this appeal presents the question of when a district court may enforce a government agency subpoena duces tecum against a financial institution in light of two statutes which protect private consumer financial information,the right to financial privacy act rfpa,et and the act glba,et.
factual and jurisdictional background 
in february,the united states department of labor dol initiated an investigation into unspecified fiduciary duty violations of the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa,involving the regional employers assurance leagues voluntary employees beneficiary association real veba.real veba is a welfare benefit trust.the individual employees,who are beneficiaries of the real veba trust,receive various benefits from the trust,including life insurance.real veba pays the premiums of each participant separate insurance policy.real veba does not,however,maintain separate accounts in each participant name.each participant in real veba has executed a limited power of attorney for real veba to act on his or her behalf.
as part of her investigation,the secretary of labor issued an administrative subpoena duces tecum to benefit services,the real veba plan administrator,and to john koresko.koresko is the sole shareholder in koresko and associates,a law firm that represents.has no employees or assets.and koresko refused to comply with the subpoena based on privilege and financial privacy rights.as a result,in april,the secretary instituted an enforcement action in the eastern district of pennsylvania.our court ultimately ordered in chao koresko,wl cir.lexis,that the subpoenas against and koresko be enforced 
community trust company ctc is trust company.it is the trustee of real veba and maintains an account in real veba name.ctc accepts deposits for policy premiums to be paid for certain benefits,such as life insurance,for specific employee beneficiaries.ctc maintains the deposits,invests them in a money market account,and remits payment of the premiums to insurance companies for individual employees policy premiums.the secretary,in december,issued a second subpoena duces tecum to ctc,directed at the real veba documents.
ctc maintains a copy of the real veba trust organizational documents,such as the trust agreement however,the vast majority of the documents covered by the ctc subpoena contain personal private financial information specific to each employee receiving benefits under the real veba trust.ctc claims that the subpoena requires it to disclose documents which are either personal financial records of real veba beneficiaries or copies of documents which the secretary has already received from the respondents in koresko therefore,ctc refused to furnish the information,arguing that it would violate financial privacy rights set forth in the rfpa and the glba.
on january,the secretary filed a petition to enforce the ctc subpoena in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.ctc filed a motion to dismiss under.b and b.ctc argued that the secretary could not enforce the subpoena because real veba is not covered by erisa and,therefore,the secretary lacked jurisdiction to issue the subpoena ctc claims that,because the scope of the investigation is beyond the secretary investigatory authority,ctc is forbidden by the glba and the rfpa from releasing the information.
the district court held that the plain language of the rfpa made its protections inapplicable to real veba and that the secretary did not need to establish jurisdiction to enforce the subpoena under the glba.accordingly,the district court entered judgment for the secretary and ordered ctc to comply with the subpoena.ctc then moved for a stay of enforcement pending appeal.the district court denied the motion,found ctc in contempt for refusing to comply with the subpoena,and fined ctc.
ctc has appealed the district court rulings that dol did not need to establish jurisdiction and that real veba is not protected by the rfpa.ctc has also appealed the district court denial of the stay of enforcement pending appeal.we consolidated the denial of stay and contempt ruling with the initial appeal.

ii.discussion 
to enforce an administrative subpoena,an agency must demonstrate that the subpoena meets certain threshold requirements.sec steel,cir en banc.those requirements are the inquiry must be within the authority of the agency,the demand for production must not be too indefinite,and the information sought must be reasonably relevant to the authorized inquiry.united states westinghouse,cir.if the government makes this preliminary showing,the burden then shifts to the respondent to prove that enforcement of the subpoena would be improper,at.
ctc objects to the district court enforcement of the subpoena on the grounds that the district court erred as a matter of law in its rulings that enforcement was not barred by the rfpa and the glba.ctc also claims that the subpoena was not issued within the authority of the department of labor to investigate.ctc finally contends that the district court erred in not deferring enforcement pending appeal.
right to financial privacy act 
the rfpa was enacted by congress to protect the customers of financial institutions from unwarranted intrusion into their records while at the same time permitting legitimate law enforcement activity.the rfpa seeks to strike a balance between the right of privacy of customers and the need for law enforcement agencies to obtain financial records as a part of legitimate investigations.id.ctc contends that because the specific requirements of the rfpa were not met,ctc has an affirmative obligation not to,directly or indirectly,produce the financial records of its customers to any government authority.for that reason,ctc asserts that the district court erred in holding that the rfpa did not bar enforcement of the subpoena.
the rfpa provides that,unless a statutory exception applies 
no government authority may have access to or obtain copies of,or the information contained in the financial records of any customer from a financial institution unless the financial records are reasonably described and 
such financial records are disclosed in response to an administrative subpoena or summons which meets the requirements of section 
emphasis added.none of the statutory exceptions to section apply in this case.rather,the question under the rfpa is whether the financial records,sought by the subpoena,are records of ctc customers.
the rfpa defines customer as 
any person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution,or for whom a financial institution is acting or has acted as a fiduciary,in relation to an account maintained in the person name.
emphasis added.the rfpa defines person,in turn,as an individual or a partnership of five or fewer individuals.
the district court held that the real veba beneficiaries are not customers of ctc because real veba does not maintain accounts at ctc in plan beneficiaries names.instead,the court determined that real veba was ctc customer,but because the rfpa protects only customers who are individuals or small partnerships,real veba does not qualify as a customer under the rfpa.therefore,the rfpa does not bar enforcement of the subpoena.
ctc urges to the contrary that the definition of customer should be read so that the final phrase in section,in relation to an account maintained in the person name,modifies only a financial institution that is acting or has acted as a fiduciary rather than modifying the whole subsection,including any person or authorized representative of that person.accordingly,ctc argues that,on the basis of its limited power of attorney,it is the authorized representative of the real veba plan beneficiaries who utilize its services.since the requirement that the account be in the person name applies only to fiduciaries,the rfpa applies here to prevent disclosure of the beneficiaries information.
because ctc does not maintain accounts in the names of the real veba beneficiaries,however,if the final phrase modifies both clauses of the authorized representative clause and the fiduciary relationship under the language of the rfpa the plan beneficiaries are not customers of ctc.
ctc presents four arguments in support of its reading of rfpa section.first,ctc argues that the canon of statutory construction known as the doctrine of last antecedent counsels in favor of limiting the phrase in relation to an account maintained in the person name to modifying the phrase immediately preceding it,not both clauses of rfpa section.the doctrine of last antecedent requires qualifying words,phrases,and clauses to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding,and are not to be construed as extending to and including others more remote.penney life ins.pilosi,cir.but this rule of the last antecedent is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning id.citing barnhart thomas,d applying the rule of last antecedent to statutes.
ctc statutory construction argument is undone by a comma.in penney,this court applied the rule to a phrase in an insurance contract that had no commas.at citing resolution trust nernberg,cir.in resolution trust,we noted that t he use of a comma to set off a modifying phrase from other clauses may indicate that the qualifying language is to be applied to all of the previous phrases and not merely the immediately preceding phrases.at citing sur.midland bank,cir lack of a comma limited application of the qualifying language to the word immediately preceding it.
in this case,there are two telltale commas.not only is the modifying phrase in relation to an account maintained in the person name set off by a comma,but the phrase to which ctc would like to limit the language,or for whom a financial institution is acting or has acted as a fiduciary,is also set off by commas.under normal rules of grammar which we assume congress followed,a phrase that is set off by commas can be excised from a sentence.thus,in this case,if we excise the second fiduciary clause of section,it would leave the modifying phrase in relation to an account maintained in the person name to qualify the initial phrase any person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution.because the ctc account is in real veba name and real veba is not a person under the rfpa,we conclude that ctc statutory construction argument does not hold water.
second,ctc argues that the rfpa definition of person in section is inapplicable because real veba is a trust,which is a.ctc argues that in the case of a trust,we should look to the underlying trust settlors and beneficiaries.in light of the beneficiaries equitable interest in the corpus of the trust,ctc argues that the beneficiaries qualify as customers whatever the title of the ctc account,the customers are the individual real veba beneficiaries and their legal representative,the plan administrator.the question of the status of a trust in relation to section is a question of first impression.a trust differs from a corporation,large partnership,llc,et cetera.looking to the equitable beneficiaries of a real parties in than to its legal owner is hardly a novel principle in trust law.here,the privacy interests at stake are not the real veba,but those of its beneficiaries.while the secretary claims that a broader reading of section would allow any large entity to argue that it is really just the representative of its constituent members,we are not convinced by this slippery slope argument.see ridgeley merchs.state bank.we believe that it is possible to draw a principled distinction between a trust and other entities.nonetheless,we decline to do so here we are not inclined to carve out a trust exception to rfpa definition of person solely on the principles of the common law of trusts.
moreover,ctc argument has no support in existing statute or caselaw.in pittsburgh national bank,we held that we are bound by the rfpa unambiguous definition of customer,cir holding that a corporation is not a person for section.ctc policy argument fails to get around the plain statutory language that makes rfpa protections applicable only to accounts maintained in the customers names.that is,rfpa requires a customer to hold both equitable and legal title.thus,even if ctc is managing funds for real veba beneficiaries,applicable to the interests of these individual beneficiaries,ctc does not maintain accounts in the beneficiaries names.accordingly,this argument also fails.
third,ctc argues that we should follow the ninth circuit ruling in donovan national bank of alaska,cir.national bank of alaska involved a scenario very similar to this case.in national bank of alaska,the secretary of labor served an administrative subpoena duces tecum on the bank to determine if there was a violation of erisa plans the bank administered.id.at.the subpoena required the bank to produce the general plan documents for all the plans it administered.id.the subpoena stated that upon receipt of the initial information,the secretary would select plans for more thorough examination,for which it requested a ll documents maintained by the bank relating to transactions or dealings with,for or on behalf of the employee benefit plans selected id.the bank was concerned that the additional information might include personal financial records of plan beneficiaries.
the ninth circuit opined that w here the department of labor requests records which disclose transactions of bank customers with the plans,its request would fall within the scope of the financial privacy act,and,absent certification,the bank may legally refuse to produce those records.id.at.the court held that the rfpa was not an obstacle to enforcement of the first part of the subpoena.id.at.the court went on,however,to comment on the second part 
as for the second part of the subpoena,absent selection of the actual plans to be investigated,neither the department of labor nor the bank has any way of knowing whether any individual privacy rights might be affected.the bank can not refuse to comply with the subpoena as a whole on the basis of its vague allegations that it might be required at some time in the future to produce records in violation of the financial privacy act.
id.at.thus,because national bank of alaska,at the stage at which it was decided,dealt only with organizational documents,not individual beneficiary accounts,it is distinguishable.
finally,ctc argues that under the district court ruling,the right to financial privacy,the right protected by the rfpa,can be circumvented by the government depending upon which entity,in the chain of entities involved in the provision of financial services,the government chooses to be subject to the subpoena.according to ctc,the government could obtain documents to which it is not otherwise entitled simply by issuing a subpoena to an entity one step removed from the entity that maintains the direct account relationship with the individual customer.it is axiomatic that the executive branch may not do indirectly what congress has forbidden it to do directly,particularly when privacy rights are involved.
nevertheless,even though we may agree that,under the rfpa,it is the real veba beneficiaries who should be protected,we can not reshape clear statutory language.moreover,the supreme court has made clear that rfpa is to be narrowly construed.see sec jerry,d.congress enacted the rfpa in response to united states miller,d,in which the supreme court held that there is no constitutional right to privacy of financial records.if congress is dissatisfied with the treatment its legislative creation gives to a trust like the real veba trust held by ctc,congress can rectify the situation.
thus,we conclude that the district court correctly found that the rfpa does not bar the enforcement of the secretary administrative subpoena.
ctc also contends that enforcement of the subpoena would violate the glba prohibition on disclosure of consumer financial information to unaffiliated third parties.glba section,entitled obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information,provides that 
a notice requirements.except as otherwise provided in this subtitle,a financial institution may not,directly or through any affiliate,disclose to a nonaffiliated third party any nonpublic personal information,unless such financial institution provides or has provided to the consumer a notice that complies with section.
in general.a financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless 
a such financial institution clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer,in writing or in electronic form or other form permitted by the regulations prescribed under section,that such information may be disclosed to such third party 
b the consumer is given the opportunity,before the time that such information is initially disclosed,to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party and 
c the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option.
the glba defines nonpublic personal information as personally identifiable financial information 
i provided by a consumer to a financial institution 
ii resulting from any transaction with the consumer or any service performed for the consumer or 
iii otherwise obtained by the financial institution.
if section applies to real veba,then ctc,as a financial institution,is prohibited from releasing any of the subpoenaed information,other than the real veba plan documents,to the secretary,a nonaffiliated third party,unless an exception applies.the threshold question is whether section applies to real veba.
is real veba a consumer under 
for section to apply to real veba,real veba must be a consumer under section.the parties disagree,however,as to whether real veba is a consumer.the district court did not address this question it ruled for dol on other grounds the secretary has,nonetheless,urged us to consider affirming the district court on this alternative basis,as we are permitted to do,storey burns int l sec,cir.
glba defines consumer as 
an individual who obtains,from a financial institution,financial products or services which are to be used primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,and also means the legal representative of such an individual.
obviously,real veba is not an individual.ctc,however,argues that real veba is still a consumer because its power of attorney from the beneficiaries makes it the legal representative of the individuals who receive benefits through the plan.the secretary contends that ctc claim to be real veba legal representative can not be maintained in the face of federal trade commission ftc regulations adopted under the glba.
glba section a provides rulemaking authority to various regulatory agencies for the particular types of financial institutions within their regulatory purview.a.section provides that financial institutions like ctc,a trust,are within the regulatory ambit of the ftc.ftc regulations provide examples of who is not a consumer under glba section 
vi an individual is not your consumer solely because he or she has designated you as trustee for a trust.
vii an individual is not your consumer solely because he or she is a beneficiary of a trust for which you are a trustee.
viii an individual is not your consumer solely because he or she is a participant or a beneficiary of an employee benefit plan that you sponsor or for which you act as a trustee or fiduciary.
the secretary argues that the ftc definitions demonstrate that real veba is not a consumer under the glba.the secretary,however,mistakenly attributes to ftc definitions the interpretative weight we would give in a dol matter to those of the dol.while we give agencies regulations deference,chevron natural res.def.council,d,it is only when agencies are enforcing their own regulations.sec y of labor excel mining,llc,we do not generally accord deference to one agency interpretation of a regulation issued and administered by another agency amerada hess pipeline,fed.energy reg.comm n.when an agency seeks to piggyback upon another agency regulation for its own enforcement purposes,such deference is because of differences in agency expertise and because of the fact that deference follows congressional delegation.id.at.
indeed,in the case of the glba,there is no reason to give ftc regulations deference in their interpretation by the secretary of labor because of the possibility of multiple,conflicting regulatory interpretations of the glba by the various agencies with overlapping rulemaking authority under glba section a.it is conceivable that two or more agencies could create reasonable,but different,interpretative regulations regarding the same statutory term.the glba itself foresaw this possibility and its language urges agencies to coordinate their regulations to the extent possible.see a.when it is possible for an agency to pick and choose between conflicting regulations,the agency should not be entitled to choose the convenient one and then receive chevron deference.the mere fact that there could be conflicting regulations should preclude chevron deference.
thus,in the case before us,the secretary is in the same position as a private party who might bring an action.in such a situation,federal regulations are persuasive,but no more,as to statutory interpretation.for that reason,we reject the secretary argument that real veba is not a consumer because it fails to fall within ftc regulations defining that term.
our analysis of the situation leads us to the following conclusion real veba serves as a legal representative of its beneficiaries and this role is sufficient to qualify real veba as a consumer of ctc under the glba if the plan beneficiaries are individuals who obtain services from ctc.
the secretary urges that real veba is not a consumer within section because the plan beneficiaries are not individuals who obtain services directly from ctc rather,the beneficiaries passively receive benefits from the financial passive receipt does not amount to obtaining.thus,according to the secretary,the beneficiaries are not themselves consumers,and their legal representative is not a consumer.the secretary definition of obtain is,however,dubious.
the parties both rely on a dictionary definition of obtain to come into the possession or enjoyment of something by one own effort or by request to procure or gain,as the result of purpose and effort hence,generally,to acquire,get.the oxford english dictionary,vol,at ed.under this definition,it is clear that real veba beneficiaries obtain financial services from ctc,namely the payment of insurance policy premiums and the provision of ministerial financial services.we conclude that this is sufficient to qualify real veba beneficiaries as consumers and,thus,to qualify real veba a consumer if it is the beneficiaries legal representative.
was the subpoena properly authorized 
the secretary,however,goes on to argue that,even if real veba is a consumer and entitled to the protections of glba section a,a statutory exception to section a,applies here.section e provides that a 
s hall not prohibit the disclosure of nonpublic personal information 
to comply with federal,state,or local laws,rules,and other applicable legal requirements to comply with a properly authorized civil,criminal,or regulatory investigation or subpoena or summons by federal,state,or local authorities or to respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorit
