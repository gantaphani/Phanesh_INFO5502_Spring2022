background 
greek suffers from diabetes mellitus,type i,that is inadequately controlled and thus has been labeled brittle diabetes.greek was first diagnosed with diabetes in september,and testing in march confirmed that he was suffering from diabetes mellitus,type secondary effects from this condition can include memory loss and an altered mental state due to swings in blood glucose levels,and greek suffered from both.
shahana arshad,who submitted a medical opinion in this case,began treating greek in february.arshad saw greek a number of times over the subsequent years and noted significant fluctuations in his blood glucose and other related levels.she also noted on several occasions that he had challenges in maintaining his blood glucose level during periods of activity.
greek initially saw wheeler,another physician who provided a medical opinion in this case,in july.after physical and mental examination,wheeler diagnosed greek with brittle diabetes,a term referring to type i diabetes that can be difficult to control,accompanied by frequent episodes of memory loss,forgetfulness,and hypoglycemia.
greek returned to wheeler on august,still complaining of memory problems.he related that he had been fired from his job because of theft,but that he did not remember the incident.wheeler also diagnosed greek with brittle diabetes mellitus with hypoglycemia and stated that greek was disabled due to frequent hypoglycemia with periods of confusion.
greek then returned to arshad on august.arshad commented that greek blood glucose control was suboptimal,and further noted that he was having increasing forgetfulness and a few incidents of hypoglycemia.arshad instructed greek to be on an insulin pump due to multiple episodes of hypoglycemia.
from this point forward,greek underwent a number of consultative and treatment examinations that suggested that he still suffered from cognitive impairment and increased forgetfulness.he also had unstable blood glucose levels in most of these examinations.
greek filed an application for social security disability and supplemental security income benefits on august.he alleged that his disability onset date was june.the claim was initially denied on october.greek then filed a timely request for an administrative hearing.
at the subsequent hearing,wheeler offered three opinions to the alj on greek ability to work.first,in july,she concluded that greek is disabled due to brittle diabetes.next,on august,she concluded that greek is disabled due to frequent hypoglycemia with periods of confusion.then,on august,she offered a more detailed opinion.with respect to greek ability to perform physical activities,she wrote that he is disabled due to memory loss,intermittent confusion,and diabetes.she marked on the form,for all areas requesting physical limitations.id.on the second page of the form,the doctor wrote that greek i s disabled due to brittle diabetes,memory loss,and periods of confusion.id.at.she determined that greek would have good and bad days and would likely be absent from work more than four days per month as a result of the impairments or his treatment.id.she felt that the limitations had been reasonably consistent and continuing since june.id.at.
also relevant to this appeal,a vocational expert,victor alberigi,also testified at the alj hearing.according to alberigi,greek had past relevant work experience in hardware sales and as a manager for automotive parts,dictionary of occupational titles dot.the alj asked alberigi to consider a hypothetical with an individual of the same age,education,and work experience as greek with the following residual functional capacity limited to medium exertional level as defined in the dot and limited to simple,routine,repetitive tasks.at.alberigi testified that such an individual could not perform any of the past work.in alberigi opinion,such an individual could,however,perform the jobs of janitor,light cleaner,charge account clerk,and dishwasher.the alj then posed a second hypothetical,asking alberigi to assume the person to be off task for at least two hours per day outside of normal lunch breaks or regular breaks.according to alberigi,this limitation would eliminate all competitive jobs in the national economy.furthermore,when asked by counsel to assume that the claimant were to miss four or more days per month,alberigi again answered that this restriction would eliminate all work.then,asked to assume that a claimant would be off task for up to two hours at unpredictable times occurring eleven times within a period,alberigi again concluded that such a person would not be able to retain a position or even a position.
in his decision dated october,the alj applied the standard sequential evaluation for determining whether a claimant is disabled the alj concluded at the fifth step that greek was not disabled because he could perform work existing in sufficient numbers in the national economy.the alj also found that greek has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work as defined in c,but that he is limited to simple,routine,and repetitive tasks.in reaching his decision as to greek residual functional capacity,the alj determined that wheeler opinion was entitled to little weight for two reasons that wheeler does not explain how the claimant memory loss and intermittent confusion would prohibit the claimant from performing any type of postural activity balancing,stooping,and that greek testimony that he could perform certain daily activities contradicted wheeler supposed conclusion that greek suffered from postural problems.id.at.the alj conclusions appeared to emerge from a misreading of wheeler questionnaire on residual functional capacity though wheeler wrote,or not applicable,next to all relevant physical activities on the questionnaire,id.at,the alj noted in his decision that wheeler concludes that the claimant can never perform any postural activities,id.at.
after the alj issued his decision,greek timely filed a request for review to the appeals council,which concluded,on july,that there was no basis for granting review and that the alj decision stood as the commissioner final decision.on august,greek filed an action in the western district of new york,seeking review of the commissioner final decision.the district court granted the commissioner motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed greek complaint in a judgment entered on august.greek timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,greek primarily argues that the alj failed to provide adequate reasons for giving little weight to the opinion of treating physician wheeler.
the claimant bears the ultimate burden of proving that he was disabled throughout the period for which benefits are sought.see a.here,greek was required to demonstrate that he was unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.
the ultimate determination of whether a person has a disability within the meaning of the act belongs to the commissioner.see snell apfel,cir d.we may set aside the commissioner decision only if it is based upon legal error or if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.burgess astrue,cir g.substantial evidence is more than a m
