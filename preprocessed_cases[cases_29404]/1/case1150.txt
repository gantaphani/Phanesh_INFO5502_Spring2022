this is an interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of viacom summary judgment motion.viacom seeks to have james ruehl complaint under the age discrimination in employment act of adea,et,dismissed for failure to timely exhaust administrative remedies before the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the district court denied summary judgment after concluding that ruehl failure to exhaust was saved by equitable tolling or,in the alternative,excused by application of the single filing rule.for the reasons that follow,we disagree with both rulings.we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of judgment in favor of viacom.
background 
ruehl had worked for viacom for years,when,in march,he was transferred from his position as director of accounting in the energy systems business unit to the tax department in late or early,ruehl attended a meeting at which his supervisors informed him that the tax department was being eliminated app.at.according to ruehl,t hey just informed me that i was part of the transition team and that my job would be eliminated on august.id.approximately seven months later,on july,ruehl received o fficial notification that his employment would be terminated,and that his last day would be august.app.at.
on his last day,ruehl signed a separation agreement,general release and promise not to sue the release,which included a waiver of the right to sue for age discrimination under the adea.ruehl testified that during the summer of,before he signed the release,he began to suspect that his age may have played a role in viacom decision to terminate him.other terminated employees shared his suspicion and,on december,two former viacom employees,norman mueller and harry bellas,filed eeoc charges,alleging that they were terminated as part of a pattern and scheme of systematic discrimination against older workers.app.at.
in august,mueller and bellas filed a collective action under the adea,in the western district of pennsylvania the action.the adea incorporates the collective action provisions of the fair labor standards act flsa,b see b incorporating b.unlike class actions governed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,in which potential class members may opt out,collective actions under the flsa require potential class members to notify the court of their desire to opt in to the action.see b no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
on march,the district court conditionally certified two of plaintiffs in the action see app.at.ruehl opted in to both subclasses on march.viacom moved for decertification of the subclasses on may,arguing,among other things,that neither group of plaintiffs was similarly situated as required for a collective action under the flsa or adea because they have disparate factual and employment settings,there are substantial conflicts among members of each subclass,and there are numerous individualized defenses to their claims.app.at.on december,the district court granted viacom motion,decertified both subclasses,and dismissed the action in its entirety.on march,the plaintiffs,including ruehl,were notified of the decertification.
nearly six months later,on october,ruehl filed his first,independent charge of age discrimination with the eeoc.about four months later,on january,he commenced this action under the adea in the western district of pennsylvania.on august,after limited discovery on whether ruehl waiver of adea claims was valid,viacom filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that ruehl eeoc charge and his district court complaint were both untimely.on november,the court denied the motion,holding that despite the facial untimeliness of ruehl eeoc charge under the adea,his claim could be saved by either the single filing rule,which would allow him to rely on the filing date of mueller timely eeoc charge,or by equitable tolling based on alleged defects in the release ruehl signed on his last day at viacom.
on march,the district court certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,finding substantial grounds for a difference of opinion exist as to both controlling issues of law,resolution of which would materially advance the termination of this litigation and three related cases involving plaintiffs.app.at.on january,we granted viacom petition for interlocutory review.this appeal followed 
ii.validity of release of adea claims 
as a threshold matter,we will consider the validity of ruehl waiver of adea claims,which forms the basis of his equitable tolling argument.we agree with the district court that the release ruehl signed violates the older workers benefit protection act owbpa.the owbpa imposes specific requirements for releases covering adea claims.in particular,f f of owbpa provides that a waiver of claims is not knowing and voluntary unless,at a minimum,i the individual is given a period of at least days within which to consider the agreement or ii if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees,the individual is given a period of at least days within which to consider the agreement.id.in the latter situation,the employer must 
inform the individual in writing in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual eligible to participate,as to 
i any class,unit,or group of individuals covered by such program,any eligibility factors for such program,and any time limits applicable to such program and 
ii the job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the program,and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected for the program.
in signing the release,ruehl affirmed that he was informed,in writing,by viacom,about 
i any class,unit or group of individuals covered by the involuntary separation program,any eligibility factors for the involuntary separation program,and any time limits applicable and ii the job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the involuntary separation program,and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected for the program.
app.at.this language,drafted by viacom,tracks the language of the owbpa.it is undisputed,however,that viacom failed to actually provide ruehl with the required information.
nonetheless,viacom argues that the release complies with the owbpa because viacom would have made the information available to ruehl had he requested it.ruehl responds that he did not request the information,but signed the waiver saying he did,because he was afraid that any request or modification of the release would delay his receipt of pension benefits.he argues that the release is invalid under the plain language of f h because that provision places the burden on the employer to ensure that waivers are knowing and voluntary.ruehl is correct.
the owbpa places the burden on employers seeking releases to inform the individual in writing of the demographic information listed in f h.viacom never provided ruehl the information,and the release does not mention ruehl right to receive it,nor does it mention that the information was available upon request or how one might obtain the information.ruehl waiver was therefore not knowing and voluntary under the owbpa.having the employee say he was informed in he was not satisfy the owbpa requirements.
our strict construction of the owbpa disclosure requirement follows the direction of the supreme court in oubre entergy operations,d 
the policy of the owbpa is to protect the rights and benefits of older workers.the owbpa implements congress policy via a strict,unqualified statutory stricture on waivers,and we are bound to take congress at its word.congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute.congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification courts can not with ease presume ratification of that which congress forbids.
the statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing and voluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods.the owbpa governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on adea claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications.
id.at.emphasis added.
consistent with oubre,several courts of appeals have required strict compliance with the owbpa disclosure requirements.see kruchowski weyerhaeuser,cir holding waiver invalid because employer defined decisional unit too broadly and terminated employees must be informed of the decisional unit at the time they consider whether to waive any adea claims.adams ameritech,cir holding that salary grade instead of job titles is too general to furnish the kind of information the statute contemplates and stating that a s a form of worker protection legislation,the owbpa demands information that allows people to ascertain whether they are being treated fairly their peers.tung texaco,cir holding release invalid where demographic information was given to employee on the day he signed the release,not days before,in accordance the owbpa.
viacom argues that if we invalidate ruehl waiver,employers will be forced to attach voluminous amounts of unwanted material to every release.this,viacom contends,would unduly burden both the employer and the employee but we are not suggesting that viacom was required to include boxes of paper with each and every waiver.we hold only that ruehl waiver was invalid because viacom neither attached the required information to the release nor adequately informed him of the relevant information,or how to get it,in any writing at all.
iii.timeliness of eeoc charge 
ruehl did not file an eeoc charge until october.that was days from the first adverse employment five years late.generally,a judicial complaint under the adea will be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies if a supporting eeoc charge was not filed within or days depending on state law of notification to the employee of the adverse employment action like title vii,adea has deferral provisions and the time for filing a charge depends on whether deferral applies.in deferral states,such as pennsylvania,the charge must be filed within days of the allegedly illegal act.seredinski clifton precision prods,cir.thus,ruehl had days from december,the day he was notified his job would be eliminated,to file an eeoc charge.see watson eastman kodak,cir a n adverse employment action occurs,and the statute of limitations therefore begins to run,at the time the employee receives notice of that action and termination is a delayed but inevitable result.
absent an applicable saving doctrine,ruehl eeoc charge was untimely,and his case must be dismissed the district court held,however,that ruehl claim was saved by the doctrine of equitable tolling or,in the alternative,the single filing rule.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that neither doctrine applies.
equitable tolling 
the district court denied summary judgment because it found there were material issues of fact about whether equitable tolling should be applied to ruehl deadline.on appeal,ruehl argues that equitable tolling is appropriate for two reasons viacom actively misled him by obtaining an invalid waiver of claims,that lulled him into believing he had given up his ability to pursue a claim of age discrimination and viacom actively misled him by failing to make required disclosures under the owbpa.see ruehl br.at.we conclude that ruehl has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances that would justify equitable tolling.
the adea timely exhaustion requirement is a prerequisite that,like a statute of limitations,is subject to equitable tolling.commc ns workers of am.of,cir hereinafter communications workers.equitable tolling stops the statute of limitations from running when an eeoc charge accrual date has already passed.oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir.
in oshiver,we explained two requirements for equitable tolling in an employment discrimination case 
the equitable tolling doctrine may excuse the plaintiff with the statutory limitations provision at issue when it appears that the defendant actively misled the plaintiff respecting the reason for the plaintiff discharge,and this deception caused the plaintiff with the limitations provision.
id.emphasis added.in addition,equitable tolling requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she could not,by the exercise of reasonable diligence,have discovered essential information bearing on his or her claim.in re mushroom transp,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also hart baker chem,cir denying equitable tolling although employee was given four reasons for her discharge,none related to her gender,her suspicions of gender discrimination were sufficient to lead a reasonable person to inquire further into the reasons for her discharge.
ruehl argues,first,that he was actively misled by the invalid release into believing he had waived all claims under the adea.the problem with this argument is that ruehl alleges a misrepresentation of law,not of fact.although ruehl may have been misled by the presentation of an invalid release,this did not cause his late filing because he,like everyone,has access to the law.see utah power light fed.ins,cir n o one can be deceived by a misrepresentation of law because everyone has access to the law.had he been diligent,ruehl would have discovered that the release was invalid in time to file a charge.see mushroom,at requiring,for equitable tolling,that plaintiff show reasonable diligence would not have revealed essential information bearing on his or her claim.indeed,ruehl had reason to suspect the release was invalid because it he he had seen demographic information,even though none had been provided.
ruehl argues,second,that there are material issues of fact about whether viacom actively misled him by failing to disclose owbpa information.he maintains that this information would have revealed age discrimination and undermined viacom explanation for his termination.but even assuming we agree with ruehl that,depending on what the disclosures reveal,a jury could infer that viacom actively misled him as part of an intentional plan to hide vital information from its employees,ruehl diligence is also in issue.see app.at.
ruehl can not benefit from equitable tolling unless he shows both that viacom actively misled him about the reason for his discharge and that this deception caused his late filing.see oshiver,at.the record in this case does not a permit a finding that ruehl met the second requirement.
specifically,ruehl admitted at his deposition that he first thought he had been subjected to age discrimination in the summer of 
i guess when i was probably the oldest person in the department that was let go,and i was the only one not offered a job with the outsourcer around summer of i guess,you know,around the time of my termination 
app.at.ruehl also admitted that in he thought there may have been age discrimination at viacom when,in his presence,viacom chief financial officer referred to an older employee as a blocker,and said that viacom needed to get him out of here.app.at.ruehl perceived this at the time to be the type of comments that were probably made about me the same way when i was in the room.id.
these facts,which would have supported ruehl cause of action,were known to him by the time he was terminated in august.he has failed to explain how viacom failure to disclose under the owbpa,however misleading,caused his failure to pursue a claim based on information he already had.ruehl has therefore failed to show the type of exceptional circumstances that warrant equitable tolling.
single filing rule 
the district court held,alternatively,that the single filing rule permits ruehl,as a former plaintiff in the decertified class,to piggyback on mueller eeoc charge,thereby dispensing with the requirement that he file a timely charge of his own the single filing or piggybacking rule is a exception to the requirement that plaintiffs exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit.communications workers,at under the single filing rule doctrine,a plaintiff who has not filed an eeoc charge within the requisite time period can join a class action without satisfying either and the original eeoc charge filed by the plaintiff who subsequently filed a class action had alleged class based discrimination in the eeoc charge.whalen grace,cir the single filing rule allows aggrieved individuals who failed to file the required eeoc charge to join a class action brought by a plaintiff who had filed an eeoc charge alleging discrimination.
limitation of the single filing rule to class and collective actions 
beginning with lusardi lechner,cir,we have limited application of the single filing rule to the collective and class action context.in lusardi,the district court decertified a collective action filed by xerox workers under the adea because the plaintiffs did not satisfy the adea similarly situated requirement.at see also b an action may be maintained by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.the court relied in part on the fact that not every class member had filed an individual eeoc charge.see id.at.on appeal,we remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration,because we agreed with amicus eeoc position that a single,representative complaint can achieve the notice and conciliation purpose of the eeoc filing,s o long as class issues are alleged.id.at accord lockhart westinghouse credit,cir 
on remand,the district court again decertified the class,implementing our holding,but still finding that the plaintiffs were not similarly situated,because 
t he members of the proposed class come from different departments,groups,organizations,units and local offices within the xerox organization.the plaintiffs performed different jobs at different geographic locations and were subject to different job actions concerning reductions in work force which occurred at various times as a result of various decisions by different supervisors made on a decentralized basis.
lusardi xerox.
then,in tolliver xerox,cir,the second circuit considered an individual action brought by a former lusardi class member who had not filed his own timely eeoc charge.tolliver extended the single filing rule beyond the class action context,to any individual action where it can fairly be said that no conciliatory purpose would be served by filing separate eeoc charges.id.at citation omitted.the court reasoned that the single filing rule can apply even where a class action would be inappropriate because the purpose of the administrative filing requirement,timely conciliation,is separate from the purposes of class certification.id.at.importantly,the plaintiff status as a former member of a decertified class was irrelevant to the holding.
we rejected the second circuit approach in whalen.at.whalen addressed whether plaintiffs who had not filed individual eeoc charges could join a adea action,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.the five plaintiffs in the original action had filed a joint complaint,but not a collective action.id.at.the prospective plaintiffs argued that the single filing rule applied,and the district court,relying on tolliver,permitted the joinder.id.at.we reversed,explaining that under lusardi,t here is no suggestion that filing a charge with allegations broad enough to support a subsequent class action lawsuit alleviates the burden of filing the class action itself,with the attendant requirement of class certification.id.at.
we further emphasized the connection between the certification process and proper application of the single filing rule in communications workers,at.in that case,a union filed an eeoc charge alleging racial discrimination by the state of new jersey.id.at.the union then filed a timely complaint,asserting associational standing,and alleging discrimination against all of the union black and hispanic members,without naming any individuals.id.about a year later,a separate chapter of the same union successfully intervened in the original action,but the district court dismissed its complaint as time barred.id.at.on appeal,the chapter argued that it could piggyback on the union timely complaint because the union had filed on behalf of all its members,and that was functionally the same as a class action.id.at.we disagreed,reasoning that acceptance of that argument would eviscerate the distinction between an action filed by an entity based on associational standing and class actions,with the attendant requirements of class certifications and the associated procedural due notice and fairness safeguards as provided by.rule.id.at emphasis added.
the focus of our early cases,lusardi and lockhart,was that in the limited context of a class or collective action,a single eeoc charge alleging discrimination satisfies the exhaustion requirement for all class plaintiffs because it achieves the eeoc goals of notice and conciliation.our later cases,whalen and communications workers,emphasized that the single filing rule is limited to plaintiffs who have undergone the class certification process,because that process ensures notice and possible conciliation of each class member claims.we have not squarely addressed whether the single filing rule applies in individual actions after decertification 
ruehl argues that because the action had been conditionally certified,ruehl subsequent individual action remains in the context of a class action and the single filing rule should therefore be available to him even after decertification.in our view,this proposed extension of the single filing rule does not follow from our precedent,and would make little sense under the facts of this case.we conclude that when a class is decertified because the plaintiffs are not similarly situated,those plaintiffs are in a qualitatively different position than plaintiffs in a certified class,and our reasons for applying the single filing lusardi,lockhart,whalen,and communications inapplicable.
application of the single filing rule after decertification 
the district court explained in its and exhaustive opinion decertifying the class,that its conditional certification under the adea had been granted because there was sufficient evidence of discrimination to proceed with notice and initial discovery.mueller cbs,at,app.at see also sperling roche,explaining that at the initial notice stage,plaintiffs need only make substantial allegations that they were collectively the victims of a single decision,policy,or plan infected by discrimination.the court remarked that at the notice stage the standard for conditional certification is comparatively liberal.app.at.
on reconsideration,however,the district court decertified the class,applying the factors set out in plummer general electric,and lusardi xerox,based on these factors,the court concluded that the class members were not similarly situated 
plaintiffs are suggesting that we continue to slice and dice a group of nearly terminated employees until we find two or three who are not hopelessly disparate in time,location,management,who have no internal conflicts regarding supervision,and who are subject to only one or two generalized defenses i decline to accept plaintiffs suggestion that i resolve their factual disparity problems for them 
mueller,at emphasis added app.at.these reasons for decertification strongly counsel against application of the single filing rule in ruehl individual action.
first,and most importantly,plaintiffs whose individual claims were hopelessly disparate in time,location,management,with internal conflicts regarding supervision,subject to only one or two generalized defenses,are not different than the individual plaintiffs in tolliver or whalen by virtue of the fact that they were once members of a conditionally certified class.see whalen,at.conditional certification of the action,as we have explained,only meant that there were allegations of discrimination.when,at the reconsideration phase,the facts of the case came to light,the court determined that the class members were not similar enough to proceed with their claims.
