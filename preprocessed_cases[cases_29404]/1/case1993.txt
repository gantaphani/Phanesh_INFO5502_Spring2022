ohio public interest research group ohio pirg seeks review of the environmental protection agency epa decision not to issue a notice of deficiency to the ohio environmental protection agency oepa in response to ohio pirg comments concerning the oepa implementation of title v of the clean air act,caa or the act.ohio pirg appeals the epa decision not to issue a notice of deficiency to the oepa and the epa interpretation of b of the caa.b.for the reasons below,we deny ohio pirg petition for review of the epa refusal to issue a notice of deficiency,and deny its challenge to the epa interpretation of b as untimely.
background 
a.the clean air act 
the central purpose of the clean air act,enacted in and amended in and,is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.states and local governments bear primary responsibility for preventing and controlling air pollution at its source.a.states carry out this responsibility through state implementation plans sips,subject to epa approval,implementing,maintaining and enforcing the national ambient air quality standards naaqs established by the epa.a,b,a.since,the act has authorized an operating permits as a title v permit enable states,with epa oversight,to better ensure that major sources of air pollution comply with sips and other requirements under the act.
b.the title v permitting program 
title v,enacted as part of the amendments,requires those who operate major stationary sources of air pollution to obtain operating permits,and establishes a procedure for federal authorization of programs.a,a,a.title v does not impose new obligations rather,it consolidates requirements into a single,comprehensive document for each source,which requires monitoring,and reporting of the source compliance with the act.see a,c a,c.sources subject to title v may not operate without,or in violation of,an operating permit.a.
the act directs the epa to promulgate regulations establishing minimum elements of a title v program.b.the epa title v regulations were finalized in and are codified at.each state is required to develop,and submit for epa approval,an operating permit program that meets the requirements of title v and part.d.after the epa approves a state title v permitting program,the act authorizes the epa to monitor whether the state is adequately administering and enforcing it.pursuant to i of the caa 
w henever the administrator makes a determination that a permitting authority is not adequately administering and enforcing a program,or portion thereof,the administrator shall provide notice to the state.
i.this notice,known as a notice of deficiency nod,must be published in the federal register.b.
if the epa determines that a state is not administering or enforcing its title v program adequately,it is authorized to sanction the state if the deficiencies are not corrected within eighteen months after the issuance of the nod.i.possible sanctions include the loss of federal highway funds and the application of strict emissions offset requirements for new sources in certain areas within the state.b.if the deficiencies are not corrected within eighteen months,the epa itself must promulgate,administer,and enforce a federal operating permit program.i b.
the epa granted final full approval to ohio title v program effective in october.fed.reg.august.ohio program is codified at chapter of the ohio administrative code and is administered by the oepa 
c.the epa consideration of public comments on ohio title v program 
in late,in connection with a settlement agreement in sierra club epa,the epa invited members of the public to submit comments identifying deficiencies in the administration of title v programs throughout the united states.fed.reg.december.the epa stated that after considering public comments,it would issue a nod for any claimed shortcoming in an operating permits program that the epa agrees constitutes a deficiency within the meaning of part.id.at.the epa also agreed to identify alleged problems that the epa did not believe to be deficiencies.
on march,pursuant to the epa notice,ohio pirg submitted comments addressing ohio title v program.the comments alleged eleven areas in which ohio pirg believed a nod was warranted,only four of which are at issue on appeal.
in response to ohio pirg comments,the epa initiated correspondence with the oepa regarding the alleged deficiencies ohio pirg had identified,and in november,sent the oepa a letter identifying issues on which the oepa would need to take action in order to avoid the issuance of a nod.the oepa responded by committing in writing to address several of the epa concerns.
on april,the epa issued a nod with regard to one of the issues identified by ohio pirg comments.fed.reg.however,in a letter dated may,as to ohio pirg other allegations,the epa informed ohio pirg that none of its remaining allegations of deficiency warranted the issuance of a nod.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the epa actions pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,see also greenpeace,waste techs,cir.under the apa we must set aside any agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.when an agency has acted pursuant to its interpretation of its governing statute,we are required to determine whether the agency interpretation is entitled to deference,and,if so,at what level.see united states mead,d chevron natural res.def.council,d.
an agency interpretation of its governing statute that contravenes congress unambiguously expressed intent is not entitled to judicial deference.chevron,at.when we are addressing the reasonableness of an agency actions pursuant to its governing statute,the arbitrary and capricious standard of the apa governs our review.see arent shalala.
b.the epa failure to issue a notice of deficiency to the oepa 
ohio pirg asserts that the epa arbitrarily and capriciously failed to issue a nod to the oepa,despite the fact that it confirmed that there were areas requiring correction in the oepa program.specifically,ohio pirg cites four areas where the epa agreed that improvement was necessary but failed to issue a nod to the oepa they are the oepa failure to abide by title v reporting requirements with respect to deviations caused by malfunctions,a iii b the oepa failure to issue all initial title v operating permits within the time period following its final approval by the epa to administer its title v program,c the oepa failure to prepare a lawful statement of basis to accompany each draft title v permit,a and the failure of the oepa to abide by title v requirement that any facility subject to its permitting requirements must apply for a permit revision before making a modification under any provision of subchapter i of the act,b.
ohio pirg contends that i unambiguously requires the epa to issue a nod whenever the epa has determined that the oepa was inadequately administering its title v requirements.section i states whenever the administrator makes a determination that a permitting authority is not adequately administering and enforcing a program,or portion thereof,in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter,the administrator shall provide notice to the state.i.ohio pirg contends that the word shall is mandatory,and not permissive,requiring the epa to issue a nod when inadequacies are found,as they have been in this case.
the epa does not dispute the deficiencies cited by ohio pirg.however,the epa contends that its recognition of such deficiencies does not constitute determinations that ohio was not adequately administering and enforcing its title v program.further,and more importantly,the epa contends that it has discretion under the caa to determine whether ohio is not adequately administering and enforcing its title v program.in other words,the epa argues that the act gives it discretion about whether to initiate its formal enforcement authority,which would be the result of the issuance of a nod.
although ohio pirg focuses its argument on the obligatory shall,the epa cont
