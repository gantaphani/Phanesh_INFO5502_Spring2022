opinion of the court 
in this petition for review from a final order of removal entered by the board of immigration appeals bia the petitioner,ayuk ako obale obale,argues that the decision of the bia was not supported by substantial evidence.she also moves for a stay of the voluntary departure period.before we consider the merits of the stay request,we must decide the threshold issue of whether we have jurisdiction to issue the stay.
obale is a native and citizen of cameroon who was admitted to the united states on or about november,on a,visa.she overstayed her visa,which expired on june.on july,the government issued a notice to appear charging obale with removability from the united states under section a b of the immigration and nationality act ina.obale admitted that she was removable as charged and sought relief in the forms of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.an immigration judge ij denied obale applications for relief but granted her a period to voluntarily depart before an order for removal to cameroon would take effect.
the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,and granted obale a voluntary departure period from the date of its order.two days before expiration of the period in which obale could voluntarily depart,she sought review in this court of the bia decision as well as a stay of removal and of the period for voluntary departure pending appellate review.this court granted obale motion for a stay of removal,but referred the motion for stay of voluntary departure to a merits panel to resolve the question of our jurisdiction to grant such a stay.
the question of our jurisdiction to stay the remaining two days of the period in which obale must voluntarily depart is one of first impression for this court as we noted in ashcroft,cir,the attorney general will grant an alien voluntary departure as an alternative to removal under certain circumstances permission for voluntary departure is significant because it allows the alien to depart the united states at his or her own expense without being subject to the penalties and restrictions that removal imposes.an alien who is removed may not reenter the united states without the attorney general permission for ten years.id.at.in contrast,an alien who is granted voluntary departure may reenter the united states once he or she has obtained proper documentation.id.the government contends that we do not have jurisdiction over obale motion to stay the period of voluntary departure because the authority to reinstate or extend the privilege of voluntary departure is solely within the discretion of the attorney general.resp t letter mem.dated,at.
no extensive citation is needed for the principle that t he jurisdiction of the courts of appeal is limited to that conferred by statute.vineland chem.united states,epa,cir.thus,our jurisdiction over obale motion,if we have it,must be conferred by the ina or other relevant statute.see union switch signal div.am.standard united,radio and mach.workers local,cir.although a statutory basis for jurisdiction is required,we have stated that case law caution s this court not to construe appellate review provisions too narrowly.williams metzler,cir alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,t he presumption of judicial review in the face of statutory silence has become a part of the fabric of the administrative procedure act.united states herman,cir garth,concurring in part and dissenting in part.to support a finding that congress intended to preclude judicial review of an administrative action,there must be clear and convincing evidence,such as that provided by the language of the statute.southern ry.seaboard allied milling,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
when reviewing agency decisions,courts of appeals have jurisdiction of the proceeding.a in the immigration context,there are numerous exceptions to this general grant of jurisdiction.the ina expressly precludes our jurisdiction to review either a denial or a grant of a request for voluntary departure.see f no court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure,nor shall any court order a stay of an alien removal pending consideration of any claim with respect to voluntary departure.see also a b i n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section.in addition,this court has held that it does not have jurisdiction to reinstate the period of voluntary departure after it has expired,at.
these statutory provisions may suggest that we have no jurisdiction to review a motion for a stay of voluntary departure,but they do not so provide explicitly.w henever congress wanted to oust the jurisdiction of the courts,it not only knew how to do it but did so in no uncertain terms.arrow trans.southern ry,d clark,dissenting see also chmakov blackman,cir.it follows that we have jurisdiction over all matters related to a particular proceeding except where congress has explicitly stated otherwise.given that congress has explicitly stated the courts of appeals may not hear appeals from grants or denials of voluntary departure,it is reasonable to conclude that if congress wished to strip this court of jurisdiction to grant stays of voluntary departure,it would have done so.inasmuch as obale petition for a stay of the period of voluntary departure is a part of the proceedings below and congress has not explicitly denied this court jurisdiction over such a motion,we conclude,in accordance with the majority of the courts of appeals that have considered the issue,see note supra,that we have jurisdiction over obale motion.
the government argues that we answered the question of our jurisdiction in,where we held that we do not have jurisdiction to reinstate the period of voluntary departure after it expires.according to the government,the fact that obale characterizes her request as a stay of the voluntary departure period,rather than a reinstatement or extension,is irrelevant 
we reject the government contention that our holding in governs this case.in,we addressed the narrow issue of whether a court may extend the period of voluntary departure after it had terminated.we noted that regulations promulgated pursuant to iirira clearly state that a uthority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director,the deputy executive associate commissioner for detention and removal,or the director of the office of juvenile affairs.at alteration in original quoting f.we concluded that under iirira,the executive branch is given the sole authority to reinstate a voluntary departure period after it has expired.
we considered the effect of in kanivets gonzales,cir,where we noted its limited holding.in kanivets,we held that the alien timely motion to reopen tolled the voluntary departure period until the bia decided the merits of the case.we stated,is distinguishable that is a different situation from that presented here where we hold that tolling applies during the period of time that the bia deliberates on a timely motion to reopen.id.at.to the extent that contains language that suggests that its analysis extends to motions for stays of voluntary departure,at,such language is dicta the language in that discusses the similarities between tolling and reinstatement is not necessary to the holding in that case.
unlike the power to extend or reinstate the voluntary departure period,the power to stay it is part of the federal courts traditional equitable powers.the power to stay is incidental to the power inherent in every court to dispose of cases so as to promote their fair and efficient adjudication.united states breyer,cir.unless otherwise provided by statute,all the inherent equitable powers of the federal courts are available for the proper and complete exercise of the courts jurisdiction.porter warner holding.see also tanimura antle,packed fresh produce,cir citation and quotation marks omitted stating that absent a clear congressional command to the contrary,federal courts retain their authority to issue injunctive relief in actions over which they have jurisdiction.we find no indication that congress intended to eliminate this court equitable jurisdiction to grant a stay of the voluntary departure period.thus,if the bia grant of voluntary departure is set forth as part of a final order within the meaning of,this court has jurisdiction to grant a stay of that period.
it is hornbook law that an administrative order to be subject to judicial review must be final.lam man chi bouchard,cir.a final order need not necessarily be the very last order in an agency proceeding,but rather,is final for purposes of judicial review when it impose s an obligation,den ies a right,or fix es some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.shea office of thrift supervision,cir alteration in original citation,internal quotation marks,and emphasis omitted.
the generally applicable requirement of finality is expressly incorporated in the ina,which provides that when reviewing immigration proceedings,courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review only final orders of removal.section b specifically provides judicial review of all questions of law and fact arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.b emphasis added 
the term order of deportation,and the point at which such an order becomes final,are defined at a that section provides 
a the term order of deportation means the order of the special inquiry officer,or other such administrative officer to whom the attorney general has delegated the responsibility for determining whether an alien is deportable,concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation.
b the order described under subparagraph a shall become final upon the earlier of 
i a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order or 
ii the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the board of immigration appeals.
a a b emphasis added.
over thirty years ago,the supreme court held that a simultaneous grant of voluntary departure did not affect the finality of an order of removal.in foti ins,d,the supreme court noted that t he granting of voluntary departure relief does not result in the alien not being subject to an outstanding final order of deportation.id.at.although the court did not provide citation or explanation for this assertion,its view was consistent with administrative regulations.section of volume of the code of federal regulations,which was originally issued in and remained in force until,provided that an order of deportation,including an alternate order of deportation coupled with an order of voluntary departure,shall become final upon dismissal of an appeal by the board of immigration appeals or,it shall be final as of the date of the board decision.courts relied on foti and for the proposition that voluntary departure did not affect the finality of a removal order.see,ins,cir the privilege of voluntary departure granted to petitioners is irrelevant to the finality and thus appealability of the bia order.citing foti,at,and.and hadera ins,citing foti,at,at,and.
in,however,the department of homeland security dhs issued administrative regulations which state that an order is not final until the period of voluntary departure has expired the current regulation governing the finality of removal orders,the voluntary departure provision of which appears to have gone wholly unaddressed by the courts since its issuance in,now reads 
an order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section of the act shall become final 
a upon dismissal of an appeal by the board of immigration appeals 
b upon waiver of appeal by the respondent 
c upon expiration of the time allotted for an appeal if the respondent does not file an appeal within that time 
d if certified to the board or attorney general,upon the date of the subsequent decision ordering removal 
e if an immigration judge orders an alien removed in the alien absence,immediately upon entry of such order or 
f if an immigration judge issues an alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure,upon overstay of the voluntary departure period except where the respondent has filed a timely appeal with the board.in such a case,the order shall become final upon an order of removal by the board or the attorney general,or upon overstay of any voluntary departure period granted or reinstated by the board or the attorney general.
section f provides that when an ij has issued an alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure,the order does not become final until the alien overstays the period for voluntary departure.but,if the alien files a timely appeal with the bia,then the order becomes final either when the bia issues an order of removal implicitly unaccompanied by a grant of voluntary departure or,if the bia reinstates or grants a period of voluntary departure,upon overstay of the bia new voluntary departure period.
because f of the regulations would be inconsistent with the statutory definition of a final order of removal if applied to determine finality for purposes of judicial review,we decline to enforce it here.as noted supra,the relevant statute,a a,provides that an order of removal means the order concluding that the alien is removable or ordering removal.such orders become final upon a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order.a b.thus,the statutory definition of an order of removal encompasses not only orders actually ordering removal,but also orders in which an ij merely determines that an alien is removable and issues a contingent order of removal.accordingly,we conclude that the ij determined that obale was removable on the date she issued her alternate order of removal and that the bia affirmance of that determination effected a final order on the date of the bia decision 
we turn now to the substantive standards for evaluating a motion to stay the running of a previously granted voluntary departure period.we concur with the courts of appeals that have held the standard for obtaining a stay of removal also applies to stays of voluntary departure see,bocova,at rife,at el himri ashcroft,cir nwakanma ashcroft,cir.
we apply the standard for granting a preliminary injunction when examining a petition for a stay of removal,douglas ashcroft,cir,and therefore also when considering a petition for a stay of voluntary departure.under the preliminary injunction standard,a petitioner requesting a stay of removal must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying petition that irreparable harm would occur if a stay is not granted that the potential harm to the moving party outweighs the harm to the opposing party if a stay is not granted and that the granting of the stay would serve the public interest.id.at.
because this court,applying this test,previously granted obale petition for a stay of removal,we will also grant the petition for a stay of voluntary departure pending our final decision on the merits of this case.see desta,at if an alien is eligible for a stay of removal,he is necessarily eligible for a stay of voluntary departure.but see bocova,at concluding that there may be cases in which an alien is entitled to a stay of removal but not a stay of voluntary departure alimi,at same.
to qualify for asylum,obale must demonstrate that she meets the statutory definition of refugee under the ina.a refugee is a ny person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a.
the threshold for establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is higher than that for establishing entitlement to asylum and requires the alien
