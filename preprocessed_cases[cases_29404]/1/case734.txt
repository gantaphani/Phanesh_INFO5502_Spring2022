shi jie ge has timely petitioned this court,pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended,for review of the july,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed an immigration judge the ij november,order denying ge applications for asylum,for withholding of removal,and for relief under the united nations convention against torture and other inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment cat.we conclude that errors committed by the bia require remand of ge applications for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
according to his form application for asylum and withholding of removal,which was filed on march,shi jie ge was born in tianjin,china,on september.ge,who remains a chinese citizen,entered the united states on a visa on may,and has never returned to china.his wife,whom he married in,and his son,who was born in,remain in china.
ge eventually came to reside in queens,new york and,on july,he was served there with a notice to appear,which charged him with being a removable alien under section a b of the ina,in that he had remained in the united states beyond the expiration of his visa.a b.in a september,hearing before the ij,ge admitted to the truth of this allegation.
in his asylum application,ge avers that he left china because of official retaliation against him after he complained of corrupt management practices at the electronics firm for which he worked as a salesman.but ge claim for asylum does not arise from these events.rather,ge claim arises from his membership in the china democracy party cdp,which,as attested to by the party chairman,ge joined,on june,after he entered the united states.on this appeal,ge declares that he joined the cdp because he was angry with the corrupt chinese government and shared the principles the party stands,human rights and justice.the record contains photographs of ge participating in cdp demonstrations at the chinese consulate in new york city,as well as articles written by ge which were posted on the organization website.we do not perceive that the government questions the genuineness of ge involvement with the cdp.
ge asserts that his work on behalf of the cdp includes the clandestine recruitment,by means of telephone,of party members within china itself.in fact,ge contends that his membership in the cdp was revealed to government authorities in china after an individual he recruited was arrested.after this individual reported ge membership,ge asserts that,on october,his wife was visited by chinese police officials,who urged her to encourage ge to return to china.in a letter to the ij,dated july,ge wife acknowledges that she first learned of ge cdp membership because of the arrest of my husband friend,although the letter did not mention any visit by government officials following the recruit arrest.in his asylum application,ge posits his fear of persecution should he be returned to china 
as i exposed my cdp membership public sic,my parents and my wife have been frequently harassed and persecuted by chin ese communist party authority.my wife and my child dared not stay in our own home and they kept moving from place to place so as to avoid the harassment from chinese police.naturally i will face chin ese communist party authority persecution if i return to china now,so i apply to the united states government for asylum.
the cdp chairman,in testimony before the ij on ge behalf,claims that cdp members whose member ships were revealed in china were all arrested.right now there are approximately cdp members still in jail in china.
in her oral decision delivered on november,the ij denied all of ge applications for relief.first,the ij found that ge application for asylum was untimely filed under the applicable deadline of one year from entry into the united states because ge did not file his application until almost four years after his arrival in this country.further,the ij rejected ge argument that he was subject to an exception to the deadline based upon his claim that his cdp membership only became known to chinese authorities in.the ij found that,beyond ge own testimony,the court has no evidence to establish that his membership in the cdp has ever been discovered by the government of china.
the ij also held that,even if ge application for asylum had been timely filed,his claim for asylum based upon the possibility of persecution should he be returned to china would fail.specifically,the ij held that although t he background material submitted by ge does indicate that dissidents from china are arrested and jailed upon their return,the court finds that the respondent has not offered sufficient evidence to establish that the respondent activities have become known to the government of china.after denying ge application for asylum,the ij proceeded to deny his applications for withholding of removal,and for relief under cat.
ge filed a timely appeal to the bia.in a july,decision,the bia denied the appeal.in re shi jie ge,july.the bia first considered the timeliness of ge asylum application 
with regard to the timeliness of the respondent application for asylum,we see no reason to disturb the ij finding that it was not filed within one year of the respondent arrival and did not fall within any exceptions to the filing deadline.specifically,the respondent entered the united states in may,but did not file his asylum application until march,more than three years after he arrived.the respondent contends that his circumstances changed when he joined the cdp.even if this membership did constitute changed circumstances,the respondent still waited nearly three years after he joined the cdp before filing his asylum application,which does not constitute filing an application within a reasonable time after a change of circumstances.
the bia also upheld the denial of relief arising from ge claim that he faced persecution should he be returned to china on the merits.specifically,the bia rejected ge reliance upon our decision in tun ins,cir 
in tun,there was evidence that the burmese government conducts extensive and surveillance on groups of burmese expatriates who are politically active against the burmese government in the united states.id.at.in contrast,while the united states department of state country report on china of which we take judicial notice provides that cdp activists sometimes are targeted for arrest or arbitrary detention,there is no indication that china tracks expatriate political activists report at.thus,we do not find that tun supports the respondent claim.we do not find that it is more likely than not that the respondent life or freedom will be threatened on account of his political activities in the united states.
the instant appeal followed.
the parties disagree as to the scope of review we should employ in considering whether the agency properly denied ge claims for relief.citing yan chen gonzales,cir,ge posits that this is a case where the bia both adopted and supplemented the ij decision and that,accordingly,we should consider the ij decision,as supplemented by the bia.we agree with the government,however,that the bia conducted its own analysis of ge claims and that the bia did not expressly adopt the ij decision.accordingly,we will review the decision of the bia alone.see mu xiang lin dep t of justice,cir.
there can be no disagreement that we review the agency legal conclusions de novo,see yi long yang gonzales,cir,and its factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,under the substantial evidence standard.b b see also shu wen sun bia,cir.
in order to be considered a refugee and therefore eligible for asylum,the ina provides that ge must show that he has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that he has a fear of persecution on such grounds should he be ordered to return to his native country.a.a fear is a subjective fear that is objectively reasonable.a fear is objectively reasonable even if there is only a slight,though discernible,chance of persecution.tambadou gonzales,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
