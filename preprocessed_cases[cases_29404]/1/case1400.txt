orlando and his wife and children the crespins,citizens of el salvador,petition for review of a final order of removal entered by the board of immigration appeals bia.crespin argues that he and his family deserve asylum because he fears persecution in el salvador on account of his family ties.an immigration judge ij accepted this argument and granted the crespins asylum application,but the bia vacated and ordered their removal.for the reasons that follow,we grant the crespins petition for review and remand to the bia.
the crespins seek asylum because of events arising from the murder of crespin cousin in el salvador.we detail those events as crespin described them in his testimony,an account that the ij found credible and that the bia did not dispute.we then outline the legal proceedings that followed.
in january of,in crespin hometown of sonsonate,el salvador,four members of the mara salvatrucha gang fatally shot crespin cousin.crespin heard the shots as he was walking towards his uncle house,and he witnessed four members fleeing the scene.after arriving at his uncle house,crespin described the four men to the police his description matched the one provided by crespin uncle,who had witnessed the murder.
two weeks later,another shooting occurred in sonsonate,and the police connected it to the murder of crespin cousin.they summoned crespin and his uncle to the police station,where crespin saw two of his cousin four attackers,whom the police had arrested,sitting on a bench inside.the two gang members watched crespin and his uncle enter a detective office,at which point crespin informed the detective that he recognized both attackers.crespin and his uncle then agreed to testify against the two men.
shortly thereafter,members began threatening crespin and his uncle.as the murder trial approached,gang members repeatedly told crespin uncle that they would kill him if he continued cooperating with the police.on one occasion,a gang member held a gun to the uncle head and pulled the trigger twice,although an apparent malfunction prevented it from firing.the prosecutor subsequently provided the uncle police protection.while he was under this protection,members threatened his wife.he nonetheless testified as the prosecution primary eyewitness,and a court convicted both defendants.the other two assailants were not apprehended.the police withdrew the uncle protection upon the trial completion,and the same day he fled the country.
similarly threatened crespin on three occasions.because he did not witness the murder,however,he received no police protection.the first threat came soon after his encounter with his cousin attackers at the police station gang members slipped a note under his door declaring that he would be next if he persisted in his cooperation with the police.upon finding the note,crespin and his family fled sonsonate for a relative home in san salvador.when crespin returned to sonsonate the next month to collect his mail,inside his house he found another note proclaiming that the gang would kill him if he went to court.finally,as crespin drove through sonsonate later that month,he encountered one of his cousin killers,who shouted that you need to shut up or we are going to kill you.
afraid,crespin planned his family escape to the united states.to that end,he left his children with an uncle in san salvador and,in may or june,traveled with his wife to the united states on tourist visas.they returned to el salvador after about two months to collect their children and make arrangements for the family relocation to the united states.on december,united states border patrol agents apprehended the crespins as they entered the united states.
at the removal hearing,the crespins conceded their removability but applied for asylum.in particular,crespin claimed that he harbored a fear of persecution because of his membership in a social group consisting of family members of those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses.crespin and his wife testified to the facts outlined above.in addition,they provided the written testimony of luz nagle,a law professor and former colombian judge,who explained that has murdered government witnesses in the past and that gang members often intimidate their enemies by attacking those enemies families.professor nagle also explained that recent government efforts to control gang violence in el salvador remain ineffective.finally,crespin submitted various news articles and governmental reports analyzing salvadoran gang violence.
after considering this evidence,the ij made several relevant findings.first,he found that the crespins proposed social group of family members of those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses qualified as a particular social group under the immigration and nationality act ina.second,the ij determined that crespin had demonstrated a sincere and objectively reasonable fear that he would suffer persecution were he to return to el salvador.third,the ij concluded that the salvadoran government attempts to control gang violence had failed.fourth,the ij found that a t least one central reason why the gang members targeted crespin was because of his uncle cooperation with the salvadoran government and that the persecution of crespin was therefore on account of his membership in a particular social group.
accordingly,on july,the ij granted crespin asylum application,as well as the derivative applications of his wife and children.the government appealed to the bia.
almost two years later,on march,the bia vacated the ij grant of asylum and ordered the crespins removal.it identified two reasons for doing so first,the bia stated that those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses does not qualify as a particular social group.second,it concluded that crespin faced no fear of persecution,reasoning that crespin suffered mere threats and harassment that failed to give rise to anything more than a generalized fear of harm.
on april,the crespins appealed to this court.four days later,they filed a motion to reconsider with the bia.the bia denied that motion on november,and in so doing,provided additional justifications for the denial of the crespins asylum application.specifically,the bia opined that crespin had not demonstrated a nexus between his asserted persecution and his proposed social group.it also concluded that,because the salvadoran government has focused law enforcement efforts on suppressing gang violence,the crespins had failed to demonstrate that the government was unable or unwilling to protect them from.accordingly,the bia reaffirmed its prior decision and denied the crespins motion to stay removal.the crespins did not petition for review of this order.
the government then moved this court to remand the crespins appeal of the original removal order to the bia so that the bia could clarify the interaction between that order and its order denying reconsideration we denied the government motion.
we first address the parties preliminary arguments.the government,echoing the assertions made in its motion to remand,urges us to remand or dismiss the crespins petition for lack of jurisdiction.in contrast,the crespins contend that we have jurisdiction to review the bia removal order,but only on the grounds set out in the original order.we reject both arguments.
the ina grants aliens the right to petition for judicial review of a final order of removal,a,which the statute defines in relevant part as a determination by the bia affirming an order concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation.a b i,a.should a petitioner also seek review of a motion to reconsider,that review shall be consolidated with the review of the order itself.b.in cases involving a removal order and a motion to reconsider,the statute thus contemplates two petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters.stone ins.
of course,only one petition for review faces us here.the government maintains that we lack jurisdiction over that petition because the removal order before us no longer represents the bia final statement on the issues.respondent br.it therefore urges us to dismiss the petition as moot,or in the alternative,to remand to the bia to clear up any jurisdictional difficulties.respondent br.
these arguments fail.the supreme court has emphasized that deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance,irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reconsider.stone,at.congress has provided for judicial review over any final removal order,whether or not the bia later supplements its reasoning in a separate order.see id.at noting that the ina reflects congress understanding that a deportation order is final,and reviewable,when issued and that such an order finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.this is particularly true because the bia denied the crespins motion to reconsider,leaving the original removal order wholly intact.see mukasey,cir,overruled on other grounds by holder,cir observing that courts have uniformly found that the denial of a motion to reconsider does not affect federal court jurisdiction over the underlying removal order.we therefore possess jurisdiction to review that removal order.
we similarly discern no reason to remand the case to the bia before considering the challenged removal order.in other cases,where we could not review the bia decision because the bia ha d given us nothing to review,we have remanded to the bia,explaining that such remands often become necessary when the issue at hand has not been addressed on all sides by the bia.li fang lin mukasey,cir.such is not the situation here rather,the bia has explained,in detail,its reasons for ordering the crespins removal.a simple remand for clarification would do little to illuminate the bia position.it would,however,further delay the ultimate resolution of the crespins asylum application,running afoul of the supreme court instruction that congress fundamental purpose in creating the ina review provisions was to abbreviate the process of judicial review.stone,at internal quotations omitted.more than twenty months have already elapsed since the bia issued its removal order we decline to delay the proceedings further by ordering a pointless remand.
the crespins,for their part,argue that we must limit our review to the reasoning articulated by the bia in the removal order itself.they point out that a reviewing court must judge the propriety of agency action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.sec chenery.according to the crespins,this principle forecloses us from assessing the rationales supplied by the bia in its subsequent order,which the crespins did not appeal.
we acknowledge,of course,that the bia order denying reconsideration is not before us.see stone,at explaining that a reconsideration motion requires a separate petition for review.we also recognize that if the bia acts on improper grounds,we are powerless to affirm by substituting what we consider to be a more adequate or proper basis.chenery,at see also ins ventura,per curiam applying chenery to asylum determinations.
that said,a court must not stretch the chenery principle so far that it becomes an idle and useless formality.nlrb.here,to turn a blind eye to the bia denial of reconsideration would constitute just such an idle and useless exercise.see de jesus melendez gonzales,cir addressing the rationale of the bia denial of reconsideration even though the denial itself was not before the panel alam gonzales,f d,cir same.indeed,limiting our review to the reasoning contained in the original removal order would undoubtedly prompt the bia,on remand,to reinstitute the order based on the very reasons it set forth in its denial of reconsideration.see id.ignoring that reasoning accomplishes nothing,because the result of a remand to the board,which is the only relief available to the crespins,is a foregone conclusion.hussain gonzales,cir.our assessment of the bia additional reasoning eliminates the need for such a wasteful remand.and because we analyze only the reasoning already articulated by the bia and thus need not guess at what the agency meant to say,nken holder,cir,our decision in no way propel s the court into the domain of the administrative agency.chenery,at.
accordingly,we turn to the merits of the removal order,taking into account the reasons for that removal laid out in both the original order and the denial of reconsideration.
the ina permits the attorney general to grant asylum to any refugee who applies.b a.to qualify as a refugee,an asylum seeker must demonstrate that he is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.
we may vacate a denial of asylum only if it is manifestly contrary to law.b c.although we accept factual findings unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,b b,we review the bia legal conclusions de novo.see marynenka holder,cir.thus,we afford not to the board decision.essohou gonzales,cir.
here,the bia articulated four reasons for vacating the ij grant of asylum,deciding that crespin alleged membership in no particular social group crespin suffered only harassment,not persecution crespin membership in the putative social group did not motivate his asserted persecution and the salvadoran government was willing and able to prevent crespin mistreatment.we consider each of these in turn.
the ina does not expressly define the term particular social group,but we have recently considered its meaning.see lizama holder,cir we there concluded that chevron deference should be accorded to the bia interpretation of particular social group as a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic,matter of acosta,bia,overruled on other grounds by matter of mogharrabi,bia.see lizama,at.this immutability test,first articulated in the bia seminal acosta case,requires that group members share a characteristic that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.at.
the crespins proposed group satisfies this test.acosta itself identifies kinship ties as paradigmatically immutable,see,and the bia has since affirmed that family bonds are innate and unchangeable.see in re,bia in re h,bia accepting clan membership as a particular social group because it was inextricably linked to family ties.accordingly,every circuit to have considered the question has held that family ties can provide a basis for asylum.see alghorbani holder,f d,cir ayele holder,cir jie lin ashcroft,cir gebremichael ins,cir.we agree the family provides a prototypical example of a particular social group.ins,cir.
the bia committed legal error by concluding to the contrary.that error flowed from the fact that,as the government concedes,the bia removal order rejected a group different from that which the crespins proposed.the bia concluded that those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses does not constitute a cognizable social group.but the crespins did not so contend.rather,they maintained,and continue to maintain,that family members of those witnesses constitute such a group.the bia later essentially admitted this error,acknowledging in its denial of crespin motion to reconsider that it does not dispute that family membership can give rise to membership in a particular social group under certain circumstances.the bia nonetheless affirmed its original order,asserting that the crespins proposed social group was insufficiently particular because anyone who testified against,as well as all of their family members,would potentially be included.again the bia inaccurately characterized the crespins proposed social group.indeed,the crespins proposed group excludes persons who merely testify against the crespins group instead encompasses only the relatives of such witnesses,testifying against,who suffer persecution on account of their family ties.the bia never explained why this group stretch
