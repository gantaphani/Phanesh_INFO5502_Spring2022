after preparing an environmental assessment ea of the proposed neches wildlife refuge in east texas,the fish wildlife service fws announced its finding of no significant impact fonsi,obviating the need to prepare an environmental impact statement eis.fws then set an acquisition boundary for the refuge and accepted a conservation easement within that boundary.these actions precluded a reservoir the city of dallas city and the texas water development board twdb had proposed for the same site.the city and twdb sued in federal district court claiming that the ea that fws prepared was flawed,that under the national environmental policy act nepa the agency was required to prepare an eis,and that the establishment of the refuge violated the tenth amendment.the district court dismissed several of the appellants claims and granted fws motion for summary judgment on others.we affirm.
background 
in,the state of texas first identified a site along the upper neches river in anderson and cherokee counties as a potential reservoir to serve the growing.worth metroplex.dubbed the fastrill reservoir,the site was again included in a state water agency resources plan in,and in the and regional water plans issued by twdb.the city and twdb plan envisioned constructing the reservoir in and tapping it in.there is nothing in the record prior to that indicates that the city or twdb took any steps to develop the site beyond including other possible reservoir regularly updated planning documents.
in,fws identified the same site as a possible wildlife refuge,since its native bottomland hardwood forest and wetlands provide an important wintering habitat for migrating waterfowl.that year,fws listed the site as for protection.fws approved a preliminary refuge proposal in and prepared a draft ea,but put the project aside for lack of funding.the project was revived in and the agency initiated public comment in june.public workshops were held in july and fws made a presentation to the regional water planning group in october of that year.another ea was prepared,which listed three alternatives no action,the recommended configuration,and a narrower configuration.the ea referenced the reservoir proposal and noted that both the larger and smaller refuge configurations would prevent the reservoir from being built.the ea was distributed to public officials and interested groups,open meetings were held in may,and it was open for public review and comment for two weeks that same month.more than comments were received,but the ea was not revised,and a final ea was not issued.on july,fws concluded that an eis was unnecessary and prepared a fonsi.
by early,the city was aware that fws had revived the refuge proposal.on march,the dallas city council passed a resolution expressing a desire to work with fws on a plan that would allow the reservoir and the refuge to coexist and authorizing a feasibility study.on august,the texas legislature designated the fastrill reservoir as a critical resource,and the january regional water plan recommended building the reservoir as part of its water management strategy.meetings were also held between the director of fws and city representatives to discuss alternative sites for the refuge,and state and fws representatives continued to communicate through the first half of about alternative plans that would allow a refuge and a reservoir to coexist.the city and twdb did not actually series of engineering and environmental studies.by june,the day fws designated an acquisition boundary for the refuge encompassing the larger site,the feasibility study was not completed nor had appellants taken any concrete steps toward planning the reservoir,such as applying for permits.accompanying the designation was a conceptual management plan outlining how land within the boundary would be acquired.the neches wildlife refuge was set to come into existence when fws,by purchase or donation,took title to or an interest in property within the acquisition boundary.on august,fws accepted a conservation easement from a landowner within the acquisition boundary.
twdb and the city filed the instant suits on january,arguing inter alia that the ea was flawed,that fws should have prepared an eis,and that the refuge violated the tenth amendment.on october,the district court dismissed five of the city claims,including the constitutional claim,and two of twdb claims,under rule b.the parties filed for partial summary judgment on the nepa claims,and on june,the district court denied the appellants motions and granted fws motion.relying heavily on sabine river auth.dep t of the interior,cir,the district court held that an eis was not required because the establishment of the acquisition boundary did not cause any change in the physical environment.the court concluded that the refuge effect on the city water supply was speculative and not within the scope of nepa.the court also found that the ea considered a reasonable range of alternatives and evaluated the necessary information.the city and twdb moved for an injunction pending appeal and for entry of final judgment,which were granted on july.the parties subsequently filed a joint motion to amend the judgment,which was granted on september.notice of appeal was filed on september,and the appeal was expedited on september.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.terrebonne parish sch.bd.mobil oil,cir.the court may only set aside an agency decision not to prepare an eis where a plaintiff establishes that the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also marsh or.natural res.council,d kleppe sierra club,d.under this highly deferential standard of review,a reviewing court has the least latitude in finding grounds for reversal.sabine river,at.courts may not use review of an agency environmental analysis as a guise for substantive decisions committed to the discretion of the agency.but i n conducting our nepa inquiry,we must make a searching and careful inquiry into the facts and review whether the decision was based on consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.marsh,at.citation omitted.

sufficiency of the environmental assessment 
nepa does not require federal agencies to favor an environmentally preferable course of action,but rather requires that they take a hard look at environmental consequences.robertson methow valley citizens council,d quoting kleppe,at.the statute requires all agencies of the federal government to include an eis in every recommendation or report on proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.an eis is not necessary when the federal action is not major or does not have a significant impact on the environment.sabine river,at.to determine whether an eis is necessary,an agency will perform an ea.sierra club espy,cir a defining an ea as a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.an ea is a rough cut,environmental impact statement designed to show whether a environmental impact is very costly and to prepare and has been the kiss of death to many a federal necessary.sabine river,at citing cronin dep of agriculture,cir.an ea will result in a finding that an eis is necessary or in a fonsi,indicating that no further study of environmental impacts is warranted.crawfish producers ass rowan,cir.
failure to consider alternatives 
an ea must discuss alternatives to the planned action,but need not discuss all proposed alternatives.see b assessment s hall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted see also.crawfish ass n,at nepa does not require that all proposed alternatives,no matter their merit,be discussed in the ea.t he range of alternatives that the agency must consider decreases as the environmental impact of the proposed action becomes less and less substantial.sierra club,at see also highway j citizens group mineta,cir when an agency makes an informed decision that the environmental impact will be small a less extensive search for alternatives is required.the rejection of even viable and reasonable alternatives,after an appropriate evaluation,is not arbitrary and capricious.see.river basin alliance westphal,cir.
the ea in this case noted that the area under consideration was identified in a preliminary study by the texas water plan as an area with the potential for development as a reservoir it also noted that the city was considering a feasibility study of the reservoir.it analyzed the effects of three different alternatives no action,a larger refuge,and a smaller refuge along multiple lines such as climate and air quality,water resources,vegetation,land use,and cultural resources.in each instance,the ea acknowledged and attempted to analyze the effect the alternative would have on the reservoir proposal.the ea also analyzed the cumulative impact of the refuge in conjunction with other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions,including the reservoir.
appellants argue that fws was required to consider an alternative that would allow the refuge and the reservoir to coexist.in the ea,however,fws noted that it was unable to evaluate fully any such dual proposal,since plans for the reservoir were speculative in the,not definitive in scope or purpose,and far beyond the planning horizon for the refuge proposal,years.additionally,after several weeks of consultation between staff at fws,the city,and twdb,a twdb biologist admitted to the director of twdb that an alternative site that is equal to or bigger better than the north neches site has not yet been identified.the director echoed this assessment in a letter to fws.only after the closure of the public comment period and the drafting of the fonsi did fws receive a proposal for alternative refuge sites.the alternatives included four other sites that appellants claimed were of greater environmental value,since there was more bottomland hardwood extant at these sites.each of these alternatives,however,envisioned building the fastrill reservoir and the resulting inundation of the upper neches area,with destruction of vegetation in that region.the record reveals no alternative that allowed construction of the reservoir and served fws goal of preserving the bottomlands and wetlands of the upper neches.under the circumstances,and especially given that fws concluded that the project had no significant environmental impact,see sierra club,at,this range of alternatives was reasonable.
failure to consider impacts 
an ea must analyze both the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action that are reasonably foreseeable,c ii a b,which we have defined as effects that are sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take them into account in reaching a decision.city of shoreacres waterworth,cir.reasonable foreseeability does not include highly speculative harms that distort the decisionmaking process by emphasizing consequences beyond those of greatest concern to the public and of greatest relevance to the agency decision.robertson,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a but for causal relationship is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under nepa and the relevant regulations.rather,a plaintiff mounting a nepa challenge must establish that an alleged effect will ensue as a proximate cause,in the sense meant by tort law,of the proposed agency action.city of shoreacres,at.
appellants argue that fws was required to analyze the effect of establishing the refuge on the city water supply and urban planning process,given projected population growth.the cases cited by appellants are inapposite,however,since they concern the effect of federal actions on existing water sources,not proposed water sources.see sierra club marsh,cir effect of port development runoff city of davis coleman,cir effect of industrial development runoff california dep t of,d effect of airport construction simmans grant.effect of eliminating water source.plaintiffs do not cite to any authority for the proposition that an agency must account for the effects on a municipal water supply of precluding a proposed but water source.
further,the effects of establishing the refuge,and thus precluding the reservoir,are highly speculative and can not be shown to be the proximate cause of future water shortages in dallas.the city and twdb never committed to constructing the reservoir and may never have done so,or may have constructed a reservoir at another site.besides including it in periodically updated planning documents,the city and twdb have never taken any concrete steps toward constructing the reservoir,such as seeking permits,acquiring property,or commencing any of the hydrological,fiscal,or environmental studies necessary to a major public works project.in fact,the city and twdb have never even settled upon the exact position of the dam or footprint of the reservoir.thus,the city and twdb have never identified the precise role the if constructed and tapped in play in supplying the region future water needs.further,the city argues that water shortages in the region will begin as early as,yet the reservoir would not be tapped earlier than.given the uncertainty over whether the reservoir will be constructed and its impact on water supplies,and the long time frame for the project,the effects of establishing the refuge on water supplies are not concrete enough,nor closely enough related to the federal action,to require that they be included in the ea.
reliance on old data 
appellants argue that fws relied upon old data in its ea.properly analyzing the risks of an action requires an agency to use updated information or data reliance on or incomplete information may render the analysis of effects speculative and uncertain,warranting the preparation of an eis.see wildlands ctr.forest service,d.in this case much of the data in the ea was lifted from the earlier ea prepared in.the city and twdb note that there has been degradation of the site and that a significant portion of the upper neches bottomland hardwoods have been cleared.however,the city and twdb have not shown that this information was so flawed that it precluded assessment of reasonably foreseeable impacts.nor is it clear how,in this case,additional information as to environmental degradation of the upper neches would cause fws to conclude it should leave the site unprotected.in this sense,the instant case differs from those cited by appellants,where additional or updated information was needed before a reasoned decision could be made as to whether to intrude on a site.see,the lands council powell,cir additional information on animal habitat needed before timber harvest could commence idaho sporting congress thomas,cir additional information on trout habitat needed before logging could commence,overruled on different grounds,the lands council mcnair,cir wildlands,d at additional information on owl population needed before logging could commence.
undoubtedly,were a plaintiff to show that a site had become so example,by substantial clearcutting of the bottomland hardwoods such that it would not support migrating waterfowl even if a showing may well render the decision to rely on older data arbitrary within the meaning of nepa.no such showing has been made in this instance.here,the use of older data in an definition a rough cut,assessment of environmental impacts on the way to determining whether an eis is necessary,see
