in her pro se complaint,lillie middlebrooks alleges that the secretary of the united states department of health and human services hhs violated title vii of the civil rights act of,and,in refusing to hire her.on the government motion,the district court dismissed middlebrooks complaint,holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her title vii claim and that her claim also failed.we affirm in part,but because the record provides insufficient support for critical elements of the district court order,we also vacate and remand in part.
in february and march,middlebrooks,an experienced,registered nurse,applied for three nursing positions at the warren grant magnuson clinical center,a program operated by the national institutes of health nih,an agency within hhs.middlebrooks sought to fill an nih nursing position as a commissioned officer of the united states public health service commissioned corps phscc.
the phscc is one of the seven uniformed services of the united states military designated under a other uniformed services include the five armed forces army,navy,air force,marine corps,and coast guard and the commissioned corps of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.id.the phscc employs approximately officers in a variety of medical health professions those officers administer programs designed to promote public health,prevent disease,and advance public health science.see dep t of health human,pub.health serv.commissioned corps,about the commissioned corps.gov aboutus last visited.
phscc commissioned officers may serve in programs administered directly by the phscc,or they may serve in a variety of programs within hhs,such as the nih,the centers for disease control and prevention,and the food and drug administration.see dep t of health human,pub.health serv.commissioned corps,agencies,last visited.alternatively,they may seek employment in certain federal agencies and programs,such as the environmental protection agency and the national park service.see id.in order to serve in any programs other than those administered directly by the phscc,an individual must apply to,and be accepted by,both the phscc and the executive agency in which he or she wishes to work.only if the phscc and the executive agency determine to hire an applicant can that applicant become a commissioned officer working within the specified executive agency.see dep t of health human,pub.health serv.commissioned corps,overview of the application process,applynow last visited.yet,when an applicant seeks to serve as a commissioned officer in an executive agency position that is not dedicated exclusively to the phscc,hiring officials within the executive agency assess the applicant qualifications in a manner identical to the way in which they assess civilian candidates for that position.in fact,the applicant may be hired to serve in the executive agency position even if the applicant is not offered,or decides to decline,a position with the phscc.
in this case,after the executive agency in question,nih,determined not to hire middlebrooks,she filed a formal employment discrimination complaint with the nih office of equal opportunity and diversity management.middlebrooks complained that nih officials discriminated against her because of her race when they failed to hire her for the first two positions to which she applied,and,after she complained of this discrimination,the officials retaliated against her by excluding her from consideration for a third position.hhs officials investigated the complaint and then issued a final decision concluding that no evidence supported middlebrooks race discrimination or retaliation claims.
having exhausted her administrative remedies,middlebrooks brought this action against the secretary of hhs.she asserts a claim under title vii,alleging discrimination on the basis of race and retaliation,as well as a claim under,alleging intentional discrimination on the basis of race.middlebrooks seeks monetary and injunctive relief for those asserted violations.
the government moved to dismiss middlebrooks complaint,contending that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.see.b.the court granted the motion,reasoning that the military exception to title vii exempted from title vii protection both phscc commissioned officers and those applying to be phscc officers.the court then rejected middlebrooks claim under,because it concluded that title vii represents the exclusive remedy for federal sector employees who wish to pursue claims of intentional discrimination in employment.
middlebrooks noted a pro se appeal.at our invitation,the appellate litigation program of the georgetown university law center filed amicus briefs on her behalf,which we very much appreciate.

title vii outlaws discrimination in employment based on race and waives sovereign immunity with respect to claims for personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment in military departments and in executive agencies a.although the supreme court has not considered the question,numerous appellate courts,including this one,have concluded that uniformed members of the armed services do not constitute employees in military departments,and so do not fall within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in see,randall united states,cir holding that congress intended in to include only civilian employees of the military departments,and not uniformed service members,within the reach of title vii.courts have also concluded that congress did not intend a waiver of immunity to encompass applicants for enlistment in the uniformed armed services and therefore have held that applicants may not bring title vii claims.see,johnson alexander,cir.
for several years,the federal appellate courts differed as to whether the a waiver encompassed the phscc,or whether,like the armed forces,the phscc fell outside of the waiver intended scope.compare salazar heckler,cir concluding that a did not extend the protections of title vii to commissioned officers,or to applicants for commissioned officer positions,in the public health service,with milbert koop,holding that the military exception to title vii does not apply to a commissioned officer of the phs.
congress responded to this debate by enacting the health professions education partnerships act of,which added subsection f to,a,stat,codified at f.that provision states,in pertinent part,that a ctive service of commissioned officers of the phscc shall be deemed to be active military service in the armed forces of the united states for purposes of all laws related to discrimination on the basis of race,color,sex,ethnicity,age,religion,and disability.id.emphasis added.in,interpreting this legislation,we concluded that congress intended to bar claims under the laws for all phscc officers in active service,not merely those engaged in active military service.hedin thompson,cir.
together,f,randall,and hedin make clear that title vii claims by commissioned officers of the phscc are not cognizable,because those individuals are deemed uniformed officers of the military for purposes of laws,and in a congress did not waive sovereign immunity for uniformed officers of the military.in the case at hand,the government maintains,and the district court held,that congress has similarly not waived sovereign immunity with respect to title vii claims by phscc applicants,and,for this reason,middlebrooks has no cognizable title vii claim.we are the first appellate court to consider this question.
the government initially contends that the plain language of the statutes at issue supports its view that title vii remedies are not available to phscc applicants.the government argues that because a addresses both employees and applicants to military departments,f must be read to apply to both phscc employees and applicants,as well.if the government reading of f is correct,then,like phscc officers,applicants to the phscc would be beyond the scope of a.see randall,at johnson,at.
the statutory language simply does not support the government argument.while a addresses both employees and applicants for employment in military departments and makes no distinction between these two groups of individuals,f does not mention phscc applicants.rather,as we noted in hedin,at,f clearly governs only phscc commissioned officers in a ctive service.no plain language transforms mere applicants to the phscc into commissioned officers of the phscc.and given that phscc applicants have not yet received commissions,they certainly have not engaged in a ctive service in the phscc.
thus,we conclude that,contrary to the government assertion,the plain language of the statutes at issue here does not mandate the conclusion that phscc applicants are barred from bringing title vii claims.we take congress at its word and assume,as we must,that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says.ayes dep t of veterans affairs,cir.accordingly,we refuse to venture beyond the confines of the statutory language,to hold that this language bars phscc applicants from asserting title vii claims.rather,we conclude that the statute silence on this issue means that f does not encompass phscc applicants.
because f does not bar title vii claims by phscc applicants,we must return to the question that divided the circuits prior to the passage of f whether the phscc is included within the scope of the a waiver of sovereign immunity.that is,we must determine if congress intended applicants to the phscc to be treated as applicants to military departments or executive agencies,for whom it has waived sovereign immunity.a.
in randall,we noted that the term military departments includes only civilian employees of the army,navy,or air force,and excludes uniformed military personnel.at emphasis added.the phscc does not fall neatly within this dichotomy,however,as its members possess characteristics of both civilian employees and uniformed military personnel.compare salazar,at noting that phscc officers receive pay and allowances according to the same statutory scheme as members of the armed forces,that they may purchase supplies from the armed forces at the same prices,and that the grades,ranks,and titles of commissioned phscc officers are organized in a manner corresponding to those in the army,with milbert,at observing that,under,the phscc is an agency in hhs rather than a military department,that phscc officers are free to unilaterally terminate their status in the phscc,and that phscc officers are not subject to the code of military justice unless the president so declares,pursuant to.
thus,the very nature of the phscc renders it difficult to determine whether it is an executive agency covered by the a waiver,whose applicants can bring title vii claims,or a uniformed military service not covered by the a waiver,whose applicants can not bring title vii claims.moreover,although statutory definitions of the armed forces do not include the phscc,see,a,the phscc is consistently included within the slightly broader designation of uniformed services,see,a.
despite these factors that make it difficult to classify the phscc,several reasons persuade us that congress did not intend the a waiver of sovereign immunity to cover the phscc,and so applicants to the phscc can not bring title vii claims.first,although the phscc shares characteristics of both civilian and military personnel,the legislative history of a suggests that,in passing the amendment to title vii that added this provision,congress intended to reach only federal employees in the civil service and competitive service who were,at that time,under the authority of the civil service commission.see salazar,at explaining that congress sought to redress a general dissatisfaction with the civil service commission performance in implementing the national policy of equal employment opportunity see also gonzalez dep t of army,cir.the phscc is,however,explicitly excluded from the operation of the civil service laws,see,and from the competitive service,see.see salazar,at.thus,we agree with the tenth circuit that congress did not intend a to extend title vii protections to commissioned officers,or to applicants for commissioned officer positions,in the phscc.id.at emphasis added.
second,rules of statutory construction dictate that waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires.united states nordic,d internal quotations,alterations,and citations omitted see also united states white mountain apache tribe,d jurisdiction over any suit against the government requires a clear statement from the united states waiving sovereign immunity the terms of consent to be sued may not be inferred,but must be unequivocally expressed.internal quotations and citations omitted.the debate as to whether a includes the phscc indicates the absence of any clear statement waiving sovereign immunity for claims by phscc officers and applicants.see white mountain apache tribe,at.
finally,unlike the courts that initially considered the question of whether a extended to the phscc,salazar,at milbert,at,we are aided by the passage of f thus,we endeavor to construe a in light of congress intentions in enacting f.see ali fed.bureau of prisons,d reasoning that,although an amendment to the statute at issue did not govern the petitioner claim,the amendment is relevant because our construction of the statutory text must,to the extent possible,ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.although the plain language of f speaks only to active service of commissioned officers,we believe that it does evince congress general intent to align the phscc with the armed forces rather than with civilian employment for purposes of employment discrimination remedies.
for these reasons,we conclude that the waiver of sovereign immunity granted by a does not encompass the phscc.therefore,neither commissioned officers nor applicants to the phscc may bring claims under title vii.
this legal conclusion does not,however,resolve the question of whether middlebrooks may bring a cognizable title vii claim.this is so because of the nature of the unique hiring process for phscc commissioned officers,which requires formal approval by both the phscc and an executive agency.the vagaries in this hiring process create a factual question as to whether to characterize the application from which middlebrooks claims arise as one to the which case she may not pursue a title vii claim for the personnel actions at one to the which case she may pursue such a remedy against nih hiring officials,because congress has waived sovereign immunity for claims arising from personnel actions affecting applicants for employment in executive agencies.a emphasis added.
for example,the government has submitted that some executive agency assignments are designated as phscc positions under the statutory appointing authority provided by title of the united states code.according to the government,when a phscc candidate applies to a title position,that individual is exempt from the competitive process required of civilian applicants and automatically added to the list of eligible candidates for consideration.if not approved by the phscc for commissioning,the individual parallel application to the title executive agency position apparently is automatically rejected.when applicants seek to fill positions like this,their executive agency applications are better characterized as merely one element of the larger phscc hiring process,for which no title vii remedies are available.
but the government has additionally submitted that some executive agency assignments for phscc candidates are available under the very different statutory authority of title.according to the government,applicants to title positions are not exempted from the competitive process required of civilian applicants rather,executive agency officials assess their applications in the same manner that they assess all other applications.in such cases,the executive agency and the phscc applications may be sufficiently distinct and
