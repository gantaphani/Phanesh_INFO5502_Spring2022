patricia allen,dana breaux,and laura waldon the petitioners filed a sox whistleblower complaint against their employer,stewart enterprises,stewart.they claim that stewart retaliated against them for engaging in protected activity,created a hostile work environment,and then terminated them through inclusion in a rif.after a hearing on the merits,the administrative law judge alj dismissed the petitioners complaint.on appeal,the administrative review board arb affirmed the alj decision,which constituted the final order of the of the secretary of labor secretary.the petitioners filed a timely petition for review of the secretary final order with this court.because we conclude that the petitioners did not engage in protected activity,we affirm.
factual background 
allen,breaux,and waldon are former employees of stewart,a company that has been in the funeral home and cemetery business for over years.stewart is headquartered in new orleans and has four operating divisions eastern,central,southern,and western.the company also has a corporate division in new orleans,which consists of employees working at the corporate office and employees working at the shared services center ssc.much of the accounting and financial data generated by the ssc is reported to the securities and exchange commission sec.
stewart employed allen and breaux as quality assurance representatives qas.qas served as a liaison between the four operating divisions and the ssc.although allen worked for the central division and breaux for the eastern division,both employees were based in new orleans and worked together.waldon was director of administration doa for the central division.as the doa,waldon was responsible for managing funeral security plans fsp in kansas city,as well as supervising three records management centers rmcs,which were located in kansas city,dallas,and new orleans.
interest calculations 
stewart uses the computer system to calculate balances for customer accounts.in late,during an internal audit of cash receipts,stewart discovered a malfunction in its computer system for calculating interest when customers prepaid their installment contracts for services or merchandise to be provided in the future.the did not correctly calculate interest in quoting the amount the customer owed,and thus many of these payoff amounts were erroneous.the only calculated interest correctly when a customer paid the full amount on the due date.upon discovering the error,stewart immediately began working on a new computer program to calculate interest.further,to remedy the error,stewart special projects group,a division under the ssc headed by patricia beatty,performed manual amortizations on all accounts that showed credit balances with a history of on principal.
beginning in april,all three petitioners expressed concerns to their supervisors about the faulty functioning of the.as qas for the eastern and central division,allen and breaux were responsible for gathering supporting data needed to resolve certain issues involving customer refunds.allen and breaux complained that special projects,which performed the manual amortizations,was uncooperative and unresponsive in handling adjustments that allen,breaux,and waldon submitted to correct overcharged accounts.moreover,when they submitted an adjustment to special projects to correct an interest calculation problem,beatty told them that these errors would be charged to their division on the contract error reports issued monthly for each division.allen and waldon testified that these errors were linked to their overall performance records and bonuses,and they believed that they were being penalized for their protected activity of pointing out these errors.
the petitioners testified that they never thought that stewart intentionally programed the to overcharge customers.they knew that special projects was performing manual amortizations as an internal control until the computer problem was fixed.although the petitioners knew that stewart was actively working on a solution for the problem,they believed that stewart was taking too long to fix the problem and the delay was due to stewart desire to keep the problem a secret.all three petitioners were concerned that stewart might be overcharging customers who did not complain and that the refunds were incorrectly calculated.
allen and breaux met separately with beth schumacher,stewart director of internal audit.they complained to schumacher that the ssc personnel were stonewalling their efforts to accomplish their work.they also complained about the ssc failure to communicate with the qas,the untimely refunds,and the inaccurate interest calculations.breaux told schumacher that she was concerned about manual amortizations and that the rmcs should have an amortization schedule so they could do their own amortizations.
correcting the problem was listed as one of the goals in stewart strategic plan for.in june,the qas convened a quality assurance conference in dallas,at which both breaux and allen discussed the interest calculation problem,refund requests,and payoffs with field office directors.stewart sponsored the conference and paid for the attendees travel and lodging expenses.
untimely refunds 
special projects,which calculated refunds and payoffs,had a significant backlog.in the central division,special projects took four to six weeks to calculate refunds.allen,breaux,and waldon testified that they believed that delayed refunds exposed the company to litigation from customers that could thereby affect shareholders.they were particularly concerned that the delayed refunds violated missouri and texas state law requirements that refunds be issued within and days,respectively.they were afraid that this delay could lead to state sanctions,including revocation of stewart license,which would adversely affect shareholders.
pending other source pos accounts 
allen and breaux were also concerned about stewart pos system and reported their concerns to beatty and the cfos.stewart pos accounts are accounts that a third party,such as an insurance company,pays fully or partially.in situations where the customer paid his or her part of the account balance,but the third party did not pay its part,the customer would receive a statement showing a zero balance.allen and breaux believed that this pos billing system made it difficult for the company to collect the unpaid balance from the customer and would affect revenue if the other source did not pay the balance.stewart managers,however,testified that the pos billing system did not prevent the company from collecting the balance because customers with these accounts were contractually obligated to pay any amount not paid by the third party,and the company used collection agencies to collect from customers who refused to pay.
compliance 
in,the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin,which prohibits companies from recognizing sales revenue before they deliver merchandise to the customer.prior to this bulletin,stewart had recognized revenue at the time of sale.required that stewart change its accounting practice and recognize revenue at the time stewart actually delivered merchandise.
after reviewing internal accounting reports and speaking with beau royster,head of internal audit,waldon became concerned that stewart was not complying with.waldon was aware that stewart did not submit these internal accounting reports to the sec,but she was concerned that the company was overstating its gross profit.she later discovered that the company was making adjustments for compliance.
waldon discussed her concerns about compliance with mike hymel,stewart chief accounting officer,who assured her that stewart was working on making adjustments to its system for fiscal year.waldon did not ask hymel about compliance for fiscal years and.
the internal consolidated financial statements for the central division are not the statements submitted to the sec,but rather working documents for managers to compare costs from year to year.according to hymel,this internal document did not contain the adjustments.budde testified that in fiscal year,which commenced november,stewart began making adjustments to the documents it submitted to the sec.waldon does not believe the improper recording of costs was done intentionally by stewart,but she does believe that understating costs will result in an overstatement of the company gross profit,thus misleading shareholders.
workspace relocation and stonewalling by the ssc 
allen,breaux,and docampo the southern district qa,testified that the qa department work spaces were moved at least four times during their employment.in october,stewart moved the qa department work spaces from the fourth to the first floor of the ssc office building to make room for employees moving in as a result of the relocation of corporate offices to the ssc in new orleans.due to extensive construction at the ssc building,many other employees were also moved around.according to the petitioners,their new work space location was temporary,and their cubicles were not a standard size,did not have proper lighting,and were located next to a storage area.
allen,breaux,and waldon testified that after raising their concerns about stewart accounting practices,they began to experience stonewalling and resistance from the ssc,exclusion from emails and meetings,lack of notification of policy and procedural changes,and delays in receiving responses from the ssc.the petitioners argue that stewart subjected them to a hostile work environment for engaging in protected activity.
in december,after experiencing several years of declining revenue and decreasing earnings per share,stewart announced a rif.bill rowe,stewart chief operating officer,testified that he asked each division president to determine the positions within their divisions to be included in the rif,but he told them that their rif decision should not have any impact on the quality of service provided to customers.as part of the rif,stewart sought to cut jobs,which would result in a cost savings of approximately million.the company did not give the division presidents any written criteria to assist them in making their rif decisions.three division presidents testified that they focused on administrative positions that did not impact customer service,and they looked at job functions rather than the individuals in the jobs.the petitioners,in contrast,argue that stewart selected them for the rif because they had complained about the firm accounting practices.
the presidents of the eastern and central divisions decided to eliminate the qa position because it was an administrative support position that did not directly affect customers.the western division president did not eliminate the qa position because he considered it to be essential to the western division operating and training needs.the western division qa was based in california rather than new orleans and had different duties than the qas in the other divisions.allen,breaux,and docampo were among the approximately employees included in the rif.
the last day of employment for rifed employees was december.because the rif involved a restructuring of the company,stewart added new positions between november,and january,and stewart provided a job hotline so that rifed employees could inquire about the new positions.many employees applied for jobs and were rehired.allen and breaux did not use the job hotline or apply for any of the new positions in the company.since the rif was undertaken,stewart financial performance has improved.
waldon was the central division doa,and she was not on central division original rif list.as a result of the proposed restructuring,waldon understood that many of the functions that she oversaw would either be eliminated or transferred to the ssc,and many of the people that she supervised would be included in the rif.
concerned about her job security,waldon asked schumacher on october,whether she would continue to have a job at stewart.schumacher told waldon that she believed that waldon position would be eliminated in the future,but it would not be included in the initial rif because waldon skills were valued and she would be needed to assist with the transition after the rif.schumacher offered waldon a position in a training capacity in kansas city at a substantially lower pay than the qa position,but she refused to accept it.
on november,waldon told schumacher that she would resign with two weeks notice if the company did not meet the following list of demands notice of her termination date,consideration for expenses she incurred while she was residing in new orleans,and assurances that she would receive her fiscal year bonus,her bonus,and a severance plan.
after several exchanges,schumacher emailed waldon a draft separation agreement on november.on november,waldon name was added to the central division rif list.at the suggestion of waldon,schumacher made changes to the draft separation agreement and emailed the second draft to waldon on december.although waldon never signed and returned the second draft,schumacher still believed that she and waldon had reached an agreement that waldon would stay with the company through january.waldon,however,did not believe that she had reached an agreement with the company.stewart paid for the cancellation of waldon apartment lease in new orleans,paid her bonus and paid for the expenses of her one business trip to new orleans,all of which waldon had requested in her original demands.waldon worked through the january,deadline contained in the second draft separation agreement and received the benefits of the rifed employees.schumacher and crane testified that waldon would still be employed as the doa if she had not forced the issue of her separation and made her various demands.according to crane,waldon made a verbal agreement with shumacher to leave stewart voluntarily.
ii.analysis 
a.the sox whistleblower statute 
section of sox,codified at,creates a private cause of action for employees of companies who are retaliated against for engaging in certain protected activity.section a states,in relevant part 
no company may discharge,demote,suspend,threaten,harass,or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee to provide information,cause information to be provided,or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,or securities fraud,any rule or regulation of the securities and exchange commission,or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders,when the information or assistance is provided to or the investigation is conducted by c a person with supervisory authority over the employee or such other person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate,discover,or terminate misconduct 
a c.an employee must file a complaint with the secretary no later than days after the date on which the alleged violation occurred.id.b d.
the legal burdens of proof set forth in the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century air,b,govern sox whistleblower actions.b c.to prevail,an employee must prove by a preponderance of the that she engaged in protected activity the employer knew that she engaged in the protected activity she suffered an unfavorable personnel action and the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action b b iii stojicevic water,arb case,wl,at arb,welch cardinal bankshares,arb case,wl,at arb may,see reyna conagra foods,d,see also b i iv.
if the employee establishes these four elements,the employer may avoid liability if it can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that protected behavior.b b iv.this independent framework is distinct from the mcdonnell douglas framework applicable to title vii claims.see williams admin.review,cir era case see also trimmer dep t of labor,cir era case.
if the employee files a timely petition for review of the arb decision,our review is governed by the standard established in the administrative procedure act apa.see b a a.under that standard,the decision of the arb will be upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.williams,at quoting macktal dep t of labor,cir.factual findings are subject to substantial evidence review.id.at.under the substantial evidence standard,the arb decision must be upheld if,considering all the evidence,a reasonable person could have reached the same conclusion as the arb.id.at.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the arb conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
b.the petitioners did not engage in protected activity.
both the alj and the arb concluded that the petitioners did not engage in protected activity.we agree with the arb legal conclusion that an employee complaint must definitively and specifically relate to one of the six enumerated categories found in mail fraud wire fraud bank fraud securities fraud any rule or regulation of the sec or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.see platone flyi,arb case,wl,at arb,a n employee protected communications must relate definitively and specifically to the subject matter of the particular statute under which protection is afforded.internal quotation marks omitted see also harvey home depot usa,arb case,wl,at arb june,a n employee complaint must be directly related to the listed categories.
sox prohibits a company from retaliating against an employee who reports information to a supervisor regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of one of the six enumerated categories.a.we agree that an employee reasonable belief must be scrutinized under both a subjective and objective standard.see welch,wl,at see also burlington.at an objective standard is judicially administrable.it avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff unusual subjective feelings.the objective reasonableness of a belief is evaluated based on the knowledge available to a reasonable person in the same factual circumstances with the same training and experience as the aggrieved employee.see welch,wl,at see also melendez exxon chems,arb case,slip op.at arb july.importantly,an employee reasonable but mistaken belief that an employer engaged in conduct that constitutes a violation of one of the six enumerated categories is protected.see collins beazer homes usa,d,see halloum intel,arb case,wl,at arb.
the objective reasonableness standard applicable to sox whistleblower claims is similar to the objective reasonableness standard applicable to title vii retaliation claims see turner baylor richardson med,cir holding that an employee need only show that she had a reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices to satisfy the opposition requirement of a title vii retaliation claim internal quotation marks omitted.in title vii retaliation cases,the objective reasonableness of an employee belief can be decided as a matter of law in some cases.see byers dallas morning news,cir.however,the objective reasonableness of an employee belief can not be decided as a matter of law if there is a genuine issue of material fact.see long eastfield,cir.if r easonable minds could disagree on this issue,the objective reasonableness of an employee belief should not be decided as a matter of law,and the resolution of the issue is entitled to deference on appeal.see lipphardt durango steakhouse of brandon,cir see also fine ryan int l airlines,cir.
the alj in this case issued his recommended decision and order after a hearing on the merits.the alj did not resolve the objective reasonableness issue through summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact.see d rollins am.airlines,arb case,wl,at arb april,carter champion bus,arb case,wl,at arb.the alj determined that the petitioners beliefs were not objectively reasonable based on the evidence presented at the hearing.because reasonable minds could disagree on this issue,the alj factual finding regarding the objective reasonableness issue is entitled to deference under the substantial evidence standard.consequently,we find that the arb correctly reviewed the alj objective reasonableness finding under the substantial evidence standard,and we must apply the same deferential standard of review to that issue.
waldon,who is a certified public accountant cpa,argues that she reasonably believed that stewart was violating an sec rule or regulation when she expressed concerns to her supervisors that stewart was not complying with.unlike a rule promulgated by the sec pursuant to its authority,see a,an sec staff accounting bulletin does not carry with it the force of law.see ganino citizens utils,cir.was not a new accounting rule promulgated by the sec rather,the sec staff issued to guide companies in applying sec rules and gaap to revenue recognition issues.barrie,cir.to the extent that assists a company in complying with existing sec financial reporting rules,an alleged violation could fall within the fifth enumerated category found in.for instance,we have previously held that alleged violations in financial statements submitted to the sec could survive a rule b motion to dismiss a rule claim.barrie,at.however,by its own terms,applies only to revenue recognition in financial statements submitted to the sec,which are available to shareholders,not to a company internal financial documents.wl,at,see also barrie,at.
regarding the compliance problem,the arb found that substantial evidence supports the alj factual finding that waldon did not reasonably believe that stewart was violating a rule or regulation of the sec.because reasonable minds could disagree on this issue,the substantial evidence standard applies,so we may not review this issue de novo,reweigh the evidence,or substitute our own opinion for that of the alj and the arb.see payne weinberger,cir.based on the limited nature of waldon inquiry concerning the problem and her extensive accounting background,we concur with the arb holding that substantial evidence supports the alj factual finding regarding the objective reasonableness issue.
because she is a licensed cpa,the objective reasonableness of waldon belief must be evaluated from the perspective of an accounting expert waldon knew that the internal consolidated financial statements for the central division,which she alleged did not comply with,were not financial statements submitted to the sec.waldon testified that she knew these internal financial statements did not need to be compliant.considering the fact that she is an accounting expert and stewart sec statements were publicly available,waldon could have ascertained whether stewart sec statements failed to comply with and informed her supervisors of this fact,but she did not.although waldon apparently had subjective suspicions that stewart sec statements might not be compliant based on her review of stewart internal financial statement,substantial evidence supports the alj and arb factual finding that she did not sufficiently complain or raise particular concerns about whether stewart sec statements were compliant.waldon only direct complaint to her supervisors concerning compliance related to stewart internal financial statement,and substantial evidence supports the alj and arb factual finding that she did not complain about compliance for fiscal years and.we find that waldon general inquires concerning compliance in stewart internal financial documents,which she knew were not released to shareholders,do not constitute protected activity under sox see,bechtel const.sec y of labor,cir.
interest calculation,untimely refund,and pos billing problems 
allen,breaux,and waldon complained about the interest calculation,untimely refund,and pos billing problems to their supervisors.the petitioners do not allege that stewart conduct regarding these three problems constituted mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,securities fraud,or a violation of a specific sec rule or regulation.instead,the petitioners simply argue that they reasonably believed that stewart conduct v
