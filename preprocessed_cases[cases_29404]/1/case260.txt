decky fnu together with his wife and daughter as derivative beneficiaries collectively,petitioners,seek review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the denial of applications for asylum under section of the immigration and nationality act the act,for withholding of removal under section b of the act,and for withholding of removal under the convention against torture cat.decky contends that the bia erred when it determined that evidence of mistreatment experienced by petitioners in their native indonesia,considered as a whole and in the context of relevant country conditions,failed to rise to the level of persecution within the meaning of the immigration laws.after careful consideration,we find that the bia decision was supported by substantial evidence and therefore deny the petition for review.
background 
decky and his wife,irawati,are indonesian citizens of chinese ethnicity and christian faith.both were born and raised in the city of surabaya on the island of java.decky was raised catholic but has followed the protestant religion since marrying irawati,a protestant.
from elementary school through high school,decky was harassed on account of his ethnicity and faith.for example,muslim students would often taunt him,saying things like hey chinese,give me your money.decky acknowledges that he could have gone to a catholic high school where he would not have been harassed however,he chose not to do so because the catholic school was farther from his home.he also admits that he was never deeply involved in catholicism,although he attended catholic church in surabaya and jakarta for approximately years.during,decky was unable to describe the sacraments of the catholic church.
in,decky moved from his hometown of surabaya to jakarta,where he worked as a supervisor in a tool factory.on may,riots broke out across the city.while on his way to work,decky witnessed cars and stores being burned.he was stopped by a group of individuals he recognized as muslim and ordered off his motorcycle.the group of men,while chanting kill chinese,poured gasoline on his motorcycle and set it on fire.they then attacked and beat decky,although he was rescued by a passerby and taken to safety.decky face was swollen from the beating and his body was bruised,but he did not go to the hospital.after the assault,decky remained at home for several days during which he observed smoke from the riots all over the city.nonetheless,decky continued to live in jakarta for four years following this incident in order to honor a commitment he had made to complete a project at work.
in,decky married irawati.irawati was also shunned as a child due to her chinese ethnicity and faith.around the age of twelve,irawati began to experience instances of sexual harassment and abuse.on one occasion,she was taunted by indonesian boys who grabbed her breasts and called her a chinese pig.at another point,someone slapped her face when she tried to defend herself from being fondled.she experienced similar incidents of sexual harassment through high school,although she stated that,as an adult,she learned to avoid such situations.
in,decky and irawati moved back to surabaya.decky testified that,around this time,christian churches were bombed in various locations throughout indonesia,including near surabaya.however,while decky reports that he endured some insults in the form of hurtful words,neither he nor irawati suffered any physical harm following their return to surabaya.
in,the couple left for the united states with their daughter,dominique audrey.they arrived on visas,which they overstayed.decky timely filed a form asylum application within one year of his arrival,and named his wife and daughter as derivative beneficiaries.see b a a spouse or child of an alien who is granted asylum under this subsection may,if not otherwise eligible for asylum under this section,be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying,or following to join,such alien.he also filed an application for withholding of removal under section b,for withholding of removal under the cat,and for voluntary departure.
decky mother and nine brothers and sisters continue to live in indonesia,although decky maintains contact only with his mother.according to decky,his mother never feels safe and believes that the situation in indonesia is not stable.in approximately,decky reports that muslims threw rocks at his brother house.
procedural history 
the petitioners testified before the ij on june,and,on november,the ij issued an oral decision.the ij concluded that the evidence presented by petitioners failed to demonstrate that they suffered persecution while in indonesia.with respect to decky assault,the ij explained 
while decky suffered physical violence during the incident,that took place during a riot that swept across jakarta and other parts of indonesia and amounted to a general national unrest which was eventually quelled by the government.as frightening and painful and it was,it was not directed at decky in the form of persecution but was rather an eruption of the lawlessness over a large area that was eventually brought under control by the government.
the ij also determined that petitioners had not established a fear of future persecution,noting that decky large family continued to reside in indonesia but had not experienced one incident where anyone suffered injury as a result of persecution based on their religion or ethnicity.accordingly,the ij denied the petitions and ordered removal to indonesia 
the petitioners appealed to the bia,which issued a per curiam opinion on july,affirming the ij decision.the bia explained that the incidents described by petitioners,considered individually and cumulatively,do not amount to past persecution.the bia further held that the evidence presented by petitioners regarding the treatment of ethnic chinese and christians in indonesia was insufficient to show that their fear of persecution was,particularly where a large number of family members continued to live in indonesia unharmed.this appeal followed.
ii.legal framework 
standard of review 
our review of the bia legal rulings is de novo but is deferential as to findings of fact and the determination as to whether the facts support a claim of persecution.jorgji mukasey,cir see segran mukasey,cir explaining that deference is due not only to findings of fact but also to agency determinations about whether particular facts support a claim of persecution.thus,our review of the bia denial of an asylum claim is limited to determining whether the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence.attia gonzáles,cir.under this standard,we will uphold the decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.internal quotation marks omitted.reversal is warranted only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.scatambuli holder,cir quoting b b.in other words,vacatur requires that the evidence point unerringly in the opposite direction.bocova gonzáles,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
where,as here,the bia adopts the ij opinion and discusses some of the bases for the ij decision,we have authority to review both the ij and the bia opinions.piedrahita mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applicable law 
when a petitioner brings claims both for withholding of removal and asylum,w e focus on the petitioner asylum claim because a claim for withholding of removal places a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim for asylum.bocova,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,if the asylum claim fails,so too does the claim for withholding of removal.id.
in a claim for asylum,the petitioner carries the burden of proving that he qualifies as a refugee by showing either that he has suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.journal keisler,cir quoting a.to qualify as persecution,a person experience must rise above unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering.jorgji,at internal quotation marks omitted see also kho keisler,cir persecution,within the context of the immigration statutes,does not include all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust,or even unlawful or unconstitutional.internal quotation marks omitted.this threshold is not easily crossed.orelien gonzáles,cir.
further,the state must be the source of or at least acquiesce in the persecution specifically,the persecution must either be the direct result of government action or action,or there must be some showing that the persecution is due to the government unwillingness or inability to control the conduct of private actors.
if the petitioner establishes past persecution,he is entitled to a presumption that his fear of future persecution is the burden then shifts to the government to show a change in country conditions in order to rebut that presumption.see b jorgji,at.however,if the petitioner is unable to demonstrate past persecution,he may still qualify for asylum by establishing a fear of future persecution through specific proof that his fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.demonstrating objectively reasonable fear requires showing that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
iii.discussion 
past persecution 
decky argues that the bia erred when it concluded that the evidence presented by petitioners did not demonstrate past persecution.specifically,he contends that under sompotan mukasey,cir,the bia should have recognized that the assault he experienced in the riots was motivated on protected grounds and was not,as the ij concluded,a product of general national unrest.decky asserts that,with this experience properly factored into the analysis,the totality of evidence compels the conclusion that he suffered past persecution within the meaning of the immigration laws 
in sompotan,we determined that an arson committed against an ethnic chinese petitioner during the may jakarta riots was motivated on protected grounds,finding that the violence which precipitated the arson specifically targeted an ethnic chinese neighborhood.id.at.however,we denied sompotan petition for withholding of removal,concluding that the ij prior characterization of the riots as a huge,spontaneous act of violence,though incorrect,was harmless.id.at.in so doing,we emphasized the isolated nature of the arson and the absence of physical harm to the petitioners.id.at.nonetheless,in this appeal,decky invokes sompotan and contends that because he was physically harmed during the riots,the assault,together with the totality of evidence regarding his past experience in indonesia,requires a finding of past persecution.
considering the record as a whole,we find that the bia conclusion that decky failed to demonstrate past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.thus,any error by the ij in attributing the assault to general national unrest was harmless.see sompotan,at.first,we note that a petitioner experience of physical harm is relevant,but it is only one consideration.see,ruiz mukasey,cir t he presence or absence of physical harm and,indeed,the degree of harm inflicted remains a relevant factor in determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of persecution.see also sompotan,at absence of physical harm not determinative un gonzáles,cir explaining that physical harm is not a prerequisite for a finding of persecution in appropriate circumstances,threats alone may suffice.
in this case,decky suffered facial swelling and bruises on his body as a result of the assault.to minimize the degree of physical harm,the respondent points out that decky injuries did not compel him to go to the hospital for care.however,the evidence demonstrates that he was saved by a passerby,and that he was in the middle of a widespread riot against people of chinese descent.as such,the failure to go to a hospital in this situation does not support a reasonable inference that the injuries were not serious.while it would be impermissible to make the presence or absence of injury requiring medical attention into a sort of acid test for persecution,see topalli gonzáles,cir citing begzatowski ins,cir,here there is no indication that the ij gave this factor overblown significance when he concluded that decky beating did not rise to the level of persecution contemplated by the law.see id.at the bia is certainly allowed to take into account the severity,duration,and frequency of physical abuse to determine whether the abuse extends beyond unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering to rise to the level of persecution.
the critical factor driving our determination that substantial evidence supports a finding of no persecution in this case is the absence of evidence of systematic mistreatment of comparable severity to the beating he suffered in the riots.decky remained in jakarta for approximately four years following the assault,and in indonesia for another two years,without further incident.accordingly,the evidence supports the conclusion that the beating was an isolated event.sompotan,at see,bocova,at m istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution an important factor is whether the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.
as additional cumulative evidence of past persecution,decky points to the harassment and discrimination he faced while growing up,the sexual harassment and abuse experienced by irawati,and the general conditions of life for ethnic chinese and christians living in indonesia,as reflected in petitioners testimony and the documentary materials submitted.however,considering the totality of evidence before us,our cases compel the conclusion that mistreatment of the severity and duration suffered by petitioners does not rise to the level of persecution necessary to sustain a claim for asylum.see,datau mukasey,cir no persecution where indonesian of christian faith,who appeared ethnically chinese,experienced unwanted sexual advances and harassment from muslim men,members of her church were threatened with death,her church was vandalized and set on fire,and her friend was raped in riots kho,at no persecution where ethnic chinese indonesian of christian faith was discriminated against by school administration,robbed by group of muslims,and physically assaulted in the riots when a group of individuals looted his business susanto gonzáles,cir no persecution where ethnic chinese indonesian of christian faith experienced forced relocation to another city for two months during riots,her home was vandalized,church bombed,neighbor raped,she escaped an attempt by two men to sexually assault her at the age of while calling her a chinese snob,and she was mugged at knifepoint and threatened.
accordingly,while we do not wish to minimize the hardships petitioners experienced in indonesia,the evidence does not compel a finding of past persecution.therefore,we must affirm the bia determination.see b b 
b.a fear of future persecution 
because petitioners are unable to establish past persecution,we turn to whether they have demonstrated a fear of future persecution.the ij determined that petitioners had established a genuine,subjective fear of returning to indonesia therefore,we focus on the objective component of this inquiry.a petitioner satisfies this objective component by producing credible,direct,and specific evidence supporting a fear of individualized persecution in the future,guzmán ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted,or by demonstrating a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of a protected ground.b iii a.
here,the evidence in the record does not compel the conclusion that petitioners will suffer individualized persecution if they return to indonesia.we have observed that t he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien homeland
