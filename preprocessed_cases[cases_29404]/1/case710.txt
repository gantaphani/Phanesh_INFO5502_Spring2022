this case gives us occasion once again to take note of the exceptionally poor quality of representation often provided by attorneys retained by aliens as they attempt to negotiate the complexities of our immigration law.see aris mukasey,cir.here,despite the fact that the immigration judge ij specifically found that the defendant was eligible for relief from deportation in the form of a waiver of inadmissibility under former c of the immigration and naturalization act ina,c repealed,and despite the fact that the defendant counsel indicated that he would file an application for such relief,no application was ever filed.we hold today that the district court committed clear error when it found that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to contest the deportation order that was subsequently issued.because the district court determinations that the defendant did not meet the requirements of d and either were predicated on this erroneous factual conclusion or were legally erroneous,its decision can not stand on these additional findings.we further hold that ineffective assistance of counsel may be grounds to excuse the requirement of d that a defendant charged with illegal reentry who brings a collateral challenge to the prior deportation order must have exhausted administrative remedies in the immigration proceeding.
for at risk of deportation the consequences of inadequate counsel can be devastating because such incompetence undermines the fair and effective administration of justice,courts must be ever vigilant.we can not countenance the circumstance in which the failure of counsel to meet the most basic professional standards denies the alien a meaningful opportunity for judicial review.padilla kentucky,slip op.at the importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.
accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
jose ricardo cerna is a native of el salvador who moved to the united states in,at the age of ten,and became a lawful permanent resident of this country in.in may,at the age of sixteen,cerna was convicted of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance,after selling drugs on two occasions to undercover officers.he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of one to three years imprisonment.in may,at the age of eighteen,he was found with a loaded firearm and was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.he was sentenced to one and to three years imprisonment.in march,at the age of,after again selling a controlled substance to an undercover officer,he was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.he was sentenced to two to four years imprisonment.
in october,while cerna was incarcerated,the united states immigration and naturalization service ins ordered him to appear for a hearing to determine whether he was subject to deportation.on april,maria liz,of the law firm of liz botshon,entered a notice of appearance as cerna attorney.the deportation hearing was held on may,before an ij at the ulster correctional facility in napanoch,new york.cerna appeared in person,while his counsel,andrew friedman of liz botshon,participated by telephone.at the hearing,the ij found that cerna deportability had been established by clear and convincing evidence,but he also found that cerna was eligible for relief from deportation in the form of a waiver of inadmissibility under former c of the ina,c repealed cerna attorney asked for,and was granted,days to file cerna application for c relief,but he never filed the requisite documents.
sixteen days after the filing deadline,the ij issued a deportation order,dated july.the record contains a cover letter from the immigration court clerk to maria liz of liz botshon,with a cc to cerna at the mohawk correctional facility in rome,new york,that apparently accompanied this order.the clerk cover letter states,
attached is a copy of the written decision of the immigration judge.this decision is final unless an appeal is taken to the board of immigration appeals.the enclosed copies of form eoir,notice of appeal,and form eoir,notice of entry as attorney or representative,properly executed,must be filed with this office on or before.this appeal must be accompanied by proof of paid fee.
app.for jose ricardo cerna cerna app.no appeal was ever taken,nor did cerna or his counsel seek any other relief such as filing a motion to reopen.on july,a little over a year after his deportation order was issued,cerna was deported to el salvador.
by december,cerna had returned to the united states without the consent of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security.on that date,he was arrested in the bronx for criminal possession of a controlled substance,a charge to which he later pleaded guilty.he was sentenced to time served.
on july,cerna was indicted in the southern district of new york for unlawfully reentering the united states in violation of a and b.he was arrested on this charge on june.in august,cerna moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had not been lawfully deported.
a collateral challenge to a prior deportation order in an unlawful reentry case is governed by d,which provides that 
in a criminal proceeding under this section,an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
cerna conceded that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies in the prior deportation proceeding,but he argued that this failure should be excused because his lawyer failure to file an application for c relief,compounded by his failure to inform cerna that he had not filed the application,amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.he further argued that he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review because of his counsel ineffectiveness.finally,he contended that the entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair because there was both a fundamental procedural error,in the form of his counsel ineffective assistance,and resulting prejudice because,absent the error,there was a reasonable probability that he would have been granted relief under c.
in support of his motion to dismiss the indictment,cerna submitted a declaration stating,inter alia,that his family had hired the law firm of liz botshon to help him avoid deportation he had no reason to believe that friedman would not file the appropriate c papers,since he indicated at the hearing that he would do so for days before his deportation,he was in a holding facility without phone privileges and that during this period,his family attempted to contact his attorney but failed while he was incarcerated and awaiting deportation,he believed that his attorney was taking steps to prevent his deportation,and he did not believe that there was anything else that i could do or needed to do to contest my deportation i did not learn that my attorney had failed to file the c application until i was deported and i do not recall ever having received written notice of my right to appeal my deportation order.cerna app.
the district court denied cerna motion it explicitly stated that it made no finding as to whether cerna counsel had been ineffective,but it found that even assuming that cerna counsel was unacceptable,cerna had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to any administrative remedies in light of the fact that he took no action to contest his deportation during the year that elapsed between the issuance of the deportation order and his deportation.united states cerna,cr,wl,at.the district court further found that cerna was not deprived of judicial review by his counsel purported ineffectiveness because he sat on his rights in other words,because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.id.at.finally,the district court found that the entry of the deportation order against cerna was not fundamentally unfair because,again,cerna had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,and more generally because cerna multiple criminal convictions rendered it unlikely that he would have been granted relief under c.id.at.
on april,the district court held a bench trial at which the parties stipulated to the relevant facts,and cerna was convicted of illegal reentry.on february,cerna was sentenced.the probation office calculated an offense level of and a criminal history category of vi,which resulted in a guidelines range of to months.while the district court found this calculation to be correct,it ultimately concluded that a criminal history category of vi significantly overstated the seriousness of his criminal record,particularly in light of the fact that certain of cerna convictions were for conduct committed when he was a juvenile although he was convicted as an adult.accordingly,it based its sentence on a reduced criminal history category of ii,which produced a guidelines range of to months.noting that in the years since cerna last arrest he had embraced religion and consistently provided for his family,the district court stated,your case is a difficult one because you like two persons.you were one person at one time in your life and now you a different person in another part of your life.cerna app.the district court sentenced cerna principally to months imprisonment.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
before we address the primary legal issue raised by cerna on appeal,we must address the district court factual finding that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to administrative remedies as well as its findings that he failed to meet the requirements of d and.because the statute provides that all three requirements must be met before a collateral challenge is permitted,if the district court correctly determined that cerna failed to meet any one of them,his motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied.
we have previously held that the exhaustion requirement of d must be excused where an alien failure to exhaust results from an invalid waiver of the right to an administrative appeal.united states sosa,cir.however,if an alien knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to appeal an order of deportation,then his failure to exhaust administrative remedies will bar collateral attack on the order in a subsequent illegal reentry prosecution under d.united states johnson,cir.the district court found that there had been a valid waiver.cerna argues that this finding was clearly erroneous.we agree.
in general,b ecause it entails mixed questions of law and fact,we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment when an alien has brought a collateral challenge to an order of deportation under d.united states scott,cir.however,where the contested issue is a d istrict c ourt factual findings regarding whether a waiver of rights is knowing and voluntary,we apply a clear error standard.united states calderon,cir.while clear error review permits only limited reexamination of factual findings where the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,doe menefee,cir quotation marks omitted,reversal is appropriate when,although there is evidence to support the finding,on the entire evidence the court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,id.at quotation marks and alterations omitted.
a district court factual findings may be clearly erroneous where the court failed to synthesize the evidence in a manner that accounts for conflicting evidence or the gaps in a party evidentiary presentation incorrectly assessed the probative value of various pieces of evidence or failed to weigh all of the relevant evidence before making its factual findings.

here,the district court opinion does not explain how it resolved the apparent conflict between the evidence indicating that notice of his right to appeal was sent to cerna and the statements made in cerna declaration indicating that he was unaware that an adverse decision had been made or that he might otherwise have reason to doubt that his attorney was taking action on his behalf.while the district court acknowledged cerna assertions that,for example,his attorney assured him that he would file an application for relief under c,see cerna,wl,at,and that he does not recall having received written notice of his right to appeal the deportation order,id.at,it nevertheless found that the fact that one year elapsed between entry of the deportation order and cerna actual deportation compels the conclusion that cerna knowingly and intelligently waived his administrative remedies,id.at.it is possible that the district court did not credit the assertions made in cerna declaration,but the court offered no explicit statement to that effect and no explanation of why it did not find cerna to be credible.if the district court did not discredit the declaration,it failed to explain why,in the face of the statements made therein,cerna could nevertheless be found to have sat on his rights.see,ali mukasey,cir finding that absent written notification of the alien right to appeal there is insufficient evidence of a knowing and intelligent waiver.
the mere fact that a year passed between the issuance of the deportation order and cerna deportation can not,in and of itself,be the factual basis for the district court finding of valid waiver.according to cerna declaration,he believed during this period that his attorney had filed an application for c relief and was taking whatever other steps might be necessary to avert his deportation.indeed,the record shows that his attorney indicated at the deportation hearing that a c application would be filed.we decline to hold that an incarcerated alien whose lawyer has stated he would file an application for relief from deportation has an obligation to check up on the lawyer to confirm that the application has been filed or risk waiving his right to appeal.to the contrary,we have previously held that the obligation runs the other way an immigration attorney has an obligation to keep his client informed of relevant dates and decisions,and the attorney failure to do so can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
in aris mukasey,for example,an alien was incorrectly informed by a paralegal at his attorney firm that no hearing had been scheduled on the issue of his deportability.at.the alien therefore missed the hearing,and a deportation order was entered in absentia.id.he received a letter from the ins informing him that he was to be deported,but his lawyer,to whom he showed the letter,informed him that he would take care of everything.id.his lawyers subsequently moved to reopen the deportation proceedings,but this motion was denied.id.the alien lawyers,however,failed to inform him of this denial,and for nearly a decade,the alien lived under the mistaken belief that the law firm had resolved his immigration problems,until he was arrested.id.we held that the alien had received ineffective assistance of counsel and,moreover,that the bia had abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen the case without addressing the fact that the alien had relied on the paralegal incorrect information.id.at.as we noted there,
the petitioner,an immigrant with limited familiarity with american immigration law,acted reasonably when he relied on the information provided by the paralegal and concluded that he did not need to appear before the ij.one reason that aliens retain legal assistance in the first place is because they assume that an attorney will know how to comply with the procedural details that make immigration proceedings so complicated.
id.quotation marks and alteration omitted.
in sum,we find that the district court failed to synthesize the evidence in a manner that accounts for conflicting evidence or failed to weigh all of the relevant evidence before making its factual fi
