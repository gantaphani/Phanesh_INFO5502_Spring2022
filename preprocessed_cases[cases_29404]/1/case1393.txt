in,plaintiffs james brooks,donald hamlette,and samuel john,who were correctional officers for virginia department of corrections the department,initiated these civil actions in the western district of virginia,asserting retaliation claims under.their respective complaints named as defendants howard arthur,and randal plaintiffs their individual capacities.the defendants sought dismissal of the complaints,asserting primarily that the doctrine of res judicata barred the plaintiffs claims because the allegations made therein had been resolved administratively.the district court,deeming the department and the defendants to have been in privity in the relevant administrative proceedings,ruled that the doctrine of res judicata mandated dismissal of the claims.see brooks arthur,d the opinion.as explained below,because there was no privity between the department and the defendants in their individual capacities,we vacate and remand 
the three plaintiffs were employed as correctional officers at the rustburg correctional unit in rustburg,virginia the unit at the unit,plaintiffs brooks and john,both of whom were senior corrections officers,were under the direct supervision of plaintiff hamlette,a lieutenant.hamlette,in turn,was supervised by defendants arthur,the superintendant of the unit,and mitchell,a major and arthur.in april,hamlette visited the equal employment opportunity eeo office of the department and lodged a complaint,alleging that both arthur and mitchell had discriminated against him on the basis of race and religion.brooks and john were identified as witnesses who would support hamlette.
arthur became aware of hamlette eeo complaint in may.the plaintiffs allege that arthur immediately upbraided hamlette for violating the chain of command by going to the eeo office instead of coming directly to arthur.in july,the eeo office requested written responses from arthur and mitchell with respect to hamlette complaint.the eeo office also sent letters to the witnesses identified in the complaint.although the witness letters were marked confidential,they were placed in open unit mailboxes where they could be viewed by others.notably,arthur and mitchell responses were to be filed by august.
before any responses were filed,however,on august,arthur issued three group iii notices,one each to brooks,hamlette,and john,terminating their employment with the department brooks and hamlette were discharged effective september,and john was terminated effective september.the group iii notices to brooks and john alleged that they each failed to conduct inmate counts and had falsified inmate count sheets.the group iii notice against hamlette accused him of failing to properly supervise brooks and john and of failing to follow a supervisor instructions.
in september,in response to what they deemed unfounded group iii notices and pretextual terminations,the plaintiffs each filed grievances with the department of employment dispute resolution edr.the edr grievances alleged that issuance of the group iii notices against the plaintiffs was inconsistent,unfair,and harsh in light of how other behavior by correctional officers had been theretofore dealt with at the unit,and that the notices were filed in retaliation for hamlette asserting the eeo complaint and because brooks and john were willing to testify favorably on hamlette behalf 
the administrative hearings on the edr grievances were conducted before a hearing officer in january.on april,the hearing officer rendered his decision concerning the grievance of hamlette,setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law the hamlette decision.the hamlette decision found that six instances of misconduct had occurred in the early morning hours of august.
at,hamlette was at a front gate post where he was unable to observe other officers as he was required to do.
at,brooks recorded that he had made rounds when he had not.
at,john recorded that rounds were made when neither he nor brooks had done so.
at,john once again recorded that rounds were made when neither he nor brooks had done so.
hamlette failed to observe inmates working in the kitchen as he had been previously ordered to do.
at,brooks and john filled out count sheets which list the number of inmates in the facility and are typically completed every personally verifying the presence of each inmate.
the hamlette decision concluded by reducing hamlette group iii notice to a group ii notice,and reinstating hamlette to his position as a correctional officer with an award of back pay.the hamlette decision found that hamlette has not presented evidence to show similarly situated employees were treated differently from how he was treated.in disposing of the retaliation claim,the hamlette decision concluded that,although hamlette has established that he engaged in protected activity and that he suffered a materially adverse action because of his job loss,he has not established a connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.id.at.hamlette did not appeal the hamlette decision and thereafter settled his eeo complaint.
brooks and john appealed the initial edr rulings on their grievances to the circuit court of campbell county,virginia on august,the state court vacated those edr rulings and remanded for further proceedings.on october,the edr hearing officer issued two reconsideration on the brooks grievance and another on the john grievance collectively,the reconsideration decisions.the reconsideration decisions made essentially the same findings theretofore made in the hamlette decision.additionally,the group iii notices of brooks and john were reduced to group ii notices with awards of back pay.the reconsideration decisions also rejected the brooks and john allegations of having been treated differently from similarly situated employees and terminated in retaliation for their support of hamlette eeo complaint.no further administrative processes were pursued by either the plaintiffs or the department.
in september,the plaintiffs filed their separate complaints in the district consolidated and declaratory relief and damages against defendants arthur and mitchell in their individual capacities.the operative complaints recount hamlette filing of the eeo complaint and the issuance of the group iii notices of august,the day before the defendants eeo responses were due.the complaints allege that the group iii notices were issued in retaliation for hamlette filing of his eeo complaint and because brooks and john were willing to support him.additionally,the complaints allege that the defendants interfered with the grievance process itself,asserting that arthur and mitchell advised witnesses that their participation in the hearing was voluntary and threatened such witnesses with retaliation if they testified favorably to the plaintiffs.
the complaints specify two retaliation claims,plus a state law claim.first,count i a claim alleges that arthur initiated the group iii notices against the plaintiffs in response to the eeo complaint.second,count ii another claim alleges that arthur and mitchell interfered with the grievance process,by witness intimidation.finally,count iii a state law claim asserts that arthur tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs employment contracts with the department.in march,the defendants moved the district court,pursuant to rule b,to dismiss the complaints,contending,inter alia,that counts i and ii were barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.the thrust of their rule b endeavor was that defendants arthur and mitchell were in privity with the department in the grievance proceedings and that the hamlette decision and the reconsideration decisions barred the claims under the doctrine of res judicata.the plaintiffs responded that the rule of differing defendants are not in privity with themselves in their official and individual,and that there was a lack of privity between the department,on the one hand,and the defendants individually,on the other.the plaintiffs relied primarily on our decision in andrews daw,cir hereinafter daw ii,asserting that it constituted controlling precedent on the res judicata issue.
by its opinion of april,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,ruling that the claims were barred by res judicata.see brooks arthur,d first and foremost,the court rejected the plaintiffs reliance on daw ii and was instead persuaded by our unpublished decision in davani clement,app x cir hereinafter davani ii.predicated on the court conclusion that daw ii was distinguishable and that davani ii reasoning more aptly applied,the court ruled that the department and the defendants were in privity during the edr grievance proceedings.as part of its analysis,the court looked to see if the department and the defendants interests in the edr hearings and the suit were identical.see brooks,d at recognizing that under virginia law,t he touchstone of privity for purposes of res judicata is that a party interest is so identical with another that representation by one party is representation of the other legal right quoting state water control bd.smithfield foods.the court concluded that,a lthough the plaintiffs grievance proceedings were brought against the department of corrections,the interests of the department,arthur,and mitchell in the grievance proceedings and this action are effectively the same.id.at.the court further explained that 
e ach has or had a strong interest in the efficient and effective operation of the rustburg unit,and in the legitimacy and finality of disciplinary and management decisions.all of the allegations lodged against the defendants also arose out of their actions as supervisors employed by the commonwealth,which may only act through its employees or its agencies.furthermore,the department interest in defending against plaintiffs grievances was identical to the individual defendants interest in this action proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the discipline issued was warranted and not a result of the plaintiffs engaging in protected civil rights activity.
id.citation omitted the court thus dismissed the two claims counts i and ii as barred by res judicata.the court then dismissed the state law tortious interference claim count iii by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.timely notices of appeal have been filed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint on the basis of res judicata.see q intern courier smoak,cir.in assessing a rule b ruling,we accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true.see airline pilots ass awappa,llc,cir.additionally,however,we may consider facts on which the district court properly took judicial notice.see daw ii,at.w hen entertaining a motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata,a court may take judicial notice of facts from a prior judicial proceeding when the res judicata defense raises no disputed issue of fact.
in resolving this appeal,we first recognize that the edr grievance decisions may be accorded the same force as a state court judgment because the parties were given an adequate opportunity to litigate.of elliott,explaining that when a state agency acting in a judicial capacity resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,federal courts must give the agency fact finding the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the state courts internal quotation marks omitted.second,because we are considering whether to give preclusive effect to state administrative decisions,we must adhere to virginia legal principles concerning res judicata.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,the full faith and credit act,requires a federal court to give the same preclusive effect to a judgment as another court of that state would give.internal quotation marks omitted.
the governing authority on privity and res judicata issues in virginia is set forth in state water control board smithfield foods,where the supreme court of virginia recognized that,t o establish the defense of res judicata,the proponent of the doctrine must establish identity of the remedies sought,identity of the parties,and identity of the quality of the persons for or against whom the claim is made.see,citation omitted.that decision also recognized that privity should be determined on a case by case basis.id.of significance,the supreme court of virginia has emphasized that the federal and state tests governing privity issues are virtually identical,specifically invoking our daw ii decision.id.at 
the conclusion that arthur and mitchell in their individual capacities were in privity with the department in the edr proceedings would mean that the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of any claims disposed of therein.coming to such a conclusion,however,requires a transitive theory of capacities.first,it must be concluded that the department was in privity with arthur and mitchell in their official capacities.second,it must be concluded that arthur and mitchell in their official capacities were also in privity with themselves in their individual capacities.and,based on these two conclusions,the department must then be deemed to have been in privity with arthur and mitchell in their individual capacities.if these three steps can appropriately be taken,the application of res judicata would be proper and the district court should be affirmed.
by contrast,if the department was not in privity with arthur and mitchell in their individual capacities,the claims should not have been dismissed.in this regard,we assume that the department was in privity with the defendants in their official capacities,leaving the question of whether the defendants in their official capacities were in privity with themselves in their individual capacities.thus,this appeal turns on the proper application of the rule of differing capacities.the theory behind that rule rests on a legal fiction about individuals having two separate identities one identity or capacity as an official representative of either the government or a corporation and a separate identity or capacity as an individually autonomous human being.the rule of differing capacities is generally understood to mean that defendants in their official and individual capacities are not in privity with one another for the purposes of res judicata.see restatement second of judgments,a party appearing in an action in one capacity,individual or representative,is not thereby bound by or entitled to the benefits of the rules of res judicata in a subsequent action in which he appears in another capacity.
our controlling precedent concerning the rule of differing we see as consistent with virginia found in daw ii.the first daw appeal presented to us in,three years prior to daw ii involved a suit against,inter alia,north carolina highway patrolman daw in his official capacity for allegedly violating a driver constitutional rights during a traffic stop.see andrews daw,wl,at cir.july,unpublished decision hereinafter daw i.the district court had dismissed the daw i action in its entirety,awarding summary judgment to patrolman daw on the basis of qualified immunity.id.on appeal,however,we concluded in daw i that the appropriate disposition as to patrolman daw in the district court was not summary judgment,but rather dismissal under rule b.id.in so ruling we reasoned that,because daw had been sued in his official capacity only,he was shielded from monetary damages by the eleventh amendment and,thus,entitled to rule b relief.id.
soon thereafter,in the daw ii proceedings,patrolman daw was sued again under,but this time in his individual capacity.daw promptly moved to dismiss on the basis of res judicata,arguing that the second complaint was barred by his dismissal in daw see daw ii,at.the district court agreed and dismissed the second complaint on res judicata grounds.id.in daw ii,we reversed the court res judicata disposition,explaining that the rule of differing capacities means that a government official in his official capacity is not in privity with himself in his individual capacity.id.at.
our daw ii decision explained the rationale behind the rule of differing capacities in a manner that is highly pertinent here.more specifically,w
