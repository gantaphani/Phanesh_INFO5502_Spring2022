opinion of the court 
this case arises out of the unfortunate death of michael sanford,a boy who committed suicide at his home in emmaus,pennsylvania.kathleen sanford,michael mother,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment against her in an action against the east penn school district and one if its guidance counselors,pamela stiles the defendants.kathleen sanford filed suit under,alleging that the defendants are liable for her son death under a danger theory.she also alleges that pamela stiles is individually liable for negligence under state law.we will affirm the grant of summary judgment against sanford.
this case requires us to examine and clarify an unsettled area of the law the standard of fault in danger cases.as we have noted before,the relevant a state actor behavior shocks the conscience has an elusive quality to it this is in part because the level of culpability required to shock the conscience will depend upon the extent to which a state actor is required to act under pressure.in the present case,we are satisfied that kathleen sanford danger claims can not prevail because she is unable to show that stiles or the east penn school district acted with the requisite level of culpability.we also must reject sanford state law negligence claim because stiles is entitled to broad immunity under the pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act.
facts and procedural history 
the events in this case began when karen martin,a high school student,received a troubling note from classmate michael sanford karen and michael had dated for a brief period.karen was passed the note on november,after michael learned that she was dating a student named ryan.the note stated 
i know i really have talked to you in awhile.hopefully this note does come out the wrong way.i heard diff erent stories about you ryan.the one i heard almost made me want to go kill myself.mostly because if there was any chance in hell of you me solving the what if i fucked it up.anyways i heard that instead of danielle it was you online friday.if i said anything stupid,i apologize this weekend sucked i tried to make myself forget it.so how have you been how driving going remember stop signs w white lines around them are optional if you hit a pedestrian nite he wearing black its pts.for some reason,i just thought this have to ask you,is there any grudge or an imosity btwn us i.write back if you can,if not hopefully i ttyl.luv ya.ur,mike.
app.emphasis added.
karen indicated several times that,after reading michael note,she did not believe that michael would actually kill himself.still,the day after receiving the message,karen approached a school guidance counselor,barbara valladares,about the note contents.karen claimed that she was worried about michael and that she was sick of him bugging her.karen told valladares that she did think michael would hurt himself but that she just wanted to be safe.app.karen asked valladares not to reveal the source of the note.
valladares gave a copy of the note to michael guidance counselor,pamela stiles,and relayed both that karen wanted michael to stop bothering her and that karen was concerned about michael reaction to their earlier breakup.app.stiles immediately called michael into her office.she told michael that some of his friends were worried about him,and that therefore she was worried about him.stiles asked michael if he was upset about some sort of situation with a girl,and he replied that was two months ago when i was upset about that.i not upset about that now.app.according to stiles,michael responded in a very straightforward manner.app.
additionally,stiles asked michael if he ever had plans to hurt himself or if he would do such a thing.he answered definitely not.app.she asked him forward thinking questions and became satisfied that he had future plans.finally,stiles asked michael if anything else was upsetting him.according to stiles,michael stated,no,he was fine.app.
stiles later reported that michael kind of shrugged that she would even ask him these questions or if there was a problem.app.stiles was convinced that the feelings expressed in the note dated several months back.she concluded that mike did not present any signs that were of a nature that he was thinking about harming himself.app.therefore,because she believed michael was not at risk,she did not contact the school psychologist or michael mother.
according to stiles,she and michael spoke for ten to fifteen minutes during this first encounter.stiles then gave the note back to valladares and told her that she had seen michael and that he did not display any suicidal ideation to her in what he verbalized.app.also,jason pekarik,a friend of michael,later testified that michael told him that he had been called into the guidance office.according to pekarik,michael laughed about it and said that everything was fine.app.
on december,michael again visited the guidance office.stiles stated that she asked michael if he would like to come in,but that michael only asked stiles if it was a girl who gave her the note.app.stiles said that she could not share that information.she stated in her deposition that this was because of ethical practices aimed to help students feel comfortable giving information.app.stiles invited michael to talk further.however,michael only responded thanks,i thought that what you would say.that all i needed.app.according to stiles,michael did not seem upset during their interaction.app.
that evening,michael committed suicide by hanging himself.immediately before his death,michael and his mother had argued.sanford believed that the argument occurred because she told michael to take his sweatshirt off and to close the car windows.according to sanford,michael opened up the car door while it was still going and started to run home.sanford looked for michael,but when he saw the car,he took off again.app.at one point,michael again entered the car,but he only threw some of sanford cigarettes out of the car,then walked the short distance home.after they had both returned home,sanford asked michael to clean the kitchen.when sanford went down to look for him,she found that he had hanged himself from a door in the basement.
as the district court noted,no one,including sanford,karen martin,or michael uncle believed that michael was suicidal.michael uncle,david schlegel,was a licensed social worker and had worked as a therapist.schlegel testified that michael seemed before his death and that there were no signs that he would harm himself.additionally,shortly before michael death,sanford had read an instant message exchange between michael and his friend jason pekarik.the messages referenced suicidal behavior.still,after reading the messages,sanford was not concerned that michael could be suicidal.
it appears that stiles followed school protocol in making her assessment of michael.the emmaus high school counseling department guidelines handbook delineates a suicide referral process.that protocol states 
in cases of suicide ideation,the assigned counselor will assess the situation no matter what the referral source sap,teacher,parent,and.the counselor will determine if and when a referral should be made to the school psychologist.
app.a flow chart provides further information.
sanford filed this action against stiles and the east penn school district in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.she alleged that the defendants were liable for michael death under a danger theory for constitutional violations pursuant to.she also alleged that stiles was individually liable for negligence under state law.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted 
the district court determined that the substantive due process claims brought against both defendants failed.specifically,a reasonable jury could not conclude that stiles create d the danger to michael or that her conduct exceeded mere negligence.the district court also rejected sanford claim of municipal liability against the east penn school district because sanford failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether stiles caused an underlying constitutional violation.finally,the district court rejected the state law negligence claim against stiles both because sanford could not prove causation under tort law and because stiles was entitled to immunity under pennsylvania law.
ii.substantive due process sanford danger claim against stiles 
sanford alleges that stiles is liable under a danger theory because her actions increased the risk that michael would commit suicide.appellant br.at.generally,the due process clause does not impose an affirmative duty upon the state to protect citizens from the acts of private individuals.see deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.however,we have explicitly recognized two exceptions to this general rule.first,the state has a duty to protect or care for individuals when a special relationship exists second,the state has a duty when a danger is involved.see morse lower merion sch,cir.sanford federal claims are based on this second exception.
in kneipp tedder,cir,we first adopted the danger theory as a mechanism by which plaintiffs may establish constitutional violations under.we confirmed that liability may attach where the state acts to create or enhance a danger that deprives the plaintiff of his or her fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process.id.at see also brown.dep t of health emergency med.servs.training,cir.the danger theory is now widely recognized.although the supreme court has not yet explicitly adopted it,a majority of our sister circuits have implemented some variation of the theory 
to prevail on a danger claim in the third circuit,a plaintiff must prove the following four elements 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct 
a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience 
a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and 
a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
bright westmoreland county,cir internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted see also smith ii,at quoting an earlier version of the test.
sanford maintains that stiles created the risk of michael death by,for example,holding herself out as a source of aid to michael,cutting off other possible avenues of help,undertaking an assessment of michael without proper training,improperly evaluating his risk,and deciding not to contact the school psychologist or a parent.sanford claim against stiles fails because she is unable to show at least two of the four required elements of a danger claim.specifically,no reasonable jury could find that stiles acted with the requisite degree of culpability,or that she create d an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for harm to occur.smith ii,at.therefore,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.we examine the two elements in question,prongs two and four,in turn 
prong two the standard of culpability 
because the culpability requirement is often the most difficult element for a plaintiff to prove,the outcome of a danger case will often turn on this prong.see id.the supreme court has not fully explicated the standard of culpability in substantive due process cases generally,and our own jurisprudence is difficult to discern.see county of sacramento lewis,d noting that a complete analysis of the fault requirement in substantive due process cases is a matter for closer calls.we now attempt to clarify this difficult area of the law.
jurisprudence on the standard of culpability 
in assessing the standard of fault in danger cases,we have inquired in the past whether the state actor acted in willful disregard for the safety of the plaintiff.see,morse,at quoting kneipp,at.more recently,largely in consideration of the supreme court decision in lewis,at,we have acknowledged that the fault inquiry requires asking whether the state official acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience.see,bright,at.
the supreme court decided lewis nearly two years after we issued our opinion adopting the danger theory in kneipp.the court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuits as to the standard of culpability for due process violations in the context of a police chase.lewis,at.the court held that generally,in a due process challenge to executive action,the threshold question is whether the government officer actions shock the contemporary conscience.id.at.the court determined that in the specific context of a police pursuit,only an intent to harm the plaintiff could shock the conscience.id.at.however,the court stated that whether behavior rises to the level of will depend upon the facts of each individual case.id.at.rules of due process are not subject to mechanical application in unfamiliar territory.
the court suggested that in some instances,conduct involving more than negligence but less than intentional conduct could be shocking in the constitutional sense.therefore,deliberate indifference,or perhaps gross negligence or recklessness,could be sufficient.id.at.in discussing the importance of context,the court compared a chase or a prison riot on one hand with decisions regarding the medical needs of custodial prisoners on the other.id.at.in the latter custodial situation,deliberate indifference to the medical needs of prisoners would likely be sufficient because the state actor could engage in actual deliberation and unhurried judgments.id.at.in the former situation,where deliberation is impossible,the higher standard of intent to harm would be required.id.at.of course,we note that lewis was not a danger case but rather dealt with substantive due process generally.
following lewis,we have stated that in substantive due process cases,t he exact degree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the level depends upon the circumstances of a particular case.miller city of philadelphia,cir.and we have had occasion to reflect on the appropriate standard of fault in a number of different settings.sometimes,an intent to cause harm has been required other times,deliberate indifference has been sufficient.in miller,at,we first utilized a standard part way between intent to harm and deliberate indifference.in that case,a department of human services social worker believed that two children were victims of domestic abuse,based on reports by daycare personnel,videotape footage of the children injuries,and statements made by the children themselves.id.at.the children were removed almost immediately from their mother custody after an order was issued by an emergency judge.id.after custody was restored,the children mother filed a substantive due process suit against the social worker,alleging that he had pursued his investigation without probable cause,misrepresented facts to an assistant city solicitor,and induced a children hospital doctor to perjure himself.id.
we stated that the social worker actions,leading to the emergency order to separate parent and child,involved less urgency than a chase but more urgency than a decision involving the medical care of a prisoner.id.at.therefore,we applied a standard of fault between deliberate indifference and purpose to cause harm.id.at.we defined this new standard as gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.id.at.this standard was created to apply to cases in which no immediate or decision was required,but where officials nonetheless did not have the luxury of true deliberation.as a result,we had articulated three possible standards to determine whether behavior rose to the level of deliberate indifference gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience and intent to cause harm.we concluded that the middle standard had not been met,relying in part on the fact that there was substantial evidence that the children were in danger of abuse.id.at.like lewis,miller was not a danger case,and is therefore distinguishable on that basis.however,given the subsequent incorporation of miller into our danger case law,we find it highly instructive.
in nicini morra,cir en banc,we reviewed a substantive due process claim brought by a minor against a new jersey department of human services caseworker who placed him in the equivalent of a foster home.nicini was clearly very troubled and had apparently made two suicide attempts in the past.id.at.after nicini was sexually abused by one of the parents in his new foster home placement,he filed suit against the caseworker.he alleged that the caseworker failed to properly investigate the background of the foster parent,and that the caseworker knew or should have known that the placement was inappropriate id.at.we assessed the caseworker actions under the deliberate indifference standard,declining to impose the heightened standards utilized in lewis and miller.id.at.we explicitly distinguished miller because the caseworker in nicini,unlike the social worker in miller,had time to make unhurried judgments in investigating whether to permit the child to remain in the foster care in which he was placed.id.quoting lewis,at.
roughly two years later,in ziccardi city of philadelphia,cir,a plaintiff brought a substantive due process claim against two paramedics,asserting that their careless actions in lifting him from a fall rendered him a quadriplegic.rather than immobilizing the plaintiff cervical spine before they moved him from the ground,the paramedics quickly lifted him and allegedly caused his injuries.id.at.
we noted that miller was binding and that the standard of culpability discussed standard more rigorous than deliberate apply.id.at.however,we determined that the language in miller gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience was not intended as a precise articulation.id.at.specifically,we noted that arbitrariness is a general requirement for substantive due process violations and that gross negligence encompasses a lower level of intent than deliberate indifference.id.at.
in attempting to elucidate and apply the level of culpability required in miller,we noted that the case appear ed to have demanded proof of something less than knowledge that the harm was practically certain but more than knowledge that there was a substantial risk that the harm would occur.id.at.we formulated the following standard for circumstances where no instantaneous decision is necessary,but where the state actor also does not have the luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion a plaintiff must show that the defendant consciously disregarded,not just a substantial risk,but a great risk that serious harm would result.id.emphasis added 
we next decided estate of smith marasco,at,or smith i,in which the plaintiffs explicitly brought a danger claim.as in ziccardi and miller,we believed that the situation in smith i demanded a standard for behavior that was between deliberate indifference and intent to cause harm.specifically,we examined the appropriateness of state police officers decision,inter alia,to activate a special emergency response team.id.at.we determined that the relevant decisions were not made in a hyperpressurized environment.id.at.
not acknowledging ziccardi,we utilized the articulation earlier formulated in miller.we reiterated that in situations falling in the grey area between requiring true decisions and allowing relaxed deliberation,liability may be found if an official conduct exhibits a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that shocks the conscience.id.at.
it was not until we decided rivas city of passaic,cir,that we first explicitly acknowledged the heightened standard in ziccardi in a danger case there,we considered a family claim that two emergency medical technicians exposed a seizure victim to danger by calling the police and reporting that the victim attacked them,but failing to warn the officers that the victim had suffered a seizure.id.at.upon arrival,the police restrained the man,allegedly causing his death.id.at.we echoed the ziccardi reiteration of miller,stating at one point that a reasonable jury could conclude that the technicians consciously disregarded a great risk of serious harm to the victim.id.at.
finally,in smith ii,at,we again considered the elusive fault requirement,though in the context of qualified immunity.we first noted the inherent difficulty in determining whether conduct shocks the conscience.id.at quoting smith i,at herrera collins,d scalia,dissenting questioning the usefulness of conscience shocking as a legal test.we also stated that o ur decisions have not clarified this second element of the test to any great extent.id.at.for example,we recognized that the definition applied in smith i was somewhat circular.id.
in addressing the claim before us,we noted and seemed to apply our decision in ziccardi,and stated in a footnote that the standard articulated there was useful.id.at.however,we also stated that the ziccardi opinion did not deal with the question whether the standard formulated applied to danger claims.id.at.
ii.conclusion on the standard of culpability 
from the cases discussed above,we gather the following.the level of culpability required to shock the conscience increases as the time state actors have to deliberate decreases.in a hyperpressurized environment,an intent to cause harm is usually required.on the other hand,in cases where deliberation is possible and officials have the time to make unhurried judgments,deliberate indifference is sufficient though we need not decide the issue here,we note the possibility that deliberate indifference might exist without actual knowledge of a risk of harm when the risk is so obvious that it should be known we also recognize that there are circumstances involving something less urgent than a decision but more urgent than an unhurried judgment.generally,this category will include situations in which the state actor is required to act in a matter of hours or minutes.see ziccardi,at.in other words,these are situations in which there is some urgency and only hurried deliberation is practical.for these circumstances,we utilize the standard set forth in miller and reiterated in the explicit context of danger in smith however,we believe that gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience is a standard that provides little guidance.therefore,we will incorporate the ziccardi test,which is an interpretation of miller,insofar as it requires that the defendants disregard a great risk of serious harm rather than a substantial risk 
in conclusion,we hold that in a danger case,when a state actor is not confronted with a hyperpressurized environment but nonetheless does not have the luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion,the relevant question is whether the officer consciously disregarded a great risk of harm.again,it is possible that actual knowledge of the risk may not be necessary where the risk is obvious.
iii.application of the standard of culpability 
the district court concluded that the deliberate indifference standard applied,but like many other courts to examine this difficult area of the law,it incorrectly differentiated between a shocks the conscience standard on the one hand and a deliberate indifference standard on the other.for example,the court suggested that the lewis standard does not apply in situations.we again clarify that in any danger case,the state actor behavior must always shock the conscience.but what is required to meet the level will depend upon the circumstances of each case,particularly the extent to which deliberation is possible.in some circumstances,deliberate indifference will be sufficient.in others,it will not.
in finding that the deliberate indifference standard applied,the district court noted that stiles had an entire another visit from michael reconsider her initial evaluation.we agree that at least some forethought about michael condition was possible.certainly,the intent to harm requirement utilized in lewis does not apply.we also find this case distinguishable from miller to the extent that there was probably no need for stiles to act in a matter of hours or minutes.ziccardi,at.but regardless of whether deliberate indifference,or something more,is required to show that stiles conduct shocked the conscience,sanford is unable to meet her burden.mere negligence is not enough to shock the conscience.see schieber,at.thus,the relevant question is not whether stiles should have contacted the school psychologist or michael parent.instead,the question is whether,under the circumstances,stiles decisions shock the conscience.we hold that,applying either the deliberate indifference standard or the heightened standard we articulated above,they do not.
first,we examine the apparent gravity of the risk.as the district court noted,no one,including michael mother,karen,or michael uncle,believed that michael was at risk of harm.karen indicated several times that she did not believe that michael would actually commit suicide.for example,she stated i was shocked by the fact that he said he wanted to go kill himself.but,of course,i did think by the context of it that he was serious.app.karen had never heard michael talk about hurting himself before and she concluded that he was not being serious since it just seem ed like one of those things that you would say and because michael joked in the note.app.
we also do not believe that the language in the note itself was a clear cry for help.karen testified that the expression i want to kill myself was used all the time by her friends.app.karen was also told by valladares that the guidance office get s notes like this all the time.app.significantly,the note also referred to any suicidal thoughts as occurring in the past.
second,stiles can not be said to have disregarded any risk that michael presented.she did not simply ignore the note.to the contrary,she promptly spoke with michael,at which point she made a conscious judgment that he indicated no suicidal signs.see,app.this judgment was influenced by the fact that michael assured stiles that he was no longer upset about the issue with karen and that he had future plans.app.for these reasons,we can not conclude that stiles conduct shocked the conscience.the evidence adduced by sanford,even when all inferences are drawn in her favor,falls short of both the standard we have borrowed from ziccardi and the deliberate indifference standard.
prong four did stiles create a danger 
given that sanford has failed to show that stiles demonstrated the requisite level of fault,her claim can go no further.however,we note that sanford has also failed to create a question of fact as to the fourth prong of the danger test.given our opinion in bright,we ask if stiles used her authority in a way that created a danger to michael or that rendered him more vulnerable to danger than had she not acted at all.bright,at.
sanford alleges eleven specific affirmative acts on the part of stiles.appellant br.at.for example,she alleges that stiles interject ed herself into michael mental status,cut michael off from other sources of aid,question ed michael in a manner that pushed him toward suicide,misdiagnos ed michael psychological condition,intentionally decid ed not to refer michael to the school psychologist,intentionally decid ed not to contact michael parent,and refus ed michael request to reveal the identify of the person who had turned in the note.id.
we agree with the district court that i n this case,the link between the defendants conduct and michael sanford untimely death is far too attenuated to justify imposition of liability.we reach this decision based on several considerations.first,as the district court noted,michael visited stiles on only two when she initially called him into her office and again when michael asked her who she had received the note from.there is no evidence that michael was agitated by these meetings,or that they contributed in any way to his suicidal feelings.
second,contrary to sanford contentions,there is nothing in the record to suggest that michael relied on stiles for support or guidance.the primary encounter between stiles and michael was initiated by stiles,and michael repeatedly indicated that nothing was troubling him.finally,stiles did not in any way interfere with sanford parental relationship with her son.she did not,for example,suggest that michael not speak with his mother.sanford choice not to intervene,for example,once she had seen michael instant messages referring to suicide,was not influenced by stiles.
as the district court noted,sanford has attempted to recharacterize stiles failures as affirmative actions.we believe that this case is more about stiles failure to prevent sanford death.as we have stated many times,mere failure to protect an individual does not violate the due process clause.id.at citing deshaney,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.related case law 
our holding that sanford has failed to make out a danger claim is consistent with the case law of other circuits that have addressed similar cases involving student suicides.in fact,we are aware of only one such instance in which a danger case against school officials survived summary judgment.
sanford argues that this case is analogous to armijo wagon mound public schools,cir,in which the tenth circuit found sufficient evidence for the plaintiff to survive summary judgment in a danger claim against certain school officials.however,armijo presented a far more compelling case.there,a special education student committed suicide after he was suspended from school.id.at.he was driven home in the middle of the day,while angry.id.at.armijo parents were not notified and the boy was left to remain alone at home,in contravention of school policy.id.additionally,school officials were aware that armijo had access to firearms at home,id.at,and that he had previously threatened suicide.for example,armijo had said to a school aid i just going to shoot myself and maybe i be better off dead.id.at.armijo is a far cry from this case because there was much more evidence there that school officials actually created the danger to armijo.
this case is more properly analogized to wyke polk county school board,cir.like this case,wyke focuses on a failure to intervene.a boy named shawn committed suicide at home after twice attempting suicide at school.id.at.school officials were somewhat aware of these incidents but failed to hold shawn in custody,contact his mother,or provide him with counseling services.id.another boy who was aware of shawn first suicide attempt alerted his own mother,who in turn notified the school dean of students.id.at.the dean made the assurance that he would take care of it but only read shawn some verses from the bible.id.the mother who reported the incident to the dean testified that she would have contacted shawn mother directly had she known that the dean would not intervene in a more meaningful way.id.at.
the eleventh circuit concluded that shawn mother claim failed as a matter of law because nothing in the due process clause required that school officers protect shawn life.id.at.the school did not make a decision to prevent anyone from helping shawn and it could not be held liable.id.while we do not express agreement or disagreement with the eleventh circuit holding,we note that,like armijo,wyke presented much more urgent circumstances than those we review here.still,wyke claim failed.
the first and seventh circuits have also denied claims involving similar or more pressing risks than those we confront here.in hasenfus lajeunesse,cir,the first circuit rejected parents due process claim after their daughter attempted suicide on school grounds.the child,a known rape victim,attempted suicide after being reprimanded in front of her schoolmates by a teacher.id.at.seven other students in the girl middle school had attempted suicide in the three months prior.id.at.in affirming the district court,the first circuit stated 
the federal courts have no general authority to decide when school administrators should introduce suicide prevention programs,or whether an unruly or upset school child should be sent out of class,or what should be said to other parents about a tragic incident at school.substantive due pr
