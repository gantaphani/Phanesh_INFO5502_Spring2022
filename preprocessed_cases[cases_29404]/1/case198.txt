deborah maher,a registered nurse,began work at massachusetts general hospital mgh,in august.maher stopped working in november and,in february,began receiving disability benefits through mgh disability plan due to chronic abdominal pain and related symptoms her physicians although never entirely clear on the cause attributed her symptoms to chronic pancreatitis,chronic pain syndrome or fibromyalgia.over time,joint pain added to her woes,and maher received impressive amounts of narcotics to manage her pain,which caused some negative side effects.
in february,liberty life assurance company of boston liberty,the plan claims processor,terminated maher benefits.after a june letter misquoted plan language,liberty concluded in a corrected september letter that maher was no longer totally disabled,defined in section of the the massachusetts general hospital long term disability plan the primary plan document as 
such complete incapacity,resulting from a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,as prevents the participant from performing any and every duty of any occupation or employment,for which he is reasonably qualified by education,training or experience.
this determination was based in part on medical assessments more fully described below but also on covert surveillance video showing maher driving,walking,jogging,bending over,flying a kite,and lifting her child.the most comprehensive assessment was by robert millstein,a medical consultant at liberty,who based his judgment on review of maher medical file.he confirmed diagnoses by maher personal physicians of her fibromyalgia,osteoarthritis,and psoriasis but determined that none prevented maher from working.
maher pursued administrative appeals with liberty and ultimately with partners healthcare system,partners,the plan administrator.she submitted supporting materials,most notably march statements from her personal physician,elizabeth cuevas,and wolfram goessling,her gastroenterologist.cuevas represented that maher,despite her pain medications,remains in significant disability,both from her chronic pain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,such as somnolence.she is unable to reliably perform duties because her pain can become so severe so quickly.and goessling stated that i do not see any way that my patient would be able to sit or stand for prolonged period s of time let alone do physically or intellectually demanding work.
during the ensuing appeals,new doctors independently reviewed maher files.herbert malinoff,conducting the independent assessment on maher appeal within liberty,consulted with cuevas and goessling,but ultimately found maher symptoms far out of proportion to any abnormality identified physically dean hashimoto,conducting the independent assessment on maher final appeal to partners,agreed disability had not been established.broadly speaking,both,along with millstein,believed that the physical data did not explain the degree of pain or other symptoms claimed by maher and found she had provided insufficient other evidence of completely debilitating pain.
partners formally denied maher last appeal in january.maher sought review of her benefits termination in federal court under section of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a b.the district court,reviewing the plan administrator decision under a deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,entered summary judgment for the mgh plan and upheld the termination of benefits.maher.hosp.long term disability plan,unpublished order.maher has now appealed,challenging both the standard applied by the district court and the substantive decision.
the standard of review presents an issue of law which we review de novo,smart gillette.long term disability plan,cir.the denial of benefits is itself subject to de novo review albeit ordinarily on the administrative record unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,firestone tire rubber bruch,in which event the court applies a deferential arbitrary and capricious or abuse of discretion standard,cusson liberty life assurance,cir.
here,section of the primary plan document unequivocally reserves to the hospital authority to determine eligibility for benefits,construe the terms and conditions of the plan,and resolve disputes as to the interpretation of the plan documents and it explicitly precludes review unless the hospital action was arbitrary and capricious or without rational basis.the hospital is defined only as the general hospital corporation ghc,which is a massachusetts charitable organization whose sole member is mgh,whose sole member,in turn,is partners 
maher argument in favor of de novo review is that the final decision in this case was made by partners no proper delegation of authority to determine benefits was ever made to partners and therefore partners decision to deny benefits is not protected by section deferential standard of review.it is clear enough that,absent a proper delegation,the mgh plan could not rely on section standard to defend a denial by an independent entity.see terry bayer,cir.
as it happens,ghc,mgh and partners are in practice far from independent.partners is a framework entity embracing mgh and brigham two of the major teaching hospitals in boston and includes smaller nonprofit hospitals as well the boards of directors overlap and partners appears to operate in part as a coordinating body that performs various functions for the member hospitals including,at least so far as the mgh plan is concerned,administrator of the plan in question on behalf of the hospital.we say appears because the mgh plan has chosen to defend the case as one of conventional delegation.
this choice of litigation strategy lends a certain air of unreality to the situation.the affiliation may explain why some aspects of the alleged delegation are not as clearly formalized as one might expect.in the end,viewed as a conventional delegation the mgh plan has not relied on affiliation or provided detailed information about it the treatment of partners as a proper inheritor of the hospital discretionary authority is justified,but perhaps only by a modest margin.
the double issue is whether the plan expressly provide s for procedures for ghc to designate partners as a fiduciary with discretionary authority to administer the plan,c terry,at,and,if so,whether this had occurred.the courts have not been overly demanding in the search for express procedures.wallace johnson johnson,f d,cir.the district court relied on section of the primary plan document,which provides 
the hospital may employ agents,including but not limited to,a claims processor,accountants,attorneys or actuaries to perform such services and duties in connection with the administration of the plan as it may direct the hospital shall be fully protected in acting upon the advice of any such agent,in whole or in part,and shall not be liable for any act or omission of any such agent,the hospital only duty being to use reasonable care in the selection of any such agent.
maher argues that the focus of this language is primarily on ancillary duties to aid ghc in carrying out its own responsibilities.nothing expressly identifies decisional authority to determine benefits as a power that can be delegated.if a separate identification were required,that might be the end of any delegation claim,but under the case law it is enough that the language can be taken to include that delegation,pettaway teachers ins.annuity.
section can be read quite broadly the list of agents ghc may employ is,nothing limits the services and duties ghc may direct its agents to perform,and the attempt to relieve ghc of liability is consistent with an allocation of responsibilities from one fiduciary to another.see,fr.lawyers are commonly charged with fiduciary duties,and erisa may in some circumstances treat accountants and actuaries as fiduciaries as well,despite merely providing advice.see,d.
here,any uncertainty is resolved by looking to associated documents including the trust agreement and the summary plan description,b,which we are entitled to consult.pettaway,at.the summary plan description clearly states that partners acts as the plan administrator of mgh disability plan and has the discretion to determine all matters relating to eligibility,coverage and benefits under each plan provided.and,the plan trust agreement contemplates certain actions being undertaken by ghc or its delegate.
thus the plan instruments not only make clear that the plan authorized delegation of fiduciary responsibility to partners,but also that such delegation actually occurred.compare rodriguez abreu chase manhattan bank,cir documents taken together failed to delegate.given that delegation,the denial will be upheld only if it is reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.gannon metro.life ins,cir.maher has the burden of proving her disability.orndorf paul revere life ins,cir,cert.denied.
turning then to the denial of benefits,it is common ground that maher suffers from significant medical afflictions and uses narcotics to combat pain.the question is whether maher chronic pain narcotics use render her incapable of performing the sedentary nursing jobs suggested by liberty consultant in a transferrable skills analysis conducted during the review of maher benefits the jobs included sedentary work as a telephonic triage nurse,nurse case manager,or utilization review nurse.
on maher side we have diagnoses of medical ailments unchallenged by partners and explicit statements,already quoted,by her own doctors who treated her one of whom assessed significant disability and the other of whom said that she could not do physically or intellectually demanding work.these are,of course,fairly summary assessments but the last,if fully credited and not contradicted by other evidence,might appear to rule out even the less physically demanding positions suggested.
yet these assessments of disability also depended on maher as to the effects of medication and,more importantly,the severity of her symptoms.maher has been plagued among other things by pain,nausea,vomiting,and diarrhea.she has seen a host of doctors,attended pain clinics,been recurrently hospitalized,treated with high doses of narcotics,and undergone pancreatic and biliary procedures designed to relieve pancreatitis so obviously she has serious symptoms but the question remains whether they are disabling,and this brings us to the heart of the problem.
in some situations,the degree of pain or other dysfunction corresponds with what doctors knowing of the malady would expect or at least deem within range.millstein clearly thought that this was not true here detecting some signs of exaggeration and doctor shopping and he concluded that any negative impact of the narcotics would be alleviated by adaptation to the dosages.he also relied on both the surveillance video and a number of other separate pieces of evidence to which one might attach more or less weight 
a september statement by cuevas,maher primary care physician,stating that she had not placed restriction on maher for abdominal pain and was not aware of restrictions from other doctors 
a november record from anthony reginato,a rheumatologist,indicating that maher denied chills,vomiting,and abdominal pain,but also complained of having such pain over the previous days and 
documentation that maher had not seen wolfram goessling,her gastroenterologist,during.
malinoff,who conducted the first independent assessment,found maher symptoms far out of proportion to any abnormality identified physically,and again relied on liberty video surveillance.malinoff also consulted with cuevas and goessling.malinoff highlighted cuevas agreement that there is no identifiable medicine issue which would prevent this woman from carrying out sedentary or light labor on a full time basis,and emphasized his disagreement with goessling focus on maher symptoms.
hashimoto,conducting the last independent assessment,discredited maher pain based on her failure to submit supporting evidence of disability from her treatment in pain clinics emphasized cuevas statement to malinoff about maher physicians inability to pinpoint an anatomic cause of her symptoms discredited goessling opinion due to his failure to treat maher in and relied on the video surveillance of maher.he also said that there was little evidence of either evaluation or treatment of her claims of impairment based on narcotics use.
this is a fairly impressive set of objections but there are two aspects that concern us and,taken together,warrant remand for further consideration the first,and most important,rests on the fact that at every stage of maher administrative appeal,liberty and partners reviewing doctors emphasized the inconsistency between her limitations and the surveillance video.it is not apparent to us that any such inconsistency exists.
maher reported that her activity varied based on the extent of her pain,nausea,and opportunity to for activities,but that she generally spent most of her days in bed.in over hours of surveillance,the most damning evidence the mgh plan can identify is minutes during which maher carried a bucket or flower pot and minutes during which maher played with her son in the park.on of the days on which surveillance video is available,maher engaged in no activity.on other days,maher was shown sitting or standing outside her house with her husband for about minutes.
thus most of the surveillance,far from contradicting maher disability,seems to confirm her lifestyle as generally housebound with occasional,limited activity.for the brief periods of slightly more vigorous activity,maher may have or may have simply been having a good day either of which would be consistent with her reported limitations.of course,she may have been housebound by choice that is the critical question.but this is far from a situation in which a video conclusively disproves the disability claim 
this court earlier upheld a termination of benefits where claimant credibility was called into question by sporadic surveillance capturing limited activity.cusson liberty life assurance,cir.but there the videos showed activities that specifically contradicted claims made by the claimant as to how she spent her time and what actions she could tolerate.id.at.we cautioned in that case that weight given to surveillance in these sorts of cases depends both on the amount and nature of the activity observed.id.
apart from the video,the main objective fact relied on by partners was maher failure to provide supporting evidence of disability from her pain clinics.but maher explained her attempts to obtain documentation from those clinics and offered both releases to allow the mgh plan to access the information and to submit to examination by a doctor of the mgh plan choosing.it also appears that two of the three pain clinics were so the information ought to have been accessible.
in the end,the mgh plan was entitled to be skeptical the claimant has a stake in the outcome and the treating doctors do not purport to explain the degree of pain claimed.but the video evidence and failure to produce pain clinic information seem overstated.we can not say with assurance that the mgh plan denied maher benefits to which she was entitled,but even according deference we are also not confident that its analysis has fully justified its decision.
the judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded to the district court so it may allow partners to conduct such further review and provide such further explanation and information as it sees fit,providing maher a fair opportunity to respond to any such supplementation of the administrative record.we are not reinstating benefits but merely remanding to the plan administrator for further consideration of the claim and more adequate explanation,but we expect further proceedings by partners to proceed with expedition.each party to bear its own costs.
it is so ordered.
the majority correctly identifies the double issue we face in determining the applicable standard of review in this case first,whether massachusetts general hospital the hospital or mgh is expressly authorized by the mgh long term disability plan the plan to delegate its authority to determine benefits,and,second,whether mgh in fact made such a delegation to the plan administrator,partners healthcare system,partners.my colleagues answer yes to each of those questions.in so concluding,however,they disregard our precedent requiring a clear statement of the authority to delegate,fail to respect the limits of the pertinent plan language,and uncritically accept partners declaration of fiduciary authority despite that assertion inconsistency with the terms of the primary plan document.
in my view,the plan does not give the hospital authority to delegate and,even if it did,partners assertion of its own authority is insufficient evidence that a proper delegation in fact occurred.hence,because neither question may be answered affirmatively,the de novo standard of review must be used to evaluate the administrator decision denying benefits to maher.taking a fresh view of the record,i can only conclude that maher symptoms render her incapable of sedentary work.i would thus vacate the district court judgment and remand for entry of judgment in maher favor.
maher challenged the termination of her benefits under section of the employee retirement income security act erisa,u.a b.erisa does not prescribe a standard of review for such actions.to fill this gap,the supreme court has held that a denial of benefits challenged under section a b should be reviewed de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch.where such authority is given,our review is more deferential,id.at,and a benefits decision will be upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion,cusson liberty life assurance of boston,cir quoting gannon metro.life ins,cir.
the standard of review inquiry must thus start with the terms of the plan,through which mgh provided maher ltd benefits.article of the plan document states in full 
general.the processing of claims and calculation of benefits shall be the sole responsibility of the claims processor.the hospital shall have full discretionary authority to administer the plan,including without limitation the authority to determine eligibility for benefits,construe the terms and conditions of the plan,and resolve disputes as to the interpretation of the plan documents.any person having an interest under the plan m a y request a determination by the hospital with respect to any matter affecting such person,and any such determination of the hospital will be final and binding,and shall not be subject to de novo review,or be modified,amended,or set aside by any judicial or administrative authority in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the hospital action was arbitrary and capricious or without rational basis.
the plan document defines the hospital to mean the general hospital corporation,a massachusetts charitable organization whose sole member is mgh.because the above provision grants the hospital full discretionary authority to administer the plan,including the authority to determine eligibility for benefits and construe the terms and conditions of the plan,a benefits decision by mgh would typically be reviewed under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.firestone,at cusson,at.
the benefits decision at issue here was not,however,made by mgh.instead,it was made by partners,the plan administrator.to be sure,partners and the hospital are closely related.partners,a nonprofit corporation,coordinates a healthcare system made up of a number of constituent medical institutions,including mgh,brigham and women hospital,and various other hospitals and medical organizations.however closely bound together,though,there is no question that partners and the hospital are legally distinct entities,and the plan does not argue that the discretionary authority conferred on the hospital should be imputed to partners glotzer metro.life ins,app x,cir holding that,because successor corporation inherited in full the rights and burdens of plan administrator through purchase,discretion delegated to plan administrator was imputed to successor.
instead,the plan contends that partners validly exercised discretionary authority that had been delegated to it by the hospital.erisa provides that a named fiduciary may delegate to others its responsibilities under a plan other than trustee responsibilities where the plan expressly sets forth procedures for doing so.c rodriguez abreu chase manhattan bank,cir.to determine whether a valid delegation of authority took place here,we must address the majority double issue whether the plan authorized the hospital to delegate its authority to partners and,if so,whether there is adequate evidence of the claimed delegation of authority.
was delegation authorized 
a plan fiduciary may delegate its fiduciary responsibilities to a third party only where the plan expressly provide s for procedures for such a delegation.c.as explained in wallace johnson johnson,cir,our court has placed little emphasis on the statute reference to delegation procedures.that is,we do not require that a plan establish any procedures governing delegation beyond a basic grant of the authority to delegate itself.see id.our own cases treat delegation authority and delegation procedures as more or less the same thing.however,the statute reference to expressly provid ing delegation procedures means that such a grant of authority to delegate must be clearly stated.this is consonant both with the requirement that the initial grant of discretionary authority by a plan be unambiguous,see terry bayer,cir rodriguez abreu,at,and with our case law examining plan language granting authority to delegate.
in wallace,we found a valid delegation of discretionary authority where it was clear that the benefits plan at issue purport ed to allow delegation.at.the relevant language of the plan stated that the fiduciary may d elegate its authority established by the plan,designate persons to assist in carrying out fiduciary duties,allocate responsibility for the operation and administration of the plan,and a ppoint persons or committees to assist it to perform its duties under the plan.id.at.we reached the same conclusion in terry,where the plan stated that t he company may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf,in which case every reference herein made to the company shall be deemed to mean or include the individuals as to matters within their jurisdiction.at.in each of these cases,the plan language was unambiguous and unqualified in its grant of authority to delegate.
here,in contrast,the plan can not be read to authorize a delegation of plenary administrative authority over the plan to partners.the most relevant provision of the plan document,and the one emphasized by the plan reads as follows 
employment of agents.the hospital may employ agents,including but not limited to,a claims processor,accountants,attorneys or actuaries to perform such services and duties in connection with the administration of the plan as it may direct the hospital shall be fully protected in acting upon the advice of any such agent,in whole or in part 
unlike the plan language in terry and wallace,the provision here authorizes no complete devolution of the discretionary authority granted to the hospital under article of the plan.rather,article allows the hospital to employ agents,often referred to as service providers in erisa parlance,whose activities it may direct,to assist with the operation of the plan and to advise the hospital in carrying out the fiduciary duties assigned to it in article.in terry,in the course of determining whether a claims processor could be sued as a fiduciary under erisa for its role in denying the claimant benefits,we drew a sharp distinction between these types of third party service provider s,on the one hand,and the plan administrator and fiduciaries,on the other.at.
the reference to a claims processor as one of the agents the hospital may employ reflects the limited nature of the delegation authorized by article,and,critically,that it does not include the ultimate authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan the authority that triggers deferential review.firestone,at.a claims processor generally makes the initial determination on a benefits claim and may handle the first level of appeals,but another entity is usually responsible for making a final determination on appeal in the typical instance,we have thus noted that an entity which merely processes claims is not a fiduciary because such person does not have discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the plan.terry,at quoting,d.such is plainly the case under the plan.article sets the hospital authority with the claims processor.it makes clear that,though t he processing of claims and calculation of benefits shall be the sole responsibility of the claims processor,it is the hospital that has full discretionary authority to administer the plan,including without limitation the authority to determine eligibility for benefits,construe the terms and conditions of the plan,and resolve disputes as to the interpretation of the plan documents.
accordingly,i read article to authorize delegation of administrative functions short of the hospital core authority to determine eligibility for benefits and construe the terms and conditions of the plan.at a minimum,if this provision were intended to permit the delegation of the totality of the hospital discretionary authority,it lacks the requisite clarity.terry,at t he grant of discretionary authority must be clear.i thus conclude that article did not authorize the hospital delegation of discretionary authority to partners.however,as discussed below,even if the plan permitted such delegation,the evidence that a delegation took place is inadequate.
b.did a delegation occur 
the plan asserts that evidence of a delegation of authority to partners can be found in a document entitled partners healthcare system.health and welfare plan document the partners plan document,which the plan characterizes as a summary plan description spd.the document,published under partners name,purports to be a plan document that contains the definitions,participation and administration provisions of the various partners health and welfare plans,which includes the plan at issue here as well as over forty others,and incorporates by reference the various benefit contracts associated with the plan to form a complete plan document.the language supposedly effecting the delegation,located in section ii,article ix of the partners plan document,simply states,partners acts as the plan administrator for erisa purposes of the plans.the partners plan document further provides that,as plan administrator,partners has the discretion to determine all matters relating to eligibility,coverage and benefits under each plan and has the full power to interpret each plan and is responsible for the operation of each plan.
our cases involving delegation of fiduciary authority under erisa do not directly address what sort of evidence will suffice to show that delegation has been effected.to some extent,the answer in an individual case may depend upon whether the erisa plan at issue sets forth particular procedures to canalize the delegation process.however,often,as here,the plan will not specify a mechanism for delegation.in these cases,our precedents hint at some basic guidelines for determining whether the evidence before the court establishes the delegation of fiduciary authority.
first,it is not enough merely to show that the putative delegate is carrying out discretionary functions of plan administration.in rodriguez abreu,a senior executive of the defendant employer conducted a review of the denial of plaintiff benefits and corresponded with the plaintiff regarding his eligibility.at.the defendant argued that these circumstances alone were sufficient to show that the plan fiduciaries had delegated their discretion to the executive,triggering a deferential standard of review.we disagreed.noting that there was no expression of intent that the executive act as the delegate of the fiduciaries in the plan documents or elsewhere in the record,we found no valid delegation of authority and thus employed a de novo standard of review.id.at.
second,evidence of the delegation may be provided by a written instrument other than the plan documents themselves.in terry,the benefit plan at issue conferred discretionary authority to administer the plan to the bayer corporation,and bayer in turn delegated that authority to an internal benefit administration committee.at.the only evidence of this delegation was an internal organizational document the administrative procedures for the benefit administration committee,which,among other things,explained that the committee had been formed to act on behalf of bayer by assisting bayer in fulfilling its administrative duties which are set forth in the employee benefit plans.id.at.we found this clear and direct delegation by written instrument from the plan administrator to the benefit committee sufficient to justify a deferential standard of review.id.at see also wallace,at holding written instrument transferring discretionary authority to administer plan to third party sufficient evidence of valid delegation to trigger review under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
here,we have a written document the partners plan document that purportedly gives to partners the discretionary authority to administer the plan.however,the relevant terms in the partners plan document represent nothing more than the bare assertion by a third party of discretionary authority over administration of the plan.the document states simply that partners acts as the plan administrator for all plans listed among its pages and that partners has the discretion to determine all matters relating to eligibility,coverage and benefits under each plan and has the full power to interpret each plan and is responsible for the operation of each plan.this is at best corroborative evidence of a transfer of authority from the hospital to partners,but insufficient on its own to establish the delegation.the plan has offered no evidence of an agreement between the hospital and partners,a corporate resolution by the hospital,or other such documentation that would indicate that the hospital affirmatively granted discretionary authority over the plan to partners.
in arguing over the effect of the partners plan document,the parties vigorously dispute whether it properly qualifies as an spd for the plan this is a question that need not be resolved here,as nothing turns on it.even if the partners plan document qualified as an spd,there would be a direct conflict with the primary plan document that must be resolved in the plan document favor.each document purports to grant full discretionary authority over the plan,with the power to make final and binding decisions,to a different entity.where there is a conflict between the plan and the spd,the plan language will generally control,except in situations where the beneficiary relied to her detriment on the spd.see ringwald prudential ins.of,cir disregarding grant of discretionary authority that appeared only in spd schwartz prudential ins.of,cir same,and explaining that spd controls if participant detrimentally relied on it mauser raytheon.pension plan for salaried,cir where spd conflicts with a plan terms,the spd will control if the claimant demonstrates significant or reasonable reliance on the spd.thus,to the extent that the partners plan document qualifies as an spd,the grant of discretionary authority in the plan document must still be credited over the conflicting grant in the putative spd 
in sum,the plan by its terms did not authorize the hospital to delegate its authority,and,even if the plan had permitted such delegation,there is insufficient evidence that the hospital in fact delegated its authority to partners.partners denial of maher benefits must therefore be reviewed de novo.
in a de novo review of a benefits decision,no deference is given to administrators opinions or conclusions based on the facts.orndorf paul revere life ins,cir see also richards hewlett packard,cir same.instead,an independent review of the evidence in the administrative record must be performed,orndorf,at richards,at,and the guiding principle is that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving he is disabled,orndorf,at.to meet that burden,the terms of the plan require maher to prove a complete incapacity preventing her from performing any and every duty of any occupation or employment,for which she is reasonably qualified by education,training or experience.the plan has narrowed the scope of the inquiry somewhat by specifying the occupations for which it believes maher to be qualified telephonic triage nurse,nurse case manager,and utilization review nurse.
maher arguments on the merits of the plan benefits determination fall into two categories.first,maher argues that her use of narcotics renders her incapable of filling any of the jobs for which she is qualified by education,training,or experience.in support of this argument she points to state law that purportedly prohibits her from performing any nursing duties while under the influence of narcotics.alternatively,she submits that,legality aside,the effects of her medications would impair her judgment and interfere with her ability to perform nursing duties.second,maher contends that the evidence supports the disability caused by her chronic pain and nausea,and that partners wrongly discounted evidence of the manner and extent to which pain affects her ability to function.
i address each of these arguments in turn.
disabling effects of narcotics use 
maher medical records confirm that,for nearly a decade,maher has treated pain with a varying array of powerful narcotics,and she usually has taken multiple drugs at the same time and in significant doses.in a letter,elizabeth cuevas,maher primary care doctor,noted that her patient is treated with narcotics that are prescribed at very high doses,and wolfram goessling,maher treating gastroenterologist,has similarly noted that maher takes impressive amounts of narcotics.over the course of her treatment,maher has consulted several pain clinics and periodically changed medications,but her records reveal no success in scaling back the use of narcotic painkillers.according to herbert malinoff,one of liberty consulting doctors,maher record of treatment supports a diagnosis of chemical dependency relative to opioid and benzodiazepine use over a long period of time.
maher contends that her drug use,as a matter of law,prevents her from working in any job within the field of nursing,and thus precludes employment in the one area for which she is qualified by education,training,or experience.as maher notes,massachusetts standards of conduct for licensed nurses prohibit nurses from practicing while impaired.regs.maher argues that the sedentary nursing roles that liberty has suggested she would be capable of filling all necessarily involve the practice of nursing,defined by statute to include coordination and management of resources for care delivery.laws ann.ch.because she is therapeutically addicted to narcotic medication,maher suggests that she is legally impaired and can not serve in the above positions 
though maher tries to segregate this line of reasoning from her alternative argument that the effects of her medications would interfere with her ability to carry out the duties of a nursing job,they can not be so easily disentangled.the fact of narcotics use does not,by itself,appear to preclude legal function as a nurse.the governing regulations define impaired to mean the inability to practice nursing with reasonable judgment,skill,and safety by reason of alcohol or drug abuse,use of substances,a physical or mental illness or condition,or by any combination of the foregoing.regs.thus,whether maher is impaired turns not on whether she is addicted to narcotics,but on a factual determination of whether her narcotic use is likely to interfere with her judgment and skill.id.
the evidence of the effect of maher narcotic use on her ability to concentrate and function is mixed.there is,to be sure,an intuitive logic to the notion that we should be wary of entrusting patient care to a medical professional who takes large amounts of narcotic medications.this is a point that maher emphasizes in her briefs,and it has some basis in fact.medical authorities warn that narcotics may cause sedation,mental clouding,and impaired psychomotor function.however,according to a publication of the american medical association included in the administrative record,these types of side effects usually dissipate with continued treatment,normally within a week with regularly scheduled dosing,and studies have demonstrated that most patients on chronic opioid therapy can safely drive cars.one of liberty consulting physicians,robert millstein,makes the same point in his february report,though he acknowledges very few studies have examined the effects of opioids on selective,divided,and sustained attention.
maher medical records indicate that she has often complained of the sedation brought on by her regimen of narcotics.however,close scrutiny of these records indicates that many of her reports of somnolence and other side effects are correlated with a change in medication or an adjustment of dosage.to take one example,maher saw goessling in march and complained that the morphine she was taking made her loopy and more sleepy than usual.her medical records reveal that she was started on morphine only a couple of days prior,when she was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and the pain clinicians recommended that she transition from oxycontin.
overall,i do not find convincing support in the record for the proposition that maher drug use,by itself,would render her incapable of working in one of the sedentary nursing positions identified by liberty.there is no clear prohibition in massachusetts on serving as a nurse while on a medically prescribed regimen of narcotics,so long as the drugs do not impair the nurse judgment,skill,and safety.maher doctors have not suggested that her use of drugs would interfere with her judgment or ability to make rational decisions.indeed,goessling and cuevas both identify excessive sedation to be the major side effect associated with maher medication.i acknowledge that goessling has opined that he can not imagine that it would be in maher or society benefit to have her work as a nurse making decisions over other people lives,but he does not point to any specific effect of the drugs that would render maher incapable of safely managing the limited nursing roles suggested for her by liberty.
i am not unconcerned by the possibility that sedation would make it difficult for maher to complete a regular workday.in one instance in,maher reported that the somnolence associated with a change from oxycontin to palladone was causing her to take three naps per day.such considerable sedation would clearly interfere with most if not all possible employment.however,because maher reports of drowsiness and other adverse effects from medication appear largely related to alterations in her drug regimen which conforms to the medical evidence that side effects are most pronounced when first starting a narcotic i do not see convincing evidence that maher ability to concentrate and exercise judgment would be significantly compromised by a regular and stable program of narcotic medications.
disabling effects of pain and other symptoms 
i reach a different conclusion with respect to the impact of the symptoms of maher maladies chronic pain,nausea,vomiting,and food intolerance on her ability to work.after careful review of the record,i find persuasive evidence that maher symptoms would prevent her from performing the duties of the jobs identified by liberty.
before evaluating the record on this issue,i note that my concern here lies with the evidence of limitations attributable to maher symptoms,and not with whether the evidence supports maher underlying medical conditions.there is considerable uncertainty regarding the etiology of maher abdominal pain and other complaints,and attempting to resolve a question that has stymied multiple doctors for the past decade is both unnecessary and beyond my expertise the diagnosis makes little difference here.our court has emphasized before that in dealing with,conditions,it is not reasonable to expect or require objective evidence supporting the beneficiary claimed diagnosis.see cook liberty life assurance,f d,cir.our focus instead must be on whether evidence supports an inability to work due to the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses boardman prudential ins.of,cir.
evidence relied upon by the plan 
i begin by assessing the evidence that,in the view of the plan,calls maher limitations into question,the foremost of which is the alleged inconsistency between maher reported capabilities and the level of activity confirmed by surveillance.liberty conducted surveillance of maher on nineteen days between october and october,portions of which were recorded on video the plan and its doctors highlighted a handful of examples of increased activity by maher captured in the surveillance.on one occasion,maher was observed walking to the front of her property carrying what appeared to be a and a large bucket,and,four minutes later,walking back with the same bucket.on another,she drove herself a short distance a drive to a local school,where she went inside and returned carrying her son then close to three years old,whom she placed inside the car before departing for her home.on a third occasion and the one on which the plan places the most emphasis maher husband drove maher and her son to a local soccer field on a saturday morning.there,maher was periodically observed as she and her husband flew a kite with the young boy,as she walked and jogged around the soccer field,and as she at one point lifted the small boy and swung him around in her arms.the outing lasted minutes.
this surveillance evidence does not have the significance that the plan ascribes to it.in the activity questionnaires she submitted to liberty,maher consistently reported that the level of activity she can sustain is entirely dependent on her pain,nausea,and level of medication.for example,in her latest questionnaire,dated september,maher indicated that the amount of time she can tolerate sitting,standing,and riding in or driving a car depends on the presence of pain,nausea,vomiting,and diarrhea.she also noted that she leaves the house during the week two to three times a day one to two times on weekend days,and that she helps take care of her children and perform small chores when she is able.
as the majority points out,liberty surveillance is not inconsistent with maher own account of her activities.over nineteen days of surveillance,there were a number of days in which maher was confirmed to be at home and never left the residence.on other days,she left the house either as a passenger or driving herself to run a limited number of errands,mostly picking up or dropping off her children at school,and once to go to dinner at a restaurant.she was also observed outside on two brief occasions involved in what could generously be described as yard chores carrying a flower pot and,on another occasion,sitting in the bed of her husband truck holding a broom or rake while her husband appeared to be cleaning up.all of this activity is consistent with her description of a low level of activity dependent on the ebb and flow of her symptoms.it would be unusual for a mother of three children to be able to avoid all activity.
with regard to the episode,which strays the farthest from maher reported limitations,maher has indicated that the outing was a special event for which she premedicated with morphine.in other circumstances,this explanation might strain credulity.here,however,the notion that maher premedicates to prepare for activities that may trigger pain finds support in records that predate the incident in a march activity questionnaire,for example,maher noted that she travels by plane only with for pain and nausea from increased cabin pressure on abdomen.in her september questionnaire,maher also noted that her ability to carry out various activities of daily life always depend s on how much pain medicine i use to help myself.moreover,the entire outing at the athletic fields was very brief,lasting just over half an hour.it would be unfair to read too much into one short episode of increased activity,given the consistency of the larger record of surveillance with maher reported capabilities.
turning to an evaluation of the medical opinions concerning maher limitations,my conclusion again diverges from that of the plan and its doctors.among maher treating doctors,there is thin support for her capacity to return to a sedentary job.the most direct evidence is found in a questionnaire,completed by gale haydock,indicating that maher is ok to perform sedentary duties.however,haydock treated maher only once,in the winter of,when maher was admitted to the hospital for several days to treat a of abdominal pain,and thus haydock had no opportunity to observe the course of maher symptoms over time.
one could also,as the plan has,read various statements by maher primary care physician cuevas to support maher ability to perform sedentary work.most notably,in a conversation with malinoff,cuevas stated her agreement with malinoff opinion that,from a purely internal medicine perspective,there is no identifiable physical exam or abnormality that would prevent maher from working at a very minimum at a sedentary level.this awkwardly precise statement is technically true and is,undoubtedly,an accurate reflection of cuevas medical opinion it is also transparently misleading.maher medical records make clear that no doctor has been able to identify a physical or anatomic abnormality that causes her symptoms.however,the absence of a diagnosed medical condition says nothing about the reliability of maher complaints or whether her reported symptoms prevent her from working.on those questions,cuevas opinion is unequivocal.in a letter dated march,cuevas wrote that maher remains in significant disability,both from her chronic pain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,and that she is unable to reliably perform duties because her pain can become so severe so quickly.
lastly,the record also contains opinions from the three doctors retained by the plan millstein,malinoff,and dean hashimoto,chief of occupational and environmental medicine at mgh concluding that the available evidence does not support maher claimed inability to work a sedentary job.i find the opinions rendered by these doctors unpersuasive.each doctor relied to a significant degree on the surveillance records in evaluating maher capabilities,focusing on the episodes of activity detailed above and finding them inconsistent with maher claims.malinoff and hashimoto also interpreted cuevas statements as supportive of maher ability to return to work.for the reasons stated,i have reached contrary conclusions based on the same evidence.additionally,hashimoto observed that,even accepting the veracity of maher reported symptoms,there has been no attempt to evaluate through neuropsych testing,scans,or other available means the extent to which maher pain and use of narcotics affect her cognition and ability to function.this failing can be attributed,to some degree,to the plan decision not to pursue an independent medical evaluation of maher to assist in the assessment of her claim nevertheless,as i discuss below,i find the record evidence of maher limitations sufficient even absent the sort of testing suggested by hashimoto.
the evidence supports maher limitations 
viewing the totality of the medical evidence in the administrative record,i am persuaded that maher symptoms prevent her from reliably performing the duties of a sedentary nursing job.at the fore of that evidence are the opinions of maher treating doctors,cuevas and goessling.as noted,cuevas assessment as of march was that maher remains in significant disability and is unable to reliably perform duties because her pain can become so severe so quickly.similarly,goessling,who has followed maher since the onset of her abdominal symptoms in la
