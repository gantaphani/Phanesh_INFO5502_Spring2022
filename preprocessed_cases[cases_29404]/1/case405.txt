stroni is a native and citizen of albania who claims that he entered the united states illegally on march.on march,almost one year after his purported entry date,stroni filed an application for asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins in support of his request for asylum,stroni described several incidents of past persecution by the socialist government of albania,incidents allegedly based on stroni political affiliation and opinion.stroni also asserted that he feared he would be killed,tortured,or arrested if he returned to albania.
the asylum officer who heard stroni case found stroni testimony to be vague,inconsistent,and lacking in detail.although stroni was given the opportunity to clarify all discrepancies in his testimony,he was unable to do so successfully.in particular,the asylum officer found that stroni testimony regarding the date,manner,and place of his entry into the united states was not credible.the asylum officer thus rejected stroni application for asylum,having concluded that stroni failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application for asylum within one year of his entry as required by law.
upon referral from the asylum officer,the immigration court placed stroni in removal proceedings by filing a notice to appear dated april.on june,at an initial hearing before an immigration judge ij in new york city,stroni conceded removability as charged,renewed his application for asylum,and requested withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat,and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.the ij adjourned the hearing after granting stroni request to transfer venue to boston,massachusetts.
stroni ultimately presented documentary and testimonial evidence at two hearings before different ijs in boston.at the first hearing,held on january,stroni testified before ij thomas ragno.ij ragno continued the hearing after stroni testimony was concluded to allow the ins to verify information provided by stroni as to his entry date and use of passport aliases.a second hearing was held on february,more than a year later,before ij kenneth josephson.while acknowledging that ij ragno had taken testimony at the earlier hearing,ij josephson announced that he would hear the testimony again,explaining that he had not had an opportunity to listen to the tapes of the previous hearing.before testimony was begun,ij josephson noted for the record that the computer printout from the central indices showed no supporting documentation for stroni claim regarding the date and place he entered the united states.
briefly,stroni testified as follows 
stroni was an activist on behalf of the democratic party dp in albania,an organization that opposed the communist regime that had controlled albania for many years.although stroni himself was never a member of the dp,stroni father was a founding member and vice chairman of a local branch of the dp.the dp rose to power in but was defeated in by the socialist party,then dominated by a previous leader in the communist regime.
in october,stroni and his father were arrested at a dp rally where they were protesting the socialist party practice of firing dp supporters.while they were being held at the police station,stroni and his father were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the dp.stroni was released after one night,his father after three nights.
in march,a bomb was detonated outside stroni home,wounding stroni sister in the leg.although the incident was reported to the police,the police failed to do anything about the bombing.stroni believes that the family was targeted by unknown people for political reasons.
in or about november,stroni joined the azem hajdari,an organization named after a dp activist who was assassinated on september.stroni began paying dues to the azem hajdari in january,and he thereafter attended meetings once or twice a month.
on august,stroni and his father were once again arrested and taken to the police station.as before,they were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the democratic movement.they were released the next day.
on september,stroni was arrested the morning after a dp demonstration commemorating the second anniversary of azem hajdari death.stroni was released that same evening,after he was punched,kicked,and warned that he could suffer the same fate as azem hajdari.
on december,stroni was arrested for participating in protests in his hometown of ballish.during his detention,the police beat him,threatened him,and urinated on his face while holding his head.
after this latest arrest,stroni left ballish and went to live with his aunt in tirana for several months.he lived there without incident,staying mostly inside.in january,stroni father obtained an albanian passport for stroni from the very police department in ballish where he and stroni had been mistreated.stroni claimed that he was too afraid to get the passport himself.
stroni departed albania on march,passing through italy,belgium,and munich on his way to the united states.stroni arrived in chicago on march,using not his albanian passport but a fake italian passport issued in the name of carmello pezzotta.stroni disposed of his italian passport the day after he arrived in the united states.
by oral decision dated february,ij josephson ruled that stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he failed to satisfy his burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year after his entry into the united states.although stroni testified that he entered the united states on march,the ij specifically stated that he did not find stroni to be credible.the ij also noted that,in addition to stroni having failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his claimed entry date,the ins nonimmigrant information system inquiry failed to produce any supporting check for stroni claimed entry under the name of carmelo pezzotta.
ij josephson also denied stroni applications for withholding of removal and protection under cat,finding that stroni had utterly failed to demonstrate that he would be persecuted,more likely than not,if he were to return to albania.among other things,the ij cited the state department profile report,which described conditions in albania as follows 
the democratic party currently participates in most parliamentary activity.
despite opposition claims of massive voter disenfranchisement and other manipulations,nationwide local elections held in october of made clear and unmistakable progress towards meeting democratic standards 
all political parties have been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment even during the dark days of.there is no post communist tradition of retribution against political leaders and few instances thereof.
albania profile of asylum claims and country conditions,may.the ij also noted that,as to his father and other family members who continued not only to live in albania but also to openly support the democratic party,stroni made no claim that they had suffered anything more than insults since stroni departure from albania.finally,describing some of the many inconsistencies in stroni testimony,the ij simply concluded that stroni story about past and future persecution was not at all credible.
the bia adopted and affirmed the decision of ij josephson,stating additionally that it agreed with the ij finding that stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he both failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he timely filed his asylum application and also failed to establish extraordinary circumstances for such delay stroni failed to meet the heightene
