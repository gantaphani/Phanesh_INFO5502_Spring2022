opinion of the court 
this case presents the question of whether the pennsylvania steel products procurement act steel act.stat,is unconstitutional insofar as it prohibits the use of temporary bridges made out of foreign steel on public works projects.appellant mabey bridge shore,mabey appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on its claim that the steel act and the department of transportation interpretation thereof is preempted by the buy america act,as well as on its claims that the steel act violates the commerce clause,contract clause,and equal protection clause of the united states constitution.we will affirm.
in,the commonwealth of pennsylvania enacted the steel act,which requires that steel products used or supplied in the performance of a public works contract must be made in the united states.in particular,the act provides 
every public agency shall require that every contract document for the construction,reconstruction,alteration,repair,improvement or maintenance of public works contain a provision that,if any steel products are to be used or supplied in the performance of the contract,only steel products as herein defined shall be used or supplied in the performance of the contract or any subcontracts thereunder.
stat.a.the act defines the term steel products as p roducts rolled,formed,shaped,drawn,extruded,forged,cast,fabricated or otherwise similarly processed from steel made in the united states.id.emphasis supplied.public works is defined,in relevant part,as a ny structure,bridge,or other betterment,work or improvement whether of a permanent or temporary nature and whether for governmental or proprietary use.id.
the only statutory exception to the act requirement of steel made in the united states is where the head of the public agency,in writing,determines that steel products as herein defined are not produced in the united states in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the contract.id.b.a pennsylvania department of transportation penndot publication provides an additional exception in situations where the steel products are used as a construction tool and will not serve a permanent functional use in the project.pennsylvania department of transportation specifications,publication at change,effective april.
appellant mabey is a delaware corporation engaged in the business of supplying temporary steel bridges for construction projects these bridges are designed to handle traffic and pedestrians while a construction project is underway.mabey bridges are made of steel from the united kingdom.
mabey has supplied temporary bridges to contractors for use in public works projects,including penndot projects,for more than years.over that time,mabey estimates that it has provided temporary bridges for use on approximately fifty penndot projects.mabey asserts that its bridges have always performed to specification,and it provided documentation showing penndot considered it an approved temporary bridge fabricator.not until,however,did penndot raise the issue of whether mabey bridges were prohibited under the steel act.
in december,mabey provided a quote for a temporary bridge to a contractor for purposes of a bid on a penndot project.the contractor bid was accepted and it subcontracted with mabey to provide the bridge.the bridge specifications were submitted to a penndot engineer,and the engineer approved the bridge for use on the project.
on april,however,penndot notified the contractor that the steel act precluded the use of mabey temporary bridge on the project because the bridge is made of foreign steel.the following month,penndot chief bridge engineer sent an to all district engineers notifying them that foreign steel is not to be used for the construction of temporary bridges,and instructing them to review all projects that specify the use of a temporary bridge and incorporate a special provision codifying this requirement.likewise,on june,penndot sent a letter to the contractor concluding that a temporary bridge is itself a public work within the meaning of the steel act and thus its steel components must be manufactured in the united states and does not qualify for the exception for products used as a construction tool that will not serve a permanent functional use in the project.the letter concluded that t he use of the mabey bridge,to the extent it does not contain steel that is of domestic manufacture,seems ruled out by the act.because of these actions,mabey claims it has been forced to cancel four contracts for temporary bridges on penndot projects,and prevented from giving quotes to contractors for bids on future projects.
on july,mabey filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania against allen biehler,secretary of transportation for the commonwealth of pennsylvania.mabey sought a declaration that the steel act,as interpreted and enforced by penndot,is unconstitutional.mabey also requested a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining penndot from prohibiting the use of mabey temporary bridges on its projects.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment on all of mabey claims.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment,monroe beard,cir,and will affirm only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we exercise de novo review over the preemption question,farina nokia,cir,as well as over a district court interpretation of the constitution,blackhawk pennsylvania,cir.we will address each of mabey four constitutional claims in turn.
mabey primary contention on appeal is that the steel act is preempted by the buy america act,and related federal regulations.the doctrine of preemption is rooted in the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which declares that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.bruesewitz wyeth,cir.courts have recognized three different kinds of preemption express preemption,conflict preemption,and field preemption.elassaad independence air,cir.as we have explained 
express preemption requires that congress intent to preempt be explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.conflict preemption occurs when state law actually conflicts with federal law,such that it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.field preemption occurs when a field is reserved for federal regulation,leaving no room for state regulation,and congressional intent to supersede state laws is clear and manifest.
id.internal alteration,quotation marks,and citations omitted.in analyzing a potential conflict between federal and state law,we must be guided by the rule that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.deweese passenger,cir internal alteration and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,we consider the entire scheme of the federal statute and identify its purpose and intended effect.id.internal alteration and quotation marks omitted.
the buy america act provides that the secretary of transportation shall not obligate federal funds for highway and transit projects unless steel,iron,and manufactured products used in such project s are produced in the united states.a.in contrast to the steel act,the buy america act provides a more extensive set of exceptions to the domestic production requirement,providing that the statute provisions do not apply where the secretary finds that their application would be inconsistent with the public interest that such materials and products are not produced in the united states in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality or that inclusion of domestic material will increase the cost of the overall project contract by more than percent.id.b.the regulations also provide for a de minimis exception to the act,where the cost of the foreign steel or iron materials does not exceed certain benchmarks.b.
importantly,the regulations also contain a provision that indicates that the buy america requirements are satisfied when the project i ncludes no permanently incorporated steel or iron materials.id.b emphasis supplied.from this provision,mabey contends that,while its temporary bridges are prohibited under pennsylvania steel act,they are exempted from the domestic steel requirements of the federal law because they are not permanently incorporated in the underlying project mabey argues that the buy america act tempered and limited application of the domestic steel requirement,including its exception for temporary steel items,preempts the steel act more restrictive requirements.thus,the relevant question before us is whether the federal law provides only a floor minimum requirements which the states are free to exceed if they wish or whether the federal standards are intended to be uniform throughout the country,invalidating more restrictive state requirements.
we conclude that the buy america act demonstrates congress intent to allow states to enact more restrictive requirements related to the use of domestic steel and,thus,that the steel act is not preempted.in the same section that contains the domestic steel requirement,the buy america act also states 
the secretary of transportation shall not impose any limitation or condition on assistance provided under the surface transportation assistance act of stat or this title that restricts any state from imposing more stringent requirements than this section on the use of articles,materials,and supplies mined,produced,or manufactured in foreign countries in projects carried out with such assistance or restricts any recipient of such assistance from complying with such state imposed requirements.
d emphasis supplied.mabey argues that this section is inapplicable because it is only a restriction on the power of the secretary of transportation,not an affirmative grant of power to the states.appellant br.at.this argument,however,misses the point.the touchstone of the preemption analysis is whether congress intended to displace state law.the statutory language,far from demonstrating an intent to preempt state law,instead demonstrates that congress was aware that individual states may have more stringent requirements than the buy america act,and specifically instructed the secretary of transportation not to interfere with those requirements.such an instruction is tantamount to congressional authorization for more stringent state practices to continue.under such circumstances,there can be no preemption.see wyeth levine,d noting that the case for federal preemption is particularly weak where congress has demonstrated awareness of the operation of state law but has not acted.
mabey seeks to avoid the language of d by instead relying principally on the federal regulations implementing the buy america act,particularly b.that section provides that 
no requirement shall be imposed and no procedure shall be enforced by any state transportation department in connection with a project which may operate b to prohibit,restrict or otherwise discriminate against the use of articles or materials of foreign origin to any greater extent than is permissible under policies of the department of transportation as evidenced by requirements and procedures prescribed by the fhwa administrator to carry out such policies.
b emphasis supplied.mabey argues that this provision shows that federal law clearly prohibits states from imposing buy america requirements that are inconsistent with federal policy,including the policy of expressly exempting temporary bridges from the domestic steel requirements.appellant br.at.
mabey correctly points out that an agency regulation with the force of law can conflicting state requirements.levine,at.we are skeptical,however,as to whether a regulation can be used to support preemption in contravention of clear statutory language demonstrating congress intent not to preempt state law,such as that found in d.in any case,we find mabey reliance on the regulations unavailing.
whatever support b,standing alone,may provide for mabey argument,we can not view that regulation in isolation but,rather,must examine how it fits into the larger regulatory scheme.deweese,at a court must examine the entire scheme of the federal law at issue.of particular importance here is another regulation in the same subpart,entitled buy america requirements.that regulation provides 
b no highway construction project is to be authorized for advertisement or otherwise authorized to proceed unless at least one of the following requirements is met 
the project either i includes no permanently incorporated steel or iron materials,or ii if steel or iron materials are to be used,all manufacturing processes for these materials must occur in the united states or 
the state has standard contract provisions that require the use of domestic materials and products,including steel and iron materials,to the same or greater extent as the provisions set forth in this section.
id.b emphasis supplied.thus,echoing the buy america statute,b contemplates that states may have more stringent requirements regarding the use of domestic steel materials than the federal law,and explicitly allows these more stringent requirements to satisfy the federal buy america requirements.
we need not decide whether b and b conflict,or how they operate together in practice.to the extent there is any conflict between the two,explicitly provides that t he provisions of this section shall prevail and be given precedence over any requirements of this subpart which are contrary to this section,thus trumping the operation of b relied upon by mabey.id.a.even without the express precedence of,we note that the two regulations read in conjunction could,at best,be said to be ambiguous on the issue of more restrictive state requirements.an ambiguous regulatory scheme,however,can not demonstrate the clear congressional intent necessary to establish preemption of state law.
in sum,we conclude that the buy america act,together with b,demonstrate a federal legislative and regulatory scheme that takes into account concurrent state legislation in this area,and authorizes the states to impose more stringent requirements on the domestic manufacture of steel products.congress neither expressly preempted state law,nor exclusively occupied the field of regulation of domestic steel requirements in public works projects.furthermore,because congress contemplated more restrictive state regulations,we can not conclude that state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congressional objectives.the steel act is,therefore,not preempted by federal law.
mabey argues,next,that the steel act is unconstitutional under the dormant commerce clause.the commerce clause grants congress plenary authority to regulate commerce among the states,and has long been understood to have a negative aspect that denies the states the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.tri m group,llc sharp,cir quoting oregon waste,dep t of envtl.quality,d.a state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of local business or investment is per se invalid,unless it survives rigorous scrutiny.cloverland green spring dairies.milk mktg,cir.where,as here,a state law touches on the unique context of foreign commerce,the state power is further constrained because of the special need for federal uniformity.barclays bank plc franchise tax bd.of,d quoting wardair can.dep t of revenue,d.a state law is immune from attack under the commerce clause,however,if certain exceptions apply,including where the state is acting as a market participant rather than a market regulator,or where congress authorize s states to impose restrictions that the dormant commerce clause would otherwise forbid.tri m group,at.
