anthony araujo filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging that he was disciplined by new jersey transit rail operations,njt in retaliation for his participation in an activity protected by the federal rail safety act,frsa.specifically,araujo reported an emotional injury after he witnessed a fatal accident on february.the district court judge stanley chesler found that the discipline was not retaliatory and granted njt motion for summary judgment.see araujo new jersey transit rail operations,cv,wl.we will reverse the order of the district court and remand.
as this appeal arises from the grant of njt motion for summary judgment,we recount the facts contained in the record in the light most favorable to araujo,the party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
njt employs outside contractors to conduct repairs and maintenance work on bridges that pass over railroad tracks that are electrified by njt.they are primarily protected from overhead high voltage catenary wires by two njt linemen,and are protected from the movement of other trains on the tracks by a.prior to the february,accident,it was the practice of linemen not to talk to the njt about catenary outages.rather,linemen would brief the supervisor of the contractor crew about the extent of the electrical catenary outages.the supervisor of the contractor crew would then inform the that the catenary lines were.on the date of the accident,beaver construction company beaver construction,performed work rehabilitating bridges over an electrified njt track.the specific area of work was on track,in newark,new jersey.njt employed two linemen christopher picton and jeff meisner to the catenary and provide primary protection to the contractors.araujo was the.his primary responsibility was to protect contractors from oncoming trains.
the linemen told the beaver construction superintendent,nicholas gilman,that the beaver construction crew was supposed to work around track,near third street.the linemen did not brief araujo regarding the limits of the catenary outage,and araujo concedes that he was not aware of the extent of the catenary outage.rather,based on his experience as a,araujo assumed that the catenary was to the same extent as the track was put out of service for the repairs.he had received a bulletin document used by njt to describe track outage information which stated that the track was out of service for electrical trains between broad street and roseville avenue,an area which included seventh street,where the accident occurred.araujo,however,was mistaken in his assumption that the scope of the catenary was the same as the track outage.the catenary was not controlled by the bulletin order,but was controlled by another form the form and did not extend that far.
the beaver construction crew,accompanied by araujo,commenced its work at the third street area of track.after the crew completed its work,araujo believed that the construction crew was going to get off of the tracks at the bathgate avenue exit ramp,which is past seventh street.the two linemen,picton and meisner,did not remain with the construction crew,but rather moved to meet the beaver construction crew at bathgate avenue.rather than exiting,the beaver construction crew foreman,francis mcneil,asked superintendent gilman for permission for the crew to stop at seventh street to perform minor repairs.
according to araujo,who heard the conversation between mcneil and gilman,gilman told mcneil that he had the catenary,meaning that he had signed off on the catenary outage with the linemen.araujo understood this to mean that the catenary was at seventh street.according to araujo,linemen in practice communicated catenary outages to a by relaying the information through a construction crew foreman.thus,at this time,the construction crew,the foreman,and araujo were not aware that the catenary outage did not extend to seventh street.araujo was the only njt employee that was with the construction crew.the construction crew proceeded with repairs,and a construction crew member came in contact with the catenary.he was electrocuted,dying from his injuries,which araujo witnessed.
following the accident,njt superintendent joseph meade,who was araujo manager,questioned araujo at the site.he also interviewed others,who confirmed that araujo had not been briefed about the catenary outage.
the accident was a federal rail administration fra reportable incident,and both fra and njt rules and regulations required njt to conduct drug tests on any employee that it had reasonable cause to believe had committed rule violations that contributed in any way to the incident.on the evening of the incident,njt administered drug tests to two lineman picton and meisner who were responsible for protecting the contractors from catenary wires,but did not order a drug test for araujo.
the following day,araujo gave a taped statement about the incident to njt.there was no significant new information in that statement.araujo also went to njt employee assistance program eap to report symptoms that he was experiencing as a result of witnessing the accident.a njt counselor confirmed that he was medically unable to work due to a injury,and informed meade that araujo could not work.a medical condition that causes an employee to miss work had to be reported to the fra.
under the applicable labor relations agreement,njt had ten days from the date of the incident to give employees notice of a hearing and investigation h i into rule violations arising out of the incident.on march,meade drafted disciplinary charges against araujo,asserting a violation of tro rules.the tro rules require conductors to prohibit people under their protection from going near the catenary unless the conductor knows for certain that the catenary is.meade admitted during his deposition that,as of the evening of february,he was in possession of all of the information on which he based the tro rule violation charges against araujo.he testified,in part 
q so what was your basis for deciding to bring the charges what information,what facts did you rely on 
a the fact that the individual came in contact with the catenary wire showed that there was some question on whether araujo followed the rules as outlined in tro,and.
q you certainly knew that fact as of the afternoon of february,correct 
a we knew that the incident happened.we were fully advised of it,which is why we set up a hearing and investigation to bring all the facts together.
q well,my question to you is 
a this is not a guilty this is trying to get all the people involved together and ascertain the facts to see if indeed he did comply with those rules.
q well,why did you suspect or believe that he did comply with the rules what basis did you have to even believe that 
a because an individual was injured under his protection by coming in contact with the catenary.
q a fact that you knew on february,correct 
a.however,meade also testified that the fact that we charged araujo had nothing to do with the fact that we did drug test him,and stated that the decision to charge araujo was made after the initial interview on february,and required him to read the statements given by picton,meisner,and other witnesses.additionally,the record reflects that araujo was the only that was ever charged with a violation of tro rules during the five years prior to february.a.
on may,njt ceased paying araujo wages on the grounds that araujo injury was a recoverable injury under the federal employers liability act fela.on october,araujo was cleared to return to work from his injury,but he was suspended without pay while the charges were pending.a hearing was held and the adjudicating officer found that araujo violated the tro rules.as a result,araujo was assessed a suspension without pay.
araujo thereafter filed a complaint with the occupational safety health administration osha office of whistleblower protection,as required by the frsa.osha issued findings in favor of araujo,and ordered njt to pay in damages,to which njt objected pursuant to the frsa,araujo filed this suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey following discovery,njt filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to d and.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment.see mabey bridge shore,schoch,cir.this court can affirm a grant of summary judgment only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in making its determination,the court should view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.marzano computer sci,cir.
the purpose of the federal rail safety act frsa is to promote safety in every area of railroad operations.the frsa was substantially amended in to include measures.prior to the passage of the frsa,whistleblower retaliation complaints by railroad carrier employees were subject to mandatory dispute resolution pursuant to the railway labor act,et.see generally.congress passed the frsa amendment in,expanding the scope of the protections and providing enforcement authority with the department of labor under the newly amended frsa,a railroad carrier may not discharge,demote,suspend,reprimand,or in any other way discriminate against an employee if such discrimination is due,in whole or in part to the employee engagement in one of numerous protected activities.a.the protected activities are enumerated in the statute,and include notifying the railroad carrier of a personal injury or a illness.id.a.
the frsa incorporates by reference the rules and procedures applicable to wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century air whistleblower cases.id.d a.air sets forth a test.see id.b b i ii.since the frsa was amended to incorporate the air test in,no federal court of appeals has considered its application.
under air,an employee must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that she engaged in protected activity the employer knew that she engaged in the protected activity she suffered an unfavorable personnel action and the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action.allen admin.review,cir.once the plaintiff makes a showing that the protected activity was a contributing factor to the adverse employment action,the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence,that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.id.b b ii.the department of labor has promulgated regulations that adopt this standard to frsa complaints filed with the department of labor.see e.
in the past,we have found that if a statute does not provide for a scheme,mcdonnell douglas applies as the default framework see doyle united states sec y of labor,cir.this implies that when a framework other than mcdonnell douglas is present in a statute,congress specifically intended to alter any presumption that mcdonnell douglas is applicable.the frsa is clear that air applies.however,in this case,the district court noted that it was unable to locate any binding authority regarding,and discussed both mcdonnell douglas and the regulations promulgated by the department of labor,e,which implement the air framework.araujo,wl,at.
ultimately,the district court concluded that it did not need to determine whether mcdonnell douglas applied,or for that matter,whether the air framework is distinct from the mcdonnell douglas framework,as according to the district court,araujo could not satisfy his burden under either standard.we disagree with this approach.the district court apparently did not recognize that,in fact,the frsa explicitly incorporates the air by reference.see id.the parties have not presented any binding authority to the court concerning how to evaluate the viability of a frsa whistleblower claim,nor has the court own research uncovered any reported cases dealing with frsa retaliation claims.unquestionably,air applies to cases brought under the frsa.
it is necessary for us to interpret the frsa scheme.statutory analysis begins with the plain language of the statute,the language employed by congress.am.tobacco patterson,d quoting reiter sonotone,d internal quotations omitted.this court must give effect to the intent of congress by giving these words their ordinary meaning.id.internal quotation omitted.considering the plain meaning of the statute,frsa is much more protective of than the mcdonnell douglas framework.the need only show that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the retaliatory discharge or discrimination,not the sole or even predominant cause.see b b ii.in other words,a contributing factor is any factor,which alone or in combination with other factors,tends to affect in any way the outcome of the decision.ameristar airways,admin,cir quoting allen,at internal quotation omitted.
the term contributing factor is a term of art that has been elaborated upon in the context of other whistleblower statutes.the federal circuit noted the following in a whistleblower protection act case 
the words a contributing factor mean any factor which,alone or in connection with other factors,tends to affect in any way the outcome of the decision.this test is specifically intended to overrule existing case law,which requires a whistleblower to prove that his protected conduct was a significant,motivating,substantial,or predominant factor in a personnel action in order to overturn that action.
marano dep t of justice,quoting cong.rec.explanatory statement on emphasis added by federal circuit.furthermore,an employee need not demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited personnel action in order to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action.marano,at emphasis in original see also coppinger martin solis,cir a prima facie case does not require that the employee conclusively demonstrate the employer retaliatory motive.
once the employee asserts a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate,by clear and convincing evidence,that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.b b ii.the clear and convincing evidence standard is the intermediate burden of proof,in between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see addington texas,d.to meet the burden,the employer must show that the truth of its factual contentions are highly probable.colorado new mexico,d internal quotation omitted.
it is worth emphasizing that the air framework that is applicable to frsa cases is much easier for a plaintiff to satisfy than the mcdonnell douglas standard.as the eleventh circuit noted in a case under the energy reorganization act,a statute that uses a similar framework,f or employers,this is a tough standard,and not by accident.stone webster eng g herman,cir.the eleventh circuit stated that the standard is tough because congress intended for companies in the nuclear industry to face a difficult time defending themselves,due to a history of whistleblower harassment and retaliation in the industry.id.the frsa amendments must be similarly construed,due to the history surrounding their enactment.we note,for example,that the house committee on transportation and infrastructure held a hearing to examine allegations suggesting that railroad safety management programs sometimes either subtly or overtly intimidate employees from reporting.impact of railroad injury,accident,and discipline policies on the safety of america railroads hearings before the comm.on transportation and infrastructure,cong.as the majority staff of the committee on transportation and infrastructure noted to members of the committee 
the accuracy of rail safety databases has been heavily criticized in a number of government reports over the years.the primary issue identified in many previous government investigations is that the rail industry has a long history of underreporting incidents and accidents in compliance with federal regulations.the underrep
