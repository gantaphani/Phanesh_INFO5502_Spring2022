yanfen appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of an immigration judge ij to deny wang request for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition for review.
factual background 
wang is a native and citizen of the people republic of china.she was admitted to the united states in september as a,under a false identity,with authorization to remain in the united states for a temporary period not to exceed december.wang stayed beyond the date authorized,and on august,the department of homeland security served her with a notice to appear alleging removability under ina a b,because,after her admission as a,she remained in the united states for a time longer than permitted.
wang filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.she attached a declaration to the application claiming that she was persecuted in china for joining a secret family church of the christian faith.on or about february,wang updated her previously written statement with an amended statement and a declaration.
at her hearing,wang admitted to the allegations contained in the notice to appear and conceded the charge of removability.wang requested a mandarin interpreter,and one was provided.the hearing proceeded with wang as the only witness.she expressed no difficulty understanding the interpreter during her direct testimony when questioned by her own attorney.
wang testified that her birth name was yanfen wang,and she was married to tao ming.they had one child who still resided in china with ming.wang became a christian in may,but her husband and daughter remained buddhists.wang testified that she was persecuted in china because of her christian faith.
wang came to the united states on september.wang entered the united states under the identity of zhijun duan,a name she had used since june,according to a chinese passport bearing that name.wang possessed two other documents bearing the name zhijun duan,a visa issued by the state department,and a chinese resident identification card.these documents were found to be genuine after a dhs forensics examination.as proof of her true identity,wang submitted a notarized birth certificate,another chinese resident identification card bearing the name of yan fen wang,and a copy of a household registry from china.the identification card bearing the name of yan fen wang was also deemed to be genuine by a forensics examiner at the dhs.it did not contain a picture.
the ij noticed that the household registry stated that she had a second son and that the housemaster was wang yanfen.wang explained that the second son was actually her husband and that the household registration contained a mistake 
in may,after she became a christian,wang began attending church meetings every week.she would usually attend meetings with approximately twelve other people.her testimony was confusing about who these twelve people were and whether they were the same twelve people or varied she claimed not to know the names of the others attending the meetings.she stated that she knew them only as christian brothers and sisters.
wang hosted group meetings at her home,and she estimated that she did so between five and ten times.during,government counsel pointed out that wang most recent written statement mentioned only two meetings,in october and june.the ij stated that wang written statement and her testimony were inconsistent.wang explained that she did not write down the dates of all the meetings but wrote those two times as examples.she explained that she remembered those two meetings more dearly because october was the first meeting at her house and the meeting was when she was arrested.
wang testified that on june,she was holding a bible study meeting at her home when she and five or six fellow christians were arrested by the police.wang testified that she was incarcerated from june to,during which time she was interrogated and beaten daily.the police slapped her,pulled her hair,used knives to cut her arm,kicked her,and tied her wrists with wire.wang testified that she eventually confessed to organizing illegal meetings,passing out illegal propaganda,and disturbing the peace because they kept hitting her and she could not take it anymore.
during,government counsel observed that wang had testified that her wrists had been bound,but her declaration stated that her thumbs had been bound.wang stated that she meant to testify that her thumbs,not her wrists,had been bound.the interpreter explained that wang did not use the word wrist or thumb and that the interpreter may have used the word wrist based on hand motions by wang.
wang testified that she was released from custody so she could obtain medical treatment,but she was required to report back to the police every two weeks.wang provided two pages of brief medical records to document her medical treatment,one showing a date of june,the other undated she testified that she was unable to return to work because of her physical injuries,and she was eventually fired from her job because of her prior activities with her church.wang provided a notice,dated june,terminating her position due to her engagement in an evil religion organization in violation of the law.
wang testified that she first began using the name zhijun duan in june after she was released from prison,so she could escape from china.she explained that her pastor,jun chen,managed to obtain a genuine chinese resident identification card for her and a passport bearing the name zhijun duan.wang later used the passport to get a visa to the united states.
on august,wang went to singapore using the duan passport seeking asylum,but once there,she learned that she could not get asylum in singapore.however,she was not deported from singapore.wang reasons for returning to china were the subject of inconsistent testimony.she said that she returned so that she could report to the police as required by her conditions of release.she also said it was so she could join a group that was coming to the.when the ij challenged her on the inconsistency,wang explained that she did not hear the ij question clearly.she then repeated her original answer that her pastor told her to hurry back to china because she had to report to the police.the ij continued to question her,her counsel objected once to the allegedly confusing nature of the questioning,and the ij played back the tape of her testimony.wang then agreed that her pastor did tell her about the group when she spoke to him on the phone while in singapore.
wang counsel asked wang more questions about when she was in custody.he asked her to show him how the wire was used on her hands,and she put her hands together with her thumbs sticking out.he asked her where the police put the wire,and she said around the thumbs.wang testified that they never put wires around her wrists.her counsel asked if she had mentioned the word wrists earlier in her testimony,and she denied mentioning wrists,but she also said,it was mentioned but i misunderstood,i heard it wrong.wang counsel twice requested a new trial,claiming that the interpreter was not competently interpreting the questions and testimony.the ij overruled the motions and asked wang whether she was having any particular problems with the interpreter.wang indicated that she was not 
wang knew one person in the houston area,shusen sun,who had met her in china in through the hexi family church in tianjin,china.wang submitted his affidavit,but he did not testify live because he was working.
ii.the ij and bia decisions 
the ij found wang removable as charged and denied her applications for asylum,withholding and protection under the cat.the ij found that wang testimony was not plausible,believable or consistent enough to warrant a positive credibility finding.the ij characterized wang testimony as vague,hesitant and evasive.the ij stated that wang did not handle confrontation by the government on in a reasonable manner.the ij found that there were contradictions and discrepancies in her testimony,some minor,some significant.she also found wang testimony about her incarceration and beatings incredible due to wang lack of emotion that seemed to the ij more consistent with one who has rehearsed a story,rather than one who lived the events.
as an example,the ij found that the circumstances surrounding wang return to china from singapore were material,but that she did not provide a reasonable explanation for the contradiction in her testimony,and the explanation given was not plausible and not supported by the entirety of her testimony.the ij found inconsistencies surrounding wang testimony concerning her return to china from singapore in august.wang originally testified that she returned to china in order to report to the police,as she had been ordered to do after her alleged arrest and detention in june.she then changed her testimony,claiming that her pastor had encouraged her to return so she could join a tour group to the united states.she then testified that she did not learn about the tour group until after her return to china.the ij found that wang failed to provide a reasonable and plausible explanation for the contradiction.
the ij found,m ost importantly,that wang had not established her personal identity,a critical factor under b b i.the ij observed that wang passport,which she used to enter and exit china,and to obtain a visa from the united states embassy,as well as her personal identity card,were all issued under the name of zhijun duan and were found to be legitimate or otherwise genuine.the ij noted that wang claimed that her real name was yanfen wang,and that she had submitted several documents to prove her real identity,including a chinese identification card,a household registration,a marriage certificate,and a birth certificate.due to mistakes in these documents and their lack of credibility,the ij found that her personal identity was not established because she had failed to convince the court that she was in fact yanfen wang.the ij discounted the evidence from shusen sun,who attested in an affidavit that he knew wang as a member of the family church in china,because she did not call him to testify in person because he was working.
the ij stated that whenever wang was confronted with an inconsistency or contradiction,she blamed it on a misunderstanding of the interpreter.the ij observed that wang did not seem to have any problem with the interpreter while she was providing direct testimony.the ij noted that wang repeatedly confirmed that she had no problem understanding the interpreter.the ij stated that her testimony was vague and unspecific and conclusional as to certain important events if her life,in particular,her pattern of traveling outside of china and returning.
the ij noted that there was no evidence of any pro or official or entity in china having any interest in this respondent and that she had no difficulty living in china,or otherwise traveling freely in and out of china under her passport in the name of zhijun duan.accordingly,the ij found that she failed to demonstrate that she had a fear of persecution or would likely be tortured if returned to china.
wang appealed the decision of the ij to the bia.wang argued that the ij should have continued the hearing when it became apparent that there was a problem in the oral translation.she also argued that the ij credibility determination was not supported by the evidence and should be reversed because the evidence compelled a different conclusion.the bia adopted and affirmed the decision of the ij,stating given the immigration judge observation of the respondent demeanor and the respondent inconsistent and implausible testimony at the hearing regarding her identity and the secret family church she belonged to in china,we do not find the immigration judge adverse credibility finding to be clearly erroneous.wang filed a timely petition for review.
iii.standard of review 
background 
when considering a petition for review,this court has the authority to review only the bia decision,not the ij decision,unless the ij decision has some impact on the bia decision.mikhael ins,cir.however,this court may review the ij findings and conclusions if the bia adopts them.efe ashcroft,cir.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision based upon the reasons set forth therein,giving this court authority to review the ij decision.
on a petition for review of a bia decision,this court reviews factual findings for substantial evidence.chun ins,cir.under substantial evidence review,this court may not reverse the bia factual findings unless the evidence compels it.ins,d.the alien must show that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.id.
for many years we have stated that it is the factfinder duty to make determinations based on the credibility of the witnesses,and this court can not substitute its judgment for that of the bia or ij with respect to factual findings based on credibility determinations.chun,at.however,historically we have required that an adverse credibility determination still must be supported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.zhang gonzales,cir.we have previously stated that credibility determinations that are unsupported by the record and are based on pure speculation or conjecture will not be upheld,but if the ij credibility determinations are supported by the record,they will be affirmed.mwembie gonzales,cir.
reviewing credibility determinations under the real id act 
effective may,congress passed the real id act,which amended the standards for assessing credibility.see real id act a,c,h,stat.because wang filed her application in june of,after the effective date of the act,the new standards for evaluating witness credibility apply.we have not previously addressed in a published opinion how to apply those standards and whether this court review of an ij assessment of credibility under those standards should be different as a result.
under the act,an applicant testimony,alone,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that his testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.b b ii.in making its credibility determination,the trier of fact may consider 
the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor.
b b iii.under this new provision,our sister circuit has held that the ij may base an adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies without regard to whether they go to the heart of the applicant claim.lin mukasey,cir but see ndrecaj mukasey,cir citing to the new provision but continuing to rely on a heart of the claim analysis application appears to have been filed before the date of the act.
the new act does not expressly address appellate review of an ij adverse credibility determination.nonetheless,congress express rejection of the prior heart of the applicant claim standard demonstrates an intent to provide more discretion to the ij in determining credibility of witnesses,including the petitioner herself.
we have long employed a highly deferential review to assessments of credibility by factfinders.see,united states ford,cir addressing jury findings and concluding that this court is bound to accept a jury credibility determinations unless the challenged testimony is so unbelievable on its face that it defies physical laws.internal citations omitted.this deferential standard has been applied to credibility determinations by an ij even befor
