this appeal arises at the intersection of numerous areas of complex federal law.we are called upon to sift through this complexity in the hopes of adding clarity.for many years prior to this appeal,james price received occupational disability benefit payments under an employee benefit plan established and maintained in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa.price benefits were discontinued after the trustees amended the plan to limit the payment of occupational disability benefits to a period of two years.he then filed suit in federal district court,challenging the denial of his benefits and alleging that the plan amendment violated erisa because his occupational disability benefits had vested as a matter of law.the district court determined that price occupational disability benefits did indeed vest under this court line of cases and,accordingly,found that the amendment as applied to price violated erisa.the pension plan now appeals this determination,arguing that the benefits were not vested.after considering all of the relevant bodies of law,we conclude that the district court failed to apply the appropriate standard of review when analyzing price claim.accordingly,we vacate the district court opinion and order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts in this case are undisputed.the indiana state district counsel of laborers and hod carriers pension fund the fund is a employee benefit pension plan established and maintained in accordance with erisa.as required by erisa,the fund has a written pension plan document the plan,which sets forth the terms of the benefits provided by the fund.the plan indicates that fund participants must be union employees,working under various collective bargaining agreements.in addition,the plan also provides that the fund will be administered by a board of trustees the board.the board in turn possesses authority to make benefit determinations,interpret the plan,and amend the plan.in granting the board amendment power,section of the plan specifically states 
any amendment to the plan may be made retroactively by the majority action of the board of trustees present and voting in order to bring the plan in compliance with the act and any subsequent amendments thereto.it is the desire of the board of trustees to maintain the plan as a qualified plan and trust under code sections a and a.
the trustees who are present and voting may amend the plan by majority action.however,no amendment shall be made which results in reduced benefits for any participant whose rights have already become vested under the provisions of the plan on the date the amendment is made,except upon the advice and counsel of an enrolled actuary.
james price first began receiving disability benefits under the plan in,after a series of injuries left him unable to work.price benefits were initially approved under the plan total and permanent disability benefit category.in,the fund notified price that he no longer qualified for benefits under this category,but advised him that he could continue receiving benefits under article provisions for occupational disability benefit.at the time price began receiving occupational disability benefits,payment of those benefits was limited according to terms in set forth in section,which stated that t he occupational disability benefit shall be payable only during continued occupational disability and until early retirement age under section n.in,the board exercised its amendment authority under plan section and amended section.the amendment to state the following 
t he occupational disability benefit shall be payable only during a participant continued occupational disability and 
b effective for occupational disability benefits commencing prior to january,for a period not to exceed december,or,if earlier,the participant attainment of early retirement age 
because price began receiving occupational disability benefits prior to january,his benefits were discontinued after december,according to the amendment.
price appealed the discontinuation of his occupational disability benefits to the board,arguing that the amendment as applied to him violated erisa.the board denied price appeal and stated in a written letter to price attorney that occupational disability benefits could be amended under the terms of the plan.price then filed suit in federal district court under a b.his complaint alleged that the amendment violated erisa because it deprived him of a benefit that had vested as a matter of law.
after a short period of discovery,the parties for summary judgment.the district court granted judgment in favor of price under this court precedent in int l union,united,aerospace,agric.implement workers of am,cir.price bd.of trustees of the.laborer pension fund,et,at.according to the lower court,price occupational disability benefits vested under at the time he began receiving the benefits because the plan promised benefits until early retirement age.id.at.the district court read this provision as an indication that the parties intended the benefits to vest.id.in separate orders,the lower court ordered the fund to reinstate price benefits and pay price attorney fees.the board and the fund bring this appeal,challenging the district court determination that price occupational disability benefits vested and its award of attorney fees in favor of price.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.noe polyone,cir.s ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.schreiber philips display components,cir quoting.
we begin by noting that disability benefits are a benefit under erisa,and as such,erisa statutory vesting requirements do not apply.see robinson sheet metal workers pension fund,plan a,cir.when a benefit is exempt from erisa vesting requirements,no barrier exists to the modification or discontinuation of the benefit.schoonejongen.while erisa does not require vesting,the parties may nevertheless provide for vesting of welfare benefits through agreement.schreiber,at.if the parties intended for the benefits to vest and this agreement is breached,an erisa violation occurs.id.neither party in this case disputes that there is no express agreement providing for vesting of price occupational disability benefits.our inquiry does not end here,however,because while price benefits may not have vested under any express agreement,this court has long recognized that under certain circumstances an intent to vest can be inferred from specific language in the parties agreements.see,at.when these circumstances are present such that the inference exists,the benefit vests in favor of the recipient.accordingly,a unilateral decrease in these vested benefits would result in an erisa violation.the question for this case then becomes whether the inference is present here.
to answer this question properly,we trace sixth circuit case law creating the inference that the parties intended for benefits to vest.the inference first appears in this court seminal decision in indeed,the inference has been renamed in many of our cases simply as the inference.in creating the inference,this court addressed the specific question of whether retiree insurance benefits continue beyond the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement based upon the intent of the parties,at.to answer this question,we applied traditional rules of contract interpretation,consistent with federal labor law,and determined that the provision of the relevant collective bargaining agreement cba,which specifically provided for retiree benefits,was ambiguous as to whether the parties intended the benefits to vest.id.at.due to this ambiguity,we looked to extrinsic evidence,including durational provisions within the cba and the context of the bargaining process,and determined that the parties did in fact intend for the retiree benefits to vest.id.at.
subsequent to,this court has consistently applied its analysis to cases involving the issue of whether parties in the collective bargaining process intended for retiree benefits to vest according to the terms of the cba.we have specifically inferred this intent that benefits vest where an ambiguity exists in the retiree benefits section of the cba and where extrinsic evidence evinces the parties intention that the benefits vest.see,noe,at finding intent to vest where cba contained general durational clause,retiree benefits were tied to pension benefits,and promises in cba would be illusory without vesting yolton el paso.pipeline,cir finding intent to vest could be inferred where cba contained general durational clause maurer joy techs,cir finding intent to vest where durational clause of cba was general rather than specific int l union,united,aerospace,agric.implement workers of am.bvr liquidating,cir holding that district court should have considered terms of insurance agreement where cba was ambiguous as to intent to vest.price now seizes upon our reasoning in and its progeny and argues that the intent to vest can be inferred in this case.
admittedly contains many similarities to this case,which would make its application attractive.price occupational disability benefits are arguably similar in nature to the retiree health benefits at issue in.additionally,the plan in this case indicates that price was a union member,working under a cba.yet before we plunge perhaps finding a inference here,we pause to consider whether framework is even workable with the facts present.in considering this issue,we note that principled distinctions exist between this case and the line of cases.after careful consideration,we believe that these distinctions caution against applying set of rules in this context.
chief among these distinctions is that,unlike in,where the benefit at issue was a retiree health benefit,the benefit at issue here is an occupational disability benefit.our case law has not addressed whether the inference can be appropriately applied outside the context of retiree health benefits.this was a distinction that the district court apparently did not find significant.instead,that court reasoned that occupationally disabled was a status similar to the retiree status because both are open to their benefits being negotiated away by future bargaining parties.price,at.we are not persuaded that the occupationally disabled status and retiree status can be quite so easily analogized.and we again believe that own language makes that case difficult to apply outside the context of retiree health benefits.
to begin with,the court specifically recognized a uniqueness in the retiree status because retiree benefits are considered a form of delayed compensation or reward for past compensation.at.because these benefits are a form of delayed compensation,it is unlikely that the parties would leave them subject to future negotiations.thus,the court may properly infer that the parties intended for retiree benefits to vest.id.while this reasoning may hold true for retiree benefits,it resonates less in the context of disability benefits.specifically,occupational disability benefits generally can not be considered a form of delayed compensation.and,unlike retiree benefits where everyone meeting the requirement will realize the benefit,only a small portion of those meeting the requirement for occupational disability benefits will actually realize the benefit.thus,rather than representing a form of delayed compensation,disability benefits are more appropriately characterized as an uncertain potentially realized benefit.
moreover,notes a uniqueness in the retiree status because unions do not owe retired persons any obligation to bargain for their continued benefits.id.thus,teaches,it is more likely that the parties would intend the retiree benefits to vest to avoid the benefits being left to future negotiations.id.unlike this feature of retiree status,the occupationally disabled status does not necessarily leave itself open to unrepresented future negotiations.this status is not as likely to be a permanent status,as is the case with the retiree status,because an occupationally disabled person might expect to recover at some point and return to a position of union representation.a more fundamental issue related to the occupationally disabled status is whether a person in this status is still considered an employee for the purpose of union bargaining.the record in this case is silent as to whether price remained an employee for the purpose of union membership.however,it is likely that at least some persons in the occupationally disabled status would be union to the requirements imposed by federal law.specifically,the family medical leave act mandates that employers must provide an eligible employee with twelve workweeks of leave during a period if the leave is required due to a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.in addition,while the americans with disabilities act does not require employers to grant a specified amount of leave to disabled employees,this act does require employers to reasonably accommodate disabled employees,unless the employer demonstrates undue hardship.b a.also,this court has specifically noted that an employer might be required to provide an extended leave period as part of a reasonable accommodation.see cleveland fed.express,app x,cir holding that a question of fact existed as to whether six month leave was a reasonable accommodation.thus,it is possible that some disabled persons would never leave the confines of union bargaining.this possibility strongly cuts against applying the inference to this status 
our analysis leaves us convinced that framework can not be applied here.yet,our inquiry does not end there because the board argues that in the absence of,we should apply this court precedent in sprague general motors,cir en banc.in sprague,we evaluated whether retiree health benefits vested in favor of salaried,general motors employees.id.at.we ultimately held that when a benefit is unilaterally provided by an employer,the plan documents must contain a clear and express statement of intent to vest.id.at.because that language was lacking in sprague,the benefits did not vest.id.applying sprague to this case also presents an attractive solution.yet for many of the reasons stated above,we do not believe that sprague governs the outcome of this case either.the benefits at issue in sprague were specifically characterized as unilaterally offered benefits.id.at.here,however,the administrative record makes clear that price occupational disability benefits were and not unilaterally provided.again,we are not convinced that the factual distinctions in this case can so easily be dismissed.moreover,we believe that this case is properly understood under a different framework,one that does not include either or sprague.
if price occupational disability benefits do not vest under erisa statutory vesting requirements and the and sprague frameworks are inapplicable,then the only possible source for vesting of price benefits is the plan itself.section of the plan clearly gives the board authority to amend the plan.yet it also specifically prohibits any amendment which results in reduced benefits for any participant whose rights have already become vested under the provisions of the plan on the date the amendment is made,except upon the advice and counsel of an enrolled actuary.the issue then becomes whether price occupational disability benefits became vested within the meaning of the plan such that the amendment could not be applied to him.
at the outset,we pause to determine whether the board decision denying price appeal should be given any deference.the answer to this question lies in how the issue is framed.the district court reviewed the board decision de novo by framing the issue as whether the plan amendment violate d erisa.price,at.yet we have already determined that neither erisa nor provide for vesting in this case.moreover,price own complaint,filed following an appeal of the denial of his occupational disability benefits,was brought under a b,which allows for civil actions to recover benefits due to a claimant under the terms of his plan.when the issue is properly framed as whether price occupational disability benefits vested under the terms of this plan,then de novo review seems less appropriate.rather,the standard for reviewing an administrator determination on an individual claim for benefits seems most appropriate.
when an erisa benefits plan gives the administrator discretion in interpreting its terms or making benefits determinations,both this court and the district court review the administrator decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see kovach zurich am.ins,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,jones metro.life ins,cir wilkins baptist healthcare,f d,cir.under this standard of review,we must uphold the administrator decision if the administrator interpretation of the plan provisions is reasonable.kovach,at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.while federal case law has created confusion on the applicable standard of review applicable to cases involving vesting of welfare benefits,principles for interpreting erisa welfare plans are properly understood as aids to determining whether the denial of benefits by the administrator is reasonable,rather than as warrants for a court resolving interpretive disputes without any deference to the administrator exercise of interpretive discretion.marrs motorola,cir.
applying these mandates here,we conclude that,if the plan gives the board discretion to interpret its terms,the essence of this case turns on the reasonableness of the board decision.and,indeed,the plan does give such discretion,and that discretion was invoked by the board in terminating price benefits.section provides that t he board of trustees shall have the exclusive right and discretion to interpret the terms and provisions of the plan therefore,the board decision must be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,using principles as aids in undertaking this review,and looking to the terms of the plan to determine whether or not the board interpretation was reasonable.see marrs,at.
we pause briefly to note that,while agreeing that the arbitrary and capricious standard applies to review of price claim,our concurring colleague nonetheless suggests that price disability benefits became vested at the time they were awarded,regardless of the use of the terms of the plan or any intent inferred therefrom.in fact,our concurring colleague states that the subsequent amendment to the plan had no proper impact at all on price receipt of benefits.the concurrence claims that when the plan found price eligible for disability benefits,it effectively issued an iou that was a single and discrete event that was complete at the time the plan made the award decision.yet,our colleague provides no support for such assertions,either from the plan itself or from the controlling statutory or case law contrary to the claims in the concurrence,review of the board decision necessarily entails looking to the terms of the plan to determine if price disability benefits vested,as it is the plan itself that sets forth the terms by which benefits are conferred,vested,or terminated 
in reviewing the terms of the plan,it would be tempting to find that the language of the plan indicates an intent to vest because the plan provides that amendments may not reduce benefits that have become vested in section.however,an analysis of the context in which the word is used shows that it applies to retiree benefits and not disability benefits.article,which governs occupational disability benefits,does not use the term vested or accrued to refer to or to modify the term occupational disability benefit.nor does it provide any other vesting provisions for disability benefits.thus,one must look to other sections of the plan for a definition of vesting,since the plan does not expressly provide one.the closest the plan gets to a definition of vesting is section,titled vesting schedule,which states that a participant who begins benefit payments on or after june,shall be vested in his accrued benefit this section then points to the term accrued benefit,which is defined in section a as the monthly benefit that has been earned by a participant for the years of service he worked for an employer according to the benefit formula described in section hereof.moving to section,which is titled amount of normal retirement benefit,this section provides a detailed formula for calculating a participant monthly normal retirement benefit.specifically,normal retirement benefits are calculated using the sum of a participant past credited service benefit and his future credited service benefit.the future credited service benefit provision provides differing formulations depending on the participant retirement date,and the past credited service benefit specifically references the retired status.
reading all of these provisions together,it would not seem unreasonable for the board to determine that price occupational disability benefits were not accrued benefits and therefore did not vest.as noted above,article,which covers occupational disability benefits,does not contain specific vesting language.nor do sections,a,or contain language including the occupational disability benefit within the meaning of vested or accrued benefit.instead,section specifically refers to the retired status and provides amounts based on retirement dates 
price nevertheless argues that his benefits vested under section because that section provides that t he occupational disability benefit shall be a monthly benefit equal to percent of the participant vested accrued benefit,unreduced for early payment.although price alternate interpretation of section could be plausible,that would not render the board interpretation unreasonable.further,price interpretation does not seem to be the most logical reading of that section.the term vested modifies the phrase accrued benefit,and the definition of accrued benefit in sections a and does not contain any language indicating that occupational disability benefits are accrued benefits.to adopt price reading of section would seemingly rewrite that section to state that the vested occupational disability benefit or would insert the term occupational disability benefit within the definition of accrued benefit.a more logical reading of section would seem to be that rather than providing a vested right to occupational disability benefits,section merely provides a formula for calculating the benefit amount.
the district court,however,did not review the board determination under the arbitrary and capricious standard,and neither party addressed the issue using the proper standard of review in the district court or before this court.accordingly,we believe that the matter must be remanded to the district court.there,the parties will have the opportunity to brief the issue with the correct standard in mind and the district court may properly review the board decision regarding the interpretation of the terms of the plan and the resulting termination of price benefits using the arbitrary and capricious standard additionally,because we vacate the district court judgment in favor of price,the award of attorney fees in favor of price is no longer appropriate.see sec y of dep t of labor king,cir stating the factors for determining fee awards in erisa cases.accordingly,we vacate this decision as well.
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
