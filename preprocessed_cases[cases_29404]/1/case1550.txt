background 
attended hisd as a student from until he withdrew from the district in january.in,teacher noticed that he had trouble completing work and following directions.he was not tested for special education while in and was advanced to kindergarten.in kindergarten,he was still unable to complete his work,mother,wanted him to have special education testing.a substitute teacher for kindergarten class recommended special education testing,but the school counselor agreed only to conduct a speech therapy evaluation.when regular teacher returned,she had no trouble understanding speech.the school officials decided not to test,but they failed to inform his mother of the decision.
despite warning that might have to repeat kindergarten,his teacher promoted him to the first grade.she believed there would be more testing and special education opportunities for in the first grade.the school had a practice of waiting until the first grade to test children for special education,in order to give them a chance to develop.
in first grade,immediately misbehaved and performed below grade level.his teacher referred him for special education testing.was removed from class to help him do his work.eventually,had to sit with her son during class.a private speech pathologist who had been treating since kindergarten wrote to the school to express concern about problems.in october,two months into the school year,the intervention assistance team iat first met to consider needs and decided that a special education evaluation was premature because his teacher had not sufficiently documented problems.the iat reached the same conclusion again on december.wrote several letters to the school requesting that be tested.the school evaluation specialist collected updated documentation from teacher and a psychologist and submitted the documents to a committee of evaluation specialists,which ultimately determines whether a student behavior warrants a special education referral.the iat met before christmas but delayed referral until after the holidays.on january,before any testing had occurred,withdrew from the hisd.entered the conroe independent school district where he was immediately recommended for special education testing.
filed an idea claim with the texas education agency,which held a due process hearing in april.a special hearing officer determined that hisd violated idea by failing to refer to an eligibility screening in october.during the proceeding,requested that hisd fully test suspected disabilities,but the hearing officer ruled this claim moot because had left hisd and was already being tested for special education in the other district.the hearing officer rejected for insufficient proof the medical expenses allegedly incurred on behalf and concluded that monetary damages were unavailable under idea.
appealed the administrative decision to the district court,requesting declaratory relief,compensatory and punitive damages.asserted claims under idea,ada,the age discrimination act,the texas and united states constitutions,and.in a comprehensive and thoughtful opinion,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.the district court held that the plaintiff idea claim for compensatory damages was not moot,but it affirmed the hearing officer findings that the plaintiff lacked any evidence to support claims for compensatory relief.the court rejected liability under the ada and because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the school actions were motivated by bad faith or gross misjudgment.the district court dismissed the plaintiff age discrimination act claim for failure to exhaust the proper administrative remedies.the district court concluded that can not be used as an additional vehicle to redress violations of the ada,or the idea.the plaintiff constitutional claims were also dismissed.has appealed,contending that genuine issues of material fact exist concerning the district liability and that the district court applied incorrect legal standards when interpreting the statutes.
the district court grant of summary judgment on the claims is reviewed de novo.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the evidence and all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see bridgmon array,cir.

he was excluded from participation in,denied the benefits of,and subject to discrimination at school included,but not limited to being excluded from the classroom activities,learning,work assignments and lunch,being denied the benefits of receiving special education testing,speech testing,speech therapy,special education and free appropriate public education,and being subject to discrimination regarding his disability,race and age.
the district court,he asserts,erroneously heightened the standard for a district liability under.because this court has equated liability standards under and the ada,we evaluate claims under the statutes together.hainze richards,cir pace bogalusa city sch,cir en banc.
a student may assert claims under idea as well as and the ada.marvin austin indep.sch,cir.this court and others have explained that while idea imposes an affirmative obligation on states to assure disabled children a free appropriate public education,see,l,and the ada broadly prohibit discrimination against disabled persons in federally assisted programs or activities.see a see also sellers sch.bd.of manassas,cir pace,at.a web of procedural regulations,including the child find mandate applicable here governs the school district identification,assessment and treatment plans for disabled students.the regulations seek to maximize educational professionals coordination and collaboration with the parents.substantively,idea aims to provide an adequate educational opportunity,not necessarily the maximization of a disabled child abilities,and it leaves considerable discretion in the hands of professionals.see monahan nebraska,cir bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley.interpreting eahca,the statutory predecessor to idea.
exactly what remedies remain under and the ada for children whose parents are dissatisfied with the school determinations under idea are unclear.this court applies issue preclusion where the legal standards underlying such claims are not significantly different.see pace,at.in reaching this conclusion,pace cited favorably an eighth circuit decision that applied claim and issue preclusion to redundant claims when idea administrative process produces an administrative decision that is upheld on judicial review.sch.dist,cir.thus,the resolution of an idea claim in the school district favor will frequently preclude parents resort to redundant claims under and ada.
further constraining the viability of claims under the disability laws is this court rule that 
a cause of action is stated under when it is alleged that a school district has refused to provide reasonable accommodations for the handicapped plaintiff to receive the full benefits of the school program.
