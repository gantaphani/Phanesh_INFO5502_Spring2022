this is an appeal from an adverse opinion and judgment of an majority the majority of a splintered united states tax court the the taxpayers seek reversal of the majority holdings,which the taxpayers accurately characterize as 
the aggregate fair market value of the taxpayers donated interests in a family limited partnership,mccord interests,mil was instead of the substantially lesser value of claimed by the taxpayers on their returns.
the taxpayers charitable deductions under of the internal revenue code of for gifts to one of two organizations collectively,exempt donees must be calculated not on the basis of the plain language of the act of gift assignment agreement of january,but on the tax court own gloss thereon and its determination of the various percentage interests in mil months after the agreed on and accepted by all donees but not by taxpayers in a sharing arrangement the confirmation agreement entered into in march of.
the taxable value of the gifts made by the taxpayers to a their four sons individually the sons and b generation skipping tax trusts gst trusts of which the sons were trustees collectively,the donees must be calculated not only on the basis of the tax court independently determined fair market value and the percentage interests in mil of the residuary exempt donee,but also without a reduction in fair market value of the gifts to the donees for the actuarially determined liability,assumed by such donees contemporaneously with the gifts,for any additional estate taxes that might be incurred under and,in the case of mccord,that were incurred if either or both of the taxpayers should die within three years following the date of the within that period being a condition subsequent that would terminate the donors and thus the donees present obligations to pay any and all eventual estate taxes.
for the reasons explained below,we reverse the tax court and remand this case to it with instructions to enter judgment for the taxpayers consistent with this opinion.
facts proceedings 
background 
with the exception of the ultimate fact question of the taxable and deductible values of the limited partnership interests in mil that comprise the completed,irrevocable inter vivos donations the gifts made by the taxpayers to the exempt and donees on january,the discrete facts framing this case are largely stipulated or otherwise undisputed.having lived in shreveport,louisiana for most of their adult lives,and having accumulated substantial and diversified assets,these octogenarian taxpayers embarked on a course of comprehensive family wealth preservation and philanthropic support planning,including transfer tax aspects of implementing such a plan.this was done in consultation with specialists in that field.
effective june,the taxpayers had joined with the sons and an existing ordinary partnership mccord formed and owned equally by the sons to create mil,a texas limited partnership.in creating mil,each taxpayer had contributed for which each had received of the class a limited partnership interest in mil each son had contributed for which he had received of the general partnership interest in mil each taxpayer had contributed identical interests in substantial business and investment assets valued at per taxpayer for which each taxpayer had received equal portions but less than all of the class b limited partnership interest in mil,representing in the aggregate just over per cent of the value of that partnership and mccord had contributed interests in similar business and investment assets valued at,for which it had received the remaining class b limited partnership interest in mil,representing roughly per cent of the value of that partnership as a result,mil was initially owned as follows 
as found by the majority,mil partnership agreement the partnership agreement provides,inter alia 
mil will continue in existence until december,the termination date,unless sooner terminated in accordance with applicable terms of the partnership agreement.
any class b limited partner may withdraw from mil prior to its termination date and receive payment equal to the fair market value as determined under the partnership agreement of such partner class b limited partnership interest the put right.
partners may freely assign their partnership interests to or for the benefit of certain family members and charitable organizations permitted assignee.
a partner desiring to assign his interest to someone other than a permitted assignee must first offer that interest to mil and all other partners and assignees,who have the right to purchase such interest at fair market value as determined under the partnership agreement.
the term partnership interest means the interest in the partnership representing any partner right to receive distributions from the partnership and to receive allocations of partnership profit and loss.
regardless of the identity of the assignee,no assignee of a partnership interest can attain the legal status of partner in mil without the unanimous consent of all mil partners.
mil may purchase the interest of any exempt donee,a permitted assignee of a partnership interest that is a charitable organization that has not been admitted as a partner of mil at any time for fair market value,as determined under the partnership agreement the call right.
for purposes of the partnership agreement,a class b limited partner put right is disregarded for purposes of determining the fair market value of such partner class b limited partnership interest,and any dispute with respect to the fair market value of any interest in mil is to be resolved by arbitration as provided in exhibit g attached to the partnership agreement.
limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the partnership affairs.however,limited partners do have veto power with respect to certain major decisions,most notably relating to voluntary bankruptcy filings in addition,if any two of the sons are not serving as managing partners,class b limited partners have voting rights with respect to certain large dollar managerial decisions.limited partners also have access to certain partnership financial information 
mil partnership agreement was amended and restated in october,prospectively effective november.twenty days after the effective date of this act,taxpayers,as owners of all class a limited partnership interests in mil,donated these interests to the southfield school foundation the foundation,a c tax exempt organization.all original mil,class a limited,and class b an assignment of partnership interests and addendum agreement the southfield agreement to implement this gift.the southfield agreement declares that all of the partners of mil desire that the foundation become a class a limited partner of mil upon execution of this assignment of partnership interest and that all consents required to effect the conveyance of the assigned partnership interest and the admission of assignee as a class a limited partner of mil have been duly obtained evidenced by the signatures hereto.after executing the southfield agreement,the taxpayers were left with only their class b limited partnership interests in mil.the donation to the foundation is not at issue in this litigation we discuss it only to note differences in its details from those of the assignment agreement,which was used to effectuate the taxpayers donations of class b interests in mil to the exempt and donees.
on january,through a combination of simultaneous taxable gifts to the donees and gifts to the exempt donees,the taxpayers irrevocably disposed of all their class b limited partnership interests in mil,retaining no interest whatsoever in the partnership.they did this by joining with all donees and two new exempt donees,namely,the community foundation of texas,cft,and the shreveport symphony,the symphony,in the execution of the assignment agreement.in it,the taxpayers transferred all of their class b limited partnership interests in mil to the exempt and donees in varying portions,expressly relinquishing all dominion and control over the partnership interests thus assigned and transferred.the assignment agreement differs from the southfield agreement in that it does not contain parallel language admitting the new donees as partners,and two of the limited partners of and the not join in the execution of the assignment agreement in any capacity.
at the heart of this case lies the question of the value of the class b limited partnership interests in mil thus transferred by the taxpayers to the exempt and donees via the assignment agreement of january.we have observed that these gifts divested the taxpayers of their entire interest in mil then remaining.it did so,however,not in percentages of interest in mil,however,but in dollar amounts of the net fair market value of mil,according to a sequentially structured defined value clause 
all gifts were complete on execution of the assignment agreement on january.no other or oral,express or found to have existed between the taxpayers and the sons,the gst trusts,the symphony,or cft,as to what putative percentage interest in mil belonged to,or might eventually be received by,any of the donees under the formula clause.rather,because the interests donated by the taxpayers to the gst trusts,the sons,and the symphony were expressed in dollars,fair market value is defined in the assignment agreement in terms of the applicable test specified in the applicable treasury regulation 
as reflected in the allocation provisions of the assignment agreement,the taxpayers conditioned their gifts to the donees on the presently binding assumption by those donees of responsibility for payment of any and all federal and state gift taxes resulting from the taxable gifts of january.in addition,those donees assumed responsibility for the future payment of only those federal estate taxes that would be assessed on the amount of taxpayers gift taxes pursuant to,unless the condition subsequent expressed in that section should occur,unless the taxpayer in question should survive for three years following the completion of the gift 
on february,frazier completed his appraisal of the various classes of the partnership interest in mil as of the january,date of the gifts.he determined that the value on that date had been for each one per cent of class b limited partnership interest in the hands of a donee immediately following completion of the gifts.
in march,all donees entered into the confirmation agreement,based on that appraisal.in essence,the confirmation agreement translated the dollar value of each gift made under the assignment agreement defined value formula into percentages of interests in mil,as follows 
the taxpayers,who two months earlier had divested themselves of all interest in mil,were not parties to the confirmation agreement or otherwise involved in it.neither did the assignment agreement call for,either expressly or impliedly,specify any method or manner that the donees must or were expected to employ in determining how to equate their respective gifts to percentages of interest in mil moreover,each donee was represented by independent counsel and each had the express right to review the frazier appraisal before entering into the confirmation agreement.in addition,any exempt donee that might question or disagree with the frazier appraisal had the right to retain its own appraiser and,if still dissatisfied,to resolve questions of value and allocation of interests in mil through binding arbitration.
cft elected to retain outside counsel who,in consultation with cft president and its director of development both of whom were lawyers with extensive experience in reviewing appraisals of interests,independently analyzed the frazier appraisal in light of the circumstances.cft subsequently accepted the frazier appraisal.although cft did not retain an independent appraiser,its officers and outside counsel expressed confidence in frazier and his firm,found his methodology appropriate,and concluded that the value of cft percentage interest in mil proposed in the confirmation agreement was an acceptable reflection of the dollar value of the interest in mil that cft had received from the taxpayers in january.neither the majority opinion nor any of the four other opinions filed in the tax court found evidence of any so much as an implicit,the taxpayers and any of the donees to the effect that any exempt donee was expected to,or in fact would,accept a percentage interest in mil with a value less than the full dollar amount that the taxpayers had given to such a donee two months earlier 
late in june of,approximately three months after all donees had entered into the confirmation agreement,mil exercised its call right under the assignment agreement to redeem the exempt donees interests in mil.even though only months had elapsed since the january gifts had been appraised,mil contracted with frazier to update his original appraisal as of june,to determine the fair market value of the interests to be redeemed.after that updated appraisal was completed,mil,the symphony,and cft reviewed it and agreed to accept its figure of as the fair market value of each one per cent interest in mil to be redeemed.this in turn produced slightly increased redemption prices of for the symphony per cent interest originally and for cft per cent interest originally.none of the opinions filed in this case contends that the taxpayers had anything at all to do with mil exercise of the call right or with the redemption prices paid by mil to the symphony and cft for these interests 
taxation of gifts 
in,the taxpayers timely filed federal gift tax returns for calendar year,reflecting the aggregate values of their january,gifts as and,respectively.these taxable values before adjustment for annual exclusions of per taxpayer and charitable contribution deductions of per taxpayer were determined on the basis of the frazier appraisal for that date,in which the gross fair market value of the respective gifts were reduced by,among other things,total federal gift taxes payable by the taxpayers on their gifts to the donees,payment of which was assumed by these donees,and the actuarially determined present value of the donees contractually assumed liability for the additional estate taxes that would be incurred pursuant to the current version of and the estate tax rates,should the triggering condition subsequent of the subject tax code provision occur,should either or both of the taxpayers fail to survive for three years after january,
deficiency 
the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner issued deficiency notices on taxpayers gift taxes in amounts of and,respectively.these amounts resulted from the commissioner proposed increases in the values of taxable gifts for of and,respectively.the commissioner based these asserted increases on his contentions that the taxpayers had understated the fair market value of the donated interests in mil,and erred in discounting the fair market value of those interests by the,actuarially calculated present value of the donees assumed obligations for additional estate taxes under.the commissioner fair market value of a interest in mil was,almost double the taxpayers figure of.
proceedings 
shortly after these notices of deficiency were issued,the taxpayers filed a petition in the tax court contesting the commissioner proposed deficiencies.the case was tried several months later before judge maurice foley,largely on a joint stipulation of facts filed on the day of trial.the principal contested matters were those raised by the commissioner in his deficiency notices the values of the taxpayers interest in mil given under the formula clause to the exempt and donees on january,and the propriety of discounting the gross fair market value of the gifts to the donees on the basis of the actuarially determined negative present value of these donees assumed liability for additional estate taxes of the taxpayer or taxpayers who might die within three years following the gifts.in their joint stipulations,the parties agreed that the commissioner had the burden of proof pursuant to.the majority expressly accepted that evidentiary standard 
in the trial before judge foley,the main thrust of the commissioner attack was grounded in the equitable doctrines of and.the commissioner did not advance an argument about the way that the assignment agreement should be interpreted or about the role of the confirmation agreement,if any,in determining fair market value.rather,he asked the court to disregard the plain wording of the assignment agreement,as well as the undisputed facts of the relationships among the parties and their actions one both taken and not to decide the case on one or both of these doctrinaire principles judge foley determined the outcome of the case on the stipulated evidentiary standard,holding that the commissioner had failed to meet his burden of proof on any contested issue of fact or law and therefore could not prevail.
approximately two years after that trial,the acting chief judge of the tax court issued an unusual order that resulted in a proceeding that resembles an en banc rehearing.in essence,the case was taken away from judge foley retroactively and reassigned to judge james halpern who,on the same day,filed an opinion on behalf of the majority.he was joined by seven other tax court judges,including the acting chief judge.the majority disagreed with judge foley original opinion,which had turned on the commissioner failure to meet his burden of proof,and held instead for the commissioner.
the majority holdings for the commissioner were not,however,based on any of the overarching equitable doctrines that the commissioner had advanced at trial.instead,the majority crafted its own interpretation of the assignment agreement and gave controlling effect to the confirmation agreement,all based entirely on a theory that the commissioner had never espoused.at the core of the novel methodology thus conceived and implemented,sua sponte,by the majority is the consistently rejected concept of postponed determination of the taxable value of a completed here until,two months after the taxpayers gifts were completed,the donees decided among themselves with neither actual nor implied participation of or suasion by the donors how they would equate the of interest in mil given to them on january,with percentages of interests in mil decided two months later by the donees in the confirmation agreement.stated differently,the majority in essence suspended the valuation date of the property that the taxpayers donated in january until the date in march on which the disparate donees acted,post hoc,to agree among themselves on the class b limited partnership percentages that each would accept as equivalents of the dollar values irrevocably and unconditionally given by the taxpayers months earlier.as shall be seen,we hold that the majority unique methodology violated the immutable maxim that occurrences do not affect,and may not be considered in,the appraisal and valuation processes.
the taxpayers timely filed their notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the complex appellate review required in this gift tax case implicates the interpretation and effect of contractual agreements,the nature of property interests transferred by gift,determination of the fair market value of such interests,and special law rules governing that kind of evaluation exercise,including the types and percentages of discounts that may be applied.thus,our standard of review here can not be covered adequately by rotely reciting the ubiquitous mantra that we review factual determinations for clear error and legal determinations de novo.the particularized standard of review applicable in this case is accurately stated in the taxpayers appellate brief 
an appellate court reviews a trial court conclusions of law de novo and draws its own conclusions in place of those of the trial court.see american home assurance unitramp,cir estate of dunn commissioner,cir.where a question of fact,such as valuation,requires legal conclusions,this court reviews those underlying legal conclusions de novo.see adams united states,cir.the determination of the nature of the property rights transferred is a question of state law that this court reviews de novo.id.holding valuation subject to de novo review because to arrive at a reasonable conclusion regarding the value of the transferred property,one must first determine the rights afforded to the owner recipient of such property by the applicable state law.the majority opinion failure to properly define the nature of the property rights transferred under the formula in the assignment agreement and its rejection of the taxpayers reduction of the value of the interests transferred by the value of the donees contractual obligation to pay estate tax liability are questions of law subject to de novo review by this court.id.inasmuch as the trial court ultimate finding here is predicated on a legal conclusion regarding the rights inherent in the property,its valuation is subject to de novo review.if this court ignores the assignment agreement and determines that the interest to be valued are those set forth in the confirmation agreement the tax court factual findings in the determination of the fair market value of the interests transferred are reviewed for clear error.see mcingvale commissioner,cir.
burden of proof 
as we noted above,the parties stipulated and the tax court accepted for purposes of this case that,pursuant to,the commissioner had the burden of proof.we review this case on appeal accordingly.
commissioner theory on appeal.
at the outset,we reiterate that,although the commissioner relied on several theories before the tax court,including doctrines of,policy,and,possibly,he has not advanced any of those theories on appeal.accordingly,the commissioner has waived them and has his efforts on appeal solely to supporting the methodology and holdings of the majority,as succinctly summarized in the taxpayers appellate brief 
t he majority held that the interests transferred by the assignment agreement of january,were assignee interests in mil the majority was not required to follow the terms of the assignment agreement in determining the fair market value of the interests in the partnership transferred by the taxpayers the fair market value of the total interests transferred was,or per interest the value of the interests transferred should be based on the value determined by the majority on a per unit basis times the percentage interests determined by the donees in a confirmation agreement reached by the donees two months after the gifts were made and the value of the donees contractual obligation to pay estate tax liability under could not be deducted in determining the value of the taxpayers gift 
we address each of these holdings,albeit in a different sequence.
nature of rights assigned 
we gather that,in arguing at trial that some of the discounts employed by the taxpayers expert in valuing the interests donated were erroneous or inapplicable,the commissioner specifically opposed a discount grounded in frazier contention that the taxpayers had transferred less than full limited partners interests.the commissioner does not,however,advance such a contention on appeal so it too is waived,and we do not address that issue our failure to address it should not,however,be viewed as either agreeing or disagreeing with the majority determination on this point.rather,as shall be shown,we have no need to reach it.
fair market value of interests in mil transferred by the taxpayers 
contributing to the framework of our review in this section is the sometimes overlooked fact that this case is not an estate tax case,but a gift tax case.thus,the aggressive and sophisticated estate planning embodied here is not typical of the estate plans that have produced the vast majority of estate tax valuation cases also helping to frame our review is the fact that this is not a fair market value gift tax case.rather,as recognized by the majority and by judges chiechi and foley in dissent,the feature that most fractionated the tax court here is the taxpayers use of the,or defined value,clause specified in the assignment agreement the gift instrument,not either the original or the amended partnership agreement nor the confirmation agreement to quantify the gifts to the various donees in dollars rather than in percentages,the latter being more commonly encountered in gifts and bequests that parcel out interests in such assets as corporate stock,partnerships,large tracts of land,and the like.
fair market value must be determined on date of gift.
as detailed above,the taxpayers irrevocably and gratuitously donated their entire remaining interests in mil,constituting in the aggregate per cent of that partnership.they did so on january,by executing the assignment agreement,which specified in dollars the quantum of all gifts of interests in mil,except for the one to cft which was a residual donation of whatever interest all other gifts had been satisfied.frazier appraised the fair market value of the interests given at per one per cent for the taxpayers entire remaining interests in mil and the taxpayers filed gift tax returns calculated on these values.
the commissioner deficiency notices were based on a total value of the interest given,before adjustments,of,almost double the frazier values used by the taxpayers in preparing their gift tax returns.the commissioner calculated his asserted total value by using as the value of a interest in mil.
the commissioner introduced the expert opinion of mukesh bajaj.this expert bottom line was that the fair market value of a interest in mil on the date of the gift was,producing a total fair market value of.thus,the commissioner own expert calculated the aggregate fair market value of all gifts to be less than the value asserted by the commissioner in his deficiency notices.even though bajaj disagreed with the values returned by the taxpayers,he also disagreed substantially with the values asserted by the commissioner in his delinquency notices 
the taxpayers adduced the testimony of frazier and the documentary evidence he offered in support of his opinion,reiterating in detail his appraisal methodology and his conclusion that was indeed the fair market value of one per cent of the interests donated by the taxpayers as of january.the taxpayers thereby provided the evidentiary underpinning of their proffered values.
fast forward two years judge foley judgment for the taxpayers based on the commissioner failure to meet his burden of proof is vacated and replaced by the majority.the majority opinion substantively treats neither the nature of the commissioner burden of proof nor whether he met it.instead,the majority confects its own methodology grounded in significant part in the donees confirmation agreement.the majority first proceeds independently to appraise the donated property,eventually reaching a value precisely halfway between those of frazier and bajaj as we hereafter hold,as a matter of law,that the methodology employed by the majority in determining the taxable and values of the various donations constitutes legal error,the results of the majority independent appraisal of the donated interests in mil and their values for gift tax purposes become irrelevant to the amount of the gift taxes owed by the taxpayers 
values of gifts based on acts of donees.
under the instant circumstances,the fact is at most a mixed question of fact and law,and thus a legal conclusion particularly when,as here,the determination of the fair market value for gift tax purposes requires legal conclusions,our review is de novo indeed,it is settled in this circuit and others that a trial court methodology in resolving fact questions is a legal issue and thus reviewable de novo on appeal 
the majority key legal error was its confecting sua sponte its own methodology for determining the taxable or deductible values of each donee gift valuing for tax purposes here.the core flaw in the majority inventive methodology was its violation of the practice of relying on events specifically,the majority used the confirmation agreement to mutate the assignment agreement gifts into percentage interests in mil.it is clear beyond cavil that the majority should have stopped with the assignment agreement plain wording.by not doing so,however,and instead continuing on to the confirmation agreement concurrence on the equivalency of dollars to percentage of interests in mil,the majority violated the maxim that a gift is valued as of the date that it is complete the flip side of that maxim is that subsequent occurrences are off limits 
in this respect,we can not improve on the opening sentence of judge foley dissent 
undaunted by the facts,legal precedent,and respondent failure to present sufficient evidence to establish his determinations,the majority allow their olfaction to displace sound legal reasoning and adherence to the rule of law 
judge foley facts are those stipulated and those adduced especially the experts testimony before him as the lone trial judge,including the absence of any probative evidence of collusion,side deals,understandings,expectations,or anything other than,unconditional completed gifts by the taxpayers on january,and arm length conversions of dollars into percentages by the donees alone in march.judge foley legal precedent includes,without limitation,constant jurisprudence that has established the immutable rule that,for inter vivos gifts and bequests or inheritances alike,fair market value is determined,on the day that the donor completes that gift or the date of death or alternative valuation date in the case of a testamentary or intestate transfer and,judge foley use of olfaction is an obvious,collegially correct synonym for the vernacular term,smell test,commonly used to identify a decision made not on the basis of relevant facts and applicable law,but on the decision maker gut feelings or intuition.the particular olfaction here is the anathema that judge swift identifies pejoratively in his concurring opinion as the sophistication of the tax planning before us.the majority election to rule on the basis of this olfaction is likewise criticized by judge laro,dissenting in part,as the 
majority appl ying its own approach 
to reach the result that the majority desires,the majority decides this case on the basis of a novel approach neither advanced nor briefed by either party 
judge foley also disagrees with the rightly so,we basing its holding on an interpretation of the assignment agreement and an application of the confirmation agreement that the commissioner never raised.to this criticism we add that the majority not only made a contractual interpretation of the assignment agreement that rests in part on the non sequitur that it uses the term fair market value without including the modifying language as finally determined for tax purposes,but also indicated a palpable hostility to the dollar formula of the defined value clause in that donation agreement.this is exacerbated by the majority lip service to,but ultimate disregard of,the immutable principal that value of a gift must be determined as of the date of the gift.the majority violates this doctrine when it relies in principal part on the actions of the donees in their march execution of the confirmation agreement.judge foley correctly notes that the majority erred in conducting 
a tortured analysis of the a ssignment a greement that is,ostensibly,justification for shifting the determination of transfer tax consequences from the date of the transfer january,to march,the date of the c onfirmation a greement.the majority analysis of the a ssignment a greement requires that taxpayers use the court valuation to determine the dollar value of the transferred interests,but the donees appraiser valuation to determine the percentages of interests transferred to the charitable organizations.there is no factual,legal,or logical basis for this conclusion 
we obviously agree with judge foley unchallenged baselines that the gift was complete on january,and that the courts and the parties alike are governed by a.we thus agree as well that the majority reversibly erred when,in determining the charitable deduction,the majority rely on the c onfirmation a greement without regard to the fact that the taxpayers were not parties to this agreement,and that this agreement was executed by the donees more than months after the transfer.in taking issue with the majority on this point,judge foley cogently points out that t he majority appear to assert,without any authority,that the taxpayers charitable deduction can not be determined unless the gifted interest is expressed in terms of a percentage or a fractional share.as implied,the majority created a valuation methodology out of the whole cloth.we too are convinced that r egardless of how the transferred interest was described,it had an ascertainable value on the date of the gift that value can not,of course,be varied by the subsequent acts of the donees in executing the confirmation agreement.consequently,the values ascribed by the majority,being derived from its use of its own imaginative but flawed methodology,may not be used in any way in the calculation of the taxpayers gift tax liability.
in the end,whether the controlling values of the donated interests in mil on the date of the gifts are those set forth in the assignment agreement based on frazier appraisal of per one per cent or those reached by the majority before it invoked the confirmation agreement or even those used by the commissioner in the deficiency notices or those reached by the commissioner expert witness for that matter,have no practical effect on the amount of gift taxes owed here.nevertheless,given the majority rejection of the commissioner experts values and,as we shall show,its own legal error,not applying a discount to account for the present negative value of the donees assumed liability for estate taxes even before the majority translated the defined value clause dollars into percentages by use of the confirmation agreement,the fair market values applicable in this case are,by a process of elimination,those determined by the frazier report and used by the taxpayers in preparing their gift tax returns for.in sum,we hold that the majority erred as a matter of law.accordingly,the taxable values used by the taxpayers in preparing their gift tax returns must stand,subject only to the question of their having been arrived at,in part,by applying the actuarially determined present value of the donees assumed responsibility for payment of estate taxes,if any,under.we address that issue now.
effect on present fair market values of potential estate taxes under 
taxes paid by a donee on the value of property gratuitously transferred reduces the taxable value of such gift in calculating the taxable value of their gifts,the taxpayers employed a variation on the venerable net gift theme for reducing that taxable value.they did so in calculating not only the amounts of correct gift taxes assumed by the donees,but also in calculating the discount that a willing buyer would require to account for additional estate taxes that these donees would have to pay,pursuant to,if the taxpayers or either of them should die within three years following the gift.the majority held for the commissioner,who contended that this particular factor is too speculative to be recognized in calculating the net gift.it appears that the dissenters and concurrers would have agreed with the majority on this point.we,however,disagree with the majority and therefore reverse its ruling on this issue too.
there is nothing speculative about the fact that if either or both taxpayers were to die within three years following the gift as did mccord,the donees would have been and,coincidently,were legally bound to pay the additional estate tax that could result from the provisions of.it is axiomatic contract law that a present obligation may be,and frequently is,performable at a future date.it is also axiomatic that responsibility for the future performance of such a present obligation may be either firmly fixed or conditional,either absolute or contingent on the occurrence of a future event,a condition subsequent.and,it is axiomatic that any conditional liability for the future performance of a present obligation a greater or lesser degree speculative.the issue here,though,is not whether condition subsequent is speculative vel non,but whether it is too speculative to be applicable,a very elastic yardstick indeed.
conditions subsequent come in a variety of flavors a future event that is absolutely certain to occur,such as the passage of time a future event,like the act of a third party that is not absolutely certain to occur,but nevertheless may be a more certain prophec y a possible,but,future event,such as the reversion of an interest in property if the unmarried and childless life tenant not only survives the transferor,but herself bears children who live to the age of majority and at least one of whom survives the transferor,as in robinette helvering undeniably a less certain prophec y of the future.and there are all degrees and shades of certainty along the speculative continuum,from absolute certainty to essentially total impossibility.
the issue presented here regarding the degree of certainty of the assumed obligation under,is a legal one which we review de novo to what conditions subsequent are the exempt donees assumed obligations subject,and thus speculative and,in combination,do these conditions subsequent respective degrees of uncertainty make the contingent obligation in question too speculative to be credited for purposes of valuing the gift to the donee the judicial determination of how much is too much is a subjective one yet it remains a mixed question of law and ultimate fact,to be reviewed de novo on the basis of an analysis of all the relevant and material discrete facts.here,the discrete facts are not in dispute only the extent to which,together,they make the probability of the occurrence of condition subsequent too speculative to credit.
putting ourselves in the shoes of the ubiquitous willing buyer,we must first identify each factor that,by future change,could affect the likelihood that the donees will eventually have to pay the additional estate tax.after that,we must identify which of those factors a willing buyer would and we,as a matter of law,must take into consideration in deciding whether it is too speculative for him to insist on its being used in reaching a price that the seller is willing to accept.it is in this context that we must make subjective determinations as to where,on that continuum between absolute certainty and virtual uncertainty the donees contractually assumed responsibility for estate taxes falls,and then whether it is so speculative that our willing buyer would not insist on its being taken into consideration as a discount that a willing seller must accept.
those donees future performance of their present obligation was subject to a number of factors and conditions at the time in january that the gifts were made.and,some of these factors are not totally predictable or quantifiable 
the amount of gift taxes owed by the taxpayers for these gifts.
whether there would be an estate tax or essentially identical transfer tax in existence at the time of the death s of a taxpayer or taxpayers.
whether the amount of gift taxes on the gifts would be taxable under,or some similar successor section,in the estate of a taxpayer who dies within three years following the gift.
whether,if such an estate tax would exist at the future death of a taxpayer and,under it,the amount of the gift taxes are subjected to the marginal estate tax rate by or any successor provision,that rate will be greater than,less than,or the same as the rate that was in effect on january.
whether,if or its equivalent is in effect at the death or deaths of the taxpayers,it will still be conditioned on survivorship for three years after the gifts,and if so,the period of survivorship will be the same,shorter,or longer than three years.
whether the interest rate that a willing buyer and willing seller of the transferred partnership interests would agree to use in discounting their price to account for the negative value of the seller potential obligation under would be the same rate of interest as it was on the date of the gifts.
what would be the additional discount in value for the obligation,based on actuarial odds that the measuring life would exceed the survivorship trigger that automatically terminates the obligation.
we consi
