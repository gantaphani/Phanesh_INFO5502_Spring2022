anwar saqr saqr seeks review of the decision by the board of immigration appeals bia upholding the immigration court finding that saqr is subject to removal on the grounds that his criminal conviction for second degree assault under extreme emotional disturbance under kentucky law is an aggravated felony and that his conviction for reckless homicide is a crime of moral turpitude.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.for the reasons that follow,the bia finding that saqr is removable on the basis of his conviction for second degree assault under extreme emotional disturbance is reversed,and this action is remanded for further proceedings to determine whether saqr conviction for reckless homicide constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.
background 
while in the united states in valid status,saqr was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which one person was killed and another person seriously injured.pursuant to a plea agreement with state authorities,saqr pled guilty to one count of reckless homicide in violation of kentucky revised statute and one count of assault in the second degree under extreme emotional disturbance in violation of kentucky revised statutes and.on january,saqr was sentenced to a period of imprisonment on each count,to be served consecutively.
on february,the immigration and naturalization served saqr with an order to show cause osc,ordered him to appear for a hearing before an immigration judge at a time and place to be determined,and issued a warrant for his arrest.the osc charged saqr with having committed a crime involving moral turpitude and violating the terms of his status,thereby rendering him subject to removal pursuant to sections a a i and a c i,respectively,of the immigration and nationality act.the osc did not include a charge that saqr had committed an aggravated felony.
the ins did not file the osc with an immigration court.however,the ins also does not appear to have canceled the february,osc at any time,and the arrest warrant appears to have remained in effect,as well.in early july,saqr was released into ins custody.on august,while saqr remained in ins custody,the ins served him with a second osc,now called a notice to appear nta.the nta,like the osc served on saqr in,charged only that he was subject to removal based upon his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude and,separately,based upon his having failed to maintain or comply with the conditions of his status it did not include a charge that he was subject to removal based upon an aggravated felony conviction.on september,the ins lodged the additional charge that saqr was subject to removal for an aggravated felony conviction and,on the same date,filed the nta with the immigration court.
during the interim between february,when the osc was served upon saqr,and september,when the nta was filed with the immigration court,congress adopted a new definition of the term aggravated felony.see illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.under the previous definition,an offense constituted an aggravated felony if it was a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment imposed regardless of any suspension of imprisonment is at least years a f.under the new definition,an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony if it is a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.
at an individual hearing on the merits,held before the immigration court on march,saqr argued that his crimes of conviction were not crimes involving moral turpitude.saqr also argued that neither offense was an aggravated felony under the law as it existed at the time of his plea and conviction and that applying the expanded definition of aggravated felony adopted by congress in to his case would be an impermissibly retroactive application of the law.
in an oral decision and order dated march,the immigration court rejected the government contention that saqr had failed to maintain his status or had violated the terms of that status by virtue of his criminal convictions.however,the immigration court found that the conviction for reckless homicide constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.the immigration court made no finding on whether the assault offense also constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.furthermore,although the immigration court did not specifically address the issue of retroactivity,the immigration judge applied the definition of aggravated felony to saqr convictions and found that both qualify as aggravated felonies.on the basis of these findings,the immigration court found saqr removable.additionally,the immigration judge concluded that the reckless homicide offense constitutes not only an aggravated felony,thereby rendering saqr ineligible for asylum,but also a particularly serious offense,thereby rendering saqr ineligible for withholding of removal.finally,the immigration court found that saqr had abandoned his application for relief from removal under the convention against torture cat.
saqr appealed to the bia,which affirmed in part and reversed in part.in an order dated april,the bia upheld the immigration court finding that saqr was removable for having committed an aggravated felony.the bia did not specify whether only one conviction or both qualify as an aggravated felony,but presumably it intended to encompass both convictions because the immigration court had determined both to be aggravated felonies.similarly,although the bia found that the immigration court properly determined that saqr had committed a particularly serious crime,thereby rendering him ineligible for withholding of removal,the immigration court did not discuss whether it deemed both offenses or only the reckless homicide offense to be particularly serious.because the bia did not specify otherwise,it presumably intended this finding to apply only to the reckless homicide conviction given that the immigration judge made no finding concerning whether the assault offense is a particularly serious crime.finally,the bia found the record insufficient on the issue of saqr request for relief under the cat and remanded for further proceedings on that issue.
the bia order left a number of issues unaddressed entirely.first,although the immigration court had found the reckless homicide conviction to be a crime of moral turpitude,the bia made no determination on that issue.second,the bia,like the immigration court,failed to address whether the assault conviction constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.third,the bia did not address the immigration court determination that saqr was not removable on the basis of a violation of his nonimmigrant status.however,the bia did address the retroactivity issue,stating that it lacked authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws enacted by congress.
on remand from the bia,the immigration court denied saqr claim for relief under the cat.in light of that denial,the immigration court reinstated its march,order of removal.
saqr appealed to the bia,essentially requesting reconsideration of the finding that the reckless homicide conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony in light of the united states supreme court intervening decision in leocal ashcroft,d the bia concluded that the reckless homicide offense is an aggravated felony because the mens rea element of the crime was greater than negligence.accordingly,the bia upheld the immigration court earlier order finding saqr removable on the basis of the reckless homicide conviction,which the bia concluded was an aggravated felony.the bia also stated that the aggravated felony conviction rendered saqr ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal.
saqr petitioned this court for review.after saqr had filed his opening brief,the government moved to remand on the issue of whether the definition of recklessly as set forth in kentucky revised statutes shares the same meaning as the common law definition of criminal negligence,and if so,whether saqr case was controlled by leocal.this court,noting that saqr
