petitioner yinggui lin lin is a falun gong practitioner who allegedly fled from persecution in china,including a chinese police raid on his gaming business which resulted in the confiscation of equipment.lin entered the united states illegally in september near roma,texas.that same month,the department of homeland security served lin with a notice to appear,alleging he was removable as an alien.lin was granted a change of venue to cleveland,ohio in march.in august,lin filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
the immigration judge denied lin application at a merits hearing in august.the denial was affirmed in april by the board of immigration appeals bia.lin filed this appeal in may.he argues the bia erred in upholding the immigration judge finding that lin failed to provide corroborating evidence of the circumstances supporting his request for asylum.lin also argues the immigration judge erred in failing to find a nexus between his falun gong activities and the chinese police confiscation of his gaming equipment,and to properly review the state department human rights report on discrimination against falun gong practitioners in china.finally,lin argues his due process rights were violated when the immigration judge did not properly mark exhibit his application for asylum with supporting documentation into the record.
for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition on all grounds.
background 
falun gong is a spiritual discipline comprised of meditation exercises with moral components,including cultivation of virtue and character.introduction to falun gong,last visited april.
according to lin testimony before the immigration judge,he has been a falun gong practitioner since.friends recommended the practice to aid in relaxation as well as physical and mental health.lin ceased his practice in when the chinese government began suppressing falun gong,but he renewed the practice in.
one of lin fellow falun gong practitioners was arrested in and apparently reported lin name to the chinese police.in december,the police raided lin business,a gaming room,when he was not there.the police told lin employee,xianfei wong,that lin was being targeted because he was a falun gong practitioner.after the raid,the police confiscated lin gaming equipment and shut down his business.
immediately following this incident,lin left hangzhou and moved to shenzen,where he stayed with a friend and continued to practice falun gong.lin employer,a restaurant owner,saw lin practicing falun gong while at work in june.his employer told him to cease his practice or he would call the police.instead,lin left this job.
in december,while lin was living in shenzen,police visited his parents house in hangzhou,showed his parents a notice for lin appearance,and asked where he was.the police allegedly wanted to arrest lin because of his falun gong practices and asked his parents to advise lin to surrender himself to authorities,which lin refused to do.according to his parents,police continued to look for lin through august.
lin left china in july,borrowing money from friends and relatives and paying a snakehead to smuggle lin into the united states.he entered the united states illegally in september near roma,texas,and the next day was served with papers charging him as an illegal alien.lin currently lives in cleveland with his cousin and several others.he continues to practice falun gong,although his cousin and others living with them,who allegedly have observed his practice,did not testify at the hearing.
the immigration judge issued an oral decision at the conclusion of the august merits hearing denying lin applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.
although the judge found lin credible,he based his denial on lin failure to present corroborating evidence of his falun gong practice in china and the united states.the judge specifically found lin did not provide an adequate explanation for his failure to produce,for example,statements from friends with whom he practiced falun gong in hangzhou,the friend with whom he stayed in shenzen,his employer in shenzen,or others in the united states ja.the judge also sought corroboration of the incident when the chinese police appeared at his parents home,but lin could not produce the notice served by the police,allegedly because his parents destroyed the notice in anger after the police left.the judge found the alleged intentional destruction of the document an inadequate explanation for the document absence.
the judge acknowledged the affidavit from xianfei wong,lin employee at his gaming room,but found this sole piece of corroborating evidence too speculative to make a definitive conclusion ja.likewise,the letter lin proffered from his parents was not very specific and contained no dates or details regarding the police confrontation or that the police interference was because of lin falun gong practice ja.the judge found the letter from petitioner aunt similarly vague and general,entitled to very limited weight under the circumstances id.
lin failed to carry the burden of proof required for granting asylum because he demonstrated neither past persecution in china for his falun gong practice nor a fear of future persecution based upon a totality of the evidence ja.because lin failed to meet his burden to show eligibility for asylum,he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal,and failed to demonstrate the likelihood of torture on his return to china.
the bia affirmed the immigration judge findings that lin failed to meet his burden of proof and questioned the absence of many documents or witnesses that lin might have been able to produce to corroborate his falun gong practice.the bia indicated that w hile the lack of some of these may be adequately explained,the overall lack of support leads us to agree with the immigration judge id.though the bia noted that a respondent testimony alone may be sufficient to support an application for relief,here,without other support,it failed to meet petitioner burden of proof id.lin now appeals the bia decision.
standard of review 
lin argues this court should conduct a de novo review of the bia because the bia allegedly erred in its interpretation of the law.however,the proper standard governing this court review of the bia findings of fact is substantial evidence.ins,d thermija ins,cir f indings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.quoting b b.under this deferential standard of review,the court must uphold the bia decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.abay ashcroft,cir quoting mikhailevitch ins,cir.a reviewing court may not reverse on the basis that it would have decided the case differently rather reversal is merited only if the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion as argued by the petitioner,but indeed compels it.hammer ins,cir see also,at.

petition for asylum 
to establish eligibility for asylum,an applicant must establish he is a refugee within the meaning of ina section a,a.to establish that the applicant is a refugee,the applicant must establish that race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.b b i.an asylum applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that persecution is a reasonable possibility should he be returned to his country of origin.perkovic ins,cir quoting ins,d.in determining whether an applicant for asylum has sustained his burden,
