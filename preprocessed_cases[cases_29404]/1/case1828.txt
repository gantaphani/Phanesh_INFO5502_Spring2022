luisa margarita seeks review of the denial of her petition for asylum and withholding of removal.an immigration judge ij found that,because had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others,see b a i and b b i,while she was a member of peruvian military intelligence,she was ineligible for these forms of relief.the ij instead granted a deferral of removal under the convention against torture the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed and adopted the ij opinion.now petitions for review.
the government contends that the meaning of the statutory language assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution,as written in and,is plain and unambiguous,and,in any event,is controlled by fedorenko united states,d,a case involving these terms in a different statute and in the context of the denaturalization of an individual who had been a guard at a nazi concentration camp.we disagree with the government view,and conclude that the legal analysis of these terms when applied to an alien who is accused of having assisted or participated in persecution in the context of working for a legitimate arm of a recognized government differs materially from that analysis when applied to an alien who served as a nazi concentration camp guard.because we further conclude that in applying the persecution bar to,the ij erred as a matter of law by failing to conduct the appropriate analysis and make the necessary findings of fact,we will remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
in,graduated from military intelligence school and became an intelligence analyst with a division of the peruvian servicio de inteligencia del ejercito sie or army intelligence.the sie was charged with collecting intelligence about and apprehending terrorists,who were then supposed to be handed over to the directorate against terrorism dircote for placement in the judicial system.was required to gather information on individuals and pass that information up the chain of command.for example,one of first assignments was to attend a meeting for an organization at the university of san marcos and report whether a particular professor had communist tendencies.shortly after beginning her employment with the sie,became aware of conduct by other factions of the peruvian military that led her to believe that human rights violations were taking place at the hands of the military,and that the suspected terrorists were not being handed over to the judicial system for trial.the first such instance occurred in june,when heard screams coming from the basement of the building in which she worked.
testified that she reported her concerns to her supervisor and requested an immediate transfer.in august,she was reclassified to work at a broadcasting department of peruvian intelligence.over the ensuing years,was assigned a number of different jobs.the precise chronology and details of these jobs are not clear from the record,but it appears that from this point on,worked as an operative for the sie.on one of her assignments,was placed at the real felipe museum where she worked undercover as a secretary and provided information to the sie.on another assignment,listened to and transcribed telephone conversations of designated individuals.
claimed that she was mistreated throughout her tenure at sie.early in her career,after she first expressed concern to her supervisor about the possibility that human rights violations were taking place,the supervisor began sexually harassing her.throughout her career,she was sexually harassed by a number of different individuals in the peruvian military.claimed that major ricardo anderson,one of the supervisors who had sexually harassed her,came to her house,broke the windows,pointed his gun at her sister,and then beat until she lost consciousness.when she reported this to the police,the military threatened her and demanded that she retract her accusations.
in late,had a discussion with an old friend,mariela barreto,who was also an sie agent.barreto told that she had been a member of a group that was responsible for many deaths and disappearances around peru,including the massacre of a number of professors and students at la cantuta university.because she had felt very guilty about her involvement in these atrocities,barreto said,she had leaked information about them to the magazine si,and now she was suspected of leaking this information and feared for her life.less than a month later,barreto was found dead,her body dismembered.about a week after that,another of colleagues who had spoken out about the abuses of the peruvian military was found beaten and paralyzed.characterized these incidents as creating a period of hysteria in the peruvian intelligence community.it was clear that the beating and killing of colleagues was carried out by individuals linked to the peruvian military and sie.in fact,former supervisor major anderson,was among those the police arrested.
was deeply troubled by all of this.in an effort to substantiate the claims of her former colleagues and to save the life of a journalist who had spoken out against human rights abuses,she began secretly to leak information to the press.not surprisingly,also began to fear for her own life.on one occasion,government agents attempted to run over her with a vehicle,but instead struck and severely injured one of female colleagues.about a week later,a friend warned that her life was in jeopardy,and on december,left sie and fled to the united states.
since arriving in the united states,has spoken out repeatedly against the human rights violations that were carried out by the peruvian government,making public declarations to numerous press outlets,including cnn,cbs,ecco,the miami herald,el nuevo herald,london bbc,and italian televison.for her efforts,she has received death threats while she has been living in the united states,and she fears that she would be tortured or killed if she were to return to peru.
applied for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij denied application on the grounds that she was ineligible for these forms of relief because,while working for sie,she had 
assisted or otherwise participated in persecution by writing the reports or by transcribing the verbatim conversations that she heard and by sending them up the chain of command.not unlike the death camp guard in fedorenko united states,d,who participated in the process even if he did not operate the gas chambers,respondent was an important part of operating this process.
argued that,at least initially,she did not know that such persecution was taking place,and that the persecution was being carried out by rogue paramilitary elements within peruvian intelligence,not by the general peruvian intelligence community itself.the ij did not make any findings on these arguments,but instead,by equating fedorenko holding that the statute at issue there contains no involuntary assistance exception to the persecution bar,at,to a holding that there is no exception for lack of knowledge of the persecution,noted that her knowledge was immaterial.the bia affirmed and adopted the ij opinion.
ii.standard of review 
where the bia summarily adopts the ij decision without issuing its own opinion,we review the decision of the ij as the final administrative order.hasan ashcroft,cir.t he factual findings of the ij are reviewed under the standard,and we will not reverse those findings unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.singh gonzales,cir quoting b b.but a determination based on flawed reasoning will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard,and the agency use of an inappropriately stringent standard when evaluating an applicant testimony constitutes legal,not factual error.balachova mukasey,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.w e generally review questions of law de novo,but defer to the ij reasonable interpretations of the ina.singh,at quoting patel gonzales,cir.
iii.analysis 
legal standards 
congress has prohibited the granting of asylum and withholding of removal to any alien who ordered incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a i applying to asylum accord b b i virtually identical language applying to withholding of removal see also b a making the designation of the alien as a refugee a condition for granting asylum a defining refugee as not including anyone who participated in persecution,and using language identical to that in b a i.
fedorenko remains the standard for invoking this persecution bar,for deciding whether an alien conduct amounts to assisting or participating in persecution.but,as the circuit courts have applied this statute to aliens who were not nazi concentration camp guards,two distinct requirements have emerged.first,the alien must have done more than simply associate with persecutors there must have been some nexus between the alien actions and the persecution of others,such that the alien can fairly be characterized as having actually assisted or otherwise participated in that persecution.see singh gonzales,cir.and second,if such a nexus is shown,the alien must have acted with scienter the alien must have had some level of prior or contemporaneous knowledge that the persecution was being conducted.see gonzales,cir singh,at.heretofore this circuit has not spoken to the persecution bar in circumstances other than the alien involvement in prison or concentration camps,and this case requires us to consider whether we should adopt the reasoning and the requirements set out in the cases decided in those other circuits 
we turn first to the nexus requirement as illustrated by the seventh circuit case of singh gonzales,cir.harpal singh was a head constable in the punjabi police force.singh acknowledged that the punjabi police force,on multiple occasions,crossed the line and persecuted innocent civilians,but he denied having any direct involvement with these activities the seventh circuit noted that the case law as it pertains to nazi concentration camp guards is quite clear membership in the ranks of nazi concentration camp guards,regardless of any direct involvement in the atrocities carried out at the camp,is sufficient to constitute assistance in prohibited persecution.id.at collecting cases.but the court distinguished singh case from that of a nazi guard unlike nazi concentration camps,whose complete existence was premised upon the persecution of innocent civilians,local punjabi police departments served traditional,legitimate law enforcement purposes and did not exclusively engage in the persecution of innocent sikhs.id.internal citations omitted.accordingly,simply being a member of a local punjabi police department during the pertinent period of persecution is not enough to trigger application of the persecution bar.id.at.rather,the record must reveal that the alien actually assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of another on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.at emphasis in original.and the court noted that fedorenko,the seminal case on matters of persecution assistance,had acknowledged that persecution cases outside of the context of nazi prison guards might present more difficult problems with regard to what actions would constitute assistance.id.at.
we read singh to stand for the proposition that in order for the persecution bar to apply,there must be some actual connection between the actions of the alien and the persecution of others.singh mere membership in the punjabi police force would not suffice because it would have been entirely possible for him,as head constable,to engage only in the traditional,legitimate law enforcement activities of the police force.in that case,although other members of the punjabi police force may have persecuted civilians,there would not necessarily have been any link between singh actions and any such persecution,and it would be impossible to characterize singh as having actually assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of another.
other circuits also require some actual connection between the actions of the alien and the persecution of the victims.the eleventh circuit,in chen attorney general,cir,after reviewing fedorenko and the development of the law in this area,held 
the standard for determining whether an asylum applicant is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal due to assistance or participation in persecution is a particularized,inquiry into whether the applicant personal conduct was merely indirect,peripheral and inconsequential association or was active,direct and integral to the underlying persecution.
chen,at.the second circuit drew a similar distinction 
where the alien conduct was active and had direct consequences for the victims,we concluded that it was assistance in persecution.where the alien conduct was tangential to the acts of oppression and passive in nature,however,we declined to hold that it amounted to such assistance.
xie ins,cir.t he mere fact that the alien may be associated with an enterprise that engages in persecution is insufficient by itself to trigger the effects of the persecutor bar.gao united states attorney general,cir noting that fedorenko itself,albeit in dicta,had disapproved of the guilt by association approach and making it clear that something more than mere association with persecutors is required.
ultimately,the seventh circuit applied the persecution bar to singh because he had,at least indirectly,participated knowingly in the persecution of others.
singh took innocent sikhs into custody during that period and transported them to the police station,where he knew they would be subjected to unjustified physical abuse.further,singh participated in raids on the homes of innocent sikh families,guarding those homes to prevent escapes while other officers were inside arresting and beating family members without cause.
singh,at.singh role in these activities qualifies as actual assistance or participation in persecution the seventh circuit said,even though singh claimed that he did not learn until after the fact that the sikhs whose homes he was guarding were innocent.id.it is worth noting here that singh did not claim that he did not learn until after the fact that these sikhs were being beaten,only that he did not know they were innocent.the court found a sufficient nexus between singh actions and the persecution of others to permit the persecution bar to be applied to him.although the court did not expressly address any knowledge requirement,it is clear that the mere effect of singh actions was not sufficient his knowledge of the physical abuse was essential.
the first circuit explicitly established the in,at.castaneda was a lieutenant in the peruvian military who had led one of four patrol units in an operation that turned into a massacre of dozens of innocent villagers.id.at.while two patrol units entered a village to conduct a search for shining path members,castaneda unit set up position some three to five miles outside the village,with instructions to block any suspects from escaping that way.id.castaneda unit never entered the village and he testified that he was unaware of the massacre until almost three weeks later.id.
noting that no one denied that the massacres were in fact persecution,the first circuit held that,although castaneda blocking of escape routes had the objective effect of aiding in the massacre of the villagers,the persecution bar should not apply unless castaneda had some prior knowledge of an intent to murder the villagers or some contemporaneous knowledge that the murders were being committed.id.at.specifically,the court announced 
we hold that presumptively the persecutor bar should be read not to apply to castaneda if his version of his state of mind is accepted.on remand the agency can,if it wants,try to develop a construction more favorable to the government.but this would have to be done expressly and persuasively,and not by vague reference to the totality of conduct that conflates the question whether one conduct constitutes assistance with the question whether one possessed such scienter as may be required under the circumstances.
