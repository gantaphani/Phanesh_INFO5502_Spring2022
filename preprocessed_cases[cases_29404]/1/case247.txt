this is an appeal from a denial of a tax refund.the taxpayer,hostar marine transportation systems,hostar,a manufacturer of hydraulic boat trailers,seeks a refund of federal excise taxes in the amount of plus interest.the united states counterclaimed for plus interest on hostar as yet unpaid taxes.
the united states district court for the district of massachusetts granted the united states motion to dismiss hostar claim to have suffered a violation of due process,motion for summary judgment on hostar claim that it was erroneously assessed the taxes,and motion for summary judgment on the united states counterclaim.on appeal,hostar challenges each of the district court rulings.after careful consideration,we affirm those rulings.
background 
we outline the statutes,facts,and procedural history relevant to the issues on appeal in this case the issues on appeal are whether hostar hydraulic boat trailers qualify as semitrailers or truck trailers for purposes of section of the internal revenue code qualify for the exclusion provided in section a of the concerning gross vehicle weight gvw and qualify for the exception provided in a d ii concerning c ertain vehicles specially designed for offhighway transportation.
statutes and a 
section a of the,concerning the imposition of tax on heavy trucks and trailers sold at retail,imposes on the first retail sale a tax of percent of the amount for which the applicable truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies are so sold.a c d.one district court has described the general purpose of this excise tax as follows 
to ensure that those entities which enjoy the use of the public roads pay for their upkeep.to put it differently,the tax forces those entities that cause the most damage to the public roads,and often benefit economically the most from them,to pay for the consequences of their use.

exclusion concerning gross vehicle weight 
section of the lists exclusions from this tax.the exclusion at issue on appeal in this case is the following the tax shall not apply to truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies,suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer which has a gvw of pounds or less as determined under regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury.a.
the gvw is defined in the treasury regulations.according to these regulations 
for purposes of this section,the term gross vehicle weight means the maximum total weight of a loaded vehicle.except as otherwise provided,such maximum total weight shall be the gvw rating of the article as specified by the manufacturer or established by the seller of the completed article,unless the irs commissioner finds that such rating is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances in a particular case.
exception concerning offhighway transportation 
beyond the explicit exclusions section of the itself lists,the treasury regulations include certain limits and exceptions to this excise tax.the exception at issue on appeal in this case applies to c ertain vehicles specially designed for offhighway transportation.a d ii.that exception requires that the vehicle meet two criteria.the vehicle must satisfy a design test,in that it must be specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway in connection with a construction,manufacturing,processing,farming,mining,drilling,timbering,or operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations id.to qualify for the exception to this excise tax,the vehicle must also satisfy a use test,in that,by reason of such special design,the use of such vehicle to transport such load over the public highways is substantially limited or substantially impaired.id.
hostar reports that it manufactures four models of hydraulic boat trailers hpt,hst,hsty,and hht,three of which hpt,hst,and hht are capable of use and one of which hsty is not.
hostar competitors 
hostar states that it has competitors in the united states and canada that also manufacture hydraulic boat trailers.hostar alleges,however,that it is the only such manufacturer whose trailers have been determined by the irs not to qualify for exemption pursuant to treasury regulations a d i and a d ii.this alleged disparate treatment is central to hostar claim to have suffered a violation of due process.
purpose of hostar trailers 
hostar describes the purposes of hydraulic boat trailers as being to launch and retrieve boats from the water,to move boats into and out of repair facilities and paint booths,to move them about the boat yard,yacht club,marina or boat leadership,and to set boats on keel blocking and boat stands for winter storage.hostar claims that t he main function or purpose of a hydraulic trailer is not that of highway transporting.rather,hostar asserts,t he primary function of hostar hydraulic boat trailers is for use in boat yards and rarely on the highway due to the cost and highly specialized nature of the equipment.hostar has provided affidavits from its customers that hostar claims establish that hostar trailers are used in boatyards and rarely on the highway.
design of hostar trailers 
hostar states that hydraulic boat trailers are constructed with stub axles,which attach a single wheel to the trailer,as opposed to through axles,which are more common,attach two wheels to the trailer,and are used on highway transport trailers.hostar asserts that the design of the stub axle,which features an,enables the operations of ramp launching,retrieving,and setting a boat on the ground,in a repair facility or in a storage building but renders these types of axles vulnerable to extraordinary wear and tear on the highway.
hostar reports that it does not build lowboy trailers.hostar states that almost all transporting of boats on highways is accomplished on such trailers.in contrast to hydraulic boat trailers,lowboy trailers have through axles instead of stub axles,a full bed or cross beams as opposed to an open center design,no hydraulic components,are not submersible,and are similar to trailers used for moving construction equipment.
gross vehicle weight of hostar trailers 
at the time of sale between and,according to hostar own documentation through both the vehicle identification numbers and the certificates of origin,each of hostar fourteen trailers at issue in this case had a gvw exceeding pounds.the trailers gvws thus precluded the exclusion from the tax assessed pursuant to section a of the at issue on appeal in this case.see supra part i a.on november,an unknown entity revised all of the certificates of origin for these fourteen trailers to reflect lower gvws.eight of the trailers then reflected gvws below pounds and the remaining six reflected gvws still in excess of pounds.
procedural history 
irs assessment 
between january,and december,hostar sold the fourteen trailers at issue in this case.between april and october,an irs revenue agent audited hostar.on or about may,pursuant to section a of the,the irs assessed excise taxes against hostar with respect to the sale of the fourteen boat trailers and notified hostar such payments were due.see hostar i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in january and june,the applied overpayment credits to hostar tax assessments totaling.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
hostar declined to pay the tax assessed against any of its hydraulic boat trailers before submitting its first complaint in this matter.on may,the district court for the district of massachusetts granted the united states motion to dismiss hostar request for a refund of plus interest and a declaration that the twelve percent excise tax assessed against it pursuant to a is exempted by regulations and hostar request for abatement of the tax because of an alleged violation of due process.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court determined that it had no jurisdiction over the question of whether an excise tax was due until after hostar paid the tax.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court noted jurisdiction would be conferred on the court if hostar paid tax on a minimum of one trailer for one quarter.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court further determined that hostar allegation of suffering a violation of due process was equally unavailing because hostar had named the wrong defendant and insufficiently pled a bivens action.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.finally,the district court noted that its decision to grant the united states motion to dismiss was further bolstered by the fact that hostar exceeded the statute of limitation in filing its complaint.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
hostar complaint 
hostar did not appeal the district court decision in hostar rather,on or about april,hostar paid the irs the tax assessed on the sale of one boat trailer and filed a claim for a refund of the paid sum.see hostar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on may,hostar filed in the district court for the district of massachusetts a complaint against the united states.asserting its rights under a providing for civil actions for refunds concerning,inter alia,internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,hostar claimed that it had been erroneously assessed the excise tax pursuant to section a of the hostar alleged two counts.in count i,hostar claimed that the tax assessment was erroneous because,pursuant to treasury regulations a d i and a d ii,its hydraulic boat trailers were exempted from the tax.in count ii,hostar claimed that it suffered a violation of due process because the united states,in an unjustifiable and discriminatory violation of its duty of consistency,assessed the tax only against hostar despite knowing that some of hostar competitors in the united states and canada also manufacture hydraulic boat trailers.hostar requested judgment against the united states in the amount of plus statutory interest and an abatement of the assessment against it.
the government answer and counterclaim 
by june,hostar had still not paid the outstanding tax the irs assessed on hostar hydraulic boat trailers in.including interest and penalties,the united states calculated that hostar then owed.
on july,the united states filed its answer,which the united states amended on july,to include a counterclaim.the united states demanded judgment dismissing hostar action and granting to the united states its costs.the united states stated that,despite the notices and demands it sent hostar,hostar had refused or neglected to pay in full excise taxes on its sale of hydraulic boat trailers assessed in for tax periods between and.the united states thus asserted a counterclaim against hostar demanding judgment in favor of the united states in the amount of plus interest and other statutory additions accruing from and after june.contrary to the single trailer on which hostar paid an excise tax and for which it claimed a refund,the united states ultimately asserted that fourteen trailers were at issue in this case.
the government motion to dismiss and hostar ii 
on may,the united states filed a motion to dismiss,with prejudice,count ii of hostar complaint,concerning the violation of due process hostar alleged it suffered.the united states provided three grounds for its requested dismissal.first,the united states claimed that hostar was precluded by collateral estoppel from relitigating this issue because the same cause of action was dismissed in a previous action between hostar and the united states.hostar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also hostar i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.second,the united states claimed that the district court lacked jurisdiction over count ii because the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity.third,the united states claimed that hostar allegation that it was entitled to relief from this tax because other taxpayers had not paid their taxes failed to state a claim as a matter of law,pursuant to.b.on june,the district court,concluding that hostar had failed to state a due process claim upon which relief can be granted,dismissed count ii of hostar complaint.hostar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court noted that,unlike in hostar i,the court had jurisdiction in hostar ii because hostar had paid the tax assessed on one trailer.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.

ii.discussion 
our of review is the all issues on appeal in this case 
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under.b,accepting as true all facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.
we also review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party while ignoring conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.for review of both summary judgment and dismissal under rule b,we may affirm on any basis apparent in the record.

hostar contends that it is undisputed that hostar would go out of business if subjected to the excise tax.the united states responds that,because only a relatively narrow subset of hostar trailers is subject to excise taxes under section of the,hostar contention is improper and belied by the record.hostar has offered no factual support for its contention,nor has it identified any case law that holds that the effect an excise tax would have on a taxpayer should factor into whether the taxpayer is subjected to the excise tax.we therefore consider this issue waived.united states bongiorno,cir we have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner,not accompanied by developed argumentation.
hostar due process claim based on purported disparate treatment 
hostar argues that the irs has treated differently two groups canadian manufacturers who are competitors and american competitors.hostar asserts that there is a general principle that the irs has a duty to act consistently and can not treat similarly situated taxpayers disparately.see int l bus.machs.united states ibm,and sirbo holdings,comm r sirbo i,cir.in other words,hostar contends,the united states is required to treat all of the taxpayers in the same manner.because similarly situated manufacturers of boat trailers were not subject to the section tax,hostar argues that the district court erred when it dismissed hostar claim that the united states improperly discriminated against it in assessing the tax against hostar.
when describing similarly situated manufacturers,hostar identifies both canadian and domestic competitors that it claims were not subjected to the disputed tax.as to canadian competitors,we do not accept any argument that domestic and foreign corporations are similarly situated and so there can be no claims of discrimination in violation of the due process clause.as to american competitors,hostar argues only arbitrary treatment,purportedly in violation of the due process clause.as support for this argument,hostar cites language from the court of claims decision in ibm and from justice frankfurter concurrence in united states kaiser.see ibm,at equality of treatment is so dominant in our understanding of justice that discretion,where it is allowed a role,must pay the strictest heed.united states kaiser,d frankfurter,concurring the irs commissioner can not tax one and not tax another without some rational basis for the difference.and so,assuming the correctness of the principle of equality,it can be an independent ground of decision that the commissioner has been inconsistent,without much concern for whether we should hold as an original matter that the position the commissioner now seeks to sustain is wrong.we address that claim.hostar also cites two tax court memoranda to bolster its claim,even though it acknowledges that these memoranda apply to limitations on the irs commissioner discretion in offering settlement terms to taxpayers,not to the irs commissioner assessment of taxes.see elghanian comm r,at,tax.memo lexis,at tax laws must be applied as uniformly as possible.however,the irs commissioner is not required to offer a settlement to one taxpayer consistent with that offered to other similarly situated taxpayers,absent proof that a taxpayer has been singled out for adverse treatment based on impermissible considerations such as race or religion,and absent contractual agreements to the contrary.internal citation omitted stewart comm r,at,tax.memo lexis,at our responsibility as a court is to apply the law to the facts of the case before us how the commissioner treated other taxpayers is generally irrelevant in making that determination,absent proof that a taxpayer has been singled out for adverse treatment based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,or other arbitrary classification,and absent contractual agreements to the contrary internal citations omitted.
it has been said,as hostar asserts,that the irs has a duty to act consistently toward similarly situated taxpayers.sirbo i,at t he commissioner of the irs has a duty of consistency toward similarly situated taxpayers bunce united states,observing that the irs has a duty to treat similarly situated taxpayers consistently.
however,even accepting as true all facts in hostar complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in hostar favor,hostar claimed suffering of a violation of due process does not withstand our de novo review.the goal of treating similarly situated taxpayers consistently is general,not strict.the tax court statement that tax laws must be applied as uniformly as possible indicates that the tax laws do not need to be strictly applied uniformly.contrary to hostar assertion,the courts,including the second circuit,the tax court,the court of claims,and the court of federal claims,have not,in fact,prohibited the irs from treating similarly situated taxpayers disparately.we agree with these courts reasoning,as described below.
the second circuit declared as far back as that,w hile treatment should be the irs commissioner goal,perfection in the administration of such vast responsibilities can not be expected.sirbo holdings,comm r sirbo ii,cir internal citation omitted.
the tax court similarly declared around the same time that 
it has long been the position of this court that our responsibility is to apply the law to the facts of the case before us and determine the tax liability of the parties before us how the commissioner may have treated other taxpayers has generally been considered irrelevant in making that determination.
davis comm r,wl.four years later,the tax court noted this position of this court,while observing that there could be exceptions it is conceivable,however,that there may be situations where a taxpayer should be accorded some relief if he were selected for audit on a constitutionally impermissible criterion although such situations are extremely rare,comm r,wl.
the court of claims also has determined that,despite the likelihood that the irs had taxed similarly situated individuals differently,d isparate treatment,however,is not a valid basis for a tax refund.a failure of the irs to assess deficiencies against some taxpayers does not preclude an assessment against other taxpayers.ray united states.
finally,the court of federal claims likewise has ruled that 
the mere fact that another taxpayer has been treated differently from the plaintiff does not establish the plaintiff entitlement.the fact that all taxpayers or all areas of the tax law can not be dealt with by the internal revenue service with equal vigor and that there thus may be some taxpayers who avoid paying the tax can not serve to release all other taxpayers from the obligation.the commissioner failure to assess deficiencies against some taxpayers who owe additional tax does not preclude the commissioner from assessing deficiencies against other taxpayers who admittedly owe additional taxes on the same type of income.a taxpayer can not premise its right to an exemption by showing that others have been treated more generously,leniently or even erroneously by the irs.the fact that there may be some taxpayers who have avoided paying a tax does not relieve other similarly situated taxpayers from paying their taxes.

moreover,hostar reliance on ibm is misplaced.the ibm ruling has been limited by subsequent courts to cases involving private rulings,which were at issue in ibm but not in the instant case.we agree with the eleventh circuit,for example,which recognized that courts have placed limits on the equality principle in cases similar to ibm,citing the example that taxpayers who have not requested or received private letter rulings from the irs will not succeed on a claim of discriminatory treatment because other taxpayers have received private letter rulings on the tax consequences of the same activities.baker united states,cir.
despite the goal of consistency in treatment,the irs is not prohibited from treating such taxpayers disparately.rather than being a strict,definitive requirement,the principle of achieving parity in taxing similarly situated taxpayers is merely aspirational.dicta in a concurring supreme court opinion from five decades ago,kaiser,at,which itself seemed to hedge its position by using the conditional language of assuming a principle to be true,is not sufficient to overcome this view.moreover,we believe that the irs has good reason to retain this flexibility.as the district court noted 
there are practical considerations which counsel in favor of limiting litigation regarding the general duty of consistency in the enforcement of taxes.a broadly enforceable duty could give rise to distracting disputes not over whether a tax is applicable,but rather over the management of an administrative and enforcement agency.moreover,there is the prospect for competitive mischief if,as here,a tax refund plaintiff seeks broad discovery,on the grounds of a disparate enforcement theory,regarding its competitor financial and commercial information both from the irs and from a third party with whom it competes.
hostar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
hostar has not overcome what we find to be the irs prerogative to tax it but not its competitors.thus,we affirm the district court grant of the united states motion to dismiss hostar claim to have suffered a violation of due process.
hostar erroneous assessment claim 
having established that the irs alleged differential tax treatment of hostar and its american competitors did not constitute discrimination in violation of the due process clause,we now apply the law to the facts of the case before us to determine whether the tax was properly assessed against hostar.we conclude that the tax was properly assessed against hostar because hostar hydraulic boat trailers do qualify as semitrailers or truck trailers for purposes of section of the do not qualify for the exclusion provided in section a of the concerning gvw and do not qualify for the exception provided in a d ii concerning c ertain vehicles specially designed for offhighway transportation.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of the united states motion for summary judgment on hostar claimed e
