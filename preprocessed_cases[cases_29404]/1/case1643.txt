petitioner appeals the board of immigration appeals reversal of an immigration judge decision to terminate removal proceedings,contending that his conviction of aiding and abetting bank fraud was not an aggravated felony because it did not involve fraud or deceit and the demonstrated loss did not exceed.he also contends that the bia may not enter an order of removal in the first instance,but must remand to the ij.we dismiss in part and remand in part.
etetim david james,a citizen and native of nigeria,was admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant in january he obtained lawful permanent resident status in september.in march,james pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting bank fraud involving a transaction with a credit union in the amount of.the judgment of conviction ordered james to serve a sentence and to pay restitution in the amount of.
in october,as a result of james conviction,the immigration and naturalization filed a notice to appear charging james with deportability as an aggravated felon the ins charged that james prior conviction constituted a crime involving fraud or deceit,where the loss to the victim s exceeded james contested the applicability of both aggravated felony elements.alternatively,james asserted that he was eligible for relief from removal.
the ij determined that james offense met the first element of a m i,as the statute requires only that the offense involve fraud or deceit,not that the conviction actually include fraud or deceit.however,refusing to consider the amount of restitution,the ij agreed with james that the ins had failed to demonstrate that the loss to the victims exceeded,since he pleaded guilty to a single count of only.thus,the ij terminated removal proceedings against james.
the government appealed,arguing,as it had before the ij,that the restitution amount constituted the proper measure of loss to the victim s.james reasserted that aiding and abetting bank fraud does not necessarily involve fraud or deceit and contended that the ij otherwise had ruled correctly.the bia affirmed the ij decision regarding the fraud element of the felony but reversed the ij calculation of the loss,using instead the amount of restitution.the bia ordered james removed to nigeria.
pursuant to a,james urges our review of the bia decision.the government moved for dismissal of the appeal for want of jurisdiction we now determine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain james request for review of the bia removal order.
we lack jurisdiction where a petitioner is found deportable for having committed an aggravated felony however,james disputes that his offense qualifies as such we retain jurisdiction to examine and decide the jurisdictional question,limited to whether the charged crime constitutes an aggravated felony additionally,james argues that we have independent jurisdiction to address whether the bia acted ultra vires in ordering removal.we discuss each jurisdictional argument in turn.
we first address whether the bia erred in ruling that james prior conviction for aiding and abetting bank fraud constitutes an aggravated felony.
eight a m i defines an aggravated felony as an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.the statute specifically includes convictions based on attempt and conspiracy but does not mention aiding and abetting james argues that since he pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting bank fraud rather than to bank fraud or to attempted bank fraud,his offense does not necessarily involve fraud.additionally,he argues that the prior offense does not meet the statutory floor of loss to the victim s.therefore,he contends that the bia erred in reversing the ij determination that james offense did not qualify as an aggravated felony.
the ij,interpreting the word involve expansively,found that aiding and abetting bank fraud constitutes a crime that involves fraud or deceit under a m i we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the ina itself and definitions of phrases within it,and,then,conduct a de novo review of whether the particular statute that the prior conviction is under falls within the relevant ina definition.involves requires that the offense necessarily entails the involved behavior.we recognize that w hether an offense involves fraud is a broader question than whether it constitutes fraud.fraud and deceit retain their commonly understood legal meanings 
in determining whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under the ina,we employ a categorical approach and look at the statute under which the alien was convicted rather than at the particular underlying facts.thus,we ask whether the offense of aiding and abetting bank fraud necessarily entails,or has as at least one element,fraud or deceit 
turning first to the statute at issue,provides 
a whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal 
b whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states,is punishable as a principal 
to be convicted of aiding and abetting,the defendant must have associated with a criminal venture,participated in the venture,and sought by action to make the venture successful.association means that the defendant shared in the criminal intent of the principal.participation means that the defendant engaged in some affirmative conduct designed to aid the venture.thus,james conviction under and necessarily entailed the criminal intent to see bank fraud committed,some affirmative conduct designed to aid the bank fraud,and his seeking,by his own action,to make the bank fraud successful.
section criminalizes as bank fraud 
knowingly execut ing,or attempt ing to execute,a scheme or artifice 
to defraud a financial institution or 
to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
the plain language of,therefore,provides that a violation of either subsection necessarily entails fraud or deceit 
james argues that the exclusion of aiding and abetting offenses from the statutory framework compels the conclusion that convictions under are not included in the aggravated felony definition.james also contends that as the aiding and abetting offense does not have as one of its elements fraud or deceit,it can not constitute an aggravated felony under the ina.james further argues that aiding and abetting bank fraud requires only the requisite criminal intent,a desire to see the bank fraud succeed,and some affirmative conduct designed to aid the venture,conduct that may not necessarily entail fraud or deceit therefore,james avers that the categorical approach results in the conclusion that james was not convicted of a crime involving fraud or deceit because,on the statute face,it remains unknown if he engaged in fraudulent or deceitful conduct.we are not persuaded.
all of james contentions are susceptible to the same flaw significantly,the aiding and abetting statute,does not define a separate crime,but rather provides another means of convicting someone of the underlying offense.thus,the ij did not err in ruling that aiding and abetting bank fraud involves fraud or deceit because,the underlying offense,necessarily involves fraud.
second,james argues that,by looking beyond the count to which he pleaded guilty,the bia erred in overturning the ij determination that the amount of loss to the victims was less than since aiding and abetting bank fraud does not itself define a monetary threshold,we look beyond the to the record of conviction accordingly,the ij reasoned that since the count to which james pleaded guilty involved fraudulently causing a wire transfer in the amount of,the crime did not constitute an aggravated felony requiring the loss to exceed 
the bia vacated the ij order after concluding that the amount of restitution james on conduct included in the indictment psr and judgment of constituted the proper amount to use in determining the amount of loss to the victims citing khalayleh ins the bia reasoned that the amount of loss should be calculated based on the total loss from an entire fraudulent scheme,and the restitution amount relates directly to the losses suffered by various financial institutions resulting from james fraudulent check writing scheme.
in khalayleh,the alien was indicted on four counts of bank fraud,stemming from a scheme in violation of each of the indictment four counts incorporated language alleging a scheme by the alien to defraud two colorado banks by depositing bad checks drawn on other accounts,depositing them into the two colorado bank accounts,and,then,writing several checks for his personal of which formed the bases for the four counts with which the alien was charged the alien pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment which listed a check in the amount of importantly,in the plea,the alien agreed to pay restitution in the amount of actual loss,to be determined by the court at sentencing which the court determined to be 
the tenth circuit determined that since the counts with which the alien was charged did not allege discrete instances of fraud involving only one check,but rather alleged a scheme to defraud that involved numerous checks,the total amount of all of the checks resulted in the proper amount of loss to the victims for the purposes of a m i in the instant case,similar to khalayleh,james indictment alleges a scheme to defraud,and neither party suggests that the plea agreement defines the amount of actual loss by either limiting the loss to count one or expanding the loss to the restitution amount 
additionally,james attacks the predicate of the restitution psr.he reurges his objection to the psr which allegedly shows the amount of restitution ordered did not constitute the actual loss but,rather,represented the broader intended loss.james argues that the evidence of intended loss,which inflated the amount of restitution was,in part,based on outdated handwritten wire transfer requests and counterfeit checks found in his car.this contention is specious.the psr documents an intended loss totaling more than.out of an abundance of caution,the evidence of expired transfer requests for was not included this amount.moreover,the restitution amount accounts only for executed fraudulent losses to first flight federal credit union,china trust bank,and first community credit well exceeds the statutory floor.
james conviction satisfies the requirements of a m i,and we,therefore,lack jurisdiction to grant review of the removal decision on this ground.
james argues that independent jurisdiction exists to consider the alternative question of whether the bia can order petitioner removed in the first remanding the case to the ij for further proceedings and without addressing relief from removal.james avers that if the bia acted ultra vires in ordering him removed,jurisdiction exists to assess the validity of the removal order even if the aggravated felony conclusion remains intact we retain jurisdiction over substantial constitutional claims or questions of law,even in cases involving orders of removal otherwise removed from our consideration by the jurisdiction stripping provisions of ina a 
the government responds,arguing that james failed to exhaust his claim in the administrative and contending that the failure to raise the issue before the bia or in a motion to reopen precludes our exercising jurisdiction.specifically,the government contends that james forfeited his argument because he had sufficient opportunity to respond to the government explicit request that the bia order removal the government further argues that the error was merely procedural and fully correctable by the bia if presented with the objection,the bia could have remanded so that the ij could enter the order of removal,obviating any concern.we are not persuaded that adequate notice existed,such that james should have anticipated and,thus,forfeited his argument by not raising it before the bia prior to the ruling which created the alleged error.the government only requested in passing that the bia order removal,with no discussion of the merits of the request also,we have held that a motion to reopen is not a remedy available by right generally a motion to reopen is not required to exhaust administrative remedies under the act.james did not fail to exhaust his administrative remedies,and we find the issue here amenable to our consideration.
james argues that the bia lacked statutory authority to order him removed,rendering the order a legal nullity,such that not addressing the issue would substantiate a void removal order citing the ninth circuit case,james argues that no final order of removal yet exists to affirm.in two recent cases,we addressed a related circumstance in which the bia ordered removal,reversing the ij,after the ij had found the alien deportable but subsequently granted relief from removal we held that,where the bia reverses an ij grant of discretionary relief and gives effect to the ij original removal order,the bia has merely effected the original removal order.we explicitly distinguished from,leaving open the question of whether the bia may order removal when the ij never ruled on deportability in the first instance.likewise,our opinion in depends on this same distinction 
we now adopt the reasoning of the ninth circuit,as stated in section ii b of.with the exception of a provision allowing the attorney general to order certain aliens removed,the statutory framework of the ina conveys that only an ij may enter an order of removal in the first instance 
an immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien unless otherwise specified in this chapter,a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be removed from the united states 
we reject james contention that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
