background 
procedural history 
huang,now a native and citizen of china,entered the united states on july,as a conditional permanent resident on the basis of her marriage to john higgins higgins,a united states citizen.more than a year earlier,in march,when higgins took a trip to china accompanied by huang,huang had married higgins in china.
on april,huang and higgins submitted a joint petition to remove the conditions on residence.on november,frank ledda ledda,an adjudications officer of the former immigration and naturalization service ins,interviewed huang and higgins in michigan regarding their joint petition.that same day,after questioning,higgins submitted a sworn statement to ledda,stating that he was paid to marry huang,that he did not know that marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws was illegal,that he and huang had never lived together or consummated the marriage,and that huang lived in new york while he lived in michigan.
on november,the ins issued a notice to appear to huang,charging her with being subject to removal from the united states because her status as a conditional permanent resident had terminated pursuant to ina a d i,a d i.the ins also charged that huang was subject to removal under ina a g ii,a g ii,for gaining admission to the united states on the basis of a fraudulent marriage.
on june,huang and higgins were divorced by a judgment issued in grand rapids,michigan.
on april,at a scheduling hearing,huang attorney stated that huang intended to seek the removal of her conditional status on the basis of a marriage but that she did not intend to seek asylum or any other relief.nonetheless,at huang merits hearing on may,huang submitted an application for asylum and for withholding of removal pursuant to the ina and the cat.
huang based her application for asylum on the following claims that on october,she married yifei fong a naturalized citizen,in new york that she cared for fong son,who was born in and that on november,she and fong had a child together named oscar fong.the merits hearing on may,thus proceeded in two steps.first,the ij considered the nature of huang marriage to higgins,with the government contending that huang was removable from the country on the basis of fraudulently entering the marriage with higgins and with huang arguing that this marriage was in good faith and that the ij should grant her application for the removal of the conditions on residence on the basis of a marriage.second,the hearing then concerned huang application for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina and the cat.on the issue of the nature of huang marriage to higgins,the government presented testimony from ledda,higgins,and huang.huang testimony also pertained to her applications for asylum and withholding of removal,and following her testimony,huang purported new husband fong testified.
on june,the ij issued an oral decision finding that huang had fraudulently entered marriage with higgins for the purpose of circumventing the immigration laws and that she was therefore removable.the ij also denied huang applications for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered that she be removed from the united states.huang timely appealed to the bia from the ij decision.
in august,huang filed with the bia a motion to reopen and remand based on changed circumstances,claiming that huang was pregnant with a second child with fong.in her brief to the bia filed in july,huang also moved to remand for adjustment of status based on her marriage to fong in october.in august,and again in october,huang filed additional materials with the bia in support of her motions to remand,claiming that newly discovered evidence indicated that chinese nationals with children born in the united states would be treated the same as chinese nationals with children born in china.pet r br.at.
on january,the bia dismissed huang appeal and denied huang motions to remand.huang timely filed a petition for review of the bia decision with this court.on march,huang filed with us a motion to remand her case to the bia and to supplement the record,and on march,huang filed a motion with the bia to reopen and remand her case to the ij.
b.the hearing before the immigration judge 
at the start of the may hearing,the ij observed that huang application for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina and the cat lacked information and documentation in several crucial areas.in particular,the ij noted that,although the birth of a child in november was a predicate for her claim,huang had failed to file a birth certificate for the child,nor was the child present at the hearing.joint appendix.at hr g tr.at see also at oral decision at.
after discussion of huang application,the government presented evidence that huang marriage to higgins was fraudulent.ledda,the adjudications officer who interviewed huang and higgins in november,was the government first witness.ledda testified about his recollections of that interview,during which he became suspicious about the nature of huang and higgins marriage because they submitted minimal evidence in support of their petition to remove the conditions on her residence and there was no t what i consider real convincing evidence to place her in michigan or to establish she had a life in michigan.at ledda,hr g tr.at.huang had described a trip to new york to visit her sister,and when ledda asked for the address of huang sister in new york,higgins produced what appeared to be a business card and began reading information from it.ledda asked to see the card and found that the card contained huang name and what appeared to be contact information for huang in new york.the card also contained a social security number for huang,and the prefix showed that it had been issued in new york.
ledda testified that he then separated the couple,and at that point higgins admitted that his prior statements about the marriage were false and stated that the marriage was a fraud that had been arranged by his,that he had been paid money to go to china and marry,they had never lived together,she had never lived in michigan.at ledda,hr g tr.at.ledda stated that higgins further admitted that the evidence they submitted,such as the bank account was opened at the request of his,but only higgins had access to that account.at ledda,hr g tr.at.higgins gave a sworn written statement and his answers to ledda questions were memorialized in a typed statement.
higgins testified next at the hearing.higgins testified that he was paid to marry huang by her family,at higgins,hr g tr.at,that he and huang never had sexual relations,that he understood the situation as a marriage for her to get a green card,at higgins,hr g tr.at,that he had few sober moments on his trip to china and could not definitively remember any marriage ceremony,at higgins,hr g tr.at,that he was not even sure when huang ultimately entered the united states,having lost contact with huang and her family in the period following his brief visit to china,and that he bought a camaro with money that he received from huang family.higgins also testified that he and huang opened a joint bank account the day before filing the joint petition to remove the conditions on residence in april.higgins stated that he and huang divorced in.
huang then testified that her marriage to higgins was bona fide,that her mother is a citizen,that her father has a green card,and that her parents live in new york and have been living in the united states for more than ten years.huang also stated that she has two sisters and that all of her family has been in the united states since.huang testified that,although her entire family was living in the united states,the benefit of moving closer to her family was a factor that did come to my mind when she married higgins,a virtual stranger.at huang,hr g tr.at.
in regard to her application for asylum and withholding of removal,huang testified that she and her current fong,whom she stated she married on october,a child born on november.at huang,hr g tr.at.huang also testified that she cared for a son that fong fathered with another woman in.huang testified that her husband,her sisters,and her parents,who have had three children,have traveled to china several times in the recent past and had not experienced any problems in china despite having more than one child.huang claimed that she would be sterilized if she returned to china,but she admitted that she did not have any evidence of a government policy to that effect.huang testified that she did not marry her current husband to have children,as having children was something that never came to my mind.at huang,hr g tr.at.huang stated that she and her current husband fong would like to have one more child.if it a girl,that okay,but if it boy,maybe we will have some more.at huang,hr g tr.at.
the final witness to testify at the hearing was fong,huang purported second husband.he stated that he had a son born in china in and that he and huang had a son born in november.at fong,hr g tr.at.fong claimed that both children would be attributed to huang for the purpose of china policies,but stated that he had not brought any evidence of such policies to the hearing.at,fong,hr g tr.at.fong testified that he and huang had agreed to have t wo more children,at fong,hr g tr.at,and that he would not have married huang if she had been unable to conceive a child.at fong,hr g tr.at.
the ij also considered documentary evidence,including the department of state country report on human rights practices for china,as well as various articles pertaining to china policies.at oral decision at.two days prior to the may hearing,huang submitted a affidavit by the demographer john aird,but the ij declined to consider it because huang filed it in an untimely fashion.at oral decision at.
c.the ij decision 
the merits hearing concluded on may,and the ij rendered an oral decision on june.as he had at the merits hearing,the ij discussed several deficiencies in huang application for asylum and withholding of removal huang never submitted an original marriage registration regarding her purported marriage to fong her asylum application listed their marriage date as october,while testimony indicated that they married on october,and huang attorney had,in a july hearing,represented that the two were already married huang had not filled out the section of her asylum application with information regarding her alleged husband status no evidence had been presented to indicate that fong son born in existed or that huang had adopted him and no evidence demonstrated that huang and fong had a child in november.at,oral decision at,at july,hr g tr.at huang attorney statement that s he is married to somebody else now.
the ij denied huang application for asylum as untimely given the statutory filing deadline,which is subject to certain exceptions for applications filed within a reasonable time of certain changed circumstances.at oral decision at citing ina a b,a b.further,the ij found that huang had failed to prove the applicability of the exception to the filing requirement because she failed to prove the existence of either alleged triggering second marriage to fong or the birth of a child in november.at oral decision at see also at oral decision at stating that there is no documentary proof that this child exists.even assuming the existence of those events,the ij found that her asylum application was not filed until it was completed on the day of the hearing in may and that the delay between the alleged triggering events in november and the filing in may was not a reasonable period of time.at oral decision at.finally,the ij denied all of her applications on their merits,finding that huang had failed to prove that china would consider an adopted child a child in applying its allegedly coercive policies.id.the ij also concluded that huang and fong had not demonstrated that they would have or would want anymore children with respect to this marriage because they can not get the story straight as to how many children they want.plus,of course,we already know that huang,she says,we did get married to have children,and he says,yes.we got married to have children.id.
in regard to the alleged fraudulent marriage between huang and higgins,the ij found that the government had satisfied its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that huang fraudulently entered a marriage for the purpose of securing admission to the united states.at oral decision at.the ij concluded that all of the evidence taken together aptly demonstrates beyond any doubt in the court mind that the first marriage was done to secure immigration benefits,noting among other things the paucity of any evidence that they have a joint life together.at oral decision at.
d.the bia decision 
on january,the bia dismissed huang appeal and denied her motions to remand.at.the bia adopt ed and affirm ed the ij decision that huang marriage to higgins was not a marriage and that huang failed to demonstrate eligibility for removal of conditional permanent residence on the basis of good faith marriage.at.as to huang application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,the ij findings of fact have not been shown to be clearly erroneous,and we are not persuaded that the ij otherwise erred in ruling that huang failed to meet her burden of establishing eligibility for the relief sought.at.in particular,the bia concluded that the ij correctly denied the asylum application as untimely.id.
the bia also affirm ed the ij decision to deny withholding of removal and relief under the cat.id.the bia stated that huang failed to demonstrate past persecution because she did not suffer any serious harm before leaving her native china and l ikewise,huang failed to submit sufficient evidence reflecting that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of her opposition to china coercive population control policies or any other protected ground,or that she would be tortured upon return to china.id.
finally,the bia denied both of huang motions to remand.as to her motion to remand to allow her to apply for an adjustment of status based upon her marriage in october to fong,a citizen,the bia cited its decision in matter of velarde,bia,to support its conclusion that the requirements with respect to evidence that is to accompany a motion to remand have not been met in this case,noting also that the dhs opposes huang motion because she previously perpetrated marriage fraud.at.regarding huang motion to remand to reapply for asylum on the basis of a second child born in the united states,the bia cited its decision in matter of,bia,in concluding that huang has failed to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that her subjective fear of harm on account of her opposition to china coercive population control policies is objectively reasonable.at.
huang motion to remand to the bia 
on march,huang filed in this court a motion to remand her case to the bia and to supplement the record,claiming that the petition for review in this matter depends in large measure upon whether or not deference is owed to the bia decision in re,bia and in re,bia.pet r mot.to remand at unnumbered page.she argues that these decisions rely in turn on the may department of state profile of asylum claims and country conditions for china profile,which she asserts contains significant translation errors that make the fujian province family planning regulation appear less coercive than a correct translation would indicate.pet r mot.to remand at.the government filed a response opposing the motion,contending that huang had not exhausted her available administrative remedies.huang filed a reply claiming that on march,she filed a motion with the bia to reopen and remand her case to the ij based on the same alleged mistranslations.as an alternative to our remanding her case to the bia,huang requested that we hold her case in abeyance pending the outcome of her motion to reopen and remand filed with the bia.
ii.analysis 
huang appeal of the denial of her application for removal of conditions on residence 
the first issue in huang appeal concerns the nature of her marriage to higgins and the ij decision on this issue,which the bia adopt ed and affirm ed.at bia decision at.the government contended that huang was removable from the on the basis of fraudulently entering the marriage with higgins,whereas huang argued that the marriage was entered in good faith and that the ij should grant her application for the removal of the conditions on residence on the basis of a marriage.the ij found that huang marriage to higgins was undoubtedly fraudulent and therefore concluded that huang claim for a good faith waiver crumbles under its own weight.at oral decision at.
legal standards 
under a and d,if an alien has been granted conditional status based on a marriage to a united states citizen,the alien and her spouse must petition within a period before the second anniversary of the alien obtaining the status to have the conditions removed.after review of the petition and interview of the spouses,the attorney general may make a favorable determination and then shall remove the conditional basis of the status.c b.however,the conditional status shall be terminated if the attorney general determines that the marriage was entered into for the purpose of procuring an alien admission as an immigrant.b.the alien is then entitled to request review of that adverse determination in a proceeding to remove the alien from the,and the burden of proof shall be on the attorney general to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence that the marriage was entered to procure the alien admission.b.an alien may also seek a hardship waiver to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status by demonstrating inter alia that the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but the qualifying marriage has been terminated and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements for removal of the conditional basis.c.
where the bia adopts the ij reasoning,the court reviews the ij decision directly to determine whether the decision of the bia should be upheld on appeal.gilaj gonzales,cir citing denko ins,cir.
on appeal,we review to determine whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings underlying the ij decision regarding the nature of the marriage between huang and higgins.see gonzales,cir see also acheampong keisler,cir.a reviewing court may reverse the bia determination if the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.gilaj,at quoting ouda ins,cir.under this standard,a factual determination by the board that an alien marriage was entered for the purpose of gaining entry into the united states is conclusive if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record considered as a whole.acheampong.at quoting bazzi ashcroft,cir alteration in original.
as detailed above,the ij found that the overwhelming evidence beyond any doubt in the court view is that huang marriage to higgins was done merely to secure her lawful permanent resident status and that therefore huang claim for a good faith waiver crumbles under its own weight.at,oral decision at.on this portion of huang appeal,the bia simply adopted the ij reasoning,at bia decision at,and we thus review the ij decision.gilaj,at.huang arguments that her marriage to higgins was in good faith are unpersuasive and fail to satisfy the deferential standard of review that applies in this case.
in challenging the ij finding that her marriage to higgins was not in good faith,huang argues that her own testimony provided no reason to believe that she entered into her marriage to john higgins for the primary purpose of circumventing immigration laws,pet r br.at,and she then simply asserts that the ij should have deemed incredible higgins testimony that he did view their marriage as simply intended to procure her entry into the united states,pet r br.at.huang then incorrectly states that the ij erred in concluding that their marriage was fraudulent because higgins testimony was the only basis for the finding of marriage fraud.pet r br.at emphasis added.this statement wholly ignores that significant other evidence demonstrated the fraudulent nature of the marriage between higgins and huang,including testimony at the hearing offered by ledda,the officer who interviewed higgins and huang in,as well as the documentary evidence produced at that time,including higgins sworn statement that the marriage was fraudulent,the bank record of an essentially empty joint account,and the business card containing contact information for huang in new york and a new social security number for huang.huang failure to address these other significant bases for the ij finding that the marriage was fraudulent and not in good faith is fatal to her appeal.
we therefore hold that substantial evidence supported the ij finding that the marriage between huang and higgins was not entered into in good faith but rather was entered into for the purpose of procuring huang admission as an immigrant.b a i.thus,we deny review of the bia affirmance of the ij decision to terminate huang status.
huang appeals the denial of her application for asylum,but the government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review the ij and bia determination that huang application for asylum was untimely filed.we agree that we lack jurisdiction to review huang asylum claim.
the ina requires that an asylum applicant demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.a b.this requirement is subject to exceptions in cases when the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the required period.a d.another section of provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general regarding whether changed or extraordinary circumstances exist to excuse an application for asylum that is filed later than one year after entry into the united states.a.
in this case,the ij explicitly denied huang asylum application on the basis that it was not timely filed and that no changed or extraordinary circumstances excused the delay.at,oral decision at.the bia agreed that the asylum application was untimely.
we have held that a bar s our review of asylum applications denied for untimeliness only when the appeal seeks review of discretionary or factual questions,but not when the appeal seeks review of constitutional claims or matters of statutory construction.almuhtaseb gonzales,cir construing limitation of a in light of real id act amendment to a d.in almuhtaseb,we held that we lacked jurisdiction to consider an alien application for asylum based on changed circumstances pertaining to violence in the west bank because that petitioner argument regarding changed circumstances was predominantly factual.id.at quoting ramadan gonzales,cir.
here,the bia stated that,with regard to huang application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,t he immigration judge findings of fact have not been shown to be clearly erroneous.at bia decision at.the ij found that huang had failed to prove the existence of either her marriage to fong or the birth of her son and that,even assuming the existence of these events,huang delay in filing her asylum application from november to may constituted an unreasonable delay.at oral decision at stating that the trigger event,the marriage to fong has not been proven,and the subsequent two children of the marriage which have not been proven and that huang can not prove the trigger event,and even if she could,she can not prove that it was done in a reasonable period of time.the bia agreed with the ij finding that the asylum application was not timely filed,stating that the application was not filed within a reasonable period of time after the birth of her child in november and that t hus,the immigration judge correctly denied the asylum application as untimely.at bia decision at.
huang argument regarding changed circumstances is predominantly factual,almuhtaseb,at quoting ramadan,at,and accordingly we hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial on the ground of untimeliness of huang application for asylum.therefore we dismiss huang petition insofar as it seeks review of the denial of asylum.
withholding of removal under the ina and the cat 
legal standards 
we review the bia decision on a request for withholding of removal under the same standard regardless of whether the request was made pursuant to the ina or the cat.almuhtaseb,at.to prevail on a petition for withholding of removal under the ina,or on a petition for withholding of removal under the cat,an alien must show that there is a clear probability that she would be subject to persecution,for the ina,or to torture,for the cat,on the basis of one of the five statutorily protected grounds were she removed from this country.kouljinski keisler,cir.this showing of clear probability requires more than that needed to demonstrate refugee status,which requires only a fear of future persecution.id.quoting b.the regulations define the clear probability standard as requiring that a n applicant who has not suffered past persecution establish that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted or tortured on the basis of one of the protected grounds upon her return.b.
when the bia does not summarily affirm or adopt the ij reasoning and provide s an explanation for its decision,we review the bia decision as the final agency determination.mukasey,cir see also cordova gonzales,cir.in reviewing the decision of the bia,we must treat administrative findings of fact as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
finally,although the government challenged huang eligibility to apply for asylum,the government notes that n otwithstanding ineligibility for asylum an alien may still apply for withholding of removal.resp t br.at citing c.
the ij and the bia both denied huang application for withholding of removal under the ina and the cat,but it appears that the bia did not entirely adopt and affirm the ij reasoning.see at bia decision at inasmuch as we are in agreement with the outcome of the ij decision,we affirm his decision to deny withholding of removal under the ina and relief under the cat.emphasis added given that the bia provided its own explanation and did not fully adopt and affirm the ij reasoning in regard to huang application for withholding of removal under the ina and the cat,we review the bia reasoning.see,at cordova.at.
the bia provided the following reasoning for its decision regarding huang application for withholding of removal under the ina and the cat.the bia observed that huang did not suffer any serious harm before leaving her native china in july and t hus,she failed to demonstrate past persecution.at bia decision at.the bia then found that huang failed to submit sufficient evidence reflecting that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of her opposition to china coercive population control policies or any other protected ground,or that she would be tortured upon her return to china.id.further,in its discussion rejecting huang motion to remand to allow her to reapply for asylum on the basis of the birth in of her second child with fong,the bia cited its decision in matter of,bia,to support its conclusion that huang failed to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that her subjective fear of harm on account of her opposition to china coercive population control policies is objectively reasonable.id.
in matter of,the bia criticized the same affidavit of the retired demographer,john aird,that huang submitted to the bia with her august motion to reopen and remand.see at aird aff.dated in matter of,the bia noted that aird affidavit is not based on personal knowledge,provides only generalized statements that chinese citizens who entered the united states illegally would be subject to the same punishments that apply to chinese couples who violate the family planning laws in china,and lacks any example of a woman being sterilized because she returned to china with a child born abroad.at.in matter of,the bia also observed that the latest documents on country conditions issued by the state department conflict with the views of aird.id.at.the bia additionally stated that american diplomats in china are unaware of any cases in which returnees from the united states were forced to undergo sterilization procedures on their return.id.at quoting bureau of democracy,human rights labor,dep t of state,china profile of asylum claims and country conditions.
the finding that children born outside of china are not counted for purposes of china policies continues to be accepted by the bia,as well as by other courts of appeals.see in re,bia we therefore find that the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the chinese government has a national policy of requiring forced sterilization of parents who return with a second child born outside of china.in re,bia referring to evidence indicat ing that children born abroad,if not registered as permanent residents of china are not counted against the number of children allowed by china family planning policy quoting letter from julieta valls noyes,director,office of multilateral and global affairs,bureau of democracy,human rights and labor,dep t of state,to randa zagzoug,deputy chief counsel,aie wu mukasey,wl,at cir,referring to dep t of state report finding that there is no evidence that returnees from the united states are being forced to undergo sterilization and to dep t of state report that chinese regulations stipulate that children born overseas are not counted for purposes of administering the family planning policy song wang keisler,cir same.
in her brief,huang compresses into a single section all of her arguments pertaining to asylum,withholding of removal under the ina,and withholding of removal under the cat.pet r br.at.nowhere in that section does she confront the ij finding that she failed to prove the existence of her marriage to fong or of the birth of a child with fong.id but because the bia did not refer to the ij findings on this issue and instead rested its decision on finding that huang failed to submit sufficient evidence showing that china policies would be applied to her on account of an adopted child or children,huang failure to contest the ij findings on the existence of her marriage to and children with fong is not fatal to her appeal.in any event,huang argument mainly relies upon the and aird affidavits,and she fails to demonstrate that evidence in the record compels the conclusion that the bia incorrectly determined that china policies would not be applied against huang.
we therefore conclude that she is not entitled to withholding of removal under either the ina or the cat.thus we deny her petition for review of the bia adverse decision on these grounds.
d.the bia denial of huang motion to remand based on changed circumstances 
standard of review 
the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider a removal order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.denko ins,cir.an abuse of discretion can be shown when the ij or board off
