petitioners seek review of a decision by the secretary of the department of transportation granting a license for a liquified natural gas lng facility in the gulf of mexico under the deepwater port act,et.petitioners submit two issues for review.first,they contend that the environmental impact statement eis prepared by the secretary as required by the national environmental policy act nepa,et,was deficient in that it did not adequately consider the environmental impacts of the proposed action.more particularly,petitioners contend the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the effects of three potential future projects in the gulf of mexico were too speculative to consider in evaluating the cumulative impact of the licensing decision under nepa.second,petitioners argue that the secretary violated the deepwater port act by failing to require that the proposed facility use a closed loop system,which they assert is the best available technology to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the marine environment.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the secretary did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the effects of three potential future projects were speculative in light of the uncertainty regarding whether they would be constructed,and if constructed,whether they would use an open loop or closed loop system to warm the lng.we also conclude that the secretary did not violate the best available technology requirement of the deepwater port act.we therefore deny the petition for review.
background 
on november,gulf landing llc filed a complete application with the secretary of transportation pursuant to the deepwater port act,for a license to operate a deepwater off the coast of louisiana,miles south of cameron,described in more detail below.the facility will receive liquid natural gas,store it,regasify it by heating,and transfer it to existing pipelines for delivery to the gulf coast.it will be located in feet of water and will consist of two units fixed to the seabed,including two lng storage tanks.the lng will be vaporized using open rack vaporizers.this system,known as an open loop system,will heat the lng by pumping warm seawater to the top of each open rack vaporizer and allowing it to flow down panels,in which lng is flowing through tubes,warming and regasifying the lng.a closed loop system,by contrast,burns natural gas to heat water which is used repeatedly to heat the lng.
because open loop systems require the uptake and release of a large volume of seawater,they affect the marine environment,primarily by entrapping fish,fish eggs,and larvae in the intake screens,decreasing water temperature,and emitting agents necessary for production into the water.a closed loop system,while more expensive to run,is friendlier to the environment in most respects 
the facility will be located in what the noaa fisheries service has considered the fertile fisheries crescent,the most biologically productive area in the gulf of mexico marine ecosystem.accordingly,the facility will affect many types of animals,including fish,turtles,mammals,and birds.of primary concern is the red drum,a popular not commonly fished commercially.according to the final environmental impact statement feis for the project,the gulf landing facility alone could destroy annually a number of red drum equal to of louisiana annual red drum fish harvest 
under the deepwater port act,the secretary has approximately one year after receiving a complete application to issue a decision.c,g,i.during this time,he must take various steps,including conducting an environmental review and issuing an environmental impact statement eis under nepa and holding a public hearing.id.
as part of this process,the secretary published notice of availability of the draft eis in the federal register on june,and issued the feis in november.at the time the feis was issued,five other applications had been submitted for similar facilities in the gulf of mexico in following nepa mandate that an eis take into account cumulative effects from reasonably foreseeable future actions,the secretary took into account only two of the five pending applications.the secretary considered the other three applications too speculative,and two of the other three as too geographically distant from the gulf landing project as well 
on january,the noaa fisheries service wrote to the secretary that a license decision without analysis of the cumulative impacts from the other three facilities would not be adequately evaluated and that the draft eis and feis should have analyzed the cumulative impact from those facilities.it also stated in a letter that the open loop system was not the more environmentally responsible action a s we have consistently stated in our previous comments on this project,we are convinced that the use of a closed loop system would greatly reduce ecological impacts and yield a stronger,more environmentally responsible action.louisiana governor kathleen blanco,the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries,the gulf states marine fisheries commission,and the gulf of mexico fishery management council expressed the same two concerns in a letter to the secretary 
despite these concerns,the secretary approved the gulf landing license on february,subject to certain conditions and environmental monitoring requirements.on april,the petitioners filed a petition in this court,pursuant to the deepwater port act,arguing that the secretary should have analyzed the cumulative impact from the other three proposed lng facilities and that a closed loop system should have been required for the license to issue.
ii.standard of review 
when reviewing the adequacy of an eis,we are mindful that nepa guarantees a process,not a certain result as such,this court has set forth three considerations 
whether the agency in good faith objectively has taken a hard look at the environmental consequences of a proposed action and alternatives whether the eis provides detail sufficient to allow those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and consider the pertinent environmental influences involves and whether the eis explanation of alternatives is sufficient to permit a reasoned choice among different courses of action.

iii.cumulative impacts analysis under nepa 
we first address petitioners contention that the secretary failed to adequately consider the cumulative impact of the gulf landing deepwater port with three other ports for which applications were filed.under the deepwater port act,organizations wishing to construct the type of facility contemplated here must apply to the secretary of transportation for a license.a.as part of the approval process,the act requires the secretary to prepare an eis pursuant to nepa.f.in accord with nepa,the secretary must include a detailed statement of the environmental impacts of the proposed actions.c i.impacts include ecological aesthetic,historic,cultural,economic,social,or health,whether direct,indirect,or cumulative.cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions and can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.emphasis added.
when analyzing cumulative impacts of a proposed action,we have held that an agency should consider 
the area in which the effects of the proposed project will be felt 
the impacts that are expected in that area from the proposed project 
other,proposed,and reasonably have had or are expected to have impacts in the same area 
the impacts or expected impacts from these other actions and 
the overall impact that can be expected if the individual impacts are allowed to accumulate.

in issuing the feis for the gulf landing project,the secretary limited his analysis of cumulative impacts to the two ports for which an approved public draft nepa document was available for review at the time of the draft eis for gulf landing.the secretary therefore did not consider the impact of the three facilities for which applications had been filed but the consideration of the application had not progressed to the draft eis stage he reasoned that i t would not be reasonable to speculate on the quantitative or qualitative configurations of an application until an approved public draft evaluation was available for review.he also excluded two of those three ports on the independent rationale that they were too geographically distant from the gulf landing port,finding that t he mississippi river discharge plume is approximately miles east of the proposed gulf landing port and,in this case,represents a reasonable biological boundary for assessment of cumulative impacts.
the petitioners argue that the secretary decision to exclude consideration of the three ports for which applications had been filed was arbitrary and capricious.they contend that the effects of the proposed projects are not speculative because the details required in an application give the secretary ample information to evaluate the effects of the projects 
appellants also argue that the dire need for natural gas,the sums expended by the applicants the expense entailed in preparing such applications,and the financial stability of the applicants make the projects sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take them into account in reaching a decision.city of shoreacres,at.
the secretary argues that he was not arbitrary or capricious in declining to consider the effects of the three projects for which draft eiss were not available.the secretary acknowledges that absolute certainty that a project will come to fruition is not required in order to include it in the cumulative impact analysis.he argues,however,that a line must be drawn somewhere,and he has drawn the line such that projects without a final license are to be considered,but only after a draft eis is available.specifically,the secretary contends that the deepwater port act requires so many steps after the filing of an application that until a draft eis is available,there is insufficient certainty about the project future construction and environmental consequences to include it in the cumulative impact calculus.he argues that accepting petitioners argument would require the secretary to engage in four layers of speculation.
first,the secretary would have to presume that information provided by the applicant is sufficient for consideration,without the independent analysis by the secretary mandated by the act.he points out that this analysis is not superficial or perfunctory for example the act requires expertise from a number of different agencies second,the secretary may decide to deny the license or impose conditions on it that alter the project environmental effects.he argues that one of the conditions may even be a change from open loop to closed loop technology,or,a change with significant environmental effects third,the act imposes requirements beyond the secretary control that may require him to deny or impose conditions on a license.for example,the license can not issue if the epa informs the secretary that the project does not comply with environmental statutes or if the governor of the adjacent state timely indicates disapproval.c.fourth,even if a license issues,the facility may never be built,because of the cost of the project,a volatile market or because of unanticipated conditions the secretary imposes on construction the secretary argues that while he could have cast his net wider,it was not arbitrary or capricious for him to cast it where he did because of the above uncertainties.
finally,intervenor,conocophillips points to the continued monitoring requirements,imposed by the secretary requiring the operator to mitigate undue environmental damage.pointing to the short,window given to the secretary to act on an application,it also argues that with these time constraints the secretary could not have taken into account the three speculative ports,and that the secretary can not be expected to consider applications filed up until the date it completes its eis.
we agree that the secretary did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when he included only two of the five ports for which applications were filed.we recognize the high demand for natural gas and these lng ports,thereby increasing the possibility that the ports will be built.we also recognize that the companies which have filed the applications certainly have the resources to build the ports.
however,the secretary was entitled to conclude that the occurrence of any one of a number of contingencies could cause the plans to build the ports to be cancelled or drastically altered for example,one or more of the applicants may decide for a number of reasons to withdraw its application before the secretary approval,such as exxonmobil did with its application for the pearl crossing gbs platform the secretary,after receiving input from other agencies,may deny an application or make changes to the application construction specifications such as demanding that the port be closed loop rather than open loop.the technology in this area is also advancing rapidly and may change the effects of the planned ports.finally,based on public statements and correspondence from louisiana governor kathleen blanco,the secretary was aware that she might well decide to veto any open loop port approved by the secretary 
under the facts presented to us and under the deferential standard which we review the agency determination,we find that the secretary did not abuse his discretion or act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the three ports were not reasonably foreseeable future actions,or,as this court has put it,actions that a person of ordinary prudence would take into account in reaching a decision.city of shoreacres,at 
we next address petitioners argument that the secretary violated the deepwater port act by issuing a license for a facility that does not require the best available technology,so as to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the marine environment,as required by the act.
under c of the act,the secretary may issue a license if 
he determines that the applicant can and will comply with applicable laws,regulations,and license conditions 
he determines that the construction and operation of the deepwater port will be in the national interest and consistent with national security and other national policy goals and objectives,including energy sufficiency and environmental quality 
he determines,in accordance with the environmental review criteria established pursuant to section of this title,that the applicant has demonstrated that the deepwater port will be constructed and operated using best available technology,so as to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the mari
