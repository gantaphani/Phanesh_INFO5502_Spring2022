power fuels,llc,petitions for review of a final order of the federal mine safety and health review commission.power fuels operates a facility that receives,blends,stores,and delivers coal to meet the specifications of a power plant located across the road.the department of labor mine safety and health administration msha asserted jurisdiction over the facility under the federal mine safety and health act of mine act.
the mine act covers operators of a coal or other mine,including facilities engaged in the work of preparing coal.h c,i.power fuels challenged the secretary of labor assignment of jurisdiction to msha,rather than to the nonspecialized occupational safety and health administration osha.we hold that the secretary permissibly concluded that a facility that blends coal for a nearby power plant was subject to the mine act.because the mine act covers this kind of activity,msha assertion of jurisdiction was proper.we therefore deny the petition for review.
the parties do not dispute the facts underlying this case.in any event,we will sustain the commission factual findings so long as they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.a.
power fuels owns and operates a terminal in wise county,virginia.at this site,power fuels receives,tests,weighs,samples,mixes,blends,stores,loads,and transports coal for its customer,virginia electric and power company,doing business as dominion virginia power.dominion runs a power plant,the virginia city hybrid energy center,which produces electricity from coal and biomass.power fuels blending terminal and dominion plant are situated on adjoining properties.
power fuels works as a contractor for dominion under a formal agreement.the products provided by power fuels include coal and coal refuse,or gob.power fuels mixes an estimated average of eight thousand tons of coal per day for dominion at the blending terminal,and the facility stores an supply of fuel for dominion use.dominion owns all the coal that power fuels prepares.approximately eighty percent of the fuel consumed at dominion plant passes through power fuels blending terminal,while the remaining twenty percent comes to the plant from other locations.
power fuels blends the coal according to the precise specifications provided daily by dominion to ensure a proper reaction at the power plant.after the coal arrives,power fuels samples it and moves the material into separate piles,and it then uses equipment at the facility to blend the coal as directed by dominion.dominion orders specify,for example,the number of buckets of each material to be used in the desired blend,as well as moisture,ash,sulfur,and btu content.under the companies agreement,power fuels may recommend modifications of dominion order,but it must blend the coal as instructed unless dominion decides to change the specifications for that day.power fuels then tests the product.based on the test results,dominion may alter the order,in which case power fuels blends and tests the pile again until it meets dominion needs.the facility does not extract,crush,size,screen,or wash coal during this process.finally,trucks transport the finished products across the road,from the blending terminal to dominion power plant.
dominion plant and power fuels terminal both began operations in.the following year,an inspector from msha noticed trucks delivering coal to the power fuels site.the agency was unaware at the time of any facilities operating there.an investigator from msha then visited the site and observed that power fuels was blending,storing,and loading coal for the power plant across the road.following a review by msha and the department of labor office of the solicitor,the secretary determined that the blending terminal was subject to msha jurisdiction.
once msha asserted jurisdiction,the agency began performing inspections of the facility.in april,an inspector issued three citations to power fuels for violations of msha standards involving the trucks braking systems and warning devices.see c,b.the agency assessed a civil penalty of one hundred dollars for each citation.msha later imposed additional citations on power fuels,but the contests of those citations have been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
power fuels contested the three initial citations on the ground that it was not the operator of a mine for the purposes of the mine act,and that msha consequently lacked jurisdiction.in november,an administrative law judge for the federal mine safety and health review commission held an evidentiary hearing.in a march decision,the alj concluded that power fuels was engaged in the work of preparing the coal under the mine act.h c,i.the alj took particular note of the fact that the testing,blending,and as necessary,are directly accomplished in order to e nsure and maintain the consistent quality of the coal pursuant to dominion quality specifications.the alj accordingly ruled that msha jurisdictional assertion was proper,and he affirmed the citations and accompanying penalties.
power fuels filed a petition for discretionary review with the commission.the commission declined to grant review,and consequently the alj decision became the final order of the commission.see d.power fuels now petitions for review in this court.see id.a.
the mine act specifically protects the safety and health of individuals who work in a coal or other mine.h c see id.but even before msha asserted jurisdiction under the mine act,power fuels blending terminal was not beyond the reach of federal safety and health regulations.the occupational safety and health act of osh act provides a statutory baseline for assur ing so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions.b.this enactment mandates workplaces free from recognized hazards.id.a.where congress has enacted an statute conferring authority over working conditions on another agency,however,the osh act does not apply.b.the mine act,which governs occupational safety and health at e ach coal or other mine,is such a statute.
in practice,then,the regulatory dynamic involves displacement msha may exercise its statutory authority under the mine act in such a way as to preempt osha regulatory jurisdiction under the osh act.united energy,fed.mine safety health,cir.the osh act is comprehensive,martin occupational safety health review comm n,d,but it also affords space for specialized regulatory schemes.the secretary of labor administers both the mine act and the osh act and determines initially whether a workplace falls under the jurisdiction of msha,rather than osha.see,sec y of labor cement of.
the regulatory systems administered by msha and osha share many similarities,but the differences in scope and enforcement may hold significant implications for an employer and its employees.for example,although osha has established extensive workplace standards for toxic and hazardous substances,see pt,subpts.h,z,msha regulations are specifically tailored to the dangers that arise from handling coal,such as exposure to coal dust and other airborne contaminants,see pt.the mine act also provides the secretary with an array of enforcement mechanisms,such as inspections,investigations,recordkeeping,citations,and orders,that are particularized to the industry hazards.see.the secretary may need to draw on historical familiarity and policymaking expertise to determine which agency framework is appropriate for a given workplace.martin,at.
with the mine act,congress fashioned a law that is not only tailored to a specific industry,but also comprehensive in its coverage.the force of the statute is evident even from congress preliminary declarations.c identifying an urgent need to provide more effective means and measures for improving the working conditions and practices in the nation coal or other mines in order to prevent death and serious physical harm,and in order to prevent occupational diseases originating in such mines.congress also expressed particular solicitude for the individuals who are continually exposed to the hazards of mining.id.a announcing that the first priority and concern of all in the co
