petitioner henderson lumataw,a native and citizen of indonesia,seeks review of a decision issued by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge ij denial of his application for political asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat lumataw entered the united states in and filed his application for asylum in on the basis of past persecution and fear of future persecution in indonesia on account of his religious status as a practicing christian.the bia affirmed the ij denial of asylum on the ground that lumataw failed to allege sufficient changed circumstances in indonesia to excuse his failure to timely file his asylum application within one year of his arrival.the bia also agreed with the ij conclusion that lumataw had not established past persecution and that he would not more likely than not be persecuted in the future if he returned to indonesia.
in this petition for review,lumataw challenges the agency determinations on the merits of his asylum claim,but also alleges that the bia erred as a matter of law in holding his application to be untimely because the filing deadline had not yet been enacted into law at the time of his initial entry.after careful review of the record,we hold that the ij and bia committed prejudicial legal error in assessing the timeliness of lumataw petition.we thus grant the instant petition and remand.
background 
factual background 
henderson lumataw is a citizen and native of indonesia.he identifies himself as a christian protestant.the incident upon which lumataw claim of past persecution is premised took place in indonesia in august.on that date,while traveling through indonesia,lumataw was accosted by a thief who was subsequently joined by three additional attackers.lumataw identified these individuals as muslims due to their headdresses and sarong attire.seeing the cross necklace around lumataw neck,one of the attackers accused lumataw of being christian.the attacker pointed a knife at lumataw neck and threatened to kill him,saying i want to kill you christian.ultimately,lumataw escaped the attackers after they had robbed him of his cross necklace.lumataw was very shaken by the incident.thereafter,he left indonesia for the united states.
lumataw entered the united states on september,on a visitor with authorization to remain for six months.according to lumataw,he overstayed out of fear of being threatened,tortured,or killed if he returned to indonesia,because of his status as a christian.lumataw explained,however,that he did not apply for asylum right away because the interreligious conflict between muslims and christians was not as perilous in as it would later become.country conditions evidence on the record,including state department human rights reports,confirms the increase in interreligious tensions in indonesia in the late and early.on october,in new hampshire,lumataw married vonnie golioth golioth,also a protestant christian of indonesian nationality.
procedural history 
on january,golioth applied for asylum and lumataw was included in his wife application.on april,the department of homeland security dhs served him with a notice to appear nta charging him with being removable under a b,as an alien who remained in the united states for a time longer than permitted.in,lumataw filed his own application for asylum under of the immigration and nationality act ina,and in the alternative,withholding of removal under b of the ina and under the cat 
the ij decision 
on january,a hearing was held before an ij on the merits of lumataw application.in addition to lumataw testimony,golioth also testified about incidents of violence and intimidation inflicted on christians by muslims in indonesia.the ij issued an oral decision that day.
the ij identified the timeliness of lumataw asylum application as the threshold question for the court,noting that lumataw asylum application was filed approximately years after he entered the united states.the ij reasoned that while periods of social conflict can intervene between lumataw arrival in the united states and the time he applied for asylum,lumataw has not established that circumstances have changed to the point where his eligibility for asylum has been materially affected.finding no evidence of a change in circumstances that would justify a late filing in this case,the ij held that lumataw application for asylum was untimely.
as to the material aspects of lumataw remaining withholding of removal claim,the ij found lumataw to be generally credible,but concluded that even if lumataw attackers were motivated by animosity towards christians,one isolated attack,far from lumataw home or workplace,with no injury,did not constitute past persecution.finding that lumataw had not established past persecution,no presumption of future persecution applied either.furthermore,the ij concluded that lumataw could not prove it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted if he returned to indonesia,and thus,the ij also denied his application for withholding of removal under section b of the ina.the ij also noted that country conditions in indonesia do not support the conclusion that lumataw would more likely than not be persecuted,should he be removed to indonesia.lumataw application for cat relief was also denied.finally,the ij concluded that lumataw was eligible for voluntary departure.
the bia decision 
on may,the bia dismissed lumataw appeal.on the issue of timeliness,the bia agree d with the ij that lumataw had failed to establish sufficient changed circumstances in indonesia to excuse his failure to timely file his application for asylum.although lumataw had argued to the bia that the ij had failed to acknowledge his inclusion in his wife application,the bia held that lumataw failed to demonstrate that the ij omission of this fact supports a finding that his failure to file his application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the united states in should be excused based on changed circumstances in indonesia.
as to the merits of lumataw alternative withholding of removal claim,the bia adopted the reasoning of the ij that lumataw had failed to establish either past persecution or that he would more likely than not be persecuted in the future,so as to support withholding of removal.the bia also rejected his claims under the cat.
a timely petition for review in this court followed.in this petition lumataw argues that the ij and bia erred as a matter of law in holding his asylum application to be untimely,as those decisions rested on lumataw failure to file within one year of his initial entry in when no filing deadline had yet been enacted into law,as well as a failure to consider his inclusion in his wife petition.lumataw further argues that the ij and bia erred in ruling that lumataw failed to make out a case of past persecution.finally,lumataw argues that should we remand on the first issue,he should be entitled,on remand,to present an asylum claim based on fear of future persecution.
ii.discussion 
applicable law 
to establish eligibility for asylum,an alien must prove either past persecution,which gives rise to an inference of future persecution,or establish a well founded fear of future persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.hem mukasey,cir.in contrast,t o qualify for withholding of removal,an alien must show that,more likely than not,he faces persecution on account of one of these five protected grounds,should he return to his homeland.pan gonzales,cir emphasis added see also a a b.this more likely than not standard is harder for an alien to satisfy than the reasonable possibility standard for showing a fear of future persecution in asylum cases.pan,at.
unlike a withholding of removal application,which is not subject to a filing deadline,see a,a n asylum application must ordinarily be filed within one year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states,or by april,whichever is later.oroh,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also a b a ii explaining that the period shall be calculated from the date of the alien last arrival in the united states or april,whichever is later.prior to the enactment of this bar,effective april,there was no mandated time limit for filing applications for asylum.see in re,referencing congress enact ment of the filing period in.
an application for asylum may be considered beyond the deadline,however,if an applicant demonstrates changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing.oroh,at citing a d a,rashad mukasey,cir.changed circumstances may include c hanges in conditions in the applicant country of nationality or c hanges in the applicant circumstances that materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum,including changes in applicable law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.a i.extraordinary circumstances refers to events or factors directly related to the failure to meet the deadline.a.an applicant attempting to demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances must also demonstrate that he filed the application within a reasonable period given those circumstances.oroh,at quoting a.
standard of review 
usually,this court confines its review to the bia order that is being challenged by the petitioner.rashad,at.however,when as here,the bia adopts the decision of the ij,and provides some analysis of its own,the court reviews both decisions.id.
we will uphold the factual findings of the ij and bia if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under the substantial evidence standard,this court may not reverse the decision below unless the record compels a contrary conclusion.see ins,d applying this standard,at same.whether a petitioner has demonstrated past persecution is usually a factual determination subject only to the highly deferential substantial evidence standard.see,at.pangemanan holder,cir silva gonzales,cir.
certain agency factual determinations are,however,by statute excluded from judicial review.see a as relevant to this appeal,a divests courts of jurisdiction to review determinations of timeliness or the applicability of exceptions to the rule.oroh,at.the only exception to this rule is contained in a d,which carves out an exception allowing courts to review constitutional claims or questions of law.id.at quoting hana gonzales,cir.to form the basis of judicial review under a d,the alleged underlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable that is,the argument advanced must,at the very least,have some potential validity.pan,at.
these deferential review standards do not preclude a court from vacating the bia asylum determination and remanding a case for further consideration where the bia denial of asylum was based upon an error of law.rojo mukasey,cir unpublished quoting kotasz ins,cir.the harmless error doctrine,however,informs the propriety of remand in the face of legal error.see holder,cir citing support for proposition that harmless error doctrine applies to judicial review of immigration decision.
petition for review 
timeliness 
lumataw argues that the ij and bia erred as a matter of law in assessing the timeliness of his application for asylum.this is because the bia reasoned that lumataw did not warrant an exception to the one year asylum filing deadline as he did not file his application within one year of entering the united states.however,in,and for some years thereafter,there was no legal requirement that an alien file an asylum application within one year of fact that neither the ij nor bia recognized.in fact,there was no deadline at all.thus,by charging lumataw for failing to file within one year of entry,the ij and bia attributed years of delay to lumataw for which he was not legally responsible.lumataw argues that without even making a finding of when he was legally required to file for asylum,the bia could not conduct any meaningful analysis of whether an exception was warranted.
additionally,at his hearing before the ij,lumataw argued that because he had been included in his wife january application for asylum,it is the january date,rather than the date of lumataw personal filing in,that should be deemed the governing time for analyzing whether an exception to the deadline applied.the ij,however,erred as a matter of law,lumataw argues,in failing to consider lumataw inclusion in his wife application,noting only that petitioner filed ten years after his initial entry.thus,the ij ten year comment constitutes legal error,in that it shows the ij was mistaken as to both the start date and end dates for analyzing whether changed or extraordinary circumstances excuse lumataw delay.by adding years of additional delay to the analysis that did not belong,lumataw argues that as a matter of law,neither the ij nor bia conducted an appropriate exception analysis.
the government does not dispute lumataw claims of error,but argues that lumataw is challenging the agency factual determinations regarding timeliness,which we lack jurisdiction,pursuant to a,to review.recognizing that legal or constitutional questions are nevertheless reviewable on appeal,see a d lutaaya mukasey,cir,the government takes the position that lumataw claims do not raise legal questions.in support of its position,the government relies on decisions of this court holding that agency findings regarding timeliness and changed or extraordinary circumstances are usually factual determinations outside this court jurisdiction.see hayek gonzales,cir.
question of law 
the threshold issue is,thus,whether lumataw has alleged a reviewable question of law a d,or rather,a question of fact that is beyond our jurisdiction to review.
we have previously held that discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside our jurisdiction and that bia findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are usually factual determinations.see hayek,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.however,this does not mean that this court could never have jurisdiction over a timeliness determination.see liu ins,cir making this point.rather,s ome discretionary determinations do present underlying,reviewable questions of law.khan filip,cir see also arif mukasey,cir although we have jurisdiction to review a determination of timeliness that turns on a question of law,we do not have jurisdiction to review determinations of timeliness that are based on findings of fact.this is such a case.
a reviewable question of law may be raised where the agency used the wrong legal standard in coming to a determination on a discretionary decision.see filip,at liu,at khan gonzales,cir see,tariq keisler,cir recognizing that we retain jurisdiction to determine whether the ij erred in requiring exceptional circumstances instead of extraordinary circumstances.similarly,a reviewable question of law is raised where the agency is charged with misconstruing its own regulations in reaching a decision.see rotinsulu mukasey,cir explaining that a n agency has an obligation to abide by its own regulations and t he failure to follow an applicable regulation may be a sufficient ground for vacation of an agency decision,resulting in a remand gonzales,cir holding that the court had jurisdiction over alien petition for review because the alien claim that the bia misconstrued a regulation so as to bar his motion to reopen presented a question of law see also,at explaining in conference report on the real id act that use of the term question of law,as codified in a d refers to a question regarding the construction of a statute.
we agree with lumataw that the question of whether the ij and bia applied the correct filing deadline in assessing the timeliness of his asylum application,constitutes a question of law underlying the agency timeliness determinations.this is not a case where the alien alleges that the agency got the facts wrong.usman holder,cir citations omitted.the relevant facts,namely,the dates that lumataw entered the country and filed for asylum individually,and as part of his wife application,are not in dispute.nor does lumataw challenge the agency exercise of its discretion in determining that no exception to the filing deadline was warranted.see filip,at describing determination under a d as to whether changed or extraordinary circumstances justify filing delay as inherently discretionary and not reviewable.that analysis,lumataw properly contends,may only be conducted on remand.see gonzález thomas,d.rather,at its core,the question underlying lumataw challenge asks whether the agency misconstrued a statute,a b,and its own regulation,a ii,in assessing the timeliness of lumataw asylum application.see in re,i n at holding that ij erred as a matter of law when he calculated the filing period on the basis of the respondent prior arrival in the united states in instead of the respondent last arrival on july,emphasis added.thus,we hold that lumataw has identif ied a colorable,legal defect in the ij and bia timeliness decision s that is within this court jurisdiction to review.see usman,at quoting rashad,at.
upon undertaking such review,we hold that the ij committed legal error when he faulted lumataw for untimely filing years after he entered in without recognizing either the absence of a filing deadline for the first few years of that period,or the undisputed record fact of lumataw inclusion in his wife january asylum application.arif,at suggesting that petitioner individual asylum application would be timely if she had timely filed jointly with her husband,but holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review agency conclusion that petitioner failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that prior joint application was filed within one year of entry a i c citing i n the case of an alien who had previously been included as a dependent in another alien pending asylum application,the loss of that relationship as example of type of changed circumstance that would warrant exception to filing rule.
we further hold that the bia committed legal error in affirming the ij determination of untimeliness on grounds that lumataw fail ed to file his application for asylum within year of his arrival in the united states in,where lumataw application need only have been filed by april,in order to be timely.see a ii explaining that the period shall be calculated from the date of the alien last arrival in the united states or april,whichever is later emphasis added 
harmless error 
despite legal error,we would be required to affirm the agency rejection of lumataw asylum claim as untimely if the evidence nevertheless compel led a conclusion that lumataw asylum application was untimely and no exceptions to the filing deadline applied.un gonzales,cir emphasis added holding that ij failure to address past persecution argument was not harmless error because w e can not say the evidence compels a conclusion either way,the error can not be regarded as harmless.id.citing el moraghy ashcroft,cir.
although the government concedes that lumataw was required to file his application within one year of april,rather than within of his arrival in the united states,see a b ii,it is nevertheless undisputed that lumataw failed to file his application by april,proper asylum filing deadline applicable to him.therefore,the government argues,the ij and bia properly found that lumataw application was untimely and that no exceptions applied.moreover,the government argues,the bia concluded that even considering lumataw wife filing,lumataw nonetheless failed to timely file for asylum.thus,the government suggests that any error in the agency articulation of the proper filing deadline and initial filing date was harmless.
at first blush,the government argument carries substantial force.after all,taking april,as the proper date upon which lumataw filing window expired,and january,the date of his wife filing,as the date of lumataw initial filing,lumataw application was nevertheless almost five years late.lumataw argues,however,that by charging him with failing to file within one year of his entry,when no such requirement existed,and omitting consideration of his inclusion in his wife application,the agency attributed to lumataw an additional five years of delay for which he was not legally responsible.the agency legal errors,lumataw argues,which caused it to incorrectly identify the two dates relevant to a proper changed or extraordinary circumstances inquiry,meant that the agency never engaged in a meaningful analysis of whether the evidentiary record established circumstances that warranted an exception to the filing deadline.
lumataw argues that,on remand,with the alleged legal errors corrected,the record evidence supports a finding that changed circumstances in indonesia justify his delay in filing.see a d.specifically,although the asylum filing deadline applicable to him was april,lumataw argues that the evidentiary record contains extensive documentation showing that it was from the late into the early that conditions for christians in indonesia progressively deteriorated,a trend sparked by the overthrow of a dictator who had previously suppressed religious tensions.in support of his position,lumataw points to state department human rights reports on the record,which show an increase in interreligious violence and tension in indonesia in the period immediately preceding his filing for asylum along with his wife.specifically,the state department religious freedom report for acknowledged the substantial spike in violence in indonesia during this period by including himself in his wife january application,lumataw argues,he can show that he filed his asylum application within a reasonable time after the changed circumstances in indonesia occurred.see a ii explaining that changed circumstances exception to asylum filing deadline applies if applicant files within a reasonable period given the changed circumstances husyev mukasey,cir identifying the threshold question for the exception analysis as whether the application was filed in a reasonable period after the changed circumstances occurred.thus,the asylum claim would not be.
ultimately,we are persuaded by lumataw argument.although admittedly a close question,we can not confidently say that this was a harmless error,which did not affect the outcome of the ij decision butt keisler,cir.lumataw indisputably did not file his asylum application by april,and thus,his application was in any event untimely.yet,we conclude that by applying the proper timeliness analysis,the agency is more likely to have found circumstances that could excuse the untimely filing.
first,in terms of the ij failure to recognize lumataw inclusion in his wife application,we recognize that it was just before the filing of that joint application in january that the state department human rights reports,part of the record before the agency,document an upsurge in interreligious tensions and violence in indonesia.see a i including changes in conditions in the applicant country within the meaning of changed circumstances.this change in circumstances could be found to have materially affect ed lumataw eligibility for asylum,so as to excuse his late filing.see id.referring to circumstances materially affecting the applicant eligibility for asylum kojo holder,wl,at cir noting that worsening violence towards christians in indonesia and the increasingly ineffective response from the government may constitute changed conditions justifying petitioner untimely application for asylum,filed in rather than,and remanding to ij for appropriate determination.moreover,while what constitutes a reasonable time is nowhere defined with exactitude,at least two members of the bia have suggested that,barring extraordinary circumstances,a reasonable period for bringing an asylum claim based on changed circumstances is year from the point at which the circumstances changed.in re,pauley,board member,dissenting.this proposition of one year as a bench mark for what constitutes a reasonable time supports the notion that had lumataw derivative application filing date been taken into account,in light of the events in indonesia,the agency could have found that luma
