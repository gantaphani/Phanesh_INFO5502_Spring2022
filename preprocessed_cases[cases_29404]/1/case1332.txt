the individuals with disabilities education act idea provides for grants of federal funds to states for the education of disabled children.to meet the eligibility requirements for the full amount of funds allocated to a state,that state must not reduce the amount of its own financial support for special education below the amount of that support it provided for the preceding fiscal year.a.if the state fails to meet this condition,as it is referred to,the secretary of the department of education usdoe must reduce the level of federal funding to the state in subsequent years by the amount of the funding shortfall.id.alternatively,the secretary may grant a waiver of the condition if doing so would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the state.id.
south carolina requested a waiver of its condition for approximately million for its fiscal year ended.the secretary granted the waiver in part,but denied it to the extent of million.accordingly,he advised the state that the usdoe was reducing the state allocation for fiscal year by million.when south carolina sought to have a hearing on the secretary determination,the secretary advised the state that the idea did not provide for such a hearing.
south carolina filed this petition for review,challenging the secretary denial of its request for a full waiver and its request for a hearing.the secretary filed a motion to dismiss,contending that this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the state petition.
we conclude that the secretary action in partially denying south carolina request for a waiver was a determination made with respect to the eligibility of the state for funding and that therefore we have jurisdiction to consider the state petition for review.see e a.we also conclude that the secretary denial of the state request for a full waiver was a determination that south carolina was not eligible to receive a grant in the amount of million and that therefore the secretary was required to provide the state with notice and an opportunity for a hearing before he made a final determination with respect to the waiver request.id.d.accordingly,we grant the petition for review and remand to allow the secretary to provide south carolina with notice and an opportunity for a hearing before he makes a final determination on south carolina waiver request.
the idea provides federal funding to states for the education of disabled children.to be eligible for this funding,a state must submit a plan to the secretary of the usdoe that provides assurances to the secretary that the state has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the state meets each of stated conditions.a.in addition to requiring that the state provide an appropriate public education to all children with disabilities,the conditions require that the state not reduce the amount of state financial support for special education and related services for children with disabilities below the amount of that support for the preceding fiscal year.id.a a.this condition,however,may be waived under two circumstances,including if the secretary determines that doing so would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the state.id.a c i.without such a waiver,the statute provides that t he secretary shall reduce the allocation of funds for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the state fails to comply with the condition by the same amount by which the state fails to meet the requirement.id.a b.
after experiencing severe and precipitous reductions in state tax revenues,south carolina advised the usdoe of the reduced revenues and south carolina need to reduce funding for special education by million.in a letter to the agency,dated february,south carolina requested a waiver of the condition for fiscal year.the state also provided the agency with supporting financial information.
in an opinion letter dated june,secretary for special education and rehabilitative services alexa posny found that the submitted financial information indicated that the state did not treat special education and related services in an equitable manner when compared to state agencies as a whole.she noted that the state reduced its support for special education by,whereas its average reduction in appropriations across all agencies was.for this reason,she denied the request for a waiver of the full million amount.after recalculating the reductions in an equitable manner,however,posny granted the state waiver request to the extent of million and denied it to the extent of million.she stated 
the state submissions to the usdoe in support of its waiver request establish that it has failed to maintain financial support for special education and related services for fy by thus,the state has a shortfall in the amount of state financial support for fy.
the letter encouraged the state to take action to restore funding for special education and related services for fy.on south carolina request for reconsideration,deputy secretary anthony miller affirmed the decision.
even though the usdoe informed south carolina that it was not entitled to a hearing,south carolina filed an appeal from assistant secretary posny decision on august,with the office of hearings and appeals,requesting a hearing.after receiving no status reports or information regarding the appeal,south carolina filed a motion to expedite.when the request for a hearing was presented to the secretary,he issued an order dated may,denying the request for a hearing and explaining that while the idea provides for notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to issuance of the department final agency decision rejecting the eligibility of a state for idea grant funding or a withholding of idea funds,emphasis added,the agency partial denial of south carolina request for a waiver was neither a decision rejecting eligibility nor a decision withholding funds.thus,he ruled,no right to a hearing attached.the secretary opinion reasoned that because south carolina was not challenging the conclusion that it did not meet the condition and because south carolina was never deemed ineligible for a grant,this was not a case of an agency decision rejecting eligibility.he also stated that the agency decision did not involve a withholding of grant funds under the idea because s uch a withholding action can only occur after the office of special education and rehabilitative services has made a determination that a state has substantially failed to comply with an idea eligibility condition.but here that office never determined the state substantially failed to comply with the idea requirement the state concedes that it did not.finally,the secretary noted that the general education provisions act gepa,b requiring a hearing before the secretary withholds payment under an education program,does not provide south carolina with a right to a hearing because the specific terms of the idea,which require a reduction of funds,supersede the general terms of the gepa.
the south carolina department of education and its superintendent,mitchell zais,filed this petition for review of the secretary denial of south carolina request for a waiver and request for a hearing,naming the secretary and the usdoe as respondents.in its petition,south carolina also requested an order that the secretary restore,during the pendency of the hearing procedures,the million in funding that the secretary reduced from south carolina fiscal year allocation.in addition to its petition,south carolina filed a motion to stay the reduction of its idea funds pending appeal.
the usdoe filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction,contending that its waiver determination was a final agency action subject to review only in the district court under the administrative procedure act,not in the court of appeals under the idea or gepa.
by order dated august,we denied the state motion for a stay pending appeal and deferred ruling on th
