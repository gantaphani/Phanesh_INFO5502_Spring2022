this case returns to us after the supreme court review in reynolds united states,d.remand requires that we reach the merits of reynolds claim that the regulatory rule upon which his indictment was based was promulgated in violation of the administrative procedure act apa.this claim gives rise to three questions what is the appropriate standard of review of an agency assertion of good cause in waiving the apa notice and comment requirements did the attorney general have good cause to waive these requirements in promulgating a rule governing the retroactivity of the sex offender and registration notification act sorna registration requirements if the attorney general lacked good cause to waive the requirements,was reynolds prejudiced by the failure to comply with the apa notice and comment requirements 
the courts of appeals are divided on each of these questions.on the first question,the fifth and eleventh circuits have determined that the arbitrary and capricious standard is the appropriate standard for reviewing the attorney general actions,the fourth and sixth circuits have not stated a standard but appear to use de novo review,and the ninth circuit has explicitly avoided the question on the second question,the fourth and eleventh circuits have held that the attorney general had good cause to waive notice and comment,while the fifth,sixth,and ninth circuits have held that he did not on the final question,the fifth circuit has held that the attorney general lack of good cause does not prejudice defendants,while the sixth circuit has held that it is prejudicial 
we conclude that we need not decide the appropriate standard of review today because the attorney general assertion of good cause can not withstand review even under the most deferential standard available.we also conclude that the attorney general lack of good cause is prejudicial to reynolds.accordingly,we will vacate reynolds conviction.
in,reynolds was convicted of sexually assaulting a girl in missouri.this conviction required him to register as a sex offender,which he did for the next six years.meanwhile,congress passed sorna in,which required individuals convicted of sex offenses after its enactment to comply with certain registration requirements.through the promulgation of an administrative rule on february,the attorney general made sorna registration requirements retroactive to those convicted of sex offenses before its enactment,sexual offenders such as reynolds.
on september,reynolds moved to washington,pennsylvania.he failed both to update his place of residence and employment information in missouri and to register as a sex offender in pennsylvania.police discovered these registration violations on october,when reynolds was arrested for violating parole.he was subsequently indicted for violating sorna registration requirements because of his failure to register between september,and october.he pleaded guilty,reserving his right to appeal.he was sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.
procedural history 
reynolds primary challenge to his conviction has been to its legal basis.in the district court,he moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that sorna violated the nondelegation doctrine,the commerce clause,the ex post facto clause,the tenth amendment,and his fifth amendment substantive and procedural due process rights.finally,he argued that even if sorna did not violate the constitution,his indictment should be dismissed because it was based on an administrative rule promulgated by the attorney general that did not comply with the requirements of the apa.the district court rejected each of these arguments and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.reynolds subsequently entered into a plea agreement that specifically reserved his right to appeal those issues argued in his motion to dismiss the indictment.
in his first appeal to this court following his guilty plea,reynolds presented these same arguments.bound by united states shenandoah,cir we upheld the district court because the commerce clause,ex post facto,and fifth amendment arguments lacked merit and because reynolds lacked standing to assert his apa,nondelegation,and tenth amendment arguments.united states reynolds,fed.app x,cir see also shenandoah,at.reynolds filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court that requested review of these holdings.pet.writ cert.at i,reynolds united states,wl.the supreme court granted the petition limited to the question of whether reynolds had standing to assert his apa and nondelegation arguments.reynolds united states,d.the court reversed,holding that he did have standing to make those arguments.reynolds united states,d.
in reversing,the supreme court rejected this court interpretation in shenandoah of the power delegated to the attorney general by sorna registration requirement.d the attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter,and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection b.b providing when sex offenders other than those who had already completed their sentences should initially register in shenandoah,this court concluded that this provision automatically made sorna registration requirements applicable without any action by the attorney general to sex offenders who had been convicted before sorna was enacted and who had already completed their prison sentences.at.this meant that reynolds obligation to register under sorna was derived from the act itself and not from the administrative rule promulgated by the attorney general.accordingly,shenandoah required us to conclude that he could not challenge the legality of the administrative rule because the statute,not the rule,was the basis of his conviction.reynolds,fed.app x at shenandoah,at.
the supreme court interpreted otherwise.the court held that the registration requirement did not automatically apply retroactively to sex offenders who committed their offense before sorna was enacted.instead,the court explained that under,the act registration requirements do not apply to offenders until the attorney general specifies that they do apply.reynolds.at.this means,contrary to this court previous holding,that reynolds obligation to register under sorna does not derive from the act itself but from the administrative rule promulgated by the attorney general.we must now reach the merits of the claim reynolds raises challenging the legality of that rule.reynolds.at whether the attorney general interim rule sets forth a valid specification consequently matters in the case before us.
administrative history 
at issue here is the attorney general february,interim rule that made sorna registration requirements retroactive for all offenders.applicability of the sex offender registration and notification act,hereinafter interim rule.the attorney general issued this interim rule seven months after sorna delegated authority to him to make sorna retroactive.the attorney general did not provide the period for notice and comment required under b,nor did he provide the minimum delay before the rule became effective under d.instead,he concluded that notice and comment were not required because good cause existed pursuant to b b and that requiring those procedures would be contrary to the public interest.interim rule.at citing b b.he provided the following reasons to support his finding of good cause 
the immediate effectiveness of this rule is necessary to eliminate any possible uncertainty about the applicability of the act requirements and related means of enforcement,including criminal liability under for sex offenders who knowingly fail to register as required to sex offenders whose predicate convictions predate the enactment of sorna.delay in the implementation of this rule would impede the effective registration of such sex offenders and would impair immediate efforts to protect the public from sex offenders who fail to register through prosecution and the imposition of criminal sanctions.the resulting practical dangers include the commission of additional sexual assaults and child sexual abuse or exploitation offenses by sex offenders that could have been prevented had local authorities and the community been aware of their presence,in addition to greater difficulty in apprehending perpetrators who have not been registered and tracked as provided by sorna.this would thwart the legislative objective of protect ing the public from sex offenders and offenders against children by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders,sorna,because a substantial class of sex offenders could evade the act registration requirements and enforcement mechanisms during the pendency of a proposed rule and delay in the effectiveness of a final rule.
id.finally,the interim rule allowed comments to be submitted for two months after promulgation.id.at.
three months after the interim rule took effect,the attorney general issued proposed guidelines for the interpretation and implementation of sorna.the national guidelines for sex offender registration and notification,proposed may,hereinafter proposed guidelines.these proposed guidelines included the proposed final rule governing sorna retroactivity to offenders.it also solicited comments on all of the guidelines proposals,which were due august.id.at.thirteen months after issuing the proposed guidelines,the attorney general promulgated the final rule.it was a reiteration of the same rule set out in the interim rule regarding retroactivity.the national guidelines for sex offender registration and notification,july,hereinafter final rule 
reynolds conviction is based on the interim rule because the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred from september,to october,approximately ten months before the final rule went into effect.reynolds challenges the validity of the interim rule on two grounds.first,he argues that the attorney general did not have good cause under the apa to waive its procedural requirements.second,he argues that congress delegation to the attorney general of the authority to make sorna retroactive is an unconstitutional delegation.because we conclude that the attorney general did not provide sufficient justification for his finding of good cause and that this error prejudiced reynolds,we do not reach reynolds nondelegation argument.
our jurisdiction to hear this case is provided by,while the district court jurisdiction was provided by.our standard of review for a district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment is mixed.we review de novo a district court legal conclusions and a district court factual determinations for clear error.united states nolan cooper,cir.reynolds challenges the district court legal conclusions only,so we apply the de novo standard.
standard of review 
we must consider the parties dispute over our standard of review for an administrative agency assertion of good cause under b b of the apa before deciding if good cause existed.the parties and our prior decisions provide three possible standards de novo,mixed,and arbitrary and capricious.reynolds argues that the appropriate standard is de novo under d,while the attorney general argues for arbitrary and capricious review under a supporting the government position are the fifth and eleventh circuits use of the arbitrary and capricious standard in their sorna decisions.united states johnson,cir united states dean,cir.the arbitrary and capricious standard follows from a explicit inclusion of that standard as well as the provision broader scope of review that allows for review of agencies factual determinations.marsh,at gardner grandolsky,cir.
supporting reynolds position are the fourth and sixth circuits application of de novo review,although these courts do not specifically state the standard they applied.united states gould,cir united states cain,cir.de novo review follows from the limited scope of review provided to courts in d to ensure that agency actions,findings,and conclusions are completed in observance of procedure required by law,d,which is a legal question for which de novo review would typically be utilized.see marsh or.natural res.council,d pierce underwood,d.each party position,therefore,has support from other courts of appeals.
notably,none of these decisions has extensively analyzed the standard of review question and only the fifth and ninth circuits have directly linked their discussion of the standard to.johnson,at united states valverde,cir.for its part,the ninth circuit chose not to decide what standard should be applied.valverde,at.what the appropriate standard is,therefore,has not received analysis despite the disagreement on the ultimate conclusion.for that reason,we will take up where those courts left off.
the ambiguity created by the foregoing disagreement is heightened by the absence of an expressed standard in many good cause decisions by courts of appeals.instead,courts have resolved these cases by interpreting good cause provision with a limiting principle.this principle is most commonly formulated as a direction that good cause should be narrowly construed.cain,at gould,at dean,at johnson,at explaining that good cause should be read narrowly valverde,at stating that notice and comment can be waived only in narrow circumstances.some courts including this elaborated on this interpretive framework by explaining that circumstances justifying reliance on the good cause exception are indeed rare and will be accepted only after the court has examined closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures.natural res.def.council,epa,cir quoting council of the mountains,donovan,alterations and quotation marks omitted see also mid tex coop.fed.energy regulatory comm n,this court has cautioned that the b b exception should be narrowly construed and reluctantly countenanced.that admonition means our inquiry should be a close one.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this interpretive framework has been developed separate and apart from,derived from the legislative history of the good cause exception.am.iron steel inst.epa,cir.
our application of this interpretive principle generally suggests that de novo review is the correct standard for examining claims of good cause under the apa.but the close examination required by de novo review,natural res.def.council,at,is inconsistent with the deference afforded under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see id.at the exacting standard applicable in determining whether an agency has failed to comply with the apa procedural requirements of notice and comment for its action contrasts with the deferential standard applicable to substantive challenges to agency action.
one of our decisions,however,is more ambivalent about whether narrow construction of good cause mandates de novo review exclusively.philadelphia citizens in action schweiker,cir,suggests that the can be applied consistently with arbitrary and capricious as well as de novo review through the use of a mixed standard.there,we reviewed de novo whether shortness of time can ever constitute good cause for invoking the good cause exemption and whether the particular circumstances the department found itself in were indeed good cause.at.we then employed arbitrary and capricious review for whether the agency was correct to conclude that alternative procedure s the agency could have utilized were impracticable under the circumstances.id.at.
schweiker bifurcated analysis shows that the supports the third standard available a mixed standard consistent with both de novo and arbitrary and capricious review.this mixed standard requires that we review de novo whether the agency asserted reason for waiver of notice and comment constitutes good cause,as well as whether the established facts reveal justifiable reliance on the reason.but any factual determinations made by the agency to support its proffered reason are subject to arbitrary and capricious review.
so while some of our good cause decisions such as natural resources defense council and mobay suggest that de novo review is the appropriate standard in light of the,schweiker suggests that this principle could also support mixed review.clearly,our decisions are in tension with one another because similar procedural determinations afforded deference in schweiker are afforded little or no deference in natural resources defense council and mobay.fortunately,we need not abate that tension here because we conclude that the attorney general good cause determination will not pass muster under any of the available standards.
in summary,and our prior decisions provide us with three possible standards de novo,mixed,and arbitrary and capricious.selecting the appropriate standard gives rise to several difficult questions.the first is how to resolve the tension between schweiker and our other good cause decisions.there is reason to doubt schweiker use of mixed review because the decision appears to be an outlier from the body of from this court,as well as other courts of appeals mixed review,however,is consistent with the text of because it includes no requirement that only one provision of the section be applied to a particular review the section allows us to apply one standard to legal determinations and another to factual determinations made in an administrative decision.this conformance with is important because of the supreme court direction that t he standards to be applied on review are governed by the provisions of.heckler chaney,d dickinson zurko,d r ecognizing the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action found in to hold that deviations from the standards must be clear ly established by statute or common law.this direction by the court requires that any selection among the three standards be guided by a determination of what the respective scopes of a and d are in relation to one another a topic for which there is surprisingly little guidance.
we decline,for now,to resolve these questions.we conclude that the attorney general assertion of good cause fails even the most deferential standard of arbitrary and capricious.accord valverde,at.just what is the applicable standard of review for agency determinations that good cause justifies waiver of notice and comment is a question for another day.
good cause 
as with the standard of review,appellate courts are divided over whether the attorney general justifications are sufficient to support a good cause determination.the fourth and eleventh circuits have concluded they are sufficient.gould,at dean,at.the fifth,sixth,and ninth circuits have held otherwise.johnson,at cain,at valverde,at.we agree with the fifth,sixth,and ninth circuits that the two reasons provided in the interim rule are not sufficient to establish good cause because the attorney general reasons for good cause would eviscerate the apa notice and comment requirements 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard,a court scope of review is narrow,and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.gardner,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.a reviewing court may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given,but it can uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned from the record.id.quoting state farm,at.w e reverse an agency decision when it is not supported by substantial evidence,or the agency has made a clear error in judgment.prometheus radio project,cir quoting at t.the interim rule can not withstand review under this standard.the attorney general rationale is not supported by substantial evidence and constitutes a clear error of judgment because the logical extension of the bases offered to support it lacks a limiting principle.
notice and comment may be waived when the agency for good cause finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest.b b.the attorney general concluded that good cause existed because undergoing notice and comment for the interim rule would be contrary to the public interest,offering two reasons.interim rule.at.first,he asserted that there was a need to immediately eliminate any possible uncertainty whether sorna applied retroactively.id.second,he contended that waiver was necessary in order to protect the public from sex offenders who fail to register and thereby create practical dangers,including the commission of additional sexual assaults and child sexual abuse or exploitation offenses by sex offenders.id.we discuss each reason in turn.
the desire to eliminate uncertainty,by itself,can not constitute good cause.to hold otherwise would have the effect of writing the notice and comment requirements out of the statute.the attorney general states in the interim rule that waiver is needed in order to eliminate any possible uncertainty in regard to the retroactive application of sorna registration requirements.interim rule.at emphasis added see also dean,at stating that the interim rule guidance rationale is particularly important here as the persons who were affected by the rule were already convicted of their prior crimes and need to know whether to register.this rationale can not serve as a basis for good cause because some uncertainty follows the enactment of any law that provides an agency with administrative responsibility.uncertainty exists because the actual substantive rules that will eventually result from the delegation are uncertain until the agency invokes its power to promulgate a rule or define the scope of its authority.consequently,if elimination of uncertainty were sufficient to show good cause,then no rule would require notice and comment.nader sawhill.an agency intention to provide clarity,without more,can not amount to good cause.
further undermining the uncertainty rationale is that the elimination of notice and comment,with the simultaneous request for postpromulgation comments,does not achieve the stated goal of eliminating any uncertainty.requesting comments on the interim rule implicitly suggests that the rule will be reconsidered and possibly changed in light of these comments.but that means the level of uncertainty is,at best,unchanged,and possibly enhanced because parties do not view the interim rule as the final version.johnson,at t he goal of reducing uncertainty is undercut by the quest for comments,which could have changed the rule.gould,at michael,dissenting t he possibility of an alteration to the interim rule after its promulgation increases rather than eliminates uncertainty.emphasis in original.accordingly,if the attorney general intended to eliminate any possible uncertainty,the best course to have taken would have been to provide for notice and comment at the start and later issue a final rule.his choice not to follow this path undermines his stated justification of eliminating uncertainty.
the government argues that the limiting principle to its uncertainty justification is the unique necessity of the interim rule.urgent action was required,according to the attorney general,to ensure that sorna would be enforceable at all as to sex offenders convicted before july,the act effective date.gov t suppl.br.at emphasis in original.this reasoning is unpersuasive for several reasons.first,this argument assumes that retroactivity was the necessary conclusion of the attorney general rulemaking an assumption that is contrary to the very purpose of notice and comment for agencies to maintain a flexible and attitude towards its own rules.prometheus radio project,at.second,a need to regulate affected parties does not create the urgency necessary to establish good cause.our prior decisions have recognized urgency alone as sufficient only when a deadline imposed by congress,the executive,or the judiciary requires agency action in a timespan that is too short to provide a notice and comment period.see,schweiker,at concluding there was good cause when congress provided only days to issue comprehensive rules am.iron steel,at concluding there was no good cause when the agency had at least three months to promulgate the regulations at issue.here,there is no deadline imposed by sorna on the attorney general other than,perhaps,its provision that sorna predecessor statute would remain in effect for three years.sorna a,b.three years is hardly the deadline of mere days we found to be adequate for good cause in schweiker.at.the government urgency rationale can not be said to follow from our previous urgency cases.
because no deadline created urgency,the government urgency argument must rest on the notion that the nature of sex offenses warrants good cause.this may be,to some,an appealing intuition but it lacks a basis in law.indeed,if there is any presumption when it comes to questions of good cause in criminal cases,we agree with the circuit that a criminal prosecution founded on an agency rule should be held to the strict letter of the apa.united states picciotto,accord cain,at johnson,at.the liberty interest at stake is greater than the ordinary civil interests litigated in administrative cases.this forecloses our adoption of the government position that notice and comment are somehow less important in criminal cases,and thus easier to waive for good cause,because the procedural delay allows criminal harm to continue during the time required to comply with the apa.if congress had decided that the harm from delay was too great to warrant notice and comment,it could have statutorily dispensed with the apa requirements or made sorna registration requirements retroactive on its own.reynolds.at.congress chose not to.in light of the subject matter of the act,congress failure to address the effective date can not serve as a basis for finding good cause on the basis of urgency.
the government posits that rejecting its uncertainty argument would mean that an agency perception of urgency never could satisfy b b because every delegation entails some delay.gov t suppl.br.at emphasis in original.the only rule we establish today is that an agency perception of urgency alone is not sufficient to satisfy b b good cause exception.section b b allows waiver only if notice and comment are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to public interest.b b.urgency for urgency sake,or an agency perception of urgency,without any supporting evidence,is not among those situations identified by the statute.as with any other administrative agency conclusion,we require some statement of facts or circumstances that justifies the existence of good cause an imminent,externally imposed deadline or the existence of an emergency.see,schweiker,at haw.helicopter operators ass,cir concluding the faa had good cause when a series of accidents occurred after congress passed the relevant legislation showed a need for urgent action derieux five smiths,concluding there was good cause where notice of the rule would have resulted in behavior.the interim rule lacks such facts or justification and thus can not constitute a reasoned basis for good cause.
the attorney general second rationale,which the eleventh and fourth circuits relied on most heavily,is that waiver of the notice and comment requirements were necessary in order to protect the public from sex offenders who fail to register thus creating practical dangers,including the commission of additional sexual assaults and child sexual abuse or exploitation offenses by sex offenders.interim rule.at dean,at gould,at.this rationale relies on the circuit explanation that good cause can be found where delay from notice and comment could result in serious harm.chambers of commerce sec.this public safety rationale can not constitute a reasoned basis for good cause because it is nothing more than a rewording of the statutory purpose congress provided in the text of sorna.
mere restatement of the public safety rationale offered in the statute can not constitute good cause because it would allow agencies to circumvent the notice and comment requirements.the statutory purpose of sorna is to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children.the interim rule public safety rationale for good cause,in turn,is to reduce practical dangers to the public that include the commission of additional sexual assaults and child sexual abuse or exploitation offenses by sex offenders.at.yet this rationale does no more than iterate the harm that sex offenders and offenders against children represent.valverde,at t he attorney general did little more than restate the general dangers of child sexual assault,abuse,and exploitation that congress sought to prevent when it enacted sorna on july.most,if not all,laws passed by congress requiring agencies to promulgate new rules are designed to eliminate some real or perceived harm.if the mere assertion that such harm will continue while an agency gives notice and receives comments were enough to establish good cause,then notice and comment would always have to give way.an agency will invariably be able to point to some continuing harm during the notice and comment period antecedent to the promulgation of a rule.id.at.indeed,one should not expect otherwise if the statute did not address a perceived continuing harm,then congress would not have legislated in the first place.the attorney general iteration of the very harm congress legislated against can not be sufficient justification for good cause.
in reaching the opposite conclusion,the eleventh circuit relied heavily on the circuit formulation that good cause may exist when notice and comment would result in serious harm.dean,at quoting jifry.we disagree that the public safety rationale offered in the record would result in serious harm.situations that fit within the serious harm justification for good cause require some set of facts and circumstances showing why the harm at issue demonstrates a need to waive the notice and comment requirements.in hawaii helicopter operators ass,for example,the faa waived notice and comment after seven helicopter accidents occurred in the first nine months of.at.based on these accidents,the faa determined that there was an urgent safety problem that could not be adequately addressed solely by enforcement of existing regulations.id.the agency went on to provide other facts showing that the safety problem was ongoing and that accidents had dramatically increased in frequency in recent months.id.explaining that the agency showed there were twenty accidents from to,seven of which occurred in the nine months before the rule was issued in late.the ninth circuit held that this was sufficient to show good cause under b b.id.hawaii helicopter thus shows what the sixth and ninth circuits have alluded to the serious harm justification for waiver requires agencies to point to something specific that illustrates a particular harm that will be caused by the delay required for notice and comment.cain,at t he attorney general gave no specific evidence of actual harm valverde,at listing possible situations that might justify the need to waive notice and comment.
the circuit own application of its serious harm rationale confirms this specificity requirement.for example,in jifry f,the faa relied on the serious harm justification to bypass notice and comment in issuing new regulations relating to the automatic suspension or revocation of alien pilots licenses.id.at.the agency explained that waiver was necessary in order to minimize security threats and potential security vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.id.the jifry court found this rationale compelling because of the agency legitimate concern over the threat of further terrorist acts involving aircraft in the aftermath of september.id.that is,the circumstances arising from a specific situation in this case justified the waiver of notice and comment.jifry and hawaii helicopter,therefore,show that an agency asserting the serious harm justification must state with specificity some facts and circumstances which demonstrate that a new regulation must be swiftly put in place.
this specificity requirement is little more than a demand that an agency comply with b b language which requires within the rule a brief statement of reasons supporting why an agency wishes to waive notice and comment.b b.the degree of specificity required is not great,as the faa reliance on september in jifry illustrates,but the reasons provided must demonstrate the need for a new regulation in a time span.
here,the interim rule mere restatement of the statute public safety goal is hardly comparable to the specific facts or inferable reasons set forth in hawaii helicopter or jifry.the rule did not point to any event that would make a failure to immediately implement the rule especially harmful.we lack,for example,any factual support for the rule assertion that additional sex offenses will occur absent immediate rulemaking.we do not know whether the attorney general was suggesting that there will be an increase in the frequency of these offenses,or simply that the existing harm which the underlying legislation sought to address will continue.quite simply,the interim rule explanations rely on nothing more than the nature of the harm being regulated to justify waiver.the government serious harm rationale does not constitute a reasoned basis for good cause.
the eleventh circuit formulation of the serious harm rationale in dean to permit waiver for good cause whenever delay would do real harm only reinforces the need for a specificity requirement.dean,at.all,or at least the vast majority of,regulations are designed to mitigate or eliminate some harm that is presumably real.the delay in promulgating any regulation will thus do real harm because it will allow the currently existing harm addressed by the statute to continue unabated during the notice and comment period.to avoid the good cause exemption swallowing up notice and comment requirements,a limiting principle is needed.hawaii helicopter and jifry demonstrate that the government must explain why the harm targeted by the regulation will worsen unless notice and comment is dispensed with.
accordingly,the eleventh circuit distinguishing of the sixth and ninth circuits reasoning on the basis that those cases limited good cause to emergency situations without recognizing the serious harm or real harm rationale does not convince us that the interim rule adequately set out good cause.dean,at.even were we to agree that the emergency rationale for good cause is distinct from the serious harm rationale a distinction that is difficult to make in a meaningful way the attorney general must still explain why the harm caused by delay here is unique in a way that warrants dispensing with notice and comment.the eleventh circuit does not point to any such explanation by the attorney general,relying instead on the practical benefits obtained from retroactivity,such as the reduced risk of sex offenses by sex offenders and the increased ability to apprehend sex offenders who fail to register.id.the absence of a citation to the interim rule in the eleventh circuit explanation is telling and demonstrates the weakness of the attorney general justification.id.
we therefore hold that the interim rule did not provide sufficient justification to constitute good cause for the waiver of notice and comment.
our conclusion that the attorney general lacked good cause to waive notice and comment does not end our analysis.the apa requires that due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error when courts review agency actions.f.this means that we must determine whether the agency error is harmless.shinseki sanders,d.the courts of appeals that have concluded that the attorney general lacked good cause to waive notice and comment are divided over whether this error was harmless the fifth circuit has concluded that the attorney general error was harmless.johnson,at see also dean,at wilson,concurring arguing that the dean majority was incorrect in holding that the attorney general had good cause but concurring on grounds that the error is harmless.the sixth circuit has concluded that the attorney general error was not harmless.united states utesch,cir.we agree with the sixth circuit,albeit for difference reasons.none of the courts of appeals have addressed how the criminal nature of the case before them affects the harmless error analysis.we conclude that this characteristic has important meaning because it shifts the burden of showing harmlessness onto the government.it is a burden that the government can not meet here.
the government bears the burden of showing that the failure to provide notice and comment was harmless because of the liberty interest at stake in a criminal proceeding.in sanders,the supreme court interpreted a similar prejudice provision,b,which provides that the veterans court must take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.sanders,at.the court treated b and of the apa as identical in their incorporation of the harmless error rule.id.specifically,the court explained that the language found in these provisions requires courts to apply the same kind of harmless error rule that courts ordinarily apply in civil cases and that the apa reference to prejudicial error in is intended to sum up in succinct fashion the harmless error rule applied by the courts in review of lower court decisions as well as of administrative bodies.id.quoting of justice,attorney general manual on the administrative procedures act emphasis in original.this could be read to incorporate civil review only,but the court concluded that its review of the federal circuit harmless error approach for review of the veterans court in sanders would be conducted in light of the court general case law governing application of the harmless error standard.id.emphasis added.furthermore,the language in that incorporates the rule due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error,does not make a distinction between civil or criminal harmless error review.instead,as the sanders court suggests by its review in light of the general case law,the language of plainly incorporates the entire body of harmless error jurisprudence.
this incorporation is notable here because harmless error doctrine distinguishes between civil and criminal matters in allocating the burden of proof.in civil matters,the party seeking reversal normally must explain why the erroneous ruling caused harm.sanders,at.in criminal matters,however,the government has the burden of proving that an error did not cause harm.id.but we have placed the burden to show error was harmless on the appellee only when the matter underlying review was criminal.the burden shifts in criminal matters because the government seeks to deprive an individual of his liberty,thereby providing good reason to require the government to explain why an error should not upset the trial court determination.id.here,reynolds liberty is at stake.accordingly,the government must bear the burden of showing that the failure to provide notice and comment did not cause harm.
the government argues that this conclusion is erroneous because like sorna impose only civil penalties.smith doe,d holding that a did not violate the ex post facto clause because it is a civil regulatory scheme united states parks,cir applying the smith rationale to reject an ex post facto argument against sorna.these registration regimes are therefore civil ones for which,the government argues,we would apply the framework that we apply in any other civil matter.this argument is similar to the government argument in mcaninch,d,that a petitioner requesting relief through the writ of habeas corpus must bear the burden of showing that errors were prejudicial because habeas proceedings are civil proceedings.id.at.the supreme court rejected that argument on the basis that it fail ed to take into account the stakes involved in a habeas proceeding.id.as the court explained,although habeas is a civil proceeding,someone custody,rather than mere civil liability,is at stake.for that reason,the petitioner did not have the burden of showing that the error was harmful.id.makes clear that the nature of the underlying statutory regime does not control our analysis.instead,as seen in sanders and,the nature of the interests at stake in the proceeding before the court are determinative.the government reliance on the civil nature of sorna registration requirements to shift the burden to reynolds is misguided.
the government task in carrying this burden is difficult here.the attorney general chose to completely forego notice and comment he did not merely commit some technical error in providing a notice and comment period.in the ordinary civil case,prejudice from the failure to comply with the notice and comment regime falls into two general categories.in the first category,the agency has provided some notification and method for commenting but some technical failure in that process violates statutory requirements.city of waukesha epa.in these technical failure cases,the party challenging the agency rule may be required to demonstrate that,had proper notice been provided,they would have submitted additional,different comments that could have invalidated the rationale of the rule.id.in the second category of cases,the agency has entirely failed to comply with notice and comment requirements and the agency has offered no persuasive evidence that possible objections to its final rules have been given sufficient consideration.shell oil epa.in these complete failure situations,the petitioner does not need to show that he would have offered comments that would have invalidated the rationale underlying the promulgated rule.see also mclouth steel prods.thomas,explaining that the imposition of a burden to show specific prejudice on the challenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has completely failed to comply with.instead,the utter failure to comply with notice and comment can not be considered harmless if there is any uncertainty at all as to the effect of that failure.sugar cane growers.of veneman.that means that,in civil cases,the party challenging the administrative rule has a heavier burden when the errors that have occurred in the process are only technical as opposed to when the agency has completely failed to provide notice and comment.
this distinction between technical errors and complete procedural failures is a sensible one it is driven by a concern that harmless error analysis could be used to eliminate the notice and comment requirements together with a recognition that the underlying purposes of requirements are often satisfied when the errors made are mere technical ones.as the and ninth circuits have explained,if the government could skip procedures,engage in informal consultation,and then be protected from judicial review unless a petitioner could show a new argument not presented informally section obviously would be eviscerated.sugar cane growers,at.this risk is genuine because a n agency is not required to adopt a rule that conforms in any way to the comments presented to it.riverbend farms,madigan,cir.so if the harmless error rule were to look solely to result,an agency could always claim that it would have adopted the same rule even if it had complied with the apa procedures.id.accordingly,t o avoid gutting the apa procedural requirements,harmless error analysis in administrative rulemaking must focus on the process as well as the result.id.
focusing on the process has allowed courts to make a meaningful distinction between technical errors and complete failures of notice and comment.technical errors are often harmless absent a demonstration that the challenger would have made a comment to the rule not considered by the agency because these errors often do not prevent the purposes of notice and comment from being satisfied.id.we have previously explained that a mong the purposes of the apa notice and comment requirements are to ensure that agency regulations are tested via exposure to diverse public comment,to ensure fairness to affected parties,and to give affected parties an opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections to the rule and thereby enhance the quality of judicial review.prometheus radio project,at quoting int l union,united mine workers of am.mine safety health.in addition,a chance to comment enables the agency to maintain a flexible and attitude towards its own rules.id.quoting mclouth steel,at.as part of achieving these purposes,there must be an exchange of views,information,and criticism between interested persons and the agency.id.quoting home box office.
these purposes are often fulfilled despite the presence of technical errors.in riverbend farms,for example,the secretary of agriculture weekly final rules that set quantity limitations on navel orange production were challenged on procedural grounds.at.these final rules were reached in a two step process.first,there was an annual marketing policy that interested parties were notified about and given a chance to discuss at a public hearing that predicted the weekly restrictions.second,there were weekly meetings during the growing season that growers were notified of and could comment on at a public meeting.the final recommendation for the appropriate restriction for the week was made after the meeting and became the secretary final rule.id.at.although this process did not conform with requirements because the meetings were not publicized in the federal register and there was no opportunity for written comments,id.at,the error was deemed harmless,id.at.the parties had participated for decades in the rulemaking process used by the secretary,and that process included notification to interested parties as well as consideration of comments received.id.this,the court held,was determinative because it showed that the purposes of the notice requirement were fulfilled and that the process afforded the public a full and fair opportunity to be heard.id.quoting sagebrush rebellion,hodel,cir.in short,the technical errors in the process used did not prevent the exchange of views,information,and criticism between interested persons and the agency which is the very essence of notice and comment requirements.this allowed the riverbend farms court to conclude that the errors were harmless.
these harmless technical errors stand in contrast to an agency complete failure to comply with requirements.in those situations,the purposes of notice and comment often can not be fulfilled because there has been no effort to have the kind of exchange of views and information the requirements are intended to generate.without notice and comment,the regulations are not tested by public input nor do and interested parties have an opportunity to develop a record for judicial review.the lack of a record makes it very difficult for a reviewing court to say with certainty whether petitioner comments would have had some effect if they had been considered when the issue was open,even if we are not sure what those comments would have been.mclouth steel,at.this doubt provides uncertainty as to the effect of the failure,which means that courts are often to conclude that the failure has actually resulted in prejudice.sugar cane growers,at u tter failure to comply with notice and comment can not be considered harmless if there is any uncertainty at all as to the effect of that failure.courts,then,should be hesitant to conclude that complete failure to comply with requirements is harmless.
this is not to say that there is a presumption of harm when an agency does not provide notice and comment only that the nature of complete failure often results in courts finding prejudice.courts do find that the complete failure to provide for notice and comment is harmless,for instance,when an agency substantive rule is the only reasonable one that the court would reverse if the agency came out the other way.sheppard sullivan.in other words,there is no harm from a complete failure when the administrative record demonstrates that the conclusion reached in the administrative rule was the only possible conclusion.in these instances,the lack of notice and comment could not have caused harm because the facts and circumstances reveal that the substantive conclusion reached was the only one possible.that makes testing the rule through public comment and the development of an administrative record unnecessary.see id.at explaining that the language of the statute at issue and the statute legislative history foreclosed any reading of the provision different from the agency.
in the cases discussed above,courts have discussed possible prejudice in the civil context.here,we must determine how shifting the burden from the complaining party to the government affects the analysis.in civil cases,the burden on a party challenging a rule is more difficult to satisfy when the errors are technical than when an agency has failed completely to provide notice and comment.in the criminal context,the government will have a heavier burden to show that its complete failure to comply with requirements did not cause prejudice than if it had made only technical errors in the promulgation of the relevant rule.the reasons are obvious.in cases,the government will more likely have undergone a process that provided notice and permitted some exchange of ideas.that process makes the fulfillment of purposes more probable and the risk of circumvention less so.on the other hand,in cases,the government will not be able to rely on a process that independently satisfies the purpose of requiring notice and comment.it will only be able to assert that the decision it made was inescapable regardless of what comments could have been made.
here,the government burden is heavy because the attorney general completely failed to provide notice and comment.we conclude that the government can not carry that burden.first,as with most complete failure situations,the government has not shown that the purposes of notice and comment have been satisfied.the interim rule was never tested via exposure to diverse public comment,prometheus radio project,at.there was never an opportunity for reynolds or any other interested party to provide meaningful comments relating to the substance of the rule.this also means that interested parties never had the opportunity to develop evidence in the record to enable more effective review.id.any suggestion that the postpromulgation comments to the interim rule can satisfy these purposes misses the point.see sharon steel epa,cir we hold that the period for comments after promulgation can not substitute for the prior notice and comment required by the apa.
the government also has not shown that the attorney general maintain ed a flexible and attitude towards the interim rule.prometheus radio project,at.the interim rule demonstrates a commitment to the substantive result reached the complete retroactive application of sorna registration requirements to sex offenders who were convicted before sorna enactment.the attorney general states that the interim rule serves the narrower,immediately necessary purpose of foreclosing any dispute as to whether sorna is applicable to offenders.interim rule.at emphasis added.he sought to eliminate any dispute because sex offenders with predicate convictions predating sorna who did not want to be subject to the sorna registration requirements,or who wish ed to avoid being held to account for having violated those requirements,had not been barred from attempting to devise arguments that sorna is inapplicable to them.id.emphasis added.the attorney general thus states that the purpose of the interim rule is to eliminate any dissenting points of view about whether sorna registration requirements were to be applied retroactively the very subject matter about which he was to keep an open mind.under those circumstances,the interim rule can hardly be seen as fulfilling the purposes of notice and comment.
the failure to satisfy these purposes is especially troubling because the attorney general decision to issue the interim rule undermines the very essence of why notice and comment is required.t he essential purpose of according notice and comment opportunities is to reintroduce public participation and fairness to affected parties after governmental authority has been delegated to unrepresentative agencies.dia nav,pomeroy,cir.notice and comment avoid s the inherently arbitrary nature of unpublished ad hoc determinations.morton ruiz,d.here,the lack of an opportunity for anyone to comment on the interim rule means that there was never a reintroduction of public participation after governmental authority had been delegated to an unrepresentative agenc y.dia,at.and without public participation,all that is left before an agency promulgates a rule is the agency ipse dixit that its determination will not be arbitrary and that it is fair to affected parties.
even the timing of the interim rule undermines the reliability of the agency justification.the rule was promulgated only after the attorney general realized that his interpretation that sorna registration requirements were automatically retroactive was incorrect.reynolds conviction thus appears to rest not on carefully considered facts and reason but on a hasty reaction from an attorney general caught by surprise when courts,including the supreme court,disagreed with his interpretation of sorna.more troubling is that this hasty reaction resulted in an interim rule that reiterated the substantive,unpublished judgment expressed in litigation that sorna was retroactive for all offenders before the interim rule was issued exactly the type of unpublished ad hoc determination that is inherently arbitrary in nature and that notice and comment are intended to avoid,morton,at.
the government can not show therefore that the promulgation of the interim rule has satisfied the purposes of notice and comment.like other complete failure situations,the process used to promulgate the rule was completely devoid of the exchange of views,information,and criticism between interested persons and the agency that ensures and fair rules.prometheus radio project,at.the government has not provided any reason to believe that the purposes of notice and comment are satisfied through other means.accordingly,it has not met its burden of showing that the failure to comply with notice and comment did not harm reynolds.
furthermore,the government can not show that the attorney general conclusion was inescapably correct.the strongest argument the government can muster that full retroactivity was the only possible conclusion is the fifth circuit rationale that the attorney general interim rulemaking involved a yes or no decision,rather than a complex regulatory decision that involved nuanced and detailed regulations that greatly benefit from expert regulated entity participation.johnson,at.but the supreme court,in this very case,recognized that whether to make sorna registration requirements retroactive and the scope of any retroactive application did not resemble an switch.before remanding this case,the supreme court recognized the practical problems arising when the act sought to apply new registration requirements to offenders.reynolds.at.and the court noted that congress knew that sorna could require newly registering or a large number of offenders,which could prove expensive and might not prove feasible to do immediately.id.at citing final rule.at.these considerations,the court observed,might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of offenders.id.congress delegation to the attorney general was thus a delegation to examine these offender problems and develop one efficient and desirable solution.id.accordingly,the attorney general decision regarding the retroactivity of sorna registration requirements can not be considered a foregone conclusion.
as the supreme court points out,the attorney general recognized that his retroactivity decision was not a decision.in the final rule,the attorney general distinguishes between categories of offenders.see id.citing the final rule and a later sorna regulatory decision to support its conclusion that different categories of offenders might warrant different federal registration treatment.the final rule thus requires jurisdictions to register offenders who remain in the system as prisoners,supervisees,or registrants,or reenter the system through subsequent convictions.it does not require the registration of offenders who have fully left the system and merged into the general population.final rule.at.although this distinction is made only for determining if a s
