in this bankruptcy case,the debtor,supreme beef processors,supreme beef,asserts that it may pursue tort claims against the united states department of agriculture usda that would be barred by the federal government sovereign immunity outside of bankruptcy.the district court dismissed supreme beef claims,but a panel of this court held that permissive counterclaims against the government may be used as a setoff pursuant to c of the bankruptcy code,c,which allegedly effects a waiver of the usda sovereign immunity.upon reconsidering the case en banc,we reject the panel interpretation of c and affirm the decision of the district court in its entirety.
background 
supreme beef was a company in the business of processing,grinding and selling meat products.as a major domestic wholesale supplier of beef products,the company had several contracts with the usda to support the national school lunch program.
the usda is responsible for ensuring the safety of the nation meat products,and has delegated its inspection duties to the food safety and inspection service fsis.as a general matter,the usda bears the cost of performing inspection services.it is,however,authorized to seek reimbursement for overtime work at individual plants,and a,and it may collect fees for certification services.h.
in,fsis issued the pathogen reduction,hazard analysis and critical control point systems haccp rule,which requires meat processors to develop and implement preventive controls to ensure product safety.the fsis maintains the power to verify whether plants performance plans are eliminating common pathogens such as coli and salmonella.
two years later,supreme beef implemented its first haccp pathogen control plan.unfortunately,the company failed a series of tests administered by the fsis over a period of months.
still unable to demonstrate adequate haccp control by october,supreme beef filed a lawsuit on the day that the usda had set to suspend inspection activities at its plant.removal of usda inspectors would be a fatal blow to the company,as it is illegal to sell uninspected beef.the district court granted a temporary restraining order and later upheld supreme beef contention that because the fsis testing system was not even substantially related to the plant sanitary conditions,it fell outside the agency regulatory authority.supreme beef processors,dep t of,d,aff,cir.the decision was a pyrrhic victory,however,as the court refused to compel usda to perform the national school lunch contracts.having lost its government contracts and many other customers,supreme beef was forced to seek chapter bankruptcy in september.its case was subsequently converted to chapter.
adding insult to the company injury,the usda filed various proofs of claim totaling for meat certification services and overtime inspection work.the trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the government in bankruptcy court seeking damages for usda unauthorized regulatory activity.the reference was withdrawn,and the case proceeded in federal district court.the trustee asserted five claims against the usda under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,the usda moved to dismiss supreme beef claims as being barred facially by federal sovereign immunity.see.b and b.citing b and c,supreme beef countered that usda had waived its immunity by filing bankruptcy proofs of claim.the district court sided with the usda,and supreme beef appealed.a panel of this court reversed the trial court and held that c waived usda sovereign immunity and authorized a setoff of supreme beef permissive counterclaims.this court ordered rehearing en banc.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews de novo a district court dismissal pursuant to.b or b.leclerc webb,cir.a claim may not be dismissed unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts that would entitle him to legal relief.benton united states,cir.
the issue in this case is whether supreme beef stated a viable claim for tort recovery against the usda premised solely on c of the bankruptcy code,which provides 
c notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit,there shall be offset against a claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate.
our analysis begins with the legal claim that supreme beef may not pursue an ftca claim.the constitution contemplates that,except as authorized by congress,the federal government and its agencies are immune from suit.hercules,united states,d.two constitutional provisions support this immunity.the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury,but in consequence of appropriations made by law.const.art.i,cl.consequently,any payment of money from the treasury must be authorized by congress.office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d.similarly,the property clause states that,t he congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states.const.art.iv,cl.congress has the absolute right to prescribe the manner in which its property is transferred.gibson chouteau,wall.
absent an express waiver of federal immunity by congress,the usda can not be sued by supreme beef.congress provided,in the ftca,an exclusive vehicle for the assertion of tort claims for damages against the federal government.see a b.the ftca allows a plaintiff to pursue tort actions against the federal government,and it holds the government liable as if it were a defendant in state court,subject to strict limitations.relevant here are two substantive limitations that constitute a sine qua non for a plaintiff recovery codified at,these exceptions deprive courts of subject matter jurisdiction and can not be waived.hayes united states,cir.claims based upon a discretionary function or duty of a federal agency can not be brought against the united states.a.because usda implementation of a salmonella performance standard involved discretionary acts,the ftca affords no recovery for claims predicated on such actions.additionally,h excludes recovery for claims against the united states for libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.id.h.four of the company causes of action also ran afoul of this limitation.the district court correctly held,and supreme beef does not dispute on appeal,that for these reasons,it could not have asserted ftca claims against the usda prior to filing bankruptcy 
in lieu of the ftca,supreme beef contends that the bankruptcy code effected an independent waiver of federal sovereign immunity,allowing its offset of permissive counterclaims against usda proof of claim.while the determinative provision for supreme beef is c that provision is part of a bankruptcy code section that deals more completely with questions of sovereign immunity in searching for the best interpretation of c,it is a cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole,in order not to render portions of it inconsistent or devoid of meaning.state dep t of soc.health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d internal quotation omitted.another guiding principle is that waivers of sovereign immunity should be narrowly construed in favor of the united states.united states nordic vill,d.
bankruptcy code currently consists of three subsections,which provide in pertinent part 
a notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity,sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to the following 
sections,and of this title 
nothing in this section shall create any substantive claim for relief or cause of action not otherwise existing under this title,the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,or nonbankruptcy law.
b a governmental unit that has filed a proof of claim in the case is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such governmental unit arose.
c notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit,there shall be offset against a claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate.
when the modern bankruptcy code was enacted in,congress attempted to create a level playing field between sovereign entities and other participants in bankruptcy court by abrogating sovereign immunity.subsections b and c have been redesignated,but are substantively unchanged since the code inception except for the addition of the notwithstanding clause to c in.the current structure of the provisions is a response to supreme court decisions that required express declarations of congressional intent to abrogate sovereign immunity in order to satisfy to the eleventh amendment and federal immunity law.see,hoffman.dep t of income,d nordic,supra,at.at.section a creates jurisdiction in bankruptcy courts n otwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity to hear certain types of administrative struggles in which governmental units may become embroiled in a bankruptcy case.the list of code sections identifies the types of proceedings in which governmental units may be sued,preference and fraudulent transfer litigation,and assessment of administrative expenses.not included among these sections is of the code,which defines property of the estate.section a provides that no substantive cause of action is created against governmental units beyond what exists in bankruptcy law or in applicable law.sections a and regulate the amounts and types of recovery in bankruptcy proceedings against governmental units for this reason,and insofar as a creates no cause of action apart from applicable law,a clearly distinguishes between sovereign immunity from suit and immunity from liability.see collier on bankruptcy,ed.
sections b and c are consistent with section a they vest the bankruptcy courts with jurisdiction to hear certain claims but do not create substantive law that will govern a claim.these provisions have been described by the supreme court as plainly waiving sovereign immunity with respect to monetary relief in two settings compulsory counterclaims to governmental claims current b,and permissive counterclaims to governmental claims capped by a setoff limitation current c.nordic,at.at importantly,in nordic village,the court added that congress grant of jurisdiction to entertain such claims is wholly distinct from the abrogation of all defenses to a claim.id.at.at.put otherwise,it can not be assumed that a claimant has a cause of action for damages against a government agency merely because there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.islamic republic of iran,citing fdic meyer,d.in meyer,the court stated that t he first inquiry is whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.if there has been such a waiver the second inquiry is whether the source of substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief.meyer,at.see also,postal serv.flamingo indus.usa,d a federal agency amenability to suit does not result in liability if the substantive law in question is not intended to reach the federal entity.sections b and c,therefore,permit the assertion of counterclaims or offsets,but they do not determine the law that substantively governs claims against the governmental units.
the law that governs counterclaims or offset claims is applicable state or federal law.this is expressed in both provisions by the requirement that counterclaims or offsets against the governmental units be property of the estate.the bankruptcy code defines property of the estate as including all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.the supreme court has emphasized that bankruptcy law is not itself a source of property rights.it functions to adjust property rights as defined by extrinsic state or federal law.butner united states,d see also in re pinetree,cir.because counterclaims or offset claims against governmental entities must be property of the estate,they are not freestanding and divorced from the substantive limitations that would be imposed outside of bankruptcy.the ftca,as noted,is the exclusive vehicle for claims that supreme beef could have maintained against usda outside of bankruptcy.literal application of c ultimately leads supreme beef to a dead end.the company may not offset any permissive counterclaim without an underlying claim that was property of the estate at the date of bankruptcy.
supreme beef takes issue with this interpretation of c on several grounds.first,it contends that its claims are property of the estate because they exist under state law,notwithstanding the ftca discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions.that state law defines certain conduct as tortious,however,simply does not mean that a private person may sue the government solely under the state law.the federal government enjoys complete sovereign immunity except as it has consented to be sued and consented to submit to liability.supreme beef implication that ftca incorporation of state tort law can be divorced from that statute express limits on liability,the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions,violates the rule requiring harmonious interpretation of a statute as a whole.
supreme beef also misplaces reliance on this court recent en banc decision interpreting the temporal limits on the definition of property of the estate.burgess sikes in re burgess,cir.both the majority and dissenting opinions in burgess considered cases in which there was no dispute that the debtor had obtained a cognizable legal claim against the federal government,a claim embodied in legislation the point of contention solely concerned whether the claim arose before or after bankruptcy.in this case,the question is whether supreme beef has any claim apart from the ftca.
supreme beef next contends that because c allows a trustee to assert permissive counterclaims notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit,this effects a waiver of substantive sovereign immunity.we disagree.the clause is designed to recognize the different procedural postures in which b and c claims arise.under b,a governmental unit will have filed a proof of claim against the debtor,for back taxes,and the unit is then deemed to have waived immunity for any compulsory counterclaim the debtor can assert that is also property of the estate.in the c context,however,it is not necessary that the governmental unit first file a claim,so no deemed waiver is appropriate.but,where a separate but related governmental entity has filed a claim,two different state agencies the debtor claim for a capped offset may be maintained in bankruptcy court notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity.this language waives immunity from suit,not from liability.
if notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity in c means any more than a recognition of the procedural posture of the waiver,if it waives immunity from liability,then this would render the property of the estate language in c superfluous as regards claims against a governmental unit.further,property of the estate would have different meanings in b and c,functioning still as a limit on a governmental unit liability in the former provision but not,according to supreme beef interpretation,in the latter provision.finally,if c uniquely among its companion provisions a and b,and contrary to the causes of action against governmental units untethered from existing extrinsic law,it impermissibly creates property of the debtor that the debtor did not have prebankruptcy.supreme beef acknowledges it could not have sued usda prebankruptcy under the ftca.the bankruptcy code does not grant supreme beef a superior right against the government postbankruptcy.
the argument may be made that because c involves capped setoff claims,such claims may not result in a judgment for money damages against a governmental unit and thus do not implicate sovereign immunity.this interpretation,however,drains any meaning from the description of the setoff as property of the estate.it also renders questionable the notwithstanding clause,which would be unnecessary if the fact of a capped offset dissociates the debtor claim from impinging on sovereign immunity.
finally,while there appear to be no decisions interpreting c as a freestanding waiver of substantive sovereign immunity,that proposition has been rejected by the tenth circuit.see franklin sav.fdic,cir.there,the plaintiff attempted to circumvent its inability to state a timely claim under the ftca by relying on.the court rejected the plaintiff contention that bankruptcy code constitutes a complete waiver of sovereign immunity separate and apart from the ftca waiver of immunity,and that this waiver permits tort claims against the united states which would otherwise not be permitted under the discretionary function exception of ftca a.id.at.acknowledging that the ftca is the exclusive remedy for tort claims against the united states,the court held that bankruptcy code does not provide a substantive or independent basis for asserting a claim against the government.id.at quoting a.we see no reason to deviate from the decision and reasoning of franklin.
iii.conclusion 
the foregoing holistic interpretation of means that supreme beef has no claim for offset against the federal government unless nonbankruptcy law gave it a claim that was property of the estate as of the date of bankruptcy.any such claim,however,was coterminous with,and doomed under,the ftca.the construction of c that supreme beef advocates would allow it to assert a prebankruptcy claim against usda that it could not assert outside of bankruptcy.this result flies against the fundamental principle that bankruptcy law is intended to divide up a debtor assets according to the property rights prescribed by applicable nonbankruptcy law.butner,supra,at.at.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
this is not an easy case,and i offer no words to make it so.rather,in my view,the best footing for resolution lies with its clouding i will explain.at its heart the dispute is whether the ftca selectively incorporates state tort law,extinguishing the unincorporated husk,or whether the ftca merely waives sovereign immunity,leaving a remedy under certain conditions.to my eye,resolving that question largely decides the case.this is true because any claim brought under c must have been property of the estate that is,the claim must have existed.there is the traditional view,sovereign immunity destroys the remedy,not the cause of action there is the response that the revival of previously barred state tort claims would create property of the estate that never existed outside of bankruptcy.
while this response arguably is question begging,it is not demonstrably wrong.indeed,its main hurdle is the text of section c itself,which provides for an offset against the government notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity.the argument must explain what other than a clear waiver of immunity these words could possibly mean.the proffered solution is more clever than grounded and mirrors our approach in meyers ex rel.benzing texas,which held that the state of texas waived only its immunity from suit,not its immunity from liability,when it removed a case from state to federal court likewise,the argument continues,the clear waiver expressed in section c is a waiver only of forum immunity,not of substantive immunity.
this solution has conceptual difficulties.as meyers ex rel.benzing recognized,other circuits have held that the federal government sovereign immunity,unlike that of the states,is a defense to liability but not an immunity from suit.the two constitutional clauses in which the argument locates federal sovereign immunity,the appropriations clause and the property clause,support only immunity from liability.
another,perhaps the best possible source of the federal government immunity from suit in its own courts is article iii grant to congress of the power to control our jurisdiction.early references to federal sovereign immunity agree with this reading,locating immunity in the silence of the judiciary act,not the text of the constitution 
whatever the answer to this contested question,neither the supreme court nor the bankruptcy code clearly distinguishes between federal sovereign immunity from suit and immunity from liability.nor does collier on bankruptcy support this proposition,as the opinion suggests so if we are to rest decision on this useful conceptual dichotomy,we should name its source.
even assuming away this conceptual problem and accepting immunity as law,we are yet at sea.if congress merely wanted to provide jurisdiction over ftca claims to the bankruptcy courts waive forum immunity,it chose a most subtle means to make that simple purpose manifest.all other provisions waiving only forum immunity clearly sound in venue and jurisdiction and the reality that if congress intended this result,it likely would have amended the bankruptcy jurisdictional statute,not the substantive provisions of,is troubling.add to the mix another reality legislative history is no friend to the argument that section anticipates only that the same result prevail within bankruptcy as would have prevailed outside of bankruptcy.the senate report notes 
section provides for a limited waiver of sovereign immunity in bankruptcy cases the policy followed here is designed to achieve approximately the same result that would prevail outside of bankruptcy there is,however,a limited change from the result that would prevail in the absence of bankruptcy the change is and is within congress power both the federal government and the states.first,the filing of a proof of claim against the estate by a governmental unit is a waiver by that governmental unit of sovereign immunity with respect to compulsory counterclaims,as defined in the federal rules of civil procedure second,the estate may offset against the allowed claim of a governmental unit,up to the amount of the governmental unit claim,any claim that the debtor,and thus the estate,has against the governmental unit.
this senate report suggests that bankruptcy does indeed provide a cause of action for recoupment or offset that would not have been otherwise available.
so it is that the dissent argument that the waiver in section is unequivocal has purchase,but only until that waiver is viewed within the statutory matrix.for although,in the interest of fairness,section plainly exposes the government to suit when it files a claim in bankruptcy,it is another thing to say that section upsets the ftca detailed statutory provisions which expressly carve out a withholding of sovereignty.it would be surprising if congress intended to silently outflank such an important remedial statute,exposing government officials to suit for their every exercise of discretion.immunity for the exercise of discretion has been viewed as essential to the administration of government policy a view that sustains the judicially crafted federal common law of immunity for its qualified to absolute.
compare this impression of the statutory matrix to the court evolving section doctrine.in sea clammers,the court held that the comprehensive enforcement mechanisms found in relevant environmental statutes implied a congressional intent to preclude a remedy under the more general provisions of section such might be the case here.congress might have intended that the waiver in section apply only generically,to claims not covered by some other and relatively explicit statutory scheme.or,as the majority urges,congress might have intended that the waiver provide only a forum nor is that the end of deep water.
there is force in the argument that because all offsets are capped at zero recovery for the government,immunity from liability does not attach.no affirmative judgment against the public fisc can issue under section c.it true,of course,that practically speaking a penny saved by the debtor is a penny earned.but if practical effect were the standard,then injunctions would also implicate the public fisc.
but this argument ultimately fails.it does not apply to section b,and would create an odd statutory scheme under which a defendant could bring any state tort claim as an offset under section c,but could bring only ftca actions in recoupment under b.that scheme would sorely tax the text of b and c,and,as i have already pointed out,frustrates the larger congressional scheme.
this said,all the writings collectively make plain that ambiguity remains in the waiver of immunity.a congressional waiver of immunity must be unequivocal by the rule,resort to legislative history,which we turn to with textual ambiguity,is foreclosed,even if it offered answers,which it does not.and it is the clear statement rule that closes this case.while the argument of the dissent is strong,the clear statement rule demands that it do more.the majority,concurring,and dissenting opinions search for definitive readings of the statutory matrix and in the effort offer creative solutions that,while not fully successful,expose ambiguity.other courts,in their search for concinnity,have done the same and ambiguity is resolved in favor of the sovereign.either way,and with all respect,the writings overstate their case,and move with more certainty than is warranted.rather than creatively stretching for certainty,i would accept the uncertainty,apply the clear statement rule,and reach the same conclusion as the majority.to my eyes,my colleagues move beyond interstitial interpretation of this statutory array to the making of policy choices that ought be left to congress.
i join the majority opinion and write separately only to assign additional reasons for concluding that the tort claims that supreme beef attempts to bring in this case are not property of the estate that can be asserted as a setoff under section c of the bankruptcy code.in my view,the resolution of this question,which turns on the proper characterization of the federal tort claims act the ftca,is critical to the result in this case.because the ftca is something more than a mere limited waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity,i agree with the majority that the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section c does not permit a debtor to assert in bankruptcy tort claims that would otherwise be barred by the substantive exceptions to the ftca.see.
liability may be imposed upon the united states only if two requirements are met there must be a waiver of sovereign immunity and there must be a source of substantive law that provides a claim for relief.see fdic meyer,d.the ftca fulfills both of those requirements,as it waives the federal government immunity from suit and provides that the united states shall be liable for the torts of its employees under certain circumstances.see b,richards united states,d the tort claims act was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the united states from suits in tort and,with certain specific exceptions,to render the government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.for the most part,the ftca pegs the scope of governmental tort liability to the content of applicable state law,but congress undoubtedly possesses the authority to displace state law and place federal limits and conditions on the federal government tort liability,see richards,at,and it has exercised that authority at various places in the ftca.for example,the ftca establishes a federal statute of limitations that applies irrespective of the relevant state limitations period,see b it sets limitations on the remedies available against the united states,see id.it provides that it is the exclusive remedy for tort recovery against the united states,see id.b and,most importantly for this case,it categorically excludes liability for many types of claims,including claims based on a discretionary governmental function,claims arising in a foreign country,and claims arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.id.moreover,in developing the jurisprudence under the ftca,the federal courts have used a mixture of federal,state and hybrid concepts.see devlin united states,cir discussing hybrid,purely federal and purely approaches to defining different ftca statutory terms.
while the rules of decision in suits brought under the ftca are derived principally from the law of the states,a substantial number of purely federal and hybrid precepts are also integral to the body of law known as the ftca.consequently,the ftca claim for relief,which is subject to all of the federal principles,limitations and more,is not exclusively a claim in any realistic sense.similarly,where a party is prevented from recovering from the united states by,for example,the ftca discretionary function exception,he does not possess a cause of action that is simply barred by the united states sovereign immunity rather,his claim is barred,or effectively preempted,by a substantive limitation imposed by federal law.thus,although section c of the bankruptcy code contains a waiver of sovereign immunity,that section can not be read to dispense with the substantive principles and limitations that the ftca imposes on the liability of the united states.to hold otherwise would require us to construe section c as not only waiving sovereign immunity,but also altering the essential nature of tort claims against the united states and significantly expanding the substantive liability of the federal government for tort claims asserted in a bankruptcy proceeding.congress presumably has the authority to enact such sweeping substantive changes,but the current section,which speaks only in terms of sovereign immunity and expressly disclaims the creation of any substantive claim for relief or cause of action,a,does not do so.accordingly,i join the majority opinion.
i join the majority judgment.in my view,section c does not unambiguously abrogate the federal government sovereign immunity retained by the federal tort claims act 
section c provides notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit,there shall be offset against a claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate.the n otwithstanding phrase can plausibly be read as merely providing a forum in bankruptcy courts for claims against the federal government that would have been cognizable in another venue.this construction would not override the express reservation of sovereign immunity in the federal tort claims act for a lengthy list of particular claims nor would it subject the federal government to liability under state common law or myriad state and federal statutes as a person or entity without sovereign immunity.but a plausible argument can also be mounted,as the dissent has done,that the phrase n otwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity means that all sovereign immunity is swept aside in its entirety,and therefore all state and federal causes of action that would be viable against a private entity are viable against the federal government.
the supreme court has repeatedly held that w aivers of the government sovereign immunity,to be effective,must be unequivocally expressed,and the government consent to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.the supreme court has held that sections b and c,when they were,respectively,sections a and b meet this unequivocal expression requirement with respect to monetary liability.the court said in this regard,
addressing claim s,which the code defines as right s to payment,a,they plainly waive sovereign immunity with regard to monetary relief in two settings compulsory counterclaims to governmental claims,a and permissive counterclaims to governmental claims capped by a setoff limitation,b.next to these models of clarity stands former subsection c though it,too,waives sovereign immunity,it fails to establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims.it is susceptible of at least two interpretations that do not authorize monetary relief 
i submit that while former sections a and b,now sections b and c,clearly waive sovereign immunity with respect to monetary liability,they do not unequivocally abrogate sovereign immunity to the extent that they breathe life into causes of action against the federal government that would not otherwise exist.the supreme court was not presented with this question in nordic village,and its statement that the language in sections b and c are an unequivocal expression with respect to monetary liability can not be stretched to encompass the issue before us today.
even when congress has used waiver language that should be given a is to say,such as a provision the interpretation of the waiver statute was just the initial step in a inquiry.in united states postal service flamingo industries usa the supreme court discussed the analysis employed in an earlier case,fdic meyer e ven though sovereign immunity had been waived,there was the further,separate question whether the agency was subject to the substantive liability recognized in bivens.in flamingo industries,the question was whether the postal service could be liable under the sherman act based on the provision in the postal reorganization act of the supreme court explained,we ask first whether there is a waiver of sovereign immunity for actions against the postal service.if there is,we ask the second question,which is whether the substantive prohibitions of the sherman act apply to an independent establishment of the executive branch of the united states.the supreme court criticized the court of appeals because the court of appeals found that the postal service immunity from suit was waived to the extent provided by the statutory clause and,in doing so,conflated the two steps,which resulted in an erroneous conclusion.the supreme court explained that the substantive law on which a claim is based must be consulted to determine if it was intended to reach the federal entity 
while congress waived the immunity of the postal service,congress did not strip it of its governmental status.the distinction is important.an absence of immunity does not result in liability if the substantive law in question is not intended to reach the federal entity.so we proceed to meyer second step to determine if the substantive antitrust liability defined by the statute extends to the postal service.under meyer second step,we must look to the statute 
the n otwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit phrase in section c does not clearly strip the federal government of its governmental status as distinguished from immunity.it would seem that congress would more plainly state its intention to override the federal tort claims act retention of sovereign immunity from the claims enumerated in,including those based on the exercise or performance of a discretionary function or duty,or arising out of interference with contract rights,if that were congress intent.the n otwithstanding phrase is an improbable vehicle for such a sea change in the government liability.for example,the federal tort claims act expressly retains sovereign immunity from liability for punitive damages if congress intended to strip the federal government of its governmental status in bankruptcy court,then punitive damages would be available under sections b and c of the bankruptcy code since section a expressly provides that punitive damages may not be awarded but no similar provision is included in either section b or c.
we can not resort to legislative history to discern the intent of congress when there is ambiguity regarding waiver of sovereign immunity.as the supreme court has said,legislative history has no bearing on the ambiguity point t he unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in the statutory text.if clarity does not exist there,it can not be supplied by a committee report.
focusing on whether a claim against the government is property of the estate is not helpful in determining whether section c permits assertion of the claims at issue in the case before us even assuming that a claim that is barred by sovereign immunity is not property of the debtor estate,if section c abrogates sovereign immunity,sovereign immunity is not a bar to the claim therefore,the claim is property of the estate.whether supreme beef processors prevails ultimately turns on the meaning of the n otwithstanding phrase in section c.because that phrase is ambiguous,it does not waive the federal government immunity from the claims enumerated in.
for these reasons,i would affirm the district court judgment.
i agree with the majority opinion dismissal of supreme beef b claims.however,to reach its holding that supreme beef can not use c to offset the usda claim for overtime inspection services,the majority opinion ignores the plain language of c,disregards congress intent to allow offset against governmental claims,and rewrites the definition of property of the estate.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
section c of the bankruptcy code provides that,n otwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit,there shall be offset against a claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate.a straightforward reading of c plain language shows that the only limitation to offset is that the bankrupt claim be property of the estate.see collier on bankruptcy ed.because c contains an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity and because supreme beef offset claim is property of the estate,supreme beef has the right to pursue its offset claim.
c contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity 
for c to allow supreme beef to offset the usda claim for overtime inspection services,there must first be an explicit,unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.united states nordic village,d waivers of the government sovereign immunity,to be effective,must be unequivocally expressed.internal quotation omitted.section c allows a debtor to offset a governmental claim n otwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity.congress waiver of sovereign immunity could not be more explicit.the supreme court has stated,when discussing the predecessors to b and c that they plainly waive sovereign immunity with regard to monetary relief in two settings,one of which involves claims capped by a setoff limitation.nordic village,at.scalia.construing c as anything other than an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity ignores the statute plain language and congress intent manifested thereby.see.bank germain,d we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.citing united states ron pair,d.
indeed,the waiver language in c was added by congress in with other clarify that sovereign immunity was expressly waived.see,at,reprinted in.see also elizabeth gibson,congressional response to hoffman and nordic village amended section and sovereign immunity,am,the insertion of the phrase n otwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity serves merely to make explicit the congressional intent to eliminate sovereign immunity as a defense to setoffs falling within the terms of the provision.alteration in original.the waiver language in c is nearly identical to the waiver language in a,which congress unmistakably modified to overturn the effects of the hoffman and nordic village decisions.see,at,reprinted in,cent.comm.college katz,d noting that congress modified what is now a to clarify that it waives the federal government sovereign immunity.therefore,any implication that c does not explicitly waive sovereign not only creates a result incompatible with congress intention,but also creates inconsistency between a and c,with nearly identical language leading to waiver in a but not in c.
supreme beef claim is property of the estate.
since c contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity,this court must turn to the only remaining offset requirement in c.as the majority correctly notes,for supreme beef to offset the usda claim,its claim must be property of the estate as required in c.see op.at.property of the estate is defined as all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.in analyzing whether supreme beef claim against the usda meets this definition,this court recent decision in burgess sikes in re burgess,cir en banc,is instructive burgess was a farmer who suffered a crop loss prior to filing for bankruptcy.id.at.after burgess filed his bankruptcy petition and after he was discharged from bankruptcy,congress enacted legislation that entitled him to a relief payment.id.the trustee argued that the payment was property of the estate,while burgess argued for sole possession.see id.
in resolving the dispute,the court first rejected the trustee argument that crop loss together with potential relief legislation constituted property of the estate.id.at.it held that,because burgess had only a mere hope that legislation would be enacted when he filed his bankruptcy petition,burgess had no interest,contingent or otherwise,in the payment when he filed that petition.id.the court next considered the trustee argument that the crop loss itself was property of the estate and concluded that burgess had no legal prepetition claim because h is crops were damaged by nature rather than at the hands of an individual or entity giving rise to a legal claim for reimbursement.id.at.
from the burgess court analysis emerges a inquiry.first,there must be a prepetition loss.second,the claimant must have a prepetition right to recover that loss supreme beef claim satisfies both steps.the loss here is the injury caused by the usda inspectors,and supreme beef has a right to recover the loss pursuant to substantive texas state law,assuming it proves the necessary facts after any remand.see,burch,cir analyzing defamation claims under texas law.since supreme beef claim satisfies these two steps,supreme beef claim is property of the estate,and supreme beef has met the lone requirement to pursue an offset claim under c.
the majority opinion focuses on the fact that the ftca discretionary function exception,along with other ftca provisions,would stand as a sovereign immunity bar to supreme beef recovery outside of bankruptcy.in the majority opinion view,because sovereign immunity would bar supreme beef claim if brought through the ftca outside of bankruptcy,its claim is not property of the estate this analysis improperly fails to distinguish between a right and a remedy and construes property of the estate in a manner that is inconsistent with fifth circuit and supreme court precedent.
the ftca provides both a limited waiver of sovereign immunity and federal court jurisdiction for tort claims brought by individuals against the united states.see b.ftca focus is on the remedy what the ftca does not do is provide the substantive law from which the right to recover arises.the state law does that.both the text of the ftca and the supreme court analysis of that text reveal that the ftca is merely a procedural vehicle through which state law claims are brought.see b noting that the federal government can be sued in federal court for injury or loss of property under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred internal quotation omitted and emphasis added.see also meyer,at.noting that the supreme court ha s consistently held that the reference to law of the place means law of the source of substantive liability under the ftca emphasis added united states brown.t he effect of the tort claims act is to waive immunity from recognized causes of action.internal quotation omitted and emphasis added.supreme beef claims against the usda include claims for,among other things,slander and libel.these causes of action are creatures of texas state law,which provides a right for supreme beef to recover.this right to recover from the usda,under burgess,is property of the estate irrespective of whether the ftca provides a procedural remedy for that right.
the majority holding that the mere presence of a sovereign immunity bar in the ftca prevents the existence of property of the estate can not be reconciled with this court en banc opinion in burgess.as stated there,sovereign immunity is not a bar to the existence of a prepetition cause of action for bankruptcy purposes.burgess,at emphasis added.put otherwise,the presence of a sovereign immunity bar,here the ftca discretionary function and other exceptions,does not mean that no right to recover exists.the burgess court drew this distinction citing to supreme court precedent.see at citing williams heard,and milnor metz,pet,and emphasizing that both decisions distinguish between the existence of a right and the ability to enforce that right.this distinction should not be conflated 
the majority holding effectively requires two express sovereign immunity waivers for a bankrupt to offset a governmental claim one express waiver in the bankruptcy code and one in the ftca.the supreme court requires one.see nordic village,at.it is incongruous to add an additional prerequisite considering that congress did not include this requirement in c or in the definition of property of the estate and considering that sovereign immunity is less of a more,as the majority holding bankruptcy situations.katz.at.
moreover,where the claim against the government is only for offset,as supreme beef is,sovereign immunity concerns are even further diminished because supreme beef can not affirmatively recover from government coffers.congress implicitly recognized this lessened concern c contains fewer limitations on the waiver than do a and b.in a,congress limited the sovereign immunity waiver to situations covered by enumerated sections of the bankruptcy code and in b limited waiver to situations in which the claim against the government is property of the estate and arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the government claim.section c does have its own limitation,but it is a less restrictive one than a or b t here shall be offset for any claim that is property of the estate.it is not unreasonable to think that congress provided a limitation in c that is less restrictive than those in a or b because a bankrupt claiming offset can not affirmatively recover from the government.
conclusion 
since congress explicitly waived sovereign immunity and supreme beef claim is property of the estate,i would hold that supreme beef can pursue its claim for offset against the usda claim for overtime inspection services.i respectfully dissent from the majority holding that supreme beef can not offset the government claim under c.
supreme beef complaint alleged tortious interference with business relations tortious interference with existing contracts slander business disparagement and breach of duty to perform proper inspection.
while its ruling on c resulted in a reversal of the district court judgment,the panel upheld the trial court conclusion that b did not apply because supreme beef claims against usda are not compulsory counterclaims.see b and infra note.
the ftca contains two administrative prerequisites to suit that were arguably also not complied with and could bar supreme beef suit.these are the requirements for exhaustion of administrative remedies and a limitation on filing suit following exhaustion.see b,a.the district court held that c obviated the administrative exhaustion roadblock for supreme beef.see,ashbrook block,cir.we need not consider that ruling here,nor has the limitation been raised.
the ftca provides the sole basis of recovery for tort claims against the united states.that congress chose to incorporate standards for federal conduct that mirror applicable state standards of liability does not diminish this exclusivity.in fact,the exclusivity is reinforced by substantive limits on that incorporation,which are embodied,inter alia,in the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions to the ftca.
supreme beef continues to contend that its claims are also permitted under b,which authorizes recovery of compulsory counterclaims against a governmental unit that has filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case.the discussion hereinafter of property of the estate is as relevant to b as to c.we also find dispositive,as did the panel,the district court ruling that because usda claims for over
