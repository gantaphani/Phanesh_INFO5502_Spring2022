petitioner hamdi al khalili appeals the order by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge final order of removal to jordan.the immigration judge rendered her decision on june,denying khalili application because he failed to establish his membership in a particular social group and because he did not show that the jordanian government was unwilling or unable to control the actors who he alleged would seek to harm him.khalili appealed to the bia.the bia affirmed,concluding that khalili had failed to demonstrate the inability or unwillingness of his government to protect him.
khalili now petitions for review of the bia decision.he argues that the bia determination that he did not belong to a particular social group,such that he would face persecution if he were forced to return to jordan,was arbitrary and capricious.he also argues that the bia erred in finding that he had not established a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum based on its reading of jordan official stance on honor killings.
the government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider khalili claim because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.in the alternative,the government argues that substantial evidence supports the bia decision.
for the reasons set forth below,we find that bia actions exhausted khalili administrative remedies by sua sponte raising and ruling on the immigration judge determination regarding the jordanian government.thus,this court has jurisdiction to consider khalili appeal of that issue.however,this court also finds that substantial evidence supports the bia determination that khalili failed to show that the jordanian government was unable or unwilling to protect him and his family.we therefore deny khalili petition for review.
background 
factual background 
khalili,a citizen and native of jordan,met his current wife,deena,in jordan in.despite resistance from her family,they married in august.before and after the wedding,deena family members showed their disapproval of the relationship by beating deena and by making false accusations against khalili.based,in part,on fear for himself and his family,khalili moved with his wife and two children to the united states in september.
while living in the united states,khalili and deena got into a disagreement relating to deena sister.deena family became involved in the dispute,which ultimately led to the couple divorce in august.though khalili and deena were both living in michigan at the time,the divorce was obtained under jordanian law.thereafter,deena and the children moved back to jordan,where she alleges that her family mistreated her because of the divorce.
following the divorce,khalili married his second wife in.after a few months,khalili second wife took a trip to new jersey,and he never saw her again.he subsequently obtained a second divorce.
meanwhile,as a result of the harsh treatment they received after returning to jordan,deena and the children moved back to the united states in june.khalili renewed contact with her,and they had a third child in may.they remarried in may.
procedural background 
khalili was legally admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant visitor on september.the immigration and naturalization service,now part of the united states department of homeland security,initiated removal proceedings against him by filing a notice to appear,charging him with removability under section a b of the immigration and nationality act the ina,a b,as an alien who remained in the united states for a time longer than permitted.
at the removal hearing on october,khalili conceded removability,but filed an application for withholding of removal under section b.alternatively,he requested voluntary departure under section b.
khalili section b application for withholding of removal claimed persecution on account of his religion and membership in a particular social group.he testified in support of that claim in removal hearings on june,and june.khalili and deena testified that deena family had previously attacked them and their children and had also threatened them with future harm.khalili testified he feared that,if they returned to jordan,he or his family might become victims of honor murder of a family or clan member due to the belief that the individual has brought dishonor on the family.finally,khalili testified that he did not believe the jordanian government could protect him because usually they do interfere with honor things.joint appendix.in support of his arguments,khalili offered marriage and divorce certificates as well as two british broadcast corporation news articles related to honor killings in jordan.in response,the government submitted the state department country report on human rights for jordan.
on june,the immigration judge denied khalili application for withholding of removal.despite finding khalili testimony generally consistent and credible,the immigration judge determined that khalili was ineligible for withholding of removal under the ina because he was unable to establish that he had been or would be subject to persecution on account of any of the five statutorily enumerated grounds.noting that khalili had claimed protection based on religion and on membership in a social group the immigration judge defined as males subject to honor immigration judge found that khalili ability to establish that he fit within a particular social group was undermined by the lack of evidence showing that the cultural practice of honor killing is extended to men.the immigration judge also found that khalili had not demonstrated that the jordanian government would be unwilling or unable to protect him.finally,the immigration judge denied khalili request for voluntary departure.
khalili appealed to the bia.the bia denied that appeal on february,stating that khalili notice of appeal and briefs did not challenge the immigration judge finding that he failed to show that the government of jordan was unwilling or unable to protect him.despite khalili failure to challenge that issue,the bia nonetheless ruled on it.the bia relied on evidence showing that the jordanian government prosecutes those accused of honor killings.the bia also determined that khalili failed to present any evidence that men,as opposed to women,were the subjects of honor killings.the bia reasoned that khalili failure to show the inability or unwillingness of his government to protect him was a sufficient basis for denying his application for withholding of removal,and the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision.
ii.law and analysis
