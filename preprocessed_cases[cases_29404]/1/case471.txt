the litigation at issue here is an outgrowth of an earlier action appealed to this court,see commonwealth of blackstone valley,cir,an environmental case in which we ordered a key question referred to the united states environmental protection agency epa under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.not liking the epa response,the successor to the defendant in the initial action filed suit directly in this court,asserting that the courts of appeals have original jurisdiction under b,which grants direct appellate review of certain actions under the clean water act cwa.because we find that direct appellate review of the precise action interpretation of an already listed toxic pollutant in response to a primary jurisdiction not within the scope of section b,we hold that we lack subject matter jurisdiction.rather than dismissing the petition,we transfer it,for efficiency purposes,to the federal district court for the district of massachusetts,thus consolidating it with the underlying environmental litigation that generated the primary jurisdiction referral.see.
we briefly describe the facts,beginning with the underlying litigation.in,the commonwealth of massachusetts sued blackstone valley electric company blackstone,the corporate predecessor to narragansett electric company narragansett,the plaintiff in this action,in federal district court for the district of massachusetts to recover cleanup and response costs under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et.see blackstone valley,at.the cleanup costs were for excavation and removal of soil and wood chips contaminated with the compound ferric ferrocyanide ffc.see id.the ffc was created as a waste byproduct of a gas manufacturing process employed by a gas facility that had been operated by blackstone from.see id.
the commonwealth ability to recover its cleanup costs turned essentially on the question of whether ffc was a hazardous substance within the meaning of cercla.see id.at.cercla definition of hazardous substance incorporated various lists of substances from other environmental statutes,including the list of toxic pollutants that the epa administrator was charged with promulgating under the cwa,a.see d.ffc itself is not listed on any of the lists incorporated by cercla.however,the category cyanides is included on the cwa list of toxic pollutants,as determined by the epa administrator.see also tbl.incorporating this list into cercla.
the commonwealth argument in the initial litigation was that the term cyanides in the cwa list of toxic pollutants under a included within it the compound ffc.the district court granted the commonwealth partial summary judgment on the issue of whether ffc was a hazardous substance under cercla,holding that the term cyanides,by its plain meaning,included the cyanide compound ffc.see commonwealth of blackstone valley.
on appeal,this court vacated the district court grant of partial summary judgment on this issue.we held that there was no plain meaning whether the term cyanides included ffc,given conflicting expert affidavits on the scientific meaning of the term.blackstone valley,at.we noted further that h aving found that epa regulatory framework does not adequately define the term,that the legislative and regulatory history of the term cyanides does not establish the commonwealth position,and that the position advocated by amicus the epa is not entitled to deference,we are left with virtually no legislative or administrative guidance for determining whether the term cyanides includes ffc.id.at.thus,we ordered the question referred to the epa under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.see id.at.specifically,we remanded the case to the district court to refer to the epa the question,for administrative determination,of whether ffc qualifies as one of the cyanides within the meaning of and,table.id.at.the district court stayed its own proceedings pending this determination.
eight years later,in,the epa finally answered the question in a final administrative determination fad,as follows ferric ferrocyanide is one of the cyanides within the meaning of the toxic pollutant list under the clean water act.see.in reaching this conclusion,the epa undertook both a legal review and a scientific review.in its legal review,the epa considered the legislative history of the cwa toxic pollutant provision,a,the statutory language of this provision,and its own history of implementing this provision.it acknowledged that none of these sources specifically addressed ffc or discussed the scope of the term cyanides,but found that these three indicators showed that the listed pollutants under a were meant to be broad categories or families of compounds.further,the epa noted that the context of a made a broad reading of these listed toxic pollutants sensible listing does not impose any regulatory requirements rather it establishes how a listed pollutant may be regulated in effluent limitation guidelines and national pollutant discharge elimination system permits.in its scientific review,the epa stated that there was evidence that ffc can and has released free cyanide in the environment in ways that could be toxic to humans and aquatic organisms.c omments from peer reviewers and experts with specialized knowledge were generally supportive of epa scientific analysis thus this scientific analysis support s the epa conclusion from its legal review that the term cyanides under includes ffc.
before promulgating its fad,the epa provided notice and opportunities for public comment,as well as a peer review of its proposed determination by scientists.see.at.the epa stressed that in its view,because its fad was not a legislative rule,the agency did not need to provide a notice and comment period,but had provided one solely out of choice.see id.the epa also emphasized its view that 
epa fad clarifies the agency interpretation of the term cyanides and does not impose new requirements.it does not mean that ffc is a newly added pollutant to the toxic pollutant list under a.the fad is not a regulation nor does it change existing regulations under the cwa or cercla.
unhappy with the epa fad,which obviously meant it was more vulnerable to having to pay cercla costs to the commonwealth,narragansett the corporate successor to blackstone filed a petition for review under b of the epa fad in this court,on january.
before us,narragansett seeks a determination that the epa fad constituted a legislative rule adopted without complying with the strictures of the administrative procedure act apa,and thus is void.meanwhile,the federal district court for the district of massachusetts continues to have jurisdiction over the initial,underlying case in which the commonwealth sued narragansett for cleanup costs,because it was the court that originally referred the question to the epa under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.as best we can tell,no substantive action has taken place in that court due to the pendency of this action.
the epa has sought to dismiss the court of appeals review petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that we do not have original jurisdiction over this action under b and that any jurisdiction is instead vested in the district court under the general provisions of the apa.narragansett opposes this motion.the commonwealth has intervened and,while taking no position on the jurisdiction question in the court of appeals,argues that if we find that we have no jurisdiction over this case,we ought to transfer the action to the district court hearing the initial case between the commonwealth and narragansett,rather than dismissing it entirely,so as to facilitate efficient resolution of the underlying cercla claim.narragansett opposes this as well.
the relevant jurisdictional provision at issue,b,provides for direct federal court of appeals review of certain actions of the epa administrator under the cwa among the epa administrator actions under the cwa which are directly reviewable in the courts of appeals are the promulgation of any effluent standard,prohibition,or pretreatment standard under.b c
