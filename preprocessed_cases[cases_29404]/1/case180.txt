petitioner othmane idy idy,a native and citizen of morocco,seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an immigration judge ij removal order.idy argues that the bia erred in two ways first,by determining that his convictions mean he committed a crime involving moral turpitude and second,by denying him a waiver of inadmissibility.after careful consideration,we dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction and otherwise deny the petition.
background 
initiation of removal proceedings 
on august,idy was admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure.idy visa allowed him to stay until february,but after the visa expired he remained in the united states without authorization.
on december,idy married maria velazquez,a united states citizen.on february,idy and maria had an argument that culminated in a physical altercation in their new hampshire home and criminal convictions for idy more on that later.nevertheless,on april,maria filed an i petition to establish that she and idy were married.the department of homeland security dhs eventually approved the petition,marking the first step toward a legal immigration status for idy.
but meanwhile,on april,dhs served idy with a notice to appear nta,charging him with removability under a b as an alien who remained in the united states without authorization on may,idy filed written pleadings admitting the nta factual allegations and conceding removability.he also indicated that he would seek relief by applying for an adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility under h and on july,idy did just that.
evidence in the record 
on may,the ij convened a hearing to address the merits of idy applications for an adjustment of status and,if necessary,a h inadmissibility waiver.the evidence presented to the ij included four overlapping but occasionally markedly different versions of the same set of events idy and maria separate statements to the manchester police in the week following the february incident,and and their separate testimonies before the ij.this case does not turn on its facts nevertheless,because idy and maria testimonial shifts shed some light on the case and most pertinently idy convictions,we will now summarize each version.

on february,idy was very tired after work and wanted to sleep not having had much time to find maria a valentine day gift,idy bought her chocolates,a picture frame,and a teddy bear from rite aid.he placed the items on the table where maria could find them and went to sleep.when maria came home,idy asked her,did you like the stuff she did not respond.he wished her a happy valentine day and tried to hug her but she pushed him away.maria was upset that he only spent on her gift.they began to argue.idy tried to avoid a confrontation by going to bed,but maria went psycho and repeatedly pushed him,yelled at him,and told him to leave.instead of leaving,idy went to sleep in the living room.maria followed him and started pushing him.frustrated,he tried to leave the apartment,but she pushed him in the chest to stop him.idy managed to shove his way out of the apartment,and maria told him not to come back.
idy waited outside for the couple friend mouneer zarveen.they went to a pizzeria across the street.when he and zarveen returned to the apartment,idy and maria began to argue again.maria told idy that she was going to make him go through hell.he tried to sleep on the couch but maria threw an ashtray at his chest and began pushing and hitting him.she picked up a metal table lamp and hit him with it three times one of the blows hit his right hand.as zarveen tried to pull maria away,idy took the lamp from her.he pushed her hard several times and then grabbed her face and shoved her away.idy stood in front of maria holding the lamp while she sat on the couch with her hands in front of her face in a defensive position.intending to break a clay pot on the floor,idy calm ly walked over to the pot and flipped it in maria direction it hit her in the head and broke upon impact.

maria statements to the manchester 
idy was maria first love.in the beginning of their relationship he treated her fine,but then he became controlling and limited her interactions with her friends and family.idy did not let her go out,he made her do womanly duties,and he threatened to leave her if she did not obey him.eventually,he became physically abusive and his pushes and slaps progressed into kicks and punches.he gave maria two black eyes and assaulted her approximately five times during a bad month.afterwards,idy would apologize and tell her that it was not going to happen again she believed him because he was her world.maria never reported the abuse to the police because idy made her feel like he was the only one she had,and she did not want him to go to jail or be sent away.
when maria came home on february,she saw two chocolate hearts and a teddy bear on the table.idy asked her if she had found the gifts she told him that she had seen the bear and chocolates but had been expecting roses.they discussed it,she said thank you,and then they went to bed.idy wanted to sleep but maria wanted to watch a movie with him.he asked her to scratch his back and she said no.they started arguing,and he told her that she was being fucking stupid.idy pushed maria away and went to sleep in the living room.she began to cry and followed him.maria grabbed idy and told him that she loved him.he pushed her away.she tried to hug him.idy punched her in the face.
maria left the living room to check her eye and when she returned,idy was lying on the loveseat,covered with a blanket.she looked for something small to throw at idy in an attempt not to hurt him.she picked up an ashtray and threw it at him and then grabbed a lamp and threw it at his feet.at this point,idy got crazy.he picked up the lamp with both hands and hit her in the head and arm with its base five or six times.idy continued to hit maria with the lamp while she stood with both hands in front of her face,trying to protect herself.she made her way to the couch where zarveen was sleeping and,screaming her lungs out because the pain was so painful,jumped on him so he could protect her.zarveen woke up and began to yell at idy to stop.maria fell backwards on the couch idy tried to hit her again.maria blacked out from the blows and when she regained consciousness she prayed,please,god,do let me die.she asked zarveen to take her to the hospital.
idy immigration hearing testimony 
consistent with his first account of events,idy claimed that the fight started because he did not get maria adequate gifts for valentine day.he awoke to maria screaming that her gifts were not beautiful or sufficient.idy told maria that he would take her out the following day but she went over to the bed and began kicking him.she followed him and continued to beat him even after he left the room to sleep on the living room couch.yelling,she threw an ashtray and a table lamp at him.he pushed her away but she kept hitting him,so he swung the lamp cord to defend himself.
idy left the apartment,and when he returned with zarveen,maria came out of the bedroom and told him to leave.she began hitting him again.he angr ily pushed the flowerpot off the table,and it hit her in the head.idy immediately left the apartment and called his friend abdalla to pick him up.he told abdalla that he had just had a fight with his wife and needed a place to stay.on february,the morning after the incident,zarveen called idy and told him that the police wanted to talk to him.
