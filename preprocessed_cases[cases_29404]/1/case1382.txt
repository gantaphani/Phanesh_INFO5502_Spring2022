in,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against david johnson,alleging that he was an alien who had committed a variety of gun and drug offenses.both the immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals bia agreed with dhs that johnson was removable.johnson then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a petition for review.he claims that he is a citizen under a.as explained below,that claim falters under the plain meaning of this constitutionally valid act of congress.
johnson also argues that because he was declared a united states citizen in a removal proceeding,dhs is precluded from litigating the issue of his alienage in later removal proceedings.but this claim runs into multiple problems.the immigration judge in the proceedings never purported to declare johnson a united states citizen.immigration judges do not even have the authority to confer citizenship.see barnes holder,cir.yet notwithstanding his criminal misconduct since the proceedings,he seeks to have dhs forever precluded from seeking his removal.
this too has problems.johnson disregards the general rule that agencies are free to fashion their own rules of procedure without interference from courts.vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.defense council.he asks us to impose a sweeping rule of preclusion that would prospectively immunize criminal aliens from deportation,no matter what crimes they might at some future date commit.but that course would breach the established relationship between courts and agencies and contravene congress efforts to secure the orderly removal of criminal aliens.see,duvall attorney general of the united states,cir.as a result we affirm the district court dismissal of johnson petition for a writ of habeas corpus and deny his petition for review.
david johnson,a native of jamaica,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on october,at the age of seven.johnson father accompanied him.although his father became a naturalized citizen a little over a year after their arrival,his father failed to use the procedure congress created to apply for united states citizenship on his minor son behalf.johnson also never applied for united states citizenship on his own behalf prior to.
johnson committed a number of crimes during his time in this country.on january,he was convicted of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c.and on may,he was convicted in state court of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and aggravated assault.
the immigration and naturalization service ins,whose powers in this area have since been transferred to dhs,sought to deport johnson on the basis of these convictions.on august,ins issued johnson an order to show cause,claiming johnson was deportable from the united states based on his criminal offenses.the immigration judge terminated the proceedings for reasons that were not discussed in the order.
on june,ins issued another order to show cause,claiming johnson was deportable on account of his drug and firearms convictions.the immigration judge terminated the proceedings on february,stating that johnson appears to be a citizen by his father naturalization.ins did not appeal.
on december,during the pendency of the removal proceedings,johnson filed a form n application for certificate of citizenship with ins,claiming that he derived united states citizenship from his father naturalization.johnson relied on u.a,which has since been repealed.this subsection stated that t he naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents conferred citizenship on that child.a.on april,ins denied the application because johnson,whose parents had never married,could not show that his parents had legally separated.johnson did not appeal ins denial.
on january,johnson was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.near the end of that term,on june,dhs initiated removal proceedings against johnson and served him with a notice to appear,alleging that he was an alien removable by virtue of his and convictions.johnson argued that preclusion principles barred dhs from relitigating the issue of his citizenship because the immigration judge in the proceedings had found him to be a united states citizen.
on may,the immigration judge denied johnson motion to terminate the proceedings and ordered him deported.the immigration judge concluded that dhs was not precluded from litigating the issue of johnson citizenship because the termination order did not make any citizenship finding.even if this obstacle were absent,the immigration judge reasoned,under duvall attorney general of the united states,cir,johnson commission of an additional crime since the proceedings lifted any preclusion bar that might otherwise have existed.additionally,the immigration judge ruled that johnson did not derive citizenship from his father naturalization.
johnson appealed this decision to the bia.the bia dismissed the appeal,relying principally on the duvall argument and agreeing that johnson did not obtain citizenship through his father naturalization.johnson filed a petition for review.
johnson also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on july,raising the same citizenship issue he litigated in the removal proceedings.the district court dismissed the petition.johnson appealed,but this court held the case in abeyance pending the bia decision in johnson removal proceedings.on may,upon johnson filing of a petition for review of the bia dismissal of his appeal,this court consolidated johnson habeas appeal with his petition for review.
we first consider johnson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.at oral argument johnson conceded that his petition for review,not his habeas corpus petition,was the proper avenue of appeal.this is because the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the citizenship issues raised in the habeas petition.
petitions for review are the appropriate vehicle for judicial review of legal and factual questions arising in removal proceedings.see a a petition for review shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal b judicial review of all questions of law and fact arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.
in fact,congress has specifically prohibited the use of habeas corpus petitions as a way of obtaining review of questions arising in removal proceedings.b n o court shall have jurisdiction,by habeas corpus to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.therefore,because the issue of johnson citizenship arose in his removal proceedings,his petition for review,not his habeas corpus petition,is the proper means of seeking redress.
johnson habeas corpus petition is likewise barred because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing his habeas action in the district court.see a requiring a final administrative denial before instituting a suit for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the united states.indeed,johnson failed to appeal the rejection of his form n application for certificate of citizenship to the administrative appeals unit of ins.
because b and a prohibit johnson from obtaining review of his citizenship claims through a habeas corpus petition,we affirm the district court jurisdictional dismissal of johnson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.as directed by statute,we review johnson claims only in the context of his petition for review.
johnson argues in his petition for review that he is a united states citizen and that the bia adopted an impermissible and unconstitutional interpretation of in ruling otherwise.this issue is of central importance,because if johnson ever was a citizen,his criminal acts would not strip him of citizenship and dhs would be unable to remove him.see minasyan gonzales,cir.but the bia in fact read the statute in accordance with its unambiguous meaning,and the statute passes constitutional muster.
the particular provision at issue here is a 
a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon fulfillment of the following conditions the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation 
johnson argues that he qualifies for citizenship because his father had sole custody of him when his father became a united states citizen.johnson claims to satisfy the legal separation requirement of a because even though his parents were never married,his mother severed family ties before his father naturalized.
but johnson conclusion falters on the fact that his parents did not marry.the bia has reasoned that the term legal separation requires that there first be a marriage and then formal steps to end that marriage.and that is the clear meaning of the statute.
every circuit that has considered the issue has found a marriage requirement in the term legal separation.see lewis gonzales,cir morgan attorney general of the united states,cir barthelemy ashcroft,cir nehme ins,cir.the fourth circuit is no exception.in afeta gonzales,cir,we held that the bia interpretation of legal separation as requiring that the minor alien parents have taken formal judicial steps to end their marriage was a reasonable one.id.at.
the reason for this unanimity lies in the strength of the underlying arguments for a marriage requirement.section a is divided into two parts.the first concerns the circumstance of legal separation.the second deals with out of wedlock situations.over and above the fact that the term legal separation alone implies that there be some formal relationship,such as marriage,that can be ended only with legal action,the statute contrasts legal separation with out of wedlock.congress plainly did not break this subsection into two parts based on these two distinct terms with the intention of making them functionally equivalent.rather,a created one path to citizenship for children whose parents had married but had undergone a legal separation and another for those children born out of wedlock whose parents had never married.johnson could not seek citizenship under the former route because his parents never married.he has not sought to establish citizenship through the latter route because his mother never naturalized.
the marriage requirement also makes sense in light of the broader statutory scheme.section takes pains to protect the rights of both parents.naturalization is a significant legal event with consequences for the child here and perhaps within his country of birth or other citizenship.lewis,at.congress recognize d that either parent may have reasons to oppose the naturalization of their child,and it respects each parent rights in this regard.id.at see wedderburn ins,cir explaining that a parent may have reasons to prefer the child original citizenship,which may affect obligations such as military service and taxation.
accordingly,an automatic conferral of citizenship usually requires the naturalization of both parents,and exceptions to this rule,including a,are narrowly tailored to avoid undue interference in the relationship.the statutory exceptions cover some scenarios where one parent has been removed from the picture to some degree.wedderburn,at.these include situations where one parent is deceased,where the father has not legitimated his child and the mother has been naturalized,and where the parents have undergone a legal separation and one parent is awarded sole custody of the child.none of these exceptions applied to johnson.these are not arbitrary distinctions.at the very least,they all involve situations where it is reasonable to raise the rights of one parent above those of the other.
it is also important to keep in mind that concerns only the automatic conferral of citizenship.johnson did not slip through some crack in our immigration law.lewis,at.johnson father could have applied to naturalize his son under the version of,which allowed a citizen parent to apply for naturalization of his or her child.there was no legal separation requirement in that version of.but johnson father never pursued this avenue.whatever the reason for johnson father decision,the point is that immigration law provided children such as johnson with an alternative route to citizenship.
johnson constitutional challenge is similarly flawed.legal classifications based on legitimacy are typically reviewed under intermediate scrutiny.clark jeter.but the immigration context is a special one.
the supreme court has emphasized congress plenary power over immigration and naturalization o ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.fiallo bell,quoting oceanic navigation stranahan.t he power over aliens is of a political character and therefore subject only to narrow judicial review.id.quoting hampton mow sun wong,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,in matters of immigration and naturalization,congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.id.quoting mathews diaz,internal quotation marks omitted.
based on these principles,the fiallo court applied rational basis review to a legal classification based on legitimacy.id.at.indeed,the issue in that case was similar to the one here.in fiallo,immigration statutes granted preferential immigration status to legitimate children of a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident.id.at.but out of wedlock children could obtain the same preference only through their mother and not through their father.id.at.
the statute at issue here,a,makes precisely the same distinction,automatically conferring citizenship on legitimate children when the parent with sole custody after a legal separation naturalizes and on out of wedlock children only when the mother naturalizes.thus we must apply the same standard as the fiallo court and uphold the statute if a facially legitimate and bona fide reason supports the distinction.id.at quoting kleindienst mandel,internal quotation marks omitted.our sister circuits have been faithful to fiallo as well,applying rational basis review to a.see barthelemy,at wedderburn,at.
congress certainly had a rational basis here.as discussed above,the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock protects parental rights.section limits automatic changes to situations in which the other parent has been removed from the picture.wedderburn,at.this removal can occur via death,a combination of legal separation and sole custody,or a father failure to legitimate his child.perhaps these three categories do not cover every conceivable situation in which the rights of a one parent should be elevated above those of the other.but our role is not to the judgment of congress.rather,the question is whether the statute is supported by a rational basis.and it surely is legal separation language from the statute and replaces it with a more informal standard it calls parental abandonment.dissenting opinion at.this is a novel reading of the statute,one that no court or agency has adopted.it is not clear what exactly is sufficient to meet the new parental abandonment standard,and neither congress nor the relevant agencies nor the courts nor the dissent has set forth what the criteria should be.it is easy to speculate on all sorts of scenarios that may or may not amount to abandonment,and in any event we have no authority to write into the statute a standard congress did not put there.
the dissent also calls for heightened scrutiny of a.the supreme court,however,has never disavowed the rational basis test adopted in fiallo for precisely this situation,and the circuits upholding a have likewise followed fiallo in applying rational basis review.recognizing the plenary power of congress in the immigration context,the two cases upon which the dissent rests its case both rejected constitutional challenges to the statutes at issue.see nguyen,noting the wide deference afforded to congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power miller albright,deference to the political branches dictates a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the congress or the president in the area of immigration and naturalization.quoting mathews diaz.
the court applied heightened scrutiny only because the statutes at issue could so clearly be upheld under that standard,thus eliminating the need to choose between heightened scrutiny and rational basis review.see nguyen,at given that determination that the statute satisfies heightened scrutiny,we need not decide whether some lesser degree of scrutiny pertains miller,at opinion of stevens,joined by rehnquist,even if heightened scrutiny applied in this context,we are persuaded that the requirement imposed by a is substantially related to important governmental objectives.internal citations omitted.thus,neither nguyen nor miller held that heightened scrutiny is required.
finally,our friend in dissent attempts to build an equitable case for petitioner,but it bears remarking that petitioner difficulties are attributable to his repeated criminal offenses,not to any unconstitutional flaw in the immigration laws.and,to sum up,the combination of adopting a parental abandonment standard and requiring heightened scrutiny of a requires the courts to formulate to an unacceptable extent immigration policy for congress and dhs.we would be holding in effect 
johnson additionally argues that because dhs failed to prove his alienage in the removal proceedings,dhs was precluded from relitigating the issue of his alienage in the removal proceedings.johnson further claims that the immigration judge declared him a citizen and that that ruling forever bars dhs from revisiting the issue of his citizenship or alienage but this is simply not the case.johnson has not satisfied the requirements for issue preclusion,and,even if he could overcome that obstacle,preclusion still would not apply given the criminal misconduct apparent in his case.
we begin our analysis with an overview of administrative preclusion principles.a basic tenet of administrative law is that agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure.vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.defense council.congress determined that administrative agencies will be in a better position than federal courts to design procedural rules adapted to the peculiarities of the tasks of the agency involved.id.at quoting fcc schreiber.therefore,the judiciary should not reconstruct agency procedures unless they are inconsistent with the demands of the agency governing statute or the constitution.see schreiber,at.
accordingly,in the immigration context,we must take care to enforce only those preclusion principles consistent with the source of our authority the immigration and nationality act ina.while judicial preclusion rules ordinarily reflect the common law,agency preclusion rules are creatures of statute.see astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,duvall attorney general of the united states,cir.courts must thus refrain from imposing preclusion principles on agencies unless such a course is dictated by statute.see astoria,at schreiber,at.the relative merits of the preclusion principles followed by courts and those followed by agencies are irrelevant t he question is not whether administrative estoppel is wise but whether it is intended by the legislature.astoria,at.
the ina contains no provision requiring the bia to adopt any particular set of preclusion rules.of course,it is true that congress is understood to legislate against a background of adjudicatory principles,including rules of preclusion.id.but this is not a license for courts to impose their own preclusion rules on agencies.to do so would undermine the agency accumulated familiarity and expertise in its subject area.see schreiber,at.agencies are familiar with their own procedures and rulings.see id.and an agency expertise,developed over years of dealing with the subject matter delegated to it by the congress,guides the agency in crafting appropriate rules of preclusion and assessing the preclusive effects of its prior rulings.see id.for a court to wade casually into the waters of agency procedure would not be conducive to the deference normally owed agencies in their congressionally sanctioned spheres.
furthermore,federal courts traditionally refer to the preclusion rules of a fellow adjudicative body when determining the preclusive effect of a ruling from that body.for example,when determining the preclusive effect of a state court ruling,federal courts do not view it through the lens of their own preclusion principles.rather,they give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the state from which the judgments emerged.kremer chemical constr.agency rulings present a similar case,especially in the context here,where the issue is the preclusive effect of a prior agency ruling on a later agency adjudication.thus,it seems axiomatic that the bia rejection of the preclusive effect of its termination order is entitled to judicial respect.
johnson claims that the government failed to prove his alienage in the proceedings by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.in fact,johnson goes further,arguing that the immigration judge declared him a citizen.he contends,therefore,that the government is precluded from relitigating the issue of his in later removal proceedings.to the extent that preclusion principles apply to removal proceedings,johnson can not benefit from them here.johnson first problem is that he can not satisfy even the most basic principle of issue preclusion that the issue actually had been decided in the previous proceeding.collins pond creek mining,cir.no body of which we are aware would invoke preclusion against a party where the issue in question had never been previously decided.
the immigration judge in the proceedings never purported to declare johnson a united states citizen.rather,he merely noted that johnson appears to be a citizen by his father naturalization.as both the immigration judge and the bia concluded,this equivocal language does not indicate any conferral of citizenship.the bia stated as much t he prior deportation case does not reflect a formal finding of citizenship.a declaration of citizenship is a significant step,and it would be remarkable to find it accomplished in this offhanded a manner.in other words,assuming the privileges and obligations of citizenship is a matter of some formality,and it would undermine the naturalization process to hold otherwise.
furthermore,neither immigration judges nor the bia have any power to confer united states citizenship.we made this point explicit in barnes holder,cir.there we noted that the bia and ijs lack jurisdiction over naturalization.id.at quoting in re acosta hidalgo.congress has exclusive constitutional power over nationalization,and therefore citizenship may be conferred upon persons only by act of congress.jahed acri,cir quoting ins pangilinan.congress conferred sole authority to naturalize persons as citizens of the united states upon the attorney general.a.the attorney general delegated these powers to ins,and they have since been transferred to dhs.although immigration judges,see,and the bia,see,have responsibilities in the immigration area,naturalization is not among them.thus,dhs is the only body statutorily vested with the power to make naturalization decisions in the first instance.barnes,at.accordingly,an application to dhs,and not a plea to an immigration judge,is the appropriate avenue to citizenship.
johnson pursued this proper route to naturalization through ins.after the close of the proceedings,ins acted on johnson form n application for certificate of citizenship it denied his application.thus,the official position of the agency with statutory and administrative authority over naturalization issues is that johnson is not a united states citizen.
the odd results of johnson position thus come into focus.if johnson were to prevail on his preclusion argument,he would be left in limbo in some nebulous state of or.he could commit crimes without fear of deportation because in the context of removal proceedings he would be treated as a united states citizen.but,because he would not actually be a united states citizen,many of the other privileges of citizenship such as voting or obtaining a united states passport would remain beyond his grasp.congress sought to avoid such a partial citizenship situation by centralizing naturalization authority.see a.we can not upset this scheme by granting naturalization authority to the immigration judge who neither purported to nor had the power to declare johnson a united states citizen.
other bars to preclusion exist as well.no common law preclusion principle applies to an agency when a statutory purpose in opposition to the preclusion rule is evident.astoria,u.at quoting isbrandtsen johnson,internal quotation marks omitted.such a purpose is evident here.removal of aliens who commit serious crimes is a central aim of the ina.see duvall,at.congress not only has adopted streamlined procedures for deporting criminal aliens,see a requiring special removal proceedings that assure expeditious removal of criminal aliens,but it went even further,limiting judicial review of removal orders in such cases,see a c d restricting judicial review of final orders of removal against some criminal aliens to constitutional claims or questions of law.legislative modifications of the ina have been in this same vein,seeking to craft a more effective and efficient process for removing those aliens who commit serious crimes while in the united states.see real id act of,stat,antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat,illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,to.
johnson falls into the class of criminal aliens congress sought to remove.there are multiple statutory bases for removing johnson because of his criminal misconduct.see a.just to name a few,his drug conviction qualifies him as removable under a b i,and his firearms convictions qualify him under a c.and yet he now seeks permanent immunization from removal,no matter what crimes he chooses to commit,all because of one ruling from an immigration judge in whose substance and legal import he has misconstrued.
granting johnson request would trample on both agency practice and congressional intent.to preclude dhs from seeking to remove an alien who continues to engage in criminal conduct after the termination of earlier removal proceedings would frustrate one of the core purposes of the prompt removal of criminal aliens.see duvall,at.indeed,only repeat offenders would benefit from such a rule of preclusion.as the third circuit noted,these aliens could flout any rule or commit any offense without fear of deportation.id.it would be ironic to suggest that congress,in its repeated efforts to ensure the orderly removal of criminal aliens,had instead granted a uniquely generous rule of preclusion to a problematic class of repeat offenders.we simply can not grant what congress has refused to tender the blanket immunization johnson now seeks.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal of johnson petition for a writ of habeas corpus and deny his petition for review.
while i agree that the rules of preclusion are,in this case,not applicable to the administrative courts,i believe that the board of immigration appeals interpretation of the phrase legal separation in a violates the equal protection guarantee of the fifth amendment due process clause.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
the majority holds that a legal separation can occur only after a divorce,and,contrary to precedent,applies rational basis review to a.section a is an immigration law that does not permit fathers to automatically pass on citizenship to their children born,and therefore discriminates based on legitimacy.thus,i would instead apply heightened scrutiny,and save a by reading it so that a separation may also occur where an alien mother has formally relinquished her rights over a child to a naturalized father.see edward debartolo florida gulf coast constr.trades council,w here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,the court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.the adoption of this alternative interpretation would eliminate the unconstitutional aspects of the board of immigration appeals understanding of the law.
as the majority correctly points out,congress has plenary power in the immigration context,see fiallo bell,o ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.citation and internal quotations omitted,and we are generally bound to apply only rational basis review when assessing an equal protection challenge to an immigration law,appiah,cir applying rational basis review where an alien questioned the constitutionality of an immigration law.
nevertheless,where the petitioner,like johnson,claims that he or she is statutorily entitled to actual citizenship,and is not merely seeking residency or a special immigration status,the supreme court has applied the more stringent form of intermediate or heightened scrutiny.see nguyen,applying heightened scrutiny miller albright,plurality same see also nguyen,cir,aff same.
in miller,the daughter of a citizen father brought an action challenging the constitutionality of a on equal protection grounds.at.section required that,in order to pass citizenship onto his child born to an alien woman abroad,a citizen father had to recognize his child before she turned eighteen,but did not impose similar burdens on citizen mothers.id.at.
after applying heightened scrutiny to the law,a plurality of the court held that the statute did not violate equal protection.compare at plurality with at breyer,dissenting arguing that intermediate scrutiny should apply to naturalization laws that discriminate based on sex.the plurality opinion distinguished fiallo and declined to apply it because that case involved the claims of several aliens to a special immigration preference,whereas here petitioner claims that she is,and for years has been,an american citizen.miller,at see also nguyen,at.in the present case,like the petitioner in miller,johnson also claims to have become and remained a citizen since,when his father naturalized.
in nguyen,a majority of the supreme court clarified miller when it again upheld,but did so only after evaluating it under the heightened scrutiny standard.at.the petitioner,a lawful permanent resident born to and raised by a citizen father in the united states,also claimed that violated equal protection,and that he was therefore entitled to actual citizenship.id.at.because the law at issue was a classification,the court applied heightened scrutiny.id.at.however,even after applying this standard,the court again held that the law was valid because it was substantially related to the important governmental objectives of ensuring the existence of a biological relationship and a genuine familial bond between the citizen father and the child.id.at.
it does not matter that johnson challenge to a is based on a distinction drawn between the marital status of his parents,and not explicitly on sex or gender discrimination,since both forms of classification are subjected to heightened scrutiny.see clark jeter,i ntermediate scrutiny has been applied to discriminatory classifications based on sex or illegitimacy.we are further compelled to employ this higher standard because,like the statutes analyzed in miller and nguyen,clearly implicates other significant constitutional interests,such as a person rights to citizenship,kennedy mendoza martinez,citizenship is a most precious right,and to maintain a familial bond,wisconson yoder,describing the charter of the rights of parents to direct the moral and religious upbringing of their children 
intermediate scrutiny queries whether a statute is substantially related to an important governmental interest.united states chester,cir citing craig b
