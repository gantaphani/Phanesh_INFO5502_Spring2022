the outcome of this employment discrimination case hinges largely on two basic requirements of litigating a title vii claim in federal court,timeliness and the submission of documents in the english language.we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiff title vii discrimination and hostile work environment claims for failure to timely file within the statutory period.plaintiff bases his assertion of timeliness on a document submitted to the court in the spanish language,without an accompanying english translation,despite ample time and opportunity to provide such a translation.we can not consider that document impact on the question of the timeliness of his claim.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to plaintiff title vii retaliation claim and puerto rico law claim.
plaintiff edmond frederique brought a variety of discrimination claims against his former employer,the department of natural and environmental resources of the commonwealth of puerto rico dner,and other defendants the district court granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the action in its entirety.frederique appeals the district court grant of summary judgment as to the title vii discrimination and hostile work environment claims the title vii retaliation claim and the puerto rico law claim because frederique appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment,we employ a de novo review,drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see reckitt colman,cir.
a.the discrimination and hostile workplace claims 
frederique,a native of haiti and an agronomist by training,began his employment with the dner in.he alleges that his former supervisor,josé gonzález,repeatedly harassed and belittled him and denied him career advancement based on his national origin,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,
in,frederique filed an administrative charge first charge with the unit adu of the puerto rico department of labor and human resources and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging national origin discrimination.frederique subsequently withdrew the first charge,allegedly because gonzález pressured him to do so and promised to improve his conduct.however,frederique alleges that after he withdrew the first charge,gonzález discriminatory behavior continued,resulting in his filing a second administrative complaint second charge with the eeoc on october.as to this claim,the eeoc issued a favorable determination on the merits and issued a letter in.frederique subsequently brought this action in united states district court for the district of puerto rico.
in his complaint filed in this action,frederique stated that gonzález discriminatory behavior continued until the year when gonzález liboy left the agency.frederique repeated this date in the plaintiff version of the facts contained in the supplemental joint case management memorandum and in his opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment.the date is critical for our timeliness analysis.
under e,a title vii plaintiff is required to file an administrative charge with the eeoc within either or days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.because puerto rico is a deferral jurisdiction,the administrative charge must be filed within days of the alleged unlawful conduct see rivera puerto rico aqueduct and sewers,cir.in his complaint,frederique alleged that the harassment against him ended when gonzález left the agency,sometime in.even assuming that the last act of alleged discrimination occurred on december,frederique would only have had until october,to file his administrative charge with the eeoc.he missed this mark by five days,filing on october.
the supreme court has said that the timeliness requirement under e is mandatory,and failure to file within the time period means a potential plaintiff lose s the ability to recover for the alleged discrimination.passenger morgan,d.we see no recognized equitable basis for tolling the period in this case,nor does frederique suggest that such a basis exists.see zipes trans world airlines,d f iling a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.jones city of somerville,cir in the absence of a recognized equitable consideration,the limitation period can not be extended by even one day.
on this appeal,in an attempt at salvaging the timeliness of his claims,frederique now points to the document he submitted to the district court in april,in response to defendants motion to dismiss,and which he also appended to his response to defendants motion for summary judgment.the document is a preprinted eeoc form entitled charge of discrimination,which frederique submitted to the eeoc on october,when he filed his second charge.the form preprinted language appears in both english and spanish.however,all of frederique responses are written in spanish alone.in the box entitled fecha de ultimo acto most recent or continuous discrimination took place,frederique entered septiembre.frederique argues that the form establishes that the last act of discrimination occurred on september,which he alleges is the true date that gonzález left the dner.he further avers that the date for gonzález departure,which he relied upon in his complaint and repeated in two later court filings,was merely a clerical error and that his submission of the charge of discrimination form to the district court constituted a constructive amendment of his complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.thus,frederique concludes,there was only a gap between the last act of discrimination and his filing of the second charge,well within the requirement.
however,frederique argues to no avail.in this circuit,we have repeatedly reminded litigants that t he law incontrovertibly demands that federal litigation in puerto rico be conducted in english,and that untranslated documents are not part of the record on appeal.assocs.of,cir see also all pleadings and proceedings in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico shall be conducted in the english language.we have also confirmed that this rule applies equally to trial and proceedings.see,at.while ignorance of this rule would not excuse a failure to translate documents,in this case it appears that frederique was well aware of this requirement because he filed,along with his opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment,a motion requesting leave to file spanish language documents and time to obtain certified english translations.six months passed between the plaintiff motion to submit the translations and the district court dismissal of his claims for failure to timely file.during those six months,plaintiff did not submit translations of any documents,including the charge of discrimination form.in sum,because frederique failed to submit an version of the charge of discrimination form,the date he entered in spanish on that form is not part of the record and does not impact our above analysis of the timeliness of his claims.
in an attempt to avoid the statutory time bar,which was implicated by the date clearly set forth in his own filings the complaint,the case management memorandum,and the opposition to the motion for summary judgment,frederique makes one final,abbreviated argument.he contends that he suffered unfair surprise because the district court did not give him the opportunity to be heard on the fact issue regarding the filing of the administrative charge.the fact issue to which frederique refers is a purported typographical error by counsel which stated that the final act of discrimination occurred in,rather than as frederique now avers.
at first glance,frederique argument appears to have some attraction.dner moved for summary judgment only on the constitutional claims,the title vii retaliation claim,individual liability for the first title vii claim,and the puerto rican law claim.notably,dner did not move for summary judgment on official liability for the first title vii claim.nevertheless,the district court granted summary judgment on all of frederique claims,
