bayside owns and operates the bayside care center,a nursing home located in lexington park,maryland.on october,the board certified the united food commercial workers,local the union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for a unit of employees consisting of 
a ll and regular hourly employees employed by bayside at its bayside care facility but excluding registered nurses,licensed practitioner nurses,business office clerical employees,managers,guards and supervisors as defined by the national labor relations act.
at.initially,bayside proved reluctant to bargain with the union,and,as a result,the union filed a successful unfair labor practices charge.after the union prevailed on the charge,on december,bayside and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement effective from december,until november.
in september,roughly two months prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement,some of bayside employees circulated a disaffection petition stating as follows we the employees of bayside care center do not no sic longer want to be represented by the union.at.the petition garnered signatures,reflecting a majority of the bargaining unit employees.
on september,employee barbara courtney who had not signed the disaffection petition filed a decertification petition with the board,citing the disaffection petition in support of her request for an election.the board dismissed her decertification petition as untimely 
on october,three days after receiving a copy of the disaffection petition,bayside notified the union that it believed the union no longer represented a majority of bayside employees and would withdraw recognition of the union when the collective bargaining agreement expired on december.bayside did not send the union a copy of the disaffection petition along with the notice.
shortly thereafter,in early november,a petition entitled we the following employees of bayside care center,lexington park,maryland,do not wish to withdraw recognition and or representation of the union the union petition was circulated among the employees.this petition also garnered signatures.on november,the union notified bayside by letter that a majority of bargaining unit employees had signed a petition stating that they desired to maintain the union as their bargaining representative.the union letter also indicated that it had submitted the petition to the board.the union did not,however,attach a copy of its petition to the letter.
undeterred,bayside withdrew recognition of the union on december,and has since refused to bargain with the union.
in response,the union filed a charge alleging,among other claims,that bayside unlawfully withdrew recognition from and refused to bargain with the union.thereafter,the board general counsel issued a complaint and notice of hearing 
on october,an administrative law judge alj conducted the hearing in washington bayside,the union,and the board general counsel had stipulated to most of the relevant facts.regarding the petitions and the employees who signed them,the parties stipulated that three of the employees that signed the disaffection petition were no longer employed by bayside on december,meaning that,for purposes of this case,the disaffection petition had valid signatures of the signatures on the union petition were valid thirteen unit employees signed both the disaffection petition and the union petition and one of the signatures was invalid because it belonged to an employee that was no longer employed by bayside as of december.thus,the only factual dispute involved the number of employees in the bargaining unit.the parties had stipulated that the unit contained at least employees,but the board general counsel and the union argued that three additional employees were part of the unit.the alj agreed,finding that the total number of employees in the bargaining unit was.at.
applying levitz furniture of the pacific,the alj explained that bayside could unilaterally withdraw recognition of the union without violating the act only if it could show that,at the time of the withdrawal,the union had in fact lost the support of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.the alj found that bayside had valid signatures from unit employees on the disaffection petition at the time it withdrew recognition.the alj concluded,however,that bayside was not entitled to rely on the signatures of those employees that also signed the union petition because those employees had clearly manifest ed that they had changed their sentiments about the union.at.the alj determined that,without the signatures,bayside lacked objective evidence that a majority of unit employees no longer supported the union.accordingly,the alj held bayside in violation of the act and,as a remedy,imposed a and affirmative bargaining order.at.
bayside filed exceptions with the board to the alj decision.in addition to specific exceptions related to the alj factual findings and legal conclusions,bayside included generalized exceptions objecting to the alj order and appendix notice to employees insofar as those portions of the alj decision related to the alj factual findings and legal conclusions.of relevance to this appeal,bayside filed exceptions to those portions of the alj order which relate to the alj findings and conclusions of law with regard to any and all section a and violations found against bayside and to those portions of the alj order which relate to the alj findings and conclusions of law to which bayside has excepted.supp.at.
the board affirmed.like the alj,the board concluded that because the signatures should be disregarded,the disaffection petition provided evidence that unit employees did not support the union.in addition,the board found that employee courtney filing of the decertification petition evidenced her desire not to be represented by the union.thus,the board concluded,bayside had shown that unit employees no longer wished to be represented by the union on the date bayside withdrew recognition.because is not a majority of either or,the board found bayside evidence insufficient to satisfy its burden of proof.
in addition,the board concluded that an affirmative bargaining order was necessary to fully remedy the violation in this case.the board explained that,although it has held that such an order represents the traditional,appropriate remedy for a refusal to bargain,the circuit requires it to justify an affirmative bargaining order on the facts of each case by applying a analysis the board therefore conducted the analysis required by the circuit and found an affirmative bargaining order to be appropriate.
the board petitioned for enforcement of its order.we have jurisdiction pursuant to e west supp providing that the board shall have the power to petition the court of appeals for the circuit in which the unfair labor practice occurred for enforcement of its order s.
