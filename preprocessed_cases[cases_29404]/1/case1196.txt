opinion of the court 
appellants herminio febres,larry williams,david sims,derek copeland,charles smith,juan diaz,nelson alexander,and angel pagan and robert hawkins were employed by the appellee camden board of education board as custodians and mechanics.on or about june,they were fired for excessive absenteeism.appellants brought this suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,invoking the provision of the family and medical leave act of fmla,a d,to contest their terminations.the district court granted appellee motion to dismiss on eleventh amendment jurisdictional grounds,holding that the board is an arm of the state.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.the district court concurrently denied appellants motion for leave to amend their complaint to add claims under against various school district administrators and officials of the board.
appellants now appeal the district court order.appellants primary target is the eleventh amendment ruling if we reverse the district court jurisdictional ruling,then we are not asked to address the denial of appellants motion for leave to amend.
we have appellate jurisdiction under.our review is plenary.see farley phila.housing,cir.because we conclude that the board has not established it is an arm of the state,we will reverse.
the eleventh amendment provides unconsenting states with immunity from suits brought in federal courts by private parties.see edelman jordan,d.the supreme court has long held that counties,municipalities and political subdivisions of a state are not protected by the eleventh amendment.see healthy,at.see also bolden se.transp,cir en banc.school boards and school districts are typically considered political subdivisions of a state,not entitled to immunity.see,healthy,at.lester gilhool,cir.in some cases,however,such entities may be viewed as arm s of the state partaking of the state eleventh amendment immunity healthy,at.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d holding that the eleventh amendment bars actions in federal court whenever the state is the real,substantial party in interest.the party asserting immunity bears the burden of production and persuasion.see christy.turnpike comm n,cir.
more than years ago the third circuit identified nine factors to be considered when determining whether an entity is an arm or alter ego of the state for eleventh amendment purposes.urbano bd.of managers,cir.the numerous factors articulated in urbano were subsequently condensed into three major criteria whether the payment of the judgment would come from the state,what status the entity has under state law,and what degree of autonomy the entity has.fitchik transit rail operations,cir en banc the referred to as the fitchik been reiterated and applied many times since.see,carter city of,cir christy,at peters.river port,cir bolden,at.
we now accord equal consideration to all three prongs of the from the state treasury,status under state law,and autonomy.benn first judicial dist.of,cir however,in hess port authority,the supreme court instructed that in close cases,where indicators of immunity point in different directions,d,the principal rationale behind the eleventh of the sovereignty of states through the prevention of judgments that must be paid out of a state treasury,id.at.remain our prime guide.id.at.see id.at.identifying states solvency and dignity as the concerns underpinning the eleventh amendment.
the controversy over classification of the camden board of education centers around the first and third criteria of the fitchik test.the board legal status under state law,the second criterion,clearly militates against immunity.
a.the status of the board under state law 
four are relevant to assessing the board legal status under state law how state law treats the board generally,whether the board can sue or be sued in its own right,whether the board is separately incorporated,and whether it is immune from state taxation.see,carter,at fitchik,at.as the district court noted in its oral opinion,the board can sue or be sued under state law,is separately incorporated,and is not immune from state taxation.see stat.ann.moreover,new jersey state law generally treats school boards as separate political subdivisions.see id.see,otchy elizabeth bd.of,noting that under state law a school board is a distinct legal entity,which,for example,may hold property in its name.
in,the new jersey legislature enacted the municipal rehabilitation and economic recovery act mrera,stat.ann.to,which provides that a municipality fulfilling specified criteria will be designated a qualified municipality and subjected to a series of measures to try to alleviate its ongoing fiscal distress.see stat.ann.to,to.camden has been so designated.see camden city bd.of educ.mcgreevey,upholding the mrera.the mrera also provides for limited school district oversight in these qualified municipalities.stat.ann.c d see id.to regarding appointment of school board members and gubernatorial veto power.
the district court suggested that the governor power,under the mrera,to veto actions taken at school board meetings abrogated the board status as a separate political entity.id.this,however,conflates the second and third criteria of the fitchik test the gubernatorial veto is better addressed with regard to the board autonomy.see discussion infra fitchik,at,addressing gubernatorial veto power under the autonomy prong of the analysis.
in sum,the various factors relating to the board status under state law support appellants contention that the board is not an arm of the state and therefore not entitled to immunity.
b.the board degree of autonomy 
the district court concluded that the autonomy factor weighed heavily in favor of immunity based on the mrera grant of veto and appointment powers to the governor.we find that this factor weighs only slightly in favor of the board immunity.
according to the mrera,the minutes of any meeting of the board must be delivered to the governor.further,according to the act,the actions taken by the board at a meeting become effective fifteen days after delivery,unless during the period the governor approves the minutes,in which case the board actions become effective upon that approval,or vetoes any action taken by the board at that meeting,in which case the vetoed action does not take effect.see stat.ann.b.
we note that the governor veto power is constrained,in accord with the limited school district oversight the mrera describes,since the governor has a limited period to respond to the board actions,and the default remains that the board actions have force or effect after approximately two weeks.moreover,the board continues to control its agenda,pursuant to its powers to act under stat.ann.
the mrera also grants the governor the power to appoint members of the board the act provides for a temporary increase in the size of the school board from nine members to twelve,to allow the governor to appoint three members.see stat.ann.h.the mrera states that to ensure substantial local representation on any such board,in no case shall the number of the positions appointed by the municipality mayor and elected by the voters,combined,constitute less than a majority of the total positions on the board.id.a.
the board argues,by way of comparison,that it is significantly less autonomous than entities which have been held not to be arms of the state,and cites kovats rutgers,cir holding that rutgers university was largely autonomous and subject only to minimal state supervision and control.appellees brief at.we note,however,that even in the case of rutgers university,members of the university two governing bodies were appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the state senate.rutgers,at noting that at least six of the eleven members of the board of governors were appointed in this way,and that the eleven members of the board of trustees were responsible for,in turn,selecting up to fifty additional trustees to serve with them.
gubernatorial appointment of board members typically weighs only slightly in favor of immunity.see,christy,at finding that the state controlled the membership of the pennsylvania turnpike commission and holding,on balance,that this weighed slightly in favor of alter ego status and immunity peters,at finding that new jersey and pennsylvania appointed all sixteen members of the board of commissioners of the delaware river port authority and holding that this weighed slightly in favor of alter ego status and immunity bolden,at finding that the state appointed of septa board members but holding that septa was autonomous.
while we agree that in the case before us the board may be subject to more overall state oversight than rutgers university,we note that other entities which have been held by this court not to be arms of a state have been subject to state controls strikingly similar to those placed upon the board.fitchik transit rail operations,offers a close comparison to the case before us three out of seven of the new jersey transit board members were required to be members of the state executive branch,and the governor ha d veto power over the board actions.at citing stat.ann.much like the camden board of education,new jersey transit njt was required to deliver minutes of its board meetings to the governor,so that,within the designated time period,the governor could veto any proposed board action.see stat.ann.f see also fitchik,at id.at rosenn,dissenting.we held that while njt was not highly autonomous like rutgers,it was still significantly autonomous and concluded that the autonomy factor only counsel ed slightly in favor of according immunity to njt.fitchik,at see also hess,at.finding that the port authority was not an arm of the states of new york and new jersey,even though the states appoint and can remove the commissioners,the governors can veto port authority actions,and the states legislatures can determine the projects the port authority undertakes.
guided by our case law,we find that the autonomy factor slightly favors the board immunity.since the board legal status,supra,plainly suggests the opposite result,we observe that the indicators of immunity point in different directions.thus,the question of the state financial we turn to particularly significant.hess,at.
c.the state treasury liability for the payment of the judgment 
in support of its holding,the district court referenced a prior new jersey district court opinion,which found that the camden board of education was entitled to alter ego status because of its limited autonomy and b ecause the vast majority of the school board funding came from the state of new jersey.camden county recovery coal.camden bd.of,d,granting the board to dismiss,and dismissing as moot an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction,requested by plaintiffs,should not be granted.the camden county recovery coalition court reported that approximately to of the board monies came from the state,and concluded this left no question that any judgment against the school board would lead to the direct expenditure of state funds in order to comply with such a judgment.id.at.
in the case at bar,the district court analysis of the fitchik prong that we will term the criterion similarly attributed overwhelming significance to the fact that camden is almost entirely state funded.the court reasoned that,given the magnitude of the state funding,any judgment would ultimately have to be paid by state funds.the district court acknowledged that this was not because new jersey bears any affirmative,legal obligation to satisfy a judgment against the directly or by reimbursing the board.rather the court concluded that,as a practical matter,it was inevitable that funds provided by the state would be used to pay a judgment and that such funds would have to be replaced by the state.in fact,the district court concluded that new jersey indirect liability was so compelling an indicator of immunity that the court deemed all other considerations irrelevant.
on appeal,the board argument mirrors the reasoning articulated by the camden county recovery coalition court and the district court in this case.the board brief asserts if the board only significant revenue stream is the state of new jersey,it stands to reason that any judgment owed would in fact be coming directly from state funding,even though it is commingled with a minuscule amount of funds from the local municipality.appellees brief at.at oral argument,the board also contended that practical necessity would require new jersey to replenish any funds used by the board to pay a judgment.the board argues that immunity is appropriate where the state makes such an overwhelming financial contribution.appellees brief at.
as explained infra,we find the board assertions,and the district court corresponding conclusions,unsupported by the record.moreover,close consideration of our case law leads us to conclude that the board central argument the crux of the the state treasury is legally responsible for the payment of a judgment against the board.contrary to the board contention,the fact that new jersey is the principal source of the board finances does not alone confer immunity,or even compel a finding that this prong of the analysis favors immunity.see rutgers,at,see also healthy,at.we must consider the nature of the state financial contributions to the board.
state funds contributed to the board budget 
whether an entity claiming immunity has,or can raise,sufficient funds to satisfy a judgment has typically been a factor in our analysis.see,peters,at fitchik,at.in the instant case,the district court concluded that payment of a judgment would necessarily come from the portion of the board budget received from the state.we find this unsupported.the record before us indicates that camden schools receive revenue from a number of sources.while funds comprise a relatively small percent of the board budget,they still total a significant sum,with nearly million in local taxes and nearly million in federal grants in.in addition,the board is statutorily authorized to raise revenues through taxes,pursuant to the comprehensive educational improvement and financing act,stat.ann.d.alternatively,to increase funds,the board could undertake to reduce expenses,fitchik,at,or,as counsel for the board acknowledged in the district court,sell assets.
furthermore,we are not persuaded that it is of legal consequence whether board funds employed to satisfy a judgment were funds which had initially been provided by the state.the record does not suggest that new jersey retains ownership or control of the funds appropriated to the board.as we noted in fitchik,w e do not see the gubernatorial veto as indicating state ownership of the money already in an entity accounts.we think it,instead,to be relevant to the third factor,autonomy.at see also christy,at finding that the state control over the pennsylvania turnpike commission authority to issue bonds,notes,and other obligations falls short of indicating state ownership of funds obtained through the issuance of such bonds,notes,and other obligations emphasis in original.the magnitude of the state contribution does not alter the fact that,once deposited in the board accounts,these funds belong to the board.if then used to pay a judgment,we can say only that the judgment was satisfied with the board monies.fitchik,at rutgers,at blake kline,cir also metcalf eddy,puerto rico aqueduct sewer,cir reaching the same conclusion.
it is undisputed that the camden board of education has a relatively poor tax base and is less financially independent than many of the entities we have previously found not clothed with immunity,such as njt,septa,and rutgers university.nonetheless,given what the record before us discloses with respect to the board varied sources of existing and potential funds,the board has not established that it can not satisfy a judgment with its own monies.christy,at.
additional state funds to compensate for payment of a judgment 
while the parties agree that new jersey is not legally responsible for the board unassumed debts,the board presses us to consider the likely impact of an adverse judgment the board alleges that new jersey would be forced,as a practical matter,to increase its appropriations to refill
