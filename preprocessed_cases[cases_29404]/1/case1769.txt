defendants township of liberty,ohio,its board of trustees,and its zoning inspector collectively the township appeal the district court order enjoining it from applying a set of zoning instructions against a parcel of property owned by plaintiff wedgewood limited partnership i wedgewood.this dispute arose more than six years ago,when wedgewood applied for a zoning certificate to develop a wal mart supercenter wal mart in liberty township wedgewood commerce center.the township residents rallied against the retail giant,hoping to prevent the store construction.their elected board of trustees responded by enacting zoning instructions that adversely affected wedgewood ability to develop a large commercial structure on its property.when wedgewood agreement with wal mart collapsed,it filed this civil rights action pursuant to.
we hold that the township violated wedgewood procedural due process rights when the township adopted zoning instructions that,in effect,amended the wedgewood commerce center planned unit development without providing wedgewood with notice and an opportunity to be heard.accordingly,we affirm the order of the district court granting a permanent injunction.
on november,the liberty township board of trustees trustees legislatively approved the wedgewood commerce center wcc,a planned unit development pud in liberty township,ohio.a pud is a unique creature of zoning because the entire development carries one nominal zoning classification only,but its subdivisions contain many different kinds of approved land use,including,for example,zoning for dwellings,units,schools,recreational facilities,and commercial developments.the zoning restrictions applicable in each pud subdivision are ascertainable only by referring to the approved plats for development.gray trs.of monclova,ohio.
leading up to the november,vote,parameters for the wcc land use were negotiated at length between the trustees and charles ruma associates,one of the applicants seeking approval for pud before voting to approve the wcc,trustee john werner asked whether the wcc development plan,as amended,would be incorporated into a document for the township records.david dye,an attorney for charles ruma associates,responded,yes,it would.
on february,a document was received by,and filed with,the liberty township zoning commission commission entitled wedgewood commerce center development standards.this document contained,among other things,individual development criteria and zoning information for each subdivision,a map labeled wcc land use plan,and addendum a,entitled wedgewood commerce center summary of site data.according to this document hereinafter wcc development plan or wccdp,only subareas,and were zoned for commercial development 
nevertheless,between and,the owners of subareas,and,plats all originally designated for suburban office use only,sought approval for and obtained permits to build commercial structures.according to the township,by late,subareas,and contained approximately square feet of commercial space.
wedgewood owns lot,designated as subarea,a acre plat of land in the wcc and the subject of the parties protracted litigation.according to the wccdp,subarea is zoned for commercial development and is allotted a maximum of square feet of commercial building space.the square footage of subareas,and,when combined,permit a total of square feet of commercial development in the wcc 
at a public trustees meeting in september,a resident of liberty township voiced her concern about rumors that a wal mart or lowe was moving into the wcc,asserting that the development was becoming too commercial.the resident asked trustee werner,can we do anything about it he replied,those hearings were years ago,and the public had their shot then,and basically the wccdp was approved.
the rumors proved to be true.in october,wedgewood submitted an application to the commission requesting an amendment to the wccdp,specifically,six zoning variances to develop a square foot wal mart and fueling station on subarea while its variance application was pending,liberty township residents contacted the commission to express their objection to the proposed wal mart.on october,the commission held a public hearing addressing wedgewood application.after considering statements from several residents,many of whom were opposed to the wal mart,the commission denied wedgewood application for an amendment to the wccdp that would allow subarea commercial development to exceed square feet.
over the next several months,public opposition to the wal mart intensified.to address the public concerns,the trustees held two public meetings on december and.trustee peggy guzzo also coordinated petition drive s gathering a total of signatures from residents.after these meetings,the trustees asked liberty township zoning inspector,defendant holly foust,to produce a report detailing the prior zoning certificates issued by the commission and the combined square footage of all commercial structures located in the wcc.
on january,the trustees issued a public statement and instructions to zoning department regarding future administration of wedgewood commerce center development plan hereinafter instructions.these instructions,which form the crux of wedgewood constitutional claims,state,in relevant part 
on a general basis,we have certainly heard our constituents requests and desires to do what is possible to deter excessive and regional types of commercial development in our community.as a board we,like other residents in our community,are interested in employing our current regulations,and developing and adopting new regulations,to avoid,as possible,and limit,where possible,the burdens that big box types of retail facilities place upon the infrastructure of our community.
extensive review and analysis of the wedgewood commerce center development plan,the minutes of the meetings which led to the approval of that plan,the policies that have been followed to date in administering that plan,and the discernable intent of all of the parties expressed during the conception and the process which led to the approval of the plan,has led us to conclude that the ultimately adopted plan imposed a floating maximum of ft of commercial development in the wedgewood commerce center.we have found evidence of the establishment of this limit in a number of different documents.moreover,we have found no documents or proof through amendment processes which modified this overall square footage cap,as best as we can conclude.the subject of whether or not an acreage cap also applies has been more difficult.
the analysis reveals that the commercial development completed to date,and substantially through the approval process,has consumed most of the commercial square footages sic imposed by the development plan as an overall cap.
under these circumstances,we have determined that,except for a few modest projects which have already completed the major administrative review process,all additional applicants seeking to construct retail or other arguable commercial development in the wedgewood commerce center will be required to seek approval as a major plan of modification.in other words,we are instructing our zoning department to refrain from issuing zoning certificates for any additional commercial development in the wedgewood commerce center,to issue such permits only after an approval through the major process has been completed.each process will be considered to be an application to consume any remaining portion of the square footage limitation,or exceed that limitation,and as a modification to expand the acreage limitation which we believe has been met.
six months later,wedgewood filed its application with the commission for a zoning permit to build a smaller,approximately square foot wal mart and fueling station on subarea.unlike its october application,wedgewood did not seek a variance to permit construction that surpassed subarea square feet of approved commercial space.wedgewood did not submit its application as a major plan of modification,as specified in the newly adopted instructions.
on september,the commission denied wedgewood application for a zoning certificate.in its denial letter,the commission stated that the instructions were made a part of the commission decision by reference and articulated several reasons for denying the permit,including failure to meet the requirements of the currently effective wccdp exceed ing the maximum allowable commercial acreage and square footage limitation that were expressly made a part of the development plan failure to obtain wcc architectural review committee approval and inconsistencies with the governing liberty township zoning resolution.wedgewood appealed the commission denial of its zoning certificate to the liberty township board of zoning appeals bza.this appeal bza i preceded the ongoing proceedings that have paralleled wedgewood federal litigation.
on november,before the bza decided bza i,wedgewood filed the present action pursuant to in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.wedgewood federal complaint alleged,inter alia,that the trustees adoption of the instructions constituted an unauthorized amendment to the wccdp,violating its state and federal due process rights,or,in the alternative,that the wccdp was unconstitutionally vague.several local homeowner associations intervened and joined the township efforts to dismiss wedgewood federal complaint.the application of various abstention doctrines was one of many arguments advanced by the township and interveners.thereafter,the district court granted in part and denied in part the parties.b motions and rejected their arguments for abstention.
subsequently,the parties filed for summary judgment.in september,almost five years after wedgewood first applied to construct the wal mart,the district court granted its motion for summary judgment with respect to its vagueness and procedural due process claims.the district court constitutional rulings were dependant upon its finding that the instructions amended the wccdp without providing wedgewood with advanced notice and a hearing in violation of ohio.the district court order enjoined the township from enforcing the instructions and,in particular,the square foot floating cap hereinafter floating commercial cap against wedgewood property.the township timely appeals.
we have jurisdiction to decide this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a because the district court entered a permanent injunction against the township.as a general rule,our jurisdiction is confined to the issues necessary to determine the propriety of the district court injunction.see gibson guitar paul reed smith guitars,lp,cir chambers ohio dep t of human,cir charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.supp.
because the scope of our jurisdiction is limited by a,we may not reach the township arguments challenging the district court abstention ruling.the district court refusal to abstain is embodied in its order granting in part and denying in part the township motion to dismiss,an order that is not presently before us.see summers leis,cir.in this regard,we reject the township perfunctory argument that the district court abstention ruling is inextricably intertwined with its order granting injunctive relief.see united states phinazee,cir holding that a party forfeits an issue that is adverted to in a perfunctory manner unaccompanied by some effort at developed argument.
in summers,we described the narrow scope of our pendent appellate jurisdiction 
pendent appellate jurisdiction refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over issues that ordinarily may not be reviewed on interlocutory appeal,but,may be reviewed on interlocutory appeal if those issues are inextricably intertwined with matters over which the appellate court properly and independently has jurisdiction.chambers ohio dep t of human,cir.this circuit has interpreted inextricably intertwined to mean that the resolution of the appealable issue necessarily and unavoidably decides the nonappealable issue.
at some internal citations omitted.
the inextricably intertwined requirement of pendent appellate jurisdiction is not meant to be loosely applied as a matter of discretion rather,such jurisdiction only may be exercised when the appealable issue at hand can not be resolved without addressing the nonappealable collateral issue.chambers,at citing archie lanier,cir.moreover,we have previously declined to exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction over a district court abstention ruling when the resolution of that issue require s the application of a separate and distinct legal standard.summers,at.such is the case here.because we are able to resolve the propriety of the district court injunction without reaching its abstention ruling,we decline to review it.see chambers,at.
despite its status as the appellant,the township also argues that the issues raised by this appeal are moot.simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.ford wilder,cir quoting powell mccormack,d.the test for mootness is whether the relief sought would,if granted,make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.ford,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the instructions,as applied to the wccdp,affect the permissible zoning in subarea.specifically,the floating commercial cap provision and the major modification procedure will continue to inhibit wedgewood ability to develop a maximum of square feet of commercial space on its property.thus,contrary to the township position,the evaporation of wal mart offer to purchase subarea does not extinguish wedgewood legally cognizable interest in securing a judgment that enforces its right to develop its property according to the wccdp zoning as it existed before the instructions.
in this regard,our mootness analysis highlights a key distinction between wedgewood federal and state litigation.wedgewood state court proceedings challenge the zoning inspector denial of its application for a zoning certificate to develop a square foot wal mart on subarea.in contrast,wedgewood federal litigation involves its claim that the trustees violated its procedural due process rights by enacting the instructions without notice and a public hearing.although each proceeding requires an interpretation of the wccdp,the harm alleged and the relief sought are distinct.

to establish a procedural due process violation under,wedgewood is required to demonstrate three elements that it had a life,liberty,or property interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment that it was deprived of that protected interest within the meaning of the due process clause and that the state did not afford it adequate procedural rights before depriving it of its protected interest.see med,city of lima,cir 
wedgewood will prevail on its procedural due process claim if it demonstrates that it was deprived of a liberty or property interest as a result of an established state procedure,which itself violates procedural due process rights or establishes that the township deprived it of a liberty or property interest pursuant to a random and unauthorized act and available state remedies would not adequately compensate it for the loss that it suffered.mertik blalock,cir see macene mjw,cir.
because the district court injunction turned on its conclusion that the instructions improperly amended the wccdp,we begin our analysis with this ruling.the parties agree that ohio law governs our interpretation of the wccdp.see,miamisburg wood,ohio app d,relying upon ohio law to interpret an ohio city ordinance.
when interpreting zoning ordinances,or,in this instance,the wccdp,we must presume that the wccdp and instructions mean what they say.carlsbad,hif bio,d stevens,concurring.in addition,our interpretation of the wccdp should serve to illuminate its meaning,rather than to render portions of it meaningless.cardani olsten home healthcare,wl,at ohio.july.
article xiv of the liberty township zoning resolution f states 
any significant changes to an approved development plan in a planned commercial and office district shall be considered an amendment to the zoning map and shall only be made in accordance with article xxvii of this resolution.
article xxvii of the liberty township zoning resolution is a restatement of section of the revised code of ohio,which requires advanced notice and a public hearing before the trustees can adopt an amendment to an existing pud development plan.
the township asserts that the district court erred when it ruled that the instructions constituted an amendment to the wccdp rather than a clarification of its existing restrictions,including the floating commercial cap.it contends that the true amendment occurred on november,when the trustees voted to restrict the wccdp to square feet of office space,square feet of commercial space,and residential units.according to the township,the square foot floating commercial cap is reflected in the following november,amendment to the wccdp 
subarea development criteria 
criteria generally 
commercial.gross square footage of commercial construction shall not exceed five hundred thousand square feet.
the township also claims that the floating commercial cap is memorialized in addendum a of the wccdp 
the township further maintains that the floating commercial cap is recorded in the november,trustees meeting notes,wherein it was mentioned that the wcc would contain square feet of commercial development.
in response,wedgewood concedes that the wccdp reflects a total gross building area of square feet of commercial space.it counters,however,that a floating cap on commercial development was never contemplated by the parties.according to wedgewood,any wcc document that reports a total of square feet of commercial space simply reflects a summary of the wccdp approved commercial land use in subareas,and only.
we agree with wedgewood interpretation of the wccdp.accepting the township position,that addendum a reference to a max.gross area of square feet reflects the parties intent to apply a floating commercial cap to all subdivisions within the wcc would render meaningless the wccdp express designation of subareas,and as the only commercial subareas.put another way,if commercial development were permissible or intended in subareas other than subareas,or,it would have been superfluous to assign a specific land use category to each subarea.in addition,the township interpretation of the wccdp would require us to ignore the strong correlation between addendum a reported square feet of commercial building space and the combined square footage of subareas,and,which totals square feet.
moreover,addendum a density calculation is telling.it divides square feet of gross commercial building space by a total acreage area of acres,the total acreage of subareas,and within of one point,for a total density of square feet of commercial space per acre.thus,addendum a specifically configures its commercial density calculation by dividing the total amount of commercial building space permitted in those subareas with the total acreage of subareas,and.this calculation directly contradicts the township claim that the square feet of approved commercial development within the wcc was not specifically tethered to subareas,and.
we conclude,as the district court did,that the wccdp,as amended,contemplated commercial development in subareas,and only therefore,there was no floating commercial cap in the wccdp before the enactment of the instructions.in this regard,we agree with the district court conclusion that,even though the township and wedgewood turn ed a toward the specific location requirements for commercial development expressed in the wccdp for thirteen years,it does not somehow change the maximum allowable commercial development permitted in subareas,or.
the township enactment of the floating commercial cap provision,as articulated in the instructions,effectively reduced the total square footage of commercial space permitted in subarea.we therefore hold that the instructions constituted a significant change to an approved development plan,thus requiring an amendment to the zoning map.see liberty township zoning resolution f.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not err in ruling that the instructions constituted an amendment to the wccdp that triggered ohio advance notice and public hearing requirements.
next,the township argues that the district court erred in ruling that wedgewood had a protected liberty interest in the amendment procedures discussed above.wedgewood,however,has abandoned the district court analysis and requests that we affirm the district court favorable ruling on its procedural due process claim on the separate ground that it had a property interest in subarea zoning before the trustees enacted the instructions 
property interests,of course,are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.
in determining whether wedgewood established a vested property interest,we must look to substantive state zoning laws.dorr city of ecorse,cir unpublished citing silver franklin twp.bd.of zoning appeals,cir.in silver,we stated that a party obtains a protected property right under the fourteenth amendment when it can demonstrate a legitimate claim of entitlement or a justifiable expectation in the approval of his building plan.silver,at citations and quotation marks omitted.
in ohio,it is that a landowner right to an existing zoning classification vests upon his submission of an application for a building or zoning certificate.gibson oberlin,ohio.however,vesting does not occur unless the 
property owner has complied with all the legislative requirements for the procurement of a building permit and his proposed structure falls within the use classification of the area in which he proposes to build it,if these conditions are met he has a right to such permit,and there is a duty on the part of the officer charged therewith to issue it.
zaremba dev.fairview park,ohio app d,quoting gibson,at 
it is uncontested that wedgewood submitted its application for a zoning certificate on june,after the trustees adopted the instructions.because wedgewood submitted its application,the township argues that wedgewood can not demonstrate a vested property interest in its zoning classification under gibson and zaremba dev.we disagree.
the salient issue before us is whether the zoning commission had the authority under ohio law to take the action that it did.stile copley,d.in stile,a zoning commission eliminated a formerly permitted land use classification in a pud where the plaintiff owned property.id.at.the plaintiff intended to sell a section of his property to an automobile dealership,but the sale collapsed when the parties discovered that the township zoning commission had eliminated the sales zoning classification as a permitted use in the pud.id.
the stile court ruled that the plaintiff had demonstrated a protected property interest in the sales zoning classification because 
the change made by action of the township zoning commission was in the nature of a zoning amendment and the action was beyond the scope of the zoning commission authority,since the legislative action of amending a zoning classification can only be taken by the township board of trustees after following the notice and hearing procedures set forth in ohio.
stile,d at footnote omitted.like the township here,the township in stile asserted that the plaintiff did not have a vested property interest in the existing zoning classification under zaremba dev.id.at.the district court characterized the township argument as a red herring,noting that the proper issue was whether the zoning commission had the authority to eliminate the zoning classification without complying with notice and hearing requirements.id.the district court concluded that the zoning commission actions were improper and granted the plaintiff request for injunctive relief.id.at.
in supervalu holdings,jackson ctr,lp,nos,wl,at ohio.july,the ohio court of appeals acknowledged the property right discussed in stile 
in stile,a township zoning commission eliminated a permitted use in a planned development district where the plaintiff owned property.id.at.the plaintiff had intended to sell part of his property to an automobile dealership,but such a sale was not feasible following the elimination of sales as a permitted use.id.in stile,state action affected the plaintiff property rights by restricting how the plaintiff could use his property.
id.at.although supervalu holdings,does not expressly adopt stile holding,it acknowledged that a protectable property interest can arise under ohio law when a government entity restricts a landowner ability to use his property.id.the facts in stiles are similar to the facts in this case.
for these reasons,we conclude the ohio courts would hold that,consistent with roth,silver,stile,and supervalu holdings,wedgewood had a justifiable expectation that its zoning classification its right to develop up to square feet of commercial space on subarea was vested unless or until the commission and trustees passed an amendment to the wccdp comporting with the notice and hearing requirements set forth in ohio.see silver,at quoting roth,at,and olim,at.dorr.at.specifically,articles xiv f and xxvii of the liberty township zoning resolution,ohio,and the wccdp itself,provided the rules and understandings under ohio law that secure d its claim of entitlement to its zoning classification.see roth,at.similar to the plaintiffs in stile,wedgewood possessed a protected property interest in subarea zoning,notwithstanding the trustees ultra vires amendment.see generally,cole twp.of clinton,wl,at ohio,unpublished.
finally,we must analyze whether the township enactment of the instructions without providing notice and a hearing deprived wedgewood of a protected property interest within the meaning of the due process clause.in this regard,it is that violations of state law do not automatically translate into a deprivation of procedural due process under the united states constitution.depiero city of macedonia,cir.the supreme court has described the root requirement of the due process clause as notice and an opportunity to be heard before one is deprived of a significant property interest.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.
in nasierowski.inv.city of sterling heights,cir,a claimed that the city counsel violated his procedural due process rights by enacting a zoning amendment designed to prevent him from proceeding with his proposed commercial development.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and denied the landowner request for an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the new zoning ordinance against his property.id.at.we reversed,holding that the landowner was not provided with notice of a proposed change in the zoning ordinance,a change that would exert a severely detrimental impact on his ability to use the property in a manner consistent with his legitimate expectations expectations that the city,itself,had encouraged.nasierowski.inv,at.we held 
governmental determinations of a general nature that affect all equally do not give rise to a constitutional due process right to be heard.but,when a relatively small number of persons are affected on individual grounds,the right to a hearing is triggered.falling into that latter category is the situation where,during the zoning amendment process,a governmental unit singles out and specifically targets an individual property for a zoning change 
thus,in these circumstances the had a right to notice and hearing prior to the council vote on the proposed amendment.the city failure to afford the an opportunity to be heard constituted a denial of procedural due process.
nasierowski.inv,at footnote omitted.
we find the reasoning of nasierowski.inv.persuasive.here,there is ample evidence in the record to support the district court conclusion that the instructions were not general in nature,but rather targeted or wedgewood ability to construct a wal mart on its property.nasierowski.inv,at.thus,to satisfy the due process clause,the township was required to apprise wedgewood of the pendency of the instructions and provide adequate notice and an opportunity to present their objections.depiero,at.the township failed to do so.
accordingly,we hold that the instructions,which purported to clarify the wccdp,unlawfully amended it without affording wedgewood adequate notice and a hearing in violation of the due process clause and ohio.
we also conclude that the trustees enactment of the instructions constituted an established state procedure that itself violated wedgewood procedural due process rights.an established state procedure is defined as the mechanism that effects a deprivation or contributes to cause a deprivation.vinson campbell county fiscal court,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in zinermon burch,d,the supreme court stated that a government act constitutes an established state procedure when officials with the authority to supply a hearing fail to provide one even though they should have foreseen the need to provide such procedural protections.see also harris city of akron,cir erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed.here,the commission and board of trustees are the government entities that should have foreseen,and could have provided,the exact procedural protection that wedgewood claims it was denied.
