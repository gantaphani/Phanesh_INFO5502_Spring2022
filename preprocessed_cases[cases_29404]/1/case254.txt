this case under the fair labor standards act flsa raises an issue about whether a city or town must give notice to its public safety officers as a matter of federal law before the municipality takes advantage of a special statutory exemption for these officers from usual overtime requirements,k.we hold no such notice is required.
plaintiffs are police officers of the town of framingham who brought a putative class action suit against the town in april,alleging that the town had failed to pay them sufficient overtime in violation of the flsa,and seeking damages.anticipating the town defense,the officers sought a declaratory judgment that the town was ineligible for the flsa limited public safety exemption from overtime,k.that exemption eases the flsa overtime pay requirements on public employers who establish work schedules that meet statutory requirements.
the district court granted partial summary judgment,holding the town met the eligibility requirements for the public safety exemption.calvao town of framingham,wl,at.july.the parties have since stipulated to judgment on the remaining issues.
we affirm the district court and reject plaintiffs argument that the town was required to notify affected employees before establishing a valid work period under k.the text of the statute and the department of labor interpretive guidance,as well as our caselaw,confirm that a public employer need only establish a k compliant work period to claim the exemption benefits without explicitly giving notice to the affected employees.the town has done so and is entitled to judgment.we also reject plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion by denying their motion to strike certain evidence.
legal background the flsa public safety exemption,k 
the history and scope of the flsa public safety exemption set the background.congress enacted the flsa in to establish nationwide minimum wage and maximum hours standards.moreau klevenhagen,ellen kearns et,the fair labor standards act.iii,at.later amendments in and extended the act reach to state and municipal employers.see moreau,at.despite congressional efforts to mitigate the effect of these amendments on municipal coffers,kearns et,supra,at,the amendments triggered protracted litigation,as state and local public employers mounted constitutional challenges to the flsa regulation of compensation schemes.see moreau,at collecting cases.in part,the employers were successful.see league of cities usery,invalidating amendments to the flsa to the extent that they impermissibly interfere d with the integral governmental functions of states and municipalities.
in february,the supreme court upheld congress power under the flsa to regulate the payments due to state and local employees.see garcia san antonio metro.transit.state and municipal authorities reacted with grave concern to the decision,due in part to t he projected financial costs of coming into compliance with the the overtime provisions.moreau,at quoting,at.
in response,both the house and senate held hearings on the issue and considered legislation designed to ameliorate the burdens associated with necessary changes in public employment practice.id.congress ultimately enacted several provisions designed to allay public employers fears and contain costs.see,id.congress also delayed enforcement of the flsa against state and local employers until april,to give them time to comply with the act amended requirements.see fair labor standards amendments of,c,stat.
section k was originally passed in.the provision created a partial flsa exemption for law enforcement and fire protection personnel public safety personnel.see k.when garcia held the flsa applied to municipal employees,k became very important to municipalities.see martin coventry fire,cir.
under the flsa,employees other than public safety personnel are generally entitled to payment at a rate not less than one and times their regular wages for any time worked in excess of forty hours in a seven day period.a.however,the partial exemption in k set a higher threshold number of hours that public safety personnel can work in a day work a proportional number of hours in a shorter work period of at least seven these employees become entitled to overtime compensation.see id.k 
in k,congress set the maximum number of hours it gave the secretary of labor authority to promulgate regulations establishing a lower ceiling.id.k b see also town of agawam,cir.the secretary did so in,setting a limit for law enforcement personnel of hours over a period,or the proportional equivalent over a shorter span of time.see.for a work period,this ratio works out to approximately hours,or about hours every seven days.id.c.
section k eases the burden of the flsa overtime provisions on state and local employers two ways.the partial exemption provides for higher hourly standards before requiring the payment of overtime further,it permits overtime hours to be computed over a workweek that may be longer than a workweek and that the employer selects.as we explained in agawam 
section k raises the average number of hours the employer can require law enforcement and fire protection personnel to work without triggering the overtime requirement,and it accommodates the inherently unpredictable nature of firefighting and police work by permitting public employers to adopt work periods longer than one week.the longer the work period,the more likely it is that days of calm will offset the inevitable emergencies,resulting in decreased overtime liability.
at internal citations omitted see also garcia,at citing k limited public safety exemption as an illustration of congress attention to the special concerns of states and localities avery city of talladega,cir the work period concept was intended to ease the overtime burdens of certain public employers.citing,martin,at.
before a public employer may qualify for the limited public safety exemption,two things must be true the employees at issue must be engaged in fire protection or law enforcement within the meaning of the statute and the employer must have established a qualifying work period.see agawam,at.in turn,the qualifying work period must be at least seven but not more than consecutive days.a.overtime need not be paid unless the number of hours worked exceeds ratios,different for police than for fire employees that are set forth in department of labor regulations.there are other requirements that are not germane here.
assuming these conditions are satisfied,the employer can simply start paying its employees under k.agawam,at.further,the employer may opt to pay its employees more than k mandates without forfeiting the benefits of the exemption.id.at milner hazelwood,cir per curiam.public employers bear the burden of proving they met k requirements by clear and affirmative evidence.agawam,at kearns et,supra,at.
factual background 
plaintiffs do not dispute the district court description of the town actions and agree that the officers were law enforcement personnel within the meaning of the statute.however,they argue that the court erred by concluding that the town a qualifying work period under k,without explicitly notifying affected employees it was doing so.we briefly review the relevant facts.
in september,after garcia was decided,the town personnel board prepared a memorandum that expressed extreme concern at the application of the flsa wage and hour requirements to municipal employers and sought guidance from the town counsel.over the ensuing months,the massachusetts municipal association and the national league of cities gave the town information about the flsa impact on local employers.in march,the town director of personnel prepared a memo to all department heads,appropriate boards and commissions.that memo provided information on employees exempt from the flsa coverage and noted that determination of who is exempt must be made prior to april,the effective date for coverage under the act.
on april,the town executive administrator circulated a memo to the police chief,fire chief,personnel director,and town counsel.the memo was addressed to the publicly available personnel file maint
