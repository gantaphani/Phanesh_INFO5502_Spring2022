background 
factual background 
petitioner lives outside memphis,tennessee,where he has been an automobile salesman for about twenty years.although his primary job is selling cars,he has a passion for flying airplanes.to fund his interest in flying,kratt has frequently chartered or leased airplanes and flown people for hire to both business and pleasure destinations.in april,kratt began to fly business trips for andre johnson,one of his automobile customers.only later did kratt learn that andre johnson was transporting marijuana from texas to memphis.kratt first flew johnson and his brother to mcallen,texas,a town near the mexican border.kratt believed that johnson owned a cleaning business of some kind and did not think to question his reasons for traveling to texas.
later,kratt flew johnson brother to harlingen,texas,and flew a third trip with johnson brother and cousin to brownsville,texas.on the third trip,the brother took a bus home and,during the flight home with the cousin,kratt thought he smelled marijuana in his plane.kratt asked the cousin about the odor,who informed him that they had been transporting marijuana on all three trips.kratt became angry and landed his plan in texarkana,where he put johnson cousin and his bags out of the plane.kratt did not receive payment for the third trip.
although kratt planned never to fly again for johnson,he ultimately gave in when johnson repeatedly telephoned him and threatened to injure kratt children.during the fourth trip to texas,johnson cousin allegedly kept kratt at gunpoint during the entire trip.on the trip home,kratt first landed his plane at an airport in mississippi where customs officials were waiting for him.johnson cousin ordered kratt to take off again immediately after they landed.kratt flew the plane to another airport nearby,where they abandoned the plane.later that night,kratt called an attorney,who assisted him in surrendering to customs officers.
kratt eventually agreed to plead guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and to testify against johnson and the other men involved with the drug operation that kratt had been facilitating.kratt was unaware that he could lose his pilot license by pleading guilty and feared that if he did not plead guilty,he would face greater harm to his life and career.
on august,kratt entered his plea of guilty before the united states district court for the northern district of mississippi to the charge of possessing with intent to distribute approximately pounds of marijuana.at kratt plea hearing,the united states presented the following factual basis for kratt plea 
the government would show that on or about may the,frederick john kratt piloted a plane,to wit a cessna skylane aircraft,from south texas to the olive branch,mississippi airport,briefly stopping before continuing onto the holly springs airport in marshall county,mississippi.upon arriving at the holly springs airport,the defendant and a passenger abandoned the airplane and attempted to escape.
the government would show that the defendant aircraft was being surveilled from south texas to the holly springs airport by a chase plane operated by the custom s service agents utilizing a forward looking infrared tracking system known as fleer.when the defendant plane initially arrived at the olive branch,mississippi airport,custom s agents on the ground attempted to block the runway,but were unsuccessful,and the defendant plane took off headed for the holly springs airport where the plane was abandoned after landing.
the government would show through testimony and documentary evidence that approximately pounds of marijuana was seized from the area immediately surrounding the airplane along with the flight log and flight bag and other documentation linking the defendant to the abandoned airplane.
the government would further show that the surveilling agents witnessed the removal of the marijuana from the airplane by one of its occupants prior to being abandoned.
the government would show further that shortly thereafter the defendant contacted the custom s service and surrender ed to authorities.the government would show that the defendant thereafter fully cooperated with the customs service admitting his involvement and the involvement of others in the possession with intent to distribute marijuana recovered from the defendant plane.
after the united states presented this factual basis for its charges against kratt,the court asked him,is the factual basis essentially correct,kratt kratt responded,yes,sir.
procedural history 
the federal aviation administration faa sent kratt a letter on june,informing him that he was under investigation because he had pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.kratt accepted the opportunity to respond to the faa letter,and wrote a handwritten response in which he explained the circumstances surrounding his conviction.although he argued that he was not a willing participant in the crime,he noted that he felt responsible for at least some of the crime.the faa sent kratt a notice of proposed certificate action on august,notifying kratt that it intended to revoke his pilot certificate because he had been convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and had used an aircraft and served as an airman in connection with the offense.the faa issued its order of revocation on april,but only after kratt had a telephone conference with the faa in february.kratt chose to appeal the faa decision to the ntsb,and the faa filed its complaint,consisting of a copy of its order of revocation,before the ntsb on may.the faa complaint stated that kratt pilot license was revoked pursuant to a,b,and b.
on august,an administrative law judge alj granted the administrator partial summary judgment affirming her revocation of kratt pilot license pursuant to a.that provision permits the revocation of a pilot license if the pilot is convicted of certain offenses.see a.but the alj denied the administrator summary judgment regarding revocation of kratt license pursuant to b.the alj determined that summary judgment was not appropriate because revocation pursuant to b requires the administrator to establish that kratt was not only convicted of a offense,but also that an aircraft was used in commission of the offense and that kratt served as an airman or was on the aircraft in commission of the offense.see b a,b west.
on november,the alj held a hearing on the record to consider evidence regarding the revocation of kratt pilot license pursuant to b.the alj ultimately found that the transcript of kratt plea hearing conclusively established that the requirements of b were satisfied.nevertheless,the alj heard testimony from kratt concerning his conviction.kratt appealed the decision of the alj to the full ntsb,which affirmed the alj ruling.finally,the ntsb denied kratt request for reconsideration.
kratt now petitions this court for review of the ntsb decision.

iii.discussion 
evidence to support revocation 
kratt argues that the administrator relied on insufficient evidence when she revoked his pilot license pursuant to b.he maintains that his criminal conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was insufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements of b for revocation of his pilot license.the administrator contends that kratt guilty plea provided sufficient evidence for revocation pursuant to b and that the administrator and the ntsb in fact relied on more than just kratt conviction.
the administrator is required to revoke an individual airman certificate if that individual 
is convicted,under a law of the united states or a state related to a controlled substance except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance,of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the administrator finds that 
a an aircraft was used to commit,or facilitate the commission of,the offense and 
b the individual served as an airman,or was on the aircraft,in connection with committing,or facilitating the commission of,the offense.
b.the term airman is defined to include a pilot,mechanic,or member of the crew,who navigates aircraft when under way.a a.therefore,this court can overturn the ntsb decision only if that decision was based on less than substantial evidence that kratt was convicted of the specified type of crime,that an aircraft was used in the commission of the offense,and that kratt either served as an airman or was on the aircraft in connection with committing the offense.
kratt does not dispute that he was convicted of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year.he was convicted pursuant to,and sentenced to two years in prison.kratt argues that the ntsb erred by relying solely on his conviction for evidence that an airplane was used in commission of his offense and that he served as an airman or was on the aircraft in commission of the offense.in fact,the ntsb relied not only on kratt conviction,but also on the transcript of kratt plea hearing and his testimony before the alj.
when the administrator moved for summary judgment before the ntsb,the alj decided that kratt conviction alone was insufficient evidence to prove that an aircraft was used in commission of the offense and that kratt served as an airman or was on the aircraft in connection with the offense.later,when presented with the transcript from kratt plea hearing,the alj decided that the transcript provided sufficient evidence that kratt served as an airman in commission of the offense to which he pled guilty.
the facts that the united states presented established that kratt had served as the pilot of a plane carrying pounds of marijuana.when the judge at the plea hearing asked kratt whether the factual basis presented by the government was essentially correct,kratt responded,yes,sir.the alj rejected kratt argument that he only meant that the facts presented by the united states were the facts that the government intended to prove,not that those were the actual facts.the alj found that the question asked by the court at kratt plea hearing was clear and unequivocal and does not reasonably permit the construction urged by kratt now.
therefore,we find that the alj relied on sufficient evidence to uphold the administrator determination that kratt served as an airman in commission of the offense to which he pled guilty.contrary to kratt contention,the alj relied not just on kratt conviction,but also considered the evidence in the transcript from kratt guilty plea hearing.
furthermore,although the alj determined that the testimony from kratt plea hearing was sufficient evidence to support revocation of kratt pilot license,the alj nevertheless heard testimony from kratt regarding his conviction.kratt admits that he piloted the aircraft in which the marijuana was transported,and admits in his answer filed before the ntsb that he served as the pilot in commission of the offense,but he denies that he was a willing participant.
kratt also argues that the term served as an airman connotes that the individual knowingly and willingly used an airplane in the commission of a crime.pet r br.at.section b,however,contains no such requirement.rather,the statute states that the administrator must find that the individual served as an airman,or was on the aircraft,in connection with committing,or facilitating the commission of,the offense.b b.there is no requirement,therefore,that one knowingly and willingly serve as an airman prior to revocation of the individual pilot license.nor is there a requirement that one serve as an airman at all.rather,one need only be on the aircraft.despite what kratt claims about his willingness to pilot his airplane,he does not deny that he was on the aircraft during commission of the offense to which he pled guilty.
to the extent that the statute requires that an individual act knowingly or willingly prior to having his pilot license revoked,that requirement is embedded in the requirement that the individual be convicted of a offense.indeed,the crime to which kratt pled guilty includes the requirement that he acted knowingly or intentionally.a west.during kratt guilty plea hearing,the judge informed kratt of these elements of the crime,and kratt chose to plead guilty.
although kratt argues that he flew andre johnson and his companions only under duress,the alj noted that the administrator can not question the validity of kratt guilty plea when deciding whether to revoke his pilot license.the revocation statute expressly states that the administrator has no authority to review whether an airman violated a law of the united states or a state related to a controlled substance.b see also rawlins ntsb,cir congress obviously determined that a harsh penalty was the only advisable response to drug trafficking violations by pilots.additionally,ntsb precedent establishes that it may not entertain a collateral attack on kratt conviction.see hinson manning,ntsb order no,docket no,ntsb lexis,may,hinson gilliland,ntsb order no,docket no,ntsb lexis.kratt belated defense of duress is one that he could have raised in his criminal proceeding in lieu of a guilty plea,but it is too late to do so now.
finally,kratt argues that the administrator interpretation of the revocation statute is too broad because it would require revocation of a commercial pilot license if the pilot flew a plane on which a passenger was carrying illegal drugs.this is not true,h
