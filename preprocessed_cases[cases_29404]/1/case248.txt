jin weng,a native and citizen of china,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an immigration judge ij decision denying her petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.the ij and bia rejected weng claim that she has faced and will likely face religious persecution in china as an adherent of zun wang,a banned religion in china.the ij found weng was not credible because her testimony was inconsistent with her earlier sworn testimony,determining particularly that,in her earlier statements,she did not mention religion but said she was fleeing china and feared returning there because of poverty and other nonreligious reasons.
the ij did not explicitly separate his findings on the asylum claims about past persecution and likely future persecution.but we and the bia have inferred from his reasoning that he found that weng was not credible about the past persecution she claimed to have suffered in china or her alleged fear of future persecution in china,and that she was not credible in her assertion that she left china and fears returning because of religious persecution.although the ij discussed some but not all of the documentary evidence weng introduced to support her claim of past religious persecution,the remaining evidence would not compel a factfinder to conclude that weng had suffered past religious persecution or feared future persecution or that she was credible about her reasons for leaving china.we deny the petition for review.
weng entered the united states from mexico at calexico,california,on july.at the border,department of homeland security dhs officials found her in the trunk of a car and detained her.an immigration officer then interviewed weng under oath through a mandarin translator.weng was informed in her own language that she needed to tell the truth and,especially,to tell the officer if she feared leaving the united states and returning home.the officer assured weng she could speak privately and confidentially to another officer about her fear or concern.
weng acknowledged that she understood her rights.she told the officer that the reasons she had come to the united states and feared returning to china were that she and her family were poor and she needed work.she said she feared she might be harmed in china,but she could not name anyone who would harm her.when asked whether she had anything else to say,weng replied no.
later that day,an asylum officer conducted a interview with weng,again through a mandarin interpreter and again under oath.at the outset,weng signed a page that detailed her rights.it read,in part,
please feel comfortable telling me why you fear harm.law has strict rules to prevent the disclosure of what you tell me today about the reason why you fear harm.the information you tell me about the reasons for your fear will not be disclosed to your government,except in exceptional circumstances.the statements you make today may be used in deciding your claim and in any future immigration proceedings.
this recitation was translated for her at the time.
after this urging to be truthful and this warning that what she said would be used to decide her claim,weng gave the asylum officer several reasons she was entering the united states,none of which involved religious persecution.she said that her family did not want her and had sent her to live with others so her parents could try to have a boy.she again said her family was poor and that she would have a hard time finding a job in china because of her social status.weng said she had heard that america is a country of human rights,and she believed the american government treated its people better than the chinese government.she also noted that she opposed the chinese government policy.
weng only identified one specific reason why she might be harmed in china.she reported that her mother had obtained a loan to pay for her to leave china and the lenders might harm her mother if the loan were not repaid.weng also indicated that she had never been arrested.
on july,dhs issued weng a notice to appear.weng conceded removability and admitted the notice factual allegations.weng filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat on december.in her application,weng claimed,for the first time,that she was fleeing religious persecution in china for practicing zun wang,a banned religion in china.
after several changes in venue due to weng moving,weng appeared for her hearing before an immigration judge in boston,massachusetts,on may.in her affidavit and oral testimony,weng claimed that she was raised by an aunt who practiced zun wang and brought weng to ceremonies.weng testified that she formally joined the religion at sixteen years old and attended services regularly.she said that the government warned zun wang followers to stop practicing their religion in november.that same month,her parents allegedly received a notice from village officials warning weng to stop practicing zun wang.
weng testified that she was arrested on november,after five uniformed police officers broke down the door to a zun wang prayer meeting.weng said that officers interrogated her for thirty minutes,slapped her,and made her sign a statement without letting her read it.she testified she was held for two days over a weekend,during which she was given inadequate food and kept in a cold cell containing only a light blanket.her family bailed weng out for yuan on sunday,november.
weng claimed that she continued practicing zun wang,even though officers told her to stop or face jail.she testified that her family helped her come to the united states after she escaped a second arrest attempt in may.weng mentioned none of this in her earlier interviews with dhs officers.
weng submitted several documents supporting her religious persecution claim on may.at the beginning of her hearing on may,the ij marked and admitted the documents as group exhibit.these exhibits included state department country reports from and that detailed how china has mistreated practitioners of minority religions.weng offered letters from her sister and uncle,apparently prepared in,that described weng alleged citation and warning her sister attached pictures of zun wang ritual objects she was hiding in her own home.weng also provided,for the first time,a translated copy of a village notice,dated november,accusing her of refusing to stop practicing zun wang.it ordered her to appear for investigation and reeducation or face severe penalties.finally,she submitted in a translated copy of a bail receipt for yuan,dated november,charging her with d isturbing social order promoting superstition.
on cross examination weng admitted that,contrary to her current testimony,she had earlier told immigration officers that she had never been arrested and she had left china because she was poor nor did she mention religion or say she left because of religion.despite her prior statements that her family was poor,weng also conceded that her family runs a seafood business and is in a pretty good financial position for their area.weng explained that she had not mentioned religious persecution or her arrest when she was first interviewed because she was afraid the chinese government would learn about her statements.she claimed she only felt safe to report the persecution after speaking with a lawyer.she did not explain her inconsistent statements about her family financial situation.
after the evidence,the ij suspended the hearing,saying he wished to consider the evidence.that same day he delivered an oral opinion finding weng removable and denying her petition.he began by correctly observing that weng had to prove she had suffered past persecution or had a fear of future persecution because of,inter alia,religion.he added,also correctly,that proof of past persecution created a presumption that a petitioner has a fear of future persecution.then,the ij stated that the country reports and weng testimony certainly would have established a fear of persecution based on her religious beliefs,if indeed,she were a credible witness.he d
