this appeal requires us to determine whether a sitting governor is entitled to qualified immunity for allegedly threatening a political rival and prominent businessman during a press conference concerning a bond issue before west virginia voters.because we find that the facts as alleged establish that the governor threatened imminent adverse regulatory action and that a reasonable public official in his position would know that such a threat is unlawful,we hold that the governor is not entitled to immunity from this suit at the stage.accordingly,we affirm the ruling of the district court.
this case arises from the controversy surrounding a proposed bond amendment to the west virginia constitution,supported by governor joe manchin iii manchin or the governor or appellant and opposed by don blankenship blankenship or appellee.because this case is on appeal at the stage,the facts are presented largely from appellee complaint,with inferences drawn in his favor.see ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir.
blankenship is the president of massey energy,one of the largest coal companies in the nation and the largest in west virginia.in addition to his corporate employment,blankenship is an active participant in west virginia politics.in,blankenship campaigned against the reelection of west virginia supreme court chief justice warren mcgraw.in early,blankenship publicly opposed legislation proposed by manchin that would have increased the coal severance tax and funded workers compensation benefit plans.
in february,the west virginia legislature passed a bond amendment to the state constitution.if approved by voters,the amendment would have permitted the sale of over five billion dollars worth of state bonds to fund underfunded pension and disability plans for teachers,judges,and other public employees.the amendment was placed before the voters in a special election on june.blankenship opposed the amendment and began to publicize his opposition through interviews and the financing of television,radio,and advertising.the governor publicly campaigned in support of the amendment,including,according to the complaint,running negative advertisements portraying blankenship as an outsider and using staff to ask the west virginia secretary of state about blankenship residence.
on june,the governor appeared at an american electric power plant in putnam county,west virginia,in part to promote the bond amendment.after his speech,the governor took media questions.blankenship alleges that some of the governor answers threatened blankenship by warning that the government would scrutinize the affairs of blankenship and massey even more closely in light of blankenship decision to participate in the public debate over the pension bond amendment.compl.the governor is quoted as remarking,i think that additional scrutiny is justified now,since blankenship has jumped in there the bond debate with his personal wealth trying to direct public policy.compl.quoting ken ward,manchin still sparring over pension bond bid,charleston gazette,june,at.
the following day,the governor remarks were reported in the charleston gazette the article the gazette article,headlined manchin still sparring over pension bond bid,reported,in relevant part 
joe manchin continued friday to spar with massey energy president don blankenship over the governor pension bond proposal.the governor said blankenship,who has launched a personal campaign against the bond plan,should expect tougher scrutiny of his business affairs.
i think that is justified now,since don has jumped in there with his personal wealth trying to direct public policy,manchin said.
after his brief speech manchin was quizzed repeatedly by reporters about his pension bond battle with blankenship.
in a later interview,manchin declined to say if he thought blankenship was a good corporate citizen.
i not going to sit here and try to rag on anyone,manchin said.
i truly appreciate and value every business person who creates jobs in our state,the governor said.but i want don to use his creative energies in a good,positive manner.
manchin said he was puzzled that blankenship would not agree to serve on a pension bond advisory committee before launching his campaign against the governor proposal.
the most frustrating thing going on is that there a person who has been very successful financially in the business world,and when someone asked him to be a part of a positive movement in west virginia,he said,no.
when asked,manchin said that blankenship campaign against the pension bonds should and will prompt even more scrutiny of blankenship,who is arguably already the state coal executive.
if you want to throw yourself into public policy,your record is open,the governor said.
manchin declined to personally offer any specific criticisms of the way massey or blankenship has operated,except to note that the company has had numerous with state environmental regulators.
i think there have been many violations that hopefully they been able to correct,the governor said.
ward,supra.on june,voters rejected the bond amendment.
blankenship alleges that in retaliation for his campaign against the amendment,manchin used state government resources to reinforce his threat against blankenship and massey.compl.on june,the west virginia department of environmental protection dep approved a massey permit application to build a coal silo in raleigh county,west virginia.despite the approval,manchin allegedly ordered members of his staff to meet with dep and other regulatory officials to investigate possible safety concerns with regard to the silo site.blankenship maintains that the governor ignored these safety concerns when other groups raised them previously and initiated the investigation not out of concern for the safety of residents,but instead,in retaliation for blankenship campaign against the bond amendment.compl.
on july,blankenship commenced this action against manchin,in his official and individual capacities,alleging that manchin violated by unconstitutionally retaliating against blankenship.the complaint sought declaratory,injunctive,and compensatory relief,as well as attorneys fees pursuant to.in response,manchin filed a motion to dismiss,alleging that blankenship complaint fails to state a claim of retaliatory action in violation of the constitution that blankenship lacks standing to assert the claim that the claims are barred by qualified immunity that monetary damages based in manchin official capacity are barred by the eleventh amendment and that injunctive relief is inappropriate on january,the district court denied the motion in all respects,except for dismissing the compensatory damages claim against manchin in his official capacity.
rejecting manchin qualified immunity argument,the district court began by noting that first amendment retaliation claims are governed by this court decision in suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir,where we elucidated a test for evaluating first amendment retaliation claims against a public official.the district court characterized the relationship between manchin and blankenship as best exhibited by the fact that the industry in which the appellee finds himself is also one over which the state exercises robust oversight powers.blankenship manchin,d.
the district court then concluded that the complaint adequately alleged threats suggesting imminent adverse regulatory action because of manchin remarks that blankenship justifiably should expect tougher scrutiny of his business affairs.in addition,the district court noted that discovery would reveal whether manchin actions in ordering his staff to meet with dep officials was an accompanying act of retaliation against appellee.taking these factors together,the district court held that the alleged threats and retaliatory conduct would deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising her first amendment rights.
further,relying on this court decisions in trulock freeh,cir,and suarez,the district court held that a reasonable governor would have known that manchin alleged actions violated clearly established law.finding a constitutional violation of a clearly established right,the district court denied the application of qualified immunity.this appeal followed.
this court has appellate jurisdiction to consider the district court denial of qualified immunity to the extent that the appellant maintains that his conduct did not violate clearly established law.winfield bass,cir en banc.we review a district court denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity de novo,accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.ridpath,at jenkins medford,cir en banc.
the inquiry into whether a defendant can assert qualified immunity proceeds in two steps.first,the court must determine if the pleaded facts demonstrate that the defendant conduct violated a constitutional right.ridpath,at.if the facts do not establish the violation of a right,qualified immunity will apply,and the motion to dismiss on that basis should be granted.if a violation is established,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.saucier katz,d.
we first turn to the issue of whether blankenship has properly alleged a constitutional violation.this court set forth the standard for pleading a first amendment retaliation claim in suarez.at.first,the plaintiff must demonstrate that his speech is protected.id.next,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant alleged retaliatory conduct adversely affected the plaintiff constitutionally protected speech.id.finally,the plaintiff must show a causal relationship between its speech and the defendant retaliatory action.id.
in this case,the first and third elements are not in dispute rather,because the alleged retaliation is in the nature of speech we must first determine whether manchin remarks were threatening,coercive,or intimidating so as to intimate that punishment,sanction,or adverse regulatory action will imminently follow.id.at.given the procedural posture of this case,in order for us to conclude that manchin did not violate blankenship rights,we must conclude that blankenship could prove no set of facts to support his claim that manchin threatened imminent adverse regulatory action under suarez.see ridpath,at.the available evidence,including the account of the governor remarks in the gazette article,does not allow us to reach such a conclusion.
to begin,we note that the gazette article is only one account of manchin remarks on june.thus,even if manchin quoted remarks did not amount to a threat of imminent adverse regulatory action,blankenship could still prove that manchin made threats at the press conference that went unquoted in the gazette article and avoid dismissal at the b stage.because we find that manchin quoted remarks in the gazette article did threaten imminent adverse regulatory action,we need not analyze blankenship allegations without the aide of the gazette article.
appellant urges this court to consider the full context of the governor remarks,especially the placement of the article at page of the newspaper,in determining whether the remarks threatened imminent adverse regulatory action under suarez.while we must examine the full context of the newspaper article in which appellant statements appeared,we read the statements in the light most favorable to appellee and draw any reasonable inferences in his favor.see ridpath,at.we must accept the allegations in the complaint regarding the implication of manchin statements,unless they represent unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments,shore,assocs,cir,or contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit,veney wyche,cir.we follow this approach not because we read the gazette article with a cynical eye,as the appellant alleges,but because this approach is proper under rule b.
we can not draw the inference from the placement of the article in the gazette that the governor remarks were not threats.to begin,this case is not one for defamation,where the newspaper article itself represents the alleged tort.thus,although the article is helpful insofar as it provides one account of manchin remarks,which we may consider in determining whether those remarks satisfy suarez,it is not the sole focus of our inquiry,as noted above.second,while we may take judicial notice of the general proposition that newspapers tend to place important stories on their front pages,there is no evidence in the record indicating why the gazette article was placed at page.such a matter is one that can be inquired into during discovery,but is not proper at this stage of the proceedings,especially because it would require us to draw an inference against the appellee,contrary to our standard of review.
appellant explanation for his remarks is that they were a prediction and an opinion that blankenship public involvement in the bond amendment election would invite increased scrutiny from the media and the public.this explanation fails.it is a reasonable reading of manchin remarks to view them as a threat of imminent adverse regulatory action against massey,rather than a prediction about how the media and the public would view blankenship affairs.for example,at the time of the governor alleged remarks,blankenship was not a political novice,having spent upwards of two million dollars to defeat a state supreme court justice in and having fought a campaign against manchin worker compensation reform legislation.because blankenship was a veteran of west virginia politics and had already participated in two contentious campaigns,it is unreasonable to conclude that the only reading of manchin remarks is that they were a warning to blankenship that his opposition of the bond referendum would result in increased scrutiny by the public and the media.
furthermore,the actual regulatory scrutiny that massey experienced shortly after the article appeared strongly supports interpreting manchin remarks as a threat of increased regulatory scrutiny.that manchin activated the punitive machinery of the government against massey supports our reading the governor remarks as threats,rather than predictions.garcia city of trenton,cir.
unlike a statement of opinion,the governor remarks went beyond reflecting his own views and intent.the balt.sun ehrlich,cir.the tougher scrutiny of his business affairs that manchin said blankenship should expect and that would be justified,intimated that massey would receive more scrutiny from state regulators than other,similarly situated companies.given the expertise of agencies in the fields they regulate,a presumption of regularity attaches to administrative actions.cent.power,se.power,cir accord preston memorial hosp.palmer,we proceed to determine whether the lower court abused its discretion in reaching a decision which sets aside the presumption of regularity generally accorded an administrative agency decision by a reviewing court.tougher scrutiny by agencies whose actions are afforded a presumption of regularity is adverse regulatory action,because it implies harsher,or at least disparate,treatment of massey as a direct result of blankenship political speech.garcia,at mayor whitaker told garcia that the parking time limit would be enforced against her,and that he was taking this action because of her complaints about the bicycling ordinance.
because massey is an industry leader in a heavily regulated industry,we can draw an inference in favor of the appellee that massey is subject to regulatory oversight,and any additional scrutiny could be applied immediately.indeed,the appellee complaint supports this conclusion by alleging the actual investigation ordered by the governor a mere five days after voters rejected the bond amendment.thus,rather than an opinion or prediction,manchin remarks are reasonably construed as threats that,as a result of blankenship speech,massey would be subject to greater regulation than prior to blankenship remarks,or than its competitors faced.such a threat,directed towards an individual who is the head of a company in a highly regulated industry,constitutes an intimation of imminent adverse regulatory action and satisfies suarez.
having found that manchin remarks constituted retaliation under suarez,we
