mirant potomac river,llc mirant appeals the environmental protection agency epa approval of virginia clean air interstate rule state implementation plan cair sip.mirant alleged injury,however,flows from virginia nonattainment provisions,which are separate emissions standards adopted by virginia air pollution control board virginia board under the authority of the virginia legislature.because mirant injury can not fairly be traced to epa approval of virginia cair sip,we dismiss for lack of standing 
mirant,which operates a power plant in alexandria,virginia,challenges epa approval of virginia cair sip as unlawful under the clean air act caa,et,and the administrative procedure act apa,et.while a state implementation plan sip is a state compliance program under the caa,a cair sip is a modification of a sip that incorporates epa recently promulgated clean air interstate rule cair.virginia cair sip permits power plants to meet cair compliance obligations through the trading of emissions allowances with other power plants.
however,mirant power plant must also meet the emissions standards promulgated under virginia nonattainment provisions because of the plant geographic location in a nonattainment area.these provisions do not permit allowance trading to meet state compliance obligations.mirant claims that the nonattainment provisions are practically and legally a fundamental part of virginia cair sip.
mirant further argues that the nonattainment provisions interfere with its ability to meet its cair compliance obligations because these provisions purportedly prohibit allowance trading to meet cair obligations.because of space constraints at its power plant that allegedly limit mirant ability to install emissions controls,mirant argues that it will ultimately be forced to close the plant if it is not permitted to meet its cair compliance obligations through allowance trading.
mirant raises three issues on appeal,all grounded in alleged violations of the apa.first,mirant challenges epa approval of virginia cair sip without providing notice or the opportunity to comment on virginia nonattainment pro visions.second,mirant argues that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it reviewed and approved the nonattainment provisions outside its public process.third,mirant alleges that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving virginia cair sip because the nonattainment provisions are both a part of the cair sip and fundamentally incompatible with epa cair program.mirant requests that we vacate epa rule approving virginia cair sip and direct the agency to prohibit virginia from implementing and enforcing the nonattainment provisions unless and until virginia modifies its rules governing emissions from power plants to be consistent with federal requirements.petr.br.at.in the alternative,mirant requests that we remand the rule and require epa to allow for public notice and comment on the full virginia cair program,including the provisions at issue the nonattainment provisions in this case.id.at.
epa challenges mirant standing to bring this suit and argues that mirant has failed to show an injury fairly traceable to epa actions.epa maintains that mirant alleged injury does not flow from epa approval of virginia cair sip,but instead flows from virginia independently promulgated and administered nonattainment provisions.because we must satisfy ourselves of our jurisdiction,we address this question first.see pye united states,cir.
in order to demonstrate standing,a party must show that it has suffered an injury in fact the injury is fairly traceable to the defendants actions,and it is likely,and not merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.long term care partners,llc united states,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.to meet the injury in fact requirement,the party must demonstrate an injury that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent,as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical.id.citing lujan,at.an injury sufficient to meet the causation and redressability elements of the standing inquiry must result from the actions of the respondent,not from the actions of a third party beyond the court control.see frank krasner enters.montgomery county,cir citation omitted.finally,the burden of establishing standing lies squarely on the party claiming jurisdiction.id.at.
in challenging epa approval of virginia cair sip,mirant argues that its injury stems from the nonattainment provisions alleged prohibition on allowance trading,which mirant argues prevents it from meeting its cair compliance obligations.mirant attempts to establish the causal link between its alleged injury and the federally required sip approved by epa by arguing both that the nonattainment provisions are a fundamental part of virginia cair program,both legally and practically,petr.br.at,and that these provisions impermissibly interfere with epa cair program,see petr.br.at.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
we describe below the relevant regulatory sip,grounded in federal law,and the nonattainment provisions,grounded in virginia state explain why mirant has failed to establish an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to epa approval of virginia cair sip.
we begin with an analysis of the federal regulatory scheme.title i of the caa requires epa to issue national ambient air quality standards naaqs for each air pollutant that endangers,or may reasonably be anticipated to endanger,public health or welfare.a a.the caa also requires epa to divide the country into areas designated as nonattainment,attainment,or unclassified,based on whether the area meets the naaqs.d.
under title i,states have the primary responsibility for assuring that air quality within their borders meets the naaqs.title i requires each state to create a state implementation plan sip to meet the naaqs.the sip is then submitted to epa for approval.see.upon approval by epa,the sip becomes a binding federal regulation.see also union,cir upon approval or promulgation of a state implementation plan,the requirements thereof have the force and effect of federal law and may be enforced by the administrator in federal courts.
under the good neighbor provisions of the caa,states are also responsible for preventing emissions in amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in,or interfere with maintenance by,any other state.a d.to address this concern,epa promulgated the clean air interstate rule cair in.et.may.cair applies to states plus the district of columbia that contribute significantly to other states nonattainment.
cair gives these states the option of participating in a regional cap and trade program.under this program,epa sets an annual cap on the total number of tons of a pollutant,emissions allowances that a state may emit.each state then distributes emission allowances to individual power plants.these allowances establish each plant maximum emissions for cair compliance purposes.power plants can then or for a variety of purposes,including to meet current year cair compliance obligations,to use in the future,to invest,or to raise money.the program improves air quality by reducing the total emissions allowed over time.
all states subject to cair,including virginia,have chosen to participate in this cap and trade program and have modified their sips accordingly.one important implication for these states is that,under cair,neither a state sip nor any independent state laws can directly interfere with epa cap and trade program that is,they can not place restrictions on a power plant ability to engage in allowance trading to meet cair obligations.power plants in these states are subject to specific federal penalties for failure to meet cair compliance obligations virginia submitted its cair sip to epa early in,and epa approved it in december.
in addition to requiring states to propose and implement sips,the caa expressly authorizes states to adopt unilateral emissions regulations as long as those regulations are no less stringent than those adopted in the state sip.the relevant portion of the caa states
