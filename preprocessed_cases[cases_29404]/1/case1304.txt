gestamp south carolina,llc,petitioned for review of an order of the national labor relations board the nlrb or the board affirming the decision of an administrative law judge alj finding that gestamp discharged employees david anthony kingsmore and reggie alexander in violation of the national labor relations act the nlra and that gestamp was liable for another violation of the nlra as well.the board for enforcement of the order.
in an earlier decision,we granted gestamp petition for review,denied the board for enforcement,vacated the board decision,and remanded the case for further proceedings,based upon our determination that the recess appointment of board member craig becker deprived the board of a valid quorum to act when it issued its order.the supreme court subsequently granted the board petition for certiorari,vacated our opinion,and remanded for further consideration in light of its decision in nlrb noel canning.
for the reasons set forth below,we now conclude that board member becker recess appointment was valid.we grant gestamp petition for review in part and deny it in part,and we grant the board for enforcement in part and deny it in part.
in january,after oral argument had been held in this case,gestamp raised as an additional issue the question of whether the board had a quorum of validly appointed board members when it issued its order.specifically,gestamp argued that board member craig becker had been unconstitutionally appointed to the board during an recess of the senate in march,in violation of the recess appointments clause.see const.art.ii,cl.
shortly thereafter,this court issued an opinion in a separate case finding invalid three different recess appointments that had been made to the board during a recess in january.see nlrb enterprise leasing.southeast,cir.among other things,the enterprise leasing panel held that the recess appointments clause permits the president to make such appointments only during senate recesses,not during recesses.see see also nlrb new vista nursing,cir reh g granted,noel canning nlrb,aff on other grounds,nlrb noel canning.
in october,we applied enterprise leasing to this case and held that board member becker appointment was likewise per curiam see also new vista,at holding that the recess of the senate means only intersession breaks,and,therefore,that board member becker appointment was invalid.accordingly,we vacated the board decision,and remanded the case to the nlrb for further proceedings.the board then petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.
in nlrb noel canning,the supreme court affirmed the circuit determination that the recess appointments of the three board members at issue in that case were invalid.in doing so,however,the supreme court disagreed with the lower court reasoning,making it clear that the recess appointments clause applies to both recesses and recess es of substantial length,id.at,as well as to board vacancies that occur prior to or during the recess,id.at.the court additionally held,however,that senate pro forma sessions must be considered,id.at,and affirmed the judgment because the resulting recess at issue there was too short a time to bring the recess within the scope of the clause.id.at see id.at.
relying heavily on historical practice,the court confronted the interpretive problem in determining how long a recess must be in order to fall within the clause,id.at,and concluded that a recess of more than days but less than days would be presumptively too short to fall within the clause,id.at.the addition of the word presumptively,the court explained,was to leave open the possibility that some very unusual circumstance a national catastrophe,for instance,that renders the senate unavailable but calls for an urgent response could demand the exercise of the power during a shorter break.id 
shortly thereafter,the supreme court granted the board petition for a writ of certiorari in this case,vacated our judgment,and remanded for further consideration in light of its decision in noel canning.see nlrb gestamp.in contrast to the recess appointments of the board members at issue in noel canning and enterprise leasing,which took place over a recess in january,the recess appointment of board member becker took place over a recess in march.accordingly,we now hold that board member becker was validly appointed to the board when it issued the order in this case.see teamsters local union nlrb,wl,at cir,noting that because board member becker was appointed during an recess exceeding two weeks,there seems little reason to now doubt the validity of his appointment.having already had the benefit of full briefing and oral argument on the remaining questions presented in this case,we now proceed to decide gestamp original challenges to the board order.
lsp automotive lsp owned and operated a plant in union,south carolina that manufactures metal body parts for bmw vehicles that bmw assembles at a nearby facility.in may,lsp hired kingsmore,a former bmw employee,as a quality inspector.lsp hired alexander in june as a supply coordinator.
on october,gestamp purchased the facility from lsp and retained lsp employees and personnel policies,including those provided in lsp employee handbook.the handbook provided,as is relevant here,that m isleading or false statements made during an interview or f alse.entries in any books or records of the company could result in lsp withdrawing any employment offer or in termination.the handbook provided for multiple levels of discipline depending upon the severity of the misconduct but reserved for the company the right,in its sole discretion,to impose the level of punishment it deemed appropriate.
union activity 
kingsmore contacted the united steelworkers the union in late december regarding the possible organization of the facility hourly employees.alexander and kingsmore were both among the seven or eight employees on an organizing committee that the union helped form and which met approximately four times in january and early february.alexander and kingsmore also both spoke to other employees about supporting the union the union strategy,which was conveyed to alexander,kingsmore,and others,was to keep organizing efforts secret from the management.nevertheless,management became aware of the efforts as a result of many questions it was receiving from employees.
kingsmore and alexander roles in the unionization effort also became known by some plant supervisors.in early february,kingsmore told supervisor and quality engineer michael fink that he intended to unionize the plant.fink warned kingsmore to be careful because if gestamp general manager carmen evola found out,kingsmore would be gone.internal quotation marks omitted.kingsmore also told supervisor michael sullivan that he was going to try to unionize gestamp employees.on another occasion,however,kingsmore called general manager evola to deny possible rumors that he was part of the unionization effort.
in early to,management conducted group meetings explaining its position concerning the union.several statements at the meetings showed that the union issue was evoking very strong feelings,including one threat by an employee that when he found out who called the union,the employee and others would whip his ass.after the meeting,two employees together and another individually approached alexander and accused him of being one of those attempting to organize the facility.
alexander related these accusations to maintenance supervisor daniel morris.following that conversation,fink told alexander,with another employee in the vicinity,i did know you were one of the ones that were trying to bring the union in.internal quotation marks omitted.alexander offered no response.
kingsmore suspension and discharge 
on august,kingsmore and morris were instructed as part of their jobs to go on a tour of the bmw facility.when they arrived at the facility,morris was allowed in,but a bmw guard refused to allow kingsmore to enter.bmw representatives did not give him or morris any explanation for denying kingsmore entry.kingsmore immediately called his supervisor,alex keller,to report the incident.according to kingsmore,he also told evola about the incident that day when he returned to lsp.
in september,kingsmore applied for an internal promotion to a quality supervision position and interviewed with human resources director susan becksted for the position later that month.during the interview,kingsmore told becksted that he had left his previous job with bmw because of the length of the drive to bmw plant,the long hours,and his desire to spend more time with his young family.despite the fact that the job for which he was interviewing required him to have access to bmw premises,kingsmore did not mention that he had been barred from the facility.kingsmore did not receive the promotion.
in early february,evola told becksted that he had just learned that kingsmore had been banned from bmw premises.becksted told evola that the ban caused her concern for two reasons.first,since she knew other gestamp employees who had worked at bmw previously but were not banned from the facility,she questioned whether kingsmore had lied when he told her he had left bmw voluntarily.second,gestamp needed its employees to have access to bmw premises at certain times.evola asked becksted to investigate both why kingsmore left bmw and why he was banned from the premises.
becksted began by contacting keller,who confirmed that kingsmore had been denied access to bmw facility.after consulting again with evola,becksted then met with kingsmore and his manager juergen weckermen on february.kingsmore continued to maintain that the reasons he had given in his interview for leaving bmw were correct.becksted explained that she needed to know the reason for the ban and,in that regard,asked him to sign a release that she could provide to bmw.when kingsmore hesitated,becksted told him that he could be terminated if he refused to sign,and kingsmore relented and signed the document.after consulting with evola regarding whether to give kingsmore a copy of the release,becksted suspended kingsmore with pay,effective immediately,and told him that during the suspension he was not to enter gestamp premises or contact gestamp employees since doing so would interfere with her investigation.
becksted sent the release to bmw on february but received no response.she testified that she contacted bmw within two business days of kingsmore suspension and briefly spoke to someone in human resources who refused to give her any information.she also testified that she did not remember whether she documented the conversation and she does not recall any details about the human resources employee to whom she spoke.on february,she told kingsmore that she did not want her investigation to drag on and that he had until on february to obtain documentation from bmw explaining the reason he left bmw.bmw,however,would only provide kingsmore with written documentation of the dates of his employment.kingsmore faxed that documentation to becksted on the afternoon of february.upon receiving the information,becksted informed kingsmore that it was not what she had requested and that he was terminated.kingsmore employee separation checklist listed the reasons for his discharge as f alsification of prior work history,not supplying proper documentation from prior employer as requested and not supplying information for reason of bmw refusal to allow employee on property.
alexander discharge 
it was normal procedure for gestamp employees to create weekly timesheets that listed their start times,ending times,and total hours and to submit those to their supervisors.the company also maintained a system whereby employees checked in and out of work electronically,and the resulting records were compared by supervisors to the time sheets.
alexander had a timesheet template on his computer that included start times.alexander arrived late to work on both february and.in preparing his time sheet probably on friday,february alexander struck through the start time for february and wrote in the time he had actually arrived,which was however,he neglected to make any change noting that on february he had arrived at with alexander having failed to make that change,the timesheet he submitted indicated that he arrived on time on february.alexander supervisor,sullivan,noted the discrepancy in comparing the timesheets to the electronic records,advised alexander of the problem,and changed alexander time sheet to reflect that alexander had arrived at,and alexander was not paid for the extra minutes.when becksted learned of the discrepancy,she met with alexander on february,informed him that he had violated company policy,and terminated him for falsifying his timesheet.
based on these facts,the board acting general counsel issued a complaint alleging unfair labor practice charges against gestamp.as is relevant to this appeal,the complaint alleges that gestamp violated a and by suspending and discharging kingsmore and by discharging alexander because of their union organization efforts the discharge claims and that fink violated a by warning kingsmore that he would be fired if evola found out he was trying to unionize the facility the threat claim.
following a hearing,the alj found that gestamp and fink had committed the alleged violations.regarding the discharge claims,the alj concluded that the general counsel proved protected activity on the part of alexander and kingsmore since both participated actively in the union campaign.he concluded that knowledge of alexander and kingsmore union activity could be imputed to gestamp by virtue of its supervisors awareness of their participation.in response to an argument by gestamp that the supervisors with knowledge were not involved in the employment decisions at issue,the alj acknowledged that the record was unclear whether becksted made the adverse employment decisions herself or whether she consulted with others in making them.nevertheless,the alj determined that knowledge of the union activity by gestamp management was established by circumstantial evidence,namely the evidence that the union campaign was highly charged,as exemplified by the threat of physical violence made by an employee against union supporters and by the accusations of union involvement made against alexander.the alj also found that kingsmore was suspended,and alexander and kingsmore were fired,because of animus and that gestamp failed to show that it would have taken the same actions even in the absence of the protected activity.
the alj further found that fink warning to kingsmore that kingsmore would be fired if evola learned of kingsmore attempt to unionize the plant constituted an unlawful threat under a.the alj concluded that fink statement reasonably conveyed the message that kingsmore protected activities might harm his employment and thus reasonably could have caused kingsmore to fear reprisals for engaging in protected activities.
the alj determined that gestamp was liable for the statement,rejecting the company argument that fink authority over two gestamp employees that worked at the bmw plant was not sufficient to make him a supervisor.having found the aforementioned violations,the alj recommended an order requiring gestamp to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices,to reinstate kingsmore and alexander and make them whole,to remove any mention of the terminations from its files,and to post the required notice.
on appeal,a panel of the nlrb affirmed the alj decision and adopted the alj recommended order with minor modifications not relevant here.gestamp now petitions for review of the board order and the board for enforcement of the order.
gestamp first argues that because the alj did not find that the official who made the challenged employment decisions knew of the employees union activity,the alj erred in concluding that the general counsel established a prima facie case as to the discharge claims.we agree.
although we ordinarily review questions of law de novo,the nlrb interpretation of the act is entitled to deference if it is reasonably defensible.industrial turnaround nlrb,cir.however,the board is required to follow the law as set forth by the relevant court of appeals.nlrb flambeau ai
