opinion of the court 
somerset valley rehabilitation and nursing center somerset or the employer,known formally as route west operating company,llc,petitions for review of an order of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board that declared somerset had committed several unfair labor practices in violation of section of the national labor relations act nlra.the board for enforcement of that order.we will deny the petition for review and grant the for enforcement.
background 
this dispute arises out of a union election and its aftermath at somerset in.the nurses at the facility organized under the auspices of seiu united healthcare workers east,new jersey region the union,which is an intervenor in this case in support of the board.according to the union and the board,somerset engaged in unfair labor practices both during and after the election in an effort to discourage the exercise of labor rights.
we begin by recounting the background of the dispute and the lengthy procedural history that brings it before us now.under the nlra,t he findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.e.given the deference we thus owe to the board,and further given that somerset objections are principally to the board legal conclusions,we recount the facts as found by the board,which itself adopted the findings of the administrative law judge alj who initially heard the complaint against somerset.
factual background 
somerset is a,nursing and rehabilitation center in bound brook,new jersey,operated since by careone management,careone,a manager of multiple nursing and rehabilitation facilities.somerset employs about nurses in the relevant bargaining unit,which comprises registered nurses rns,licensed practical nurses lpns,and certified nurses aides cnas.the ranks of the nurses include employees,employees,and per diem employees who work as needed and without a regular schedule.in addition,somerset employs supervisory nurses who act as managers.when a supervisory nurse is not on duty,a senior nonsupervisory nurse will serve as a charge nurse to be the link between the floor nurse and the physician.
the unionization drive began around june,when elizabeth heedles,the administrator of the facility,announced that somerset would be reducing working hours and changing employees schedules.several nurses,including sheena claudio,shannon napolitano,and jillian jacques,were concerned about the new schedules they were asked to follow.one of the supervisory nurses,jacqueline southgate,who would become a key witness for the union,was also troubled that her schedule was to be downgraded.
somerset emphasizes that,prior to the announced scheduling changes,the new jersey department of health and senior services conducted a survey of the facility in december that resulted in two citations for violations of state standards as the alj later characterized the violations,t he surveyors did not believe that a patient pain was adequately controlled by the nurse assigned to her care.somerset suggests that the poor survey resulted in increased scrutiny on the somerset nursing department and led it to begin revamping its operations to improve care.opening br.at.the alj,however,disagreed and saw the survey violations as routine,suggesting that somerset characterization was a post hoc pretext for actions.according to the alj,it was common for a facility to be cited for deficiencies,and,in this case,somerset corrected the deficiencies within a couple of weeks after receiving the report,and submitted a written plan of correction in late december,which the state accepted.a state recertification survey in january,just a month after the original survey,found that somerset was in substantial compliance,though the survey report did recommend a penalty for the december violations.
whatever the motive for the operational changes at somerset,they prompted concern among the nurses.jacques responded by contacting careone vice president of human resources,andrea lee,who promised to look into it.lee visited the facility,met with several nurses,expressed surprise about the changes,and promised to continue looking into it.she did not,however,follow up with the nurses any further.consequently,they made contact with the union and met with union organizer brian walsh in late june.
claudio,napolitano,and jacques then began speaking about the union with their colleagues at somerset and generated interest from several other nurses,including southgate,valerie wells,and lynette tyler.they prepared a youtube video,distributed and collected union authorization cards held meetings at employees homes and at a local diner,and organized employees to wear stickers.their campaign culminated in a july,petition for a union election submitted to the board by nurses jacques and napolitano and organizer walsh.the union then circulated to somerset employees a brochure with photographs of employees,including claudio,jacques,napolitano,and wells.somerset acknowledges that napolitano,claudio,and jacques were among the leaders in the union organizing campaign.opening br.at citing.
just over a week after the union petition was filed,careone regional director,jason hutchens,brought doreen illis into somerset to replace heedles as administrator.illis was transferred from a substantially larger careone facility,and heedles took over at the facility that illis left.the alj expressed doubt that heedles was shifted for reasons of effectiveness,noting that she was transferred to lead a facility with double the number of beds,and that careone was aware of the disenchantment with the scheduling changes at somerset.somerset made other management changes in august,including bringing in inez konjoh as a replacement director of nursing and giving southgate management responsibilities.
election campaign 
by late july,after the union petition was filed,an election campaign was in full swing.somerset campaigned vigorously against the union as it had a right to do but in so doing it undertook actions that the board later concluded crossed the line into unfair labor practices.
hutchens held several meetings with employees and received their complaints about the controversial schedule changes.that schedule was ultimately not implemented.in the meetings,hutchens apologized for the proposed changes and said that he had brought in a new administrator and director of nursing to rectify the problems.when employees pressed him about ongoing problems,he noted that any policy changes during the union election would be illegal,but he asked the employees to give somerset a chance to show them that things could improve.several employees testified about the meetings and further indications from careone managers that they would fix things.several employees also testified that managers talked to them personally about the union and urged them to vote against it.
though he denied any unlawful activity,hutchens acknowledged that the employer ran a vote no campaign.he and other somerset officials held general meetings and spoke with nurses at the nursing stations.chris foglio,the chief executive officer of careone,met with employees and discussed benefits that careone might offer,including support for housing expenses and tuition reimbursement.management held meetings within its own ranks,discussing union activities and how each individual nurse might vote.it also distributed leaflets to employees to dissuade them from voting for the union.
management rectified some specific complaints during the campaign.when one nurse,annie stubbs,complained about a lack of garbage bags,garbage bags were distributed the next day.when tyler told illis her responsibilities were overwhelming her,a week later her duties were reduced at about the same time that illis asked her to convince other employees to vote against the union.
the election was finally held on september.out of votes cast,were for the union and against,with five ballots being subject to challenge.after hearing and overruling somerset objections,an nlrb hearing officer certified the union in january,a decision affirmed and certified by the board in august.
acts of alleged retaliation 
at issue in this case is the board conclusion that napolitano,claudio,jacques,and wells were discharged as retaliation for their unionization activities.claudio,jacques,and napolitano were the three leading union advocates.they contacted the union and worked with walsh to organize the nurses at somerset they appeared in the union brochure and youtube video and they served as the union election observers.wells also appeared in the youtube video and in the brochure she signed an authorization card for the union and she spoke favorably about the union at work.those facts,paired with the conclusion that somerset animus toward the union is beyond question,led the alj to decide that the union activities of those women were well known to somerset,which then targeted them for retaliation.
the first set of actions that formed the basis for the nlrb investigation of events at the nursing home concerned somerset enforcement of its attendance policy.only days after the election,somerset issued two attendance warnings to jacques,two to claudio,and one to napolitano,even though t hey had not received written discipline prior to the election for the ir attendance records.the timing was troublesome before the election,somerset was lax with regard to attendance,but immediately after the election konjoh took a personal interest in tardiness.illis did not begin to focus on attendance until six weeks into her tenure as administrator,after the election.not only did the three nurses receive discipline for recent attendance issues,they were disciplined for lateness and absences dating back to nine months prior to the election.before the election,only one employee had ever received formal discipline for attendance problems.
the second set of somerset actions at issue before the board had to do with discipline.that discipline became significantly stricter immediately after the election.the alj concluded that 
medicine and treatment records were not scrutinized as carefully before the election as they were after the election,and any errors in those records found prior to the election were rarely the subject of discipline.for example,somerset offered in evidence numerous examples of discipline given to employees after the election for performance issues,but could only present three instances of discipline prior to the election.even as to them,the maximum discipline issued was a written warning.
there were also suspicious circumstances,in the alj view,surrounding the dismissal of each of the four employees at issue.claudio received her first warning ever on september and her second on september.s he received a suspension on october,which was unusually severe compared to another nurse who committed the same infraction.finally,she was discharged on october for an infraction completing medical chart entries after her shift rather than during it which was a not uncommon practice according to southgate testimony.
jacques had worked at somerset for years.she was discharged for errors that,prior to the election,would have been remedied with training and for which other nurses received less discipline.the sudden discharge came even as somerset continued to put jacques in the senior role of charge nurse,acknowledging her experience and expertise.moreover,southgate testified that konjoh told her that somerset management was watching union organizers closely for infractions,and an employee who was a confidant of illis testified that illis told him to look for errors committed by jacques in her charting.
napolitano was discharged two weeks after the election for improperly administering a zinc pill to a patient.she did improperly administer the pill,but konjoh seemed intent on collecting evidence to support disciplinary action because she had instructed the patient to save any improperly administered pills rather than correct an error when discovered.three other nurses made the same mistake and faced no discipline.a second reason cited for napolitano dismissal was that she noted a patient pulse oxygen level at,an obvious error in documentation that would have been simply corrected before the election.
wells was a staffing coordinator at somerset for five years before the election and had not previously been disciplined.she was on vacation during the election,and when she returned to work five days afterward,she was given a disciplinary warning for the first time.she had failed to reconcile discrepancies between manually typed schedules and entries in the computerized system for the prior weekend shifts.somerset past practice would have allowed her to have the morning to correct the scheduling inconsistencies on her first day back.instead,she was written up,and she received two more warnings the following week for mistakes in inputting employee schedules and a failure to provide konjoh a written schedule.she was discharged on september,within three weeks of the election.the alj acknowledged that the scheduling errors and failure to properly use the electronic system were problematic,but he concluded that the sudden and rapid discipline following the election suggested that the true motivation for wells discharge was retaliation.
the alj found two additional retaliatory acts against other employees.first,when tyler left somerset,her records were marked with a notation that she was not eligible for rehire resigned with bad attitude toward company.she received this negative notation,even though before the election illis had encouraged her to stay or take advantage of a program.separately,somerset dropped several per diem employees within the two to three weeks following the election.to find replacements,illis solicited a per diem nurse at another careone facility to come to somerset and recommend other per diem employees who would vote in somerset favor in a new election if the results of the first election were overturned.
procedural background 
somerset activities led the union to file charges with the nlrb,all of which were eventually consolidated into a complaint issued on april.after days of hearings,the alj issued a decision against somerset.the board adopted the alj decision in its september,order the order.
while the board was considering the case,it separately sought temporary injunctive relief before the united states district court for the district of new jersey,under j of the nlra,j the district court granted in part and denied in part the injunctive relief,ordering the reinstatement of napolitano and claudio but denying reinstatement to jacques and wells.that decision was ultimately vacated by our court in lightner ex rel.nlrb route west operating,llc,cir,because the board september order made the j proceedings moot.we noted,however,that v acating the opinion and order entered by the district court will have no effect on the existence or record of the proceedings before it,and that we know of no ruling that would hinder somerset from relying on appropriate facts in the district court record.id.at.
subsequently,in june,the supreme court ruled in nlrb noel canning,that several members of the board had been appointed in violation of the recess appointments clause of the constitution.we then granted the board motion to vacate the order and to remand because two members of the board who sat on that panel had been invalidly appointed in light of noel canning.the board issued a new order on june,order or the order,affirming its order and the alj decision.in addition to reaffirming those prior decisions,the board expressly rejected the reasons that the district court had given when denying complete relief in the j proceedings.the board reiterated the conclusion from the order that,since virtually all of the discipline imposed for the supposed deficiencies of the employees was unlawfully motivated,such discipline could not be the basis for avoiding the remedy of reinstatement and back pay.according to the board,the errors ascribed to jacques and wells had long predated the union election and were merely pretexts that could not preclude reinstatement.
somerset petitioned us to review the order,and the board for enforcement.those are the applications before us now.
ii.jurisdiction 
the nlrb had jurisdiction over this matter under a.we have jurisdiction to review the board final order pursuant to f and jurisdiction to consider the application for enforcement pursuant to e.our jurisdiction over particular issues,however,is limited by the exhaustion requirement embedded in that last statutory subjection,which is e of the nlra.section e provides that n o objection that has not been urged before the board,its member,agent,or agency,shall be considered by the court,unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.e.the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional.except in the rare case that presents extraordinary circumstances,a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review objections that were not urged before the board.woelke romero framing,nlrb.
the exhaustion requirement is important in this case because one of the principal grounds for review that somerset urges upon us was never raised before the board.specifically,somerset now contends that the nlrb acting general counsel was serving in violation of the federal vacancies reform act fvra,et,at the time he filed the initial complaint against somerset,and that the subsequent actions of the board are thus infirm.that argument is new,so before we can address its merits,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider it at all.
somerset argues that the lawfulness of the general counsel service is a jurisdictional issue that goes to the board very authority to act,suggesting that we may therefore review the issue despite the exhaustion bar in e.opening br.at.as somerset notes,the general counsel of the nlrb has final authority in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints alleging unfair labor practices.d.though the general counsel may delegate authority to regional directors,t he practical effect of the nlra administrative scheme is that a party believing himself the victim of an unfair labor practice can obtain neither adjudication nor remedy under the labor statute without first persuading the office of general counsel that his claim is sufficiently meritorious to warrant board consideration,nlrb sears,roebuck.
somerset is certainly correct that the general counsel of the nlrb plays a role in all unfair labor practices cases.but that does not itself provide jurisdiction for us to review the lawfulness of the president designation of an acting general counsel.our jurisdiction to review the acts of administrative agencies is a product of statutory grant,and congress has broad discretion to determine the breadth of that jurisdiction.see lauf shinner,there can be no question of the power of congress to define and limit the jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the united states.congress may,for instance,remove from federal courts the jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor disputes.id.at.it may require that challenges to a law be brought in one tribunal rather than in another,and parties may forfeit their rights by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.yakus united states.the latter is precisely what congress has done in of the nlra.somerset admitted failure to follow the process that congress established for challenging the lawfulness of the board actions therefore precludes it from pressing its fvra claim unless it can point to a specific grant of jurisdiction 
somerset argument that its fvra claim is jurisdictional in nature thereby giving us some inherent authority to review it is unconvincing.as the supreme court explained in city of arlington fcc,there is a significant difference between the concept of jurisdiction in the judicial context and in the administrative context.in the former,there is a meaningful line between jurisdictional and questions,because w hether the court decided correctly is a question that has different consequences from the question whether it had the power to decide at all.id.at emphasis in original.but,that is not the case in the latter,administrative,context.when agencies are charged with administering congressional statutes,
b oth their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by congress,so that when they act improperly,no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction,what they do is ultra vires.because the question whether framed as an incorrect application of agency authority or an assertion of authority not conferred is always whether the agency has gone beyond what congress has permitted it to do,there is no principled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of such claims as jurisdictional.
id.at.therefore,if the board was acting unlawfully in considering a complaint brought by an improperly serving acting general counsel,its actions were no more ultra vires than if the board had misapplied the nlra.we consider both sorts of claims under the strictures of that statute,including the exhaustion bar of e.again,that bar permits consideration of arguments not raised before the board only when late consideration can be justified by extraordinary circumstances.e.
to overcome that straightforward reading of both the nlra and case law on congress power to shape federal appellate court jurisdiction,somerset leans heavily on two sentences from our opinion in nlrb konig,stating that there is a 
distinction between jurisdiction in the sense of the overall authority of the board to hear the case under the nlra and the jurisdiction of the board to issue an order based upon a factual determination made by the board.while the board statutory jurisdiction may be raised at any time,the facts upon which the board determines it has jurisdiction may be challenged only upon timely exception.
cir.quoting nlrb peyton fritton stores,cir.based on that quotation,somerset argues that it may raise its challenge regarding the acting general counsel at any time because the issue implicates the overall authority of the board to hear the case.id.that position can not prevail for three reasons.
first it conflicts with the supreme court subsequent instruction in city of arlington that any distinction between a jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional exercise of agency authority is merely illusory.at.the court was there considering deference to agency interpretations of statutes,but the logic applies equally to judicial review of an agency adjudicatory process.to rephrase the principle noted above,b oth the board power to act and how it act s are authoritatively prescribed by congress,and when the board act s improperly what it does is ultra vires no less than when it act s beyond its jurisdiction.id.city of arlington tells us plainly that we are not supposed to sift the entrails of vast statutory schemes to divine whether a particular exercise of agency authority qualifies as jurisdictional id.at.
second,the language in konig is too general to support somerset conclusion that we are free to review unexhausted challenges to agency action whenever such a challenge can be framed as jurisdictional.the case does not define what is meant by the overall authority of the board to hear the case under the nlra.konig,at.nor does it explain whether we may hear those challenges based on some inherent power or because they meet the extraordinary circumstances exception to the exhaustion bar of e.somerset inherent power theory would be a novel assertion of judicial authority,and we decline to read that much into such vague language.
that particular passage from konig also happens to be dicta,which is the third reason we decline to read it as allowing somerset to avoid the exhaustion bar.in the paragraph immediately following konig distinction between the overall authority of the board to hear the case under the nlra and the jurisdiction of the board to issue an order based upon a factual determination made by the board,we went on to rule that the issue raised in konig was the latter type of case,based on a factual determination by the board.at.we applied the exhaustion bar of e and refused to hear the claim,id.at,so there was no need to consider any broader form of authority to review jurisdictional challenges,since none was implicated in konig thus,any observations in the opinion about broader jurisdiction were irrelevant to the holding and do not bind us now.galli meadowlands comm n,cir.
our conclusion accords with the developing consensus of other courts that have considered this issue.in addressing challenges to the appointments of members of the board itself,three circuits have determined that they need not hear objections that were unpreserved.horton,nlrb,cir.ggnsc springfield llc nlrb,cir.nlrb relco locomotives,cir.when the circuit did hear such an unpreserved argument,it was not because the objection was jurisdictional,but rather because the objection satisfied the extraordinary circumstances exception to the e exhaustion bar.noel canning nlrb,cir.our court recently expressly adopted the circuit logic to hold that unexhausted canning challenges to the composition of the nlrb may be heard because they satisfy the extraordinary circumstances exception to e.advanced disposal servs,nlrb,wl,at cir,
all of those cases concerned challenges to the authority of the board itself to act based on the constitutional infirmity of its members appointments.even in those cases,courts have looked only to the extraordinary circumstances exception to e rather than to some ground to excuse a failure to exhaust.somerset now asks us to create an even broader exception to e for its statutory challenge to the acting general counsel appointment.we decline to do so.that puts us in accord with the principal opinion upon which somerset relies to support its fvra defense,in which the circuit expressed doubt that the argument then before it,if unpreserved,could be raised in court.see sw,nlrb,cir.we doubt that an employer that failed to timely raise an fvra objection will enjoy success.
since somerset has no way around the e exhaustion requirement,we lack jurisdiction to consider its fvra objection unless its failure to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances.e.somerset briefing,however,makes no mention of the extraordinary circumstances exception.at oral argument,somerset acknowledged that the focus of its argument was on the assertion of some broader jurisdiction than is granted in the extraordinary circumstances exception to e.oral arg.tr.we therefore have no argument before us as to why the present circumstances are so extraordinary as to warrant review without the board having had the first opportunity to address somerset objection consequently,we will apply the e exhaustion bar,and,lacking jurisdiction to consider somerset objection to the board order on the basis of the fvra,we will proceed to consider only those objections urged before the board.e.
iii.discussion 
somerset petitions for review of the board order based on the following grounds.first,it asks us to vacate the order because chairman mark gaston pearce should have recused himself in response to somerset motion for recusal.as to the merits of the order,somerset challenges the board determination that its conduct involved unfair labor practices.finally,it argues that,even if it did violate the nlra by dismissing certain employees,reinstatement is not the appropriate remedy in this case.we consider each objection in turn.
motion to recuse 
somerset asks us to vacate the board order because,it says,chairman pearce should have recused himself from the panel that heard this case.according to somerset,recusal was necessary because ellen dichner,who was serving as chief counsel to chairman pearce,had previously represented the union in this very case,both before the alj and in the j proceedings.while somerset does not allege that dichner participated in the board consideration of this case in any way,it argues that there is an inevitable appearance of impropriety because her subordinates would feel obliged to support her former client position in their discussions with chairman pearce.
the board denied somerset motion for recusal in its order.it acknowledged that dichner,while in earlier private practice,represented the charging party union in this case up to the exceptions stage,but contended that dichner has taken no part in the board consideration of this case.evidently,it was unimpressed by the appearance of impropriety issue.
we review an agency member decision not to recuse himself from a proceeding under a deferential,abuse of discretion standard.metro.council of naacp branches fcc,cir.see also mayberry maroney,cir.applying the same standard to recusal of district judges.that standard is premised on the principle that deferential review is used when the matter under review was decided by someone who is thought to have a better vantage point than we on the court of appeals to assess the matter.united states tomko,cir.en banc quoting united states mitchell,cir.
we therefore do not put ourselves in the position of chairman pearce or the board and make the recusal decision anew rather,we simply review whether the decision was arbitrary or unreasonable.id.at.given that there is no evidence that dichner played any role in the consideration of this case,or that chairman pearce was less than diligent in screening her from the proceedings,and given further that the assertions about dichner indirect influence are based on speculation,we can not say that the board abused its discretion by maintaining the chairman on the panel.
unfair labor practices 
somerset also challenges the correctness of the board determination that it engaged in unfair labor practices.in considering the board decision,we accept factual findings as conclusive if supported by substantial evidence,while subjecting legal conclusions to plenary review with deference to the board interpretation of the nlra.mars home for youth nlrb,cir.
substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.citizens publ g printing nlrb,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,we defer to the board credibility determinations,and will reverse them only if they are inherently incredible or patently unreasonable.grane health care nlrb,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the board legal determinations,f amiliar principles of judicial deference to an administrative agency apply to the nlrb interpretation of the nlra.therefore,the nlrb construction of the nlra will be upheld if it is reasonably defensible.quick nlrb,cir.quoting ford motor nlrb,internal citation omitted.c ourts of appeals should not substitute their judgment for that of the nlrb in determining how best to undo the effects of unfair labor practices,and the board choice of a remedy must be given special respect by reviewing courts,and must not be disturbed unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the act.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board findings that somerset unlawfully interrogated its employees and solicited their grievances,and that it retaliated against several employees by disciplining and discharging them due to their activities.thus,as detailed herein,we must sustain the board conclusion that somerset violated of the nlra.
interrogating employees 
an employer violates a of the nlra by interrogating employees about their union sympathies,when doing so suggests to the employees that the employer may retaliate because of those sympathies.hedstrom,at.
the board believed several accounts from somerset employees about management interrogating them before the election.konjoh asked claudio how other employees would vote and asked her to vote no and give management a chance to improve conditions.careone official jessica arroyo asked cna avian jarbo whether somerset was going to get a no vote from her.konjoh asked stubbs what she thought of the union and stated that,although stubbs had a union at another job,we do want one here.illis,the management official at the facility,asked tyler where are you in terms of voting editorial marks omitted.she further asked whether tyler knew how her coworkers were voting,and whether tyler could convince them to vote no.throughout the course of those sorts of questions,n o assurances were made to the employees that they would not face retaliation for failure to cooperate with management.
though somerset contests the characterization of the questioning as coercive,when employee testimony about the interrogations conflicted with that of somerset managers,the alj and the board credited the version given by the employees,explaining that they testified in a straightforward,confident,consistent manner.the board credibility determinations are entitled to great deference.atlantic limousine,nlrb,cir.in light of the testimony credited by the board,substantial evidence supports its conclusion that management officials at somerset questioned employees in a manner unlawfully coercive under a of the nlra.
retaliation 
section a of the nlra prohibits an employer from taking adverse employment actions against an employee in retaliation for union membership or activities.a.the board applied the analysis articulated in a case called wright line,nlrb,which was approved by the supreme court in nlrb transportation management.under wright line,the employee must establish that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the employer action.once this is accomplished,the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it would have reached the same decision absent the protected conduct.nlrb at.
without recounting anew the facts summarized above,we conclude that the board did indeed have substantial evidence to support its conclusions that claudio,napolitano,jacques,and wells were targeted because of their union support and that somerset justifications for the adverse employment actions it took were simply pretextual.
the principal response somerset gives to the board ruling on retaliation is that the stricter policies it instituted after the election were actually motivated by a history of poor nursing home performance that long predated union activity at the facility.opening br.at.but the timeline does not bear that out.the deficiencies uncovered in the december survey were deemed isolated,and,within weeks,somerset had corrected them and submitted a successful correction plan to state authorities.the very next month,a resurvey found somerset in substantial compliance.in fact,no significant discipline or tightening of policy took place close to the december inspection that somerset suggests was the reason for its stricter policies.instead,the discipline began months later,immediately following the union election.the timeline that somerset urges us to consider thus supports the board finding that somerset was unlawfully motivated when it disciplined and discharged the four union activists.see,hunter douglas,nlrb,cir.timing and departure from past practice indicates unlawful motive hanlon wilson nlrb,cir.union animus and disparate treatment indicate unlawful motive champion parts rebuilders,nlrb,cir.timing and disparate treatment establish unlawful motive.
solicitation of grievances 
section a of the act prohibits an employer from interfering with,restraining,or coercing its employees in the exercise of protected concerted activities.a see also id.to establish a violation,it need only be shown that under the circumstances existing,the employer conduct may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of rights protected under the act.hedstrom nlrb,cir.en banc internal quotation marks omitted.an employer violates section a by expressly or impliedly promising to remedy employee grievances if they reject the union.id.
in this case,the board credited employee testimony that,after the union petition was filed,hutchens and illis told employees they would try to fix things.the board made particular mention that management transferred heedles and eliminated the proposed scheduling changes which had created employee unrest,that it eliminated one of tyler job duties after she complained her job was overwhelming,and that it made garbage bags available in response to stubbs complaint.substantial evidence supports those findings.though some of the grievances,when viewed in isolation,may be quite minor,the board findings collectively support the conclusion that somerset solicited employees grievances,promised to fix them,and,in some cases,did fix them during the election campaign,all in violation of a of the nlra.
reinstatement remedies 
as a final argument,somerset contends that,even if we reject its legal challenges to the board findings of unlawful labor practices,we should not enforce the board proposed remedies in full.specifically,it contends that napolitano,claudio,jacques,and wells should not be reinstated because they would put patients at risk.
the board does indeed have a delicate responsibility in the healthcare services context to balanc e conflicting legitimate interests in a way that safeguards patients and effectuate s national labor policy.beth israel hosp.nlrb,internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing the board determination,though,our judicial role is narrow,and an order of the board must be enforced if it is rationally consisten t with the act and supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.id.that principle accords with our generally deferential standard of review for the board remedial orders,which we review for abuse of discretion.kenrich petrochemicals,nlrb,cir.en banc.moreover,r einstatement is the conventional correction for discriminatory discharges,phelps dodge nlrb,and we are particularly hesitant to overturn that choice of remedy.
the crux of somerset argument is that,even if those four employees were unlawfully dismissed in retaliation for their unionizing activities,the board failed to consider whether reinstatement was appropriate in light of safety concerns.that,however,is not a fair assessment of the board remedial analysis.in applying the wright line test,the board evaluated both whether somerset acted with a discriminatory motive and would have reached the same decision absent the protected conduct.nlrb at.therefore,the analysis for unfair labor practices in this case necessarily incorporated the question of whether safety concerns should preclude reinstatement because,if the employees were putting patients at risk,they could have been fired regardless of somerset motives.if somerset could not prove that it would have discharged the four employees for unsafe conduct,it also could not show that the misconduct would have disqualified them from reinstatement.as we have already recognized,substantial evidence supports the board determination that the alleged performance deficiencies were merely pretextual reasons for dismissing napolitano,claudio,jacques,and wells.we therefore also conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion in determining that the safety concerns somerset raises against reinstatement are likewise pretextual and invalid.
of greater concern to us is somerset claim that the board improperly ignored the evidence and expert opinion from the j proceedings before the district court for temporary injunctive relief.the district court reviewed the record developed before the alj,and it held eight days of additional evidentiary hearings and two days of oral argument.the additional evidence included expert testimony on patient safety not presented to the alj.the court then issued a opinion discussing the case in exacting detail and concluded that reinstatement of wells and jacques would endanger somerset patients more than it would advance the purposes of the nlra.five months later,the board issued its own decision to the contrary,ordering the reinstatement of both wells and jacques,without specifically address ing the particular allegations against jacques and wells that motivated the district court to deny them interim reinstatement.we later ruled that the district court decision was moot and instructed it to vacate its order,observing that a j proceeding gives a district court authority to enter tempor
