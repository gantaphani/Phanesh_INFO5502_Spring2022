after investigating a sex discrimination charge against petitioner mach mining,llc,respondent eeoc determined that reasonable cause existed to believe that the company had engaged in unlawful hiring practices.the commission sent a letter inviting mach mining and the complainant to participate in informal conciliation proceedings and notifying them that a representative would be contacting them to begin the process.about a year later,the commission sent mach mining another letter stating that it had determined that conciliation efforts had been unsuccessful.the commission then sued mach mining in federal court.in its answer,mach mining alleged that the commission had not attempted to conciliate in good faith.the commission countered that its conciliation efforts were not subject to judicial review and that,regardless,the two letters it sent to mach mining provided adequate proof that it had fulfilled its statutory duty.the district court agreed that it could review the adequacy of the commission efforts,but granted the commission leave to immediately appeal.the seventh circuit reversed,holding that the commission statutory conciliation obligation was unreviewable.
courts have authority to review whether the eeoc has fulfilled its title vii duty to attempt conciliation.this court has recognized a strong presumption that congress means to allow judicial review of administrative action.bowen michigan academy of family physicians.that presumption is rebuttable when a statute language or structure demonstrates that congress intended an agency to police itself.block community nutrition institute.but nothing rebuts that presumption here.
by its choice of language,congress imposed a mandatory duty on the eeoc to attempt conciliation and made that duty a precondition to filing a lawsuit.such compulsory prerequisites are routinely enforced by courts in title vii litigation.and though congress gave the eeoc wide latitude to choose which informal methods to use,it did not deprive courts of judicially manageable criteria by which to review the conciliation process.by its terms,the statutory obligation to attempt conciliation necessarily entails communication between the parties concerning the alleged unlawful employment practice.the statute therefore requires the eeoc to notify the employer of the claim and give the employer an opportunity to discuss the matter.in enforcing that statutory condition,a court applies a manageable standard.
the appropriate scope of judicial review of the eeoc conciliation activities is narrow,enforcing only the eeoc statutory obligation to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve voluntary compliance.this limited review respects the expansive discretion that title vii gives the eeoc while still ensuring that it follows the law.
the government suggestion that review be limited to checking the facial validity of its two letters to mach mining falls short of title vii demands.that standard would merely accept the eeoc word that it followed the law,whereas the aim of judicial review is to verify that the eeoc actually tried to conciliate a discrimination charge.citing the standard set out in the national labor relations act,mach mining proposes review for whether the eeoc engaged in negotiation,laying out a number of specific requirements to implement that standard.but the nlra approach provides a poor analogy for title vii,which ultimately cares about substantive outcomes and eschews any reciprocal duty to negotiate in good faith.mach mining proposed code of conduct also conflicts with the wide latitude congress gave the commission to decide how to conduct and when to end conciliation efforts.and because information obtained during conciliation would be necessary evidence in a determination proceeding,mach mining brand of review would violate title vii confidentiality protections.
the proper scope of review thus matches the terms of title vii conciliation provision.in order to comply with that provision,the eeoc must inform the employer about the specific discrimination allegation.such notice must describe what the employer has done and which employees or class of employees have suffered.and the eeoc must try to engage the employer in a discussion in order to give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice.a sworn affidavit from the eeoc stating that it has performed these obligations should suffice to show that it has met the conciliation requirement.should the employer present concrete evidence that the eeoc did not provide the requisite information about the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliating the claim,a court must conduct the factfinding necessary to resolve that limited dispute.should it find for the employer,the appropriate remedy is to order the eeoc to undertake the mandated conciliation efforts.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
before suing an employer for discrimination,the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc or commission must try to remedy unlawful workplace practices through informal methods of conciliation.this case requires us to decide whether and how courts may review those efforts.we hold that a court may review whether the eeoc satisfied its statutory obligation to attempt conciliation before filing suit.but we find that the scope of that review is narrow,thus recognizing the eeoc extensive discretion to determine the kind and amount of communication with an employer appropriate in any given case.
title vii of the civil rights act of,stat,et,sets out a detailed,procedure through which the commission enforces the statute prohibition on employment discrimination.the process generally starts when a person claiming to be aggrieved files a charge of an unlawful workplace practice with the eeoc.b.at that point,the eeoc notifies the employer of the complaint and undertakes an investigation.see ibid.if the commission finds no reasonable cause to think that the allegation has merit,it dismisses the charge and notifies the parties.ibid.the complainant may then pursue her own lawsuit if she chooses.see f.
if,on the other hand,the commission finds reasonable cause,it must first endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.b.to ensure candor in those discussions,the statute limits the disclosure and use of the participants statements nothing said or done during and as a part of such informal endeavors may be publicized by the commission or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of the persons concerned.ibid.the statute leaves to the eeoc the ultimate decision whether to accept a settlement or instead to bring a lawsuit.so long as the commission has been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission itself,the eeoc may sue the employer.f.
this case began when a woman filed a charge with the eeoc claiming that petitioner mach mining,llc,had refused to hire her as a coal miner because of her sex.the commission investigated the allegation and found reasonable cause to believe that mach mining had discriminated against the complainant,along with a class of women who had similarly applied for mining jobs.see app.in a letter announcing that determination,the eeoc invited both the company and the complainant to participate in informal methods of dispute resolution,promising that a commission representative would soon contact them to begin the conciliation process.at.the record does not disclose what happened next.but about a year later,the commission sent mach mining a second letter,stating that such conciliation efforts as are required by law have occurred and have been unsuccessful and that any further efforts would be futile.at.
the eeoc then sued mach mining in federal district court alleging sex discrimination in hiring.the commission complaint maintained that a ll conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit including an attempt to end the challenged practice through conciliation ha d been fulfilled.at.in its answer,mach mining contested that statement,asserting that the eeoc had failed to conciliat e in good faith prior to filing suit,at.
the commission subsequently moved for summary judgment on that issue,contending that its conciliation efforts are not subject to judicial review.motion for summary judgment in sd.at most,the commission argued,the court could inspect the eeoc two letters to mach mining to confirm that the eeoc had met its duty to attempt conciliation.see,at.mach mining responded by urging the court to consider the overall reasonable ness of the eeoc efforts,based on evidence the company would present about the conciliation process.memorandum in opposition to motion for partial summary judgment in sd.the trial court agreed with mach mining that it should review whether the commission had made a sincere and reasonable effort to negotiate.civ.sd,app.to pet.for cert,wl,internal quotation marks omitted.at the eeoc request,the court then authorized an immediate appeal of its ruling.see civ.sd,may,app.to pet.for cert,wl,b.
the court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed,holding that the statutory directive to attempt conciliation is not subject to judicial review.according to the court,that provision entrusts conciliation solely to the eeoc expert judgment and thus provides no workable standard of review for courts to apply,at.the seventh circuit further reasoned that judicial review of the conciliation process would undermine enforcement of title vii by protract ing and complicat ing discrimination suits,at quoting doe oberweis diary.in its concluding paragraph,however,the court indicated that it had in fact subjected the eeoc activities to a smidgen of review because the commission pled on the face of its complaint that it ha d complied with all prerequisites to suit and because its two letters to mach mining were facially sufficient to show that conciliation had occurred,the court stated,our review of that process is satisfied.at.
other courts of appeals have held that title vii allows judicial review of the eeoc conciliation efforts,but without agreeing on what that review entails we granted certiorari,to address whether and to what extent such an attempt to conciliate is subject to judicial consideration.
congress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies.for that reason,this court applies a strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.bowen michigan academy of family physicians.that presumption is rebuttable it fails when a statute or structure demonstrates that congress wanted an agency to police its own conduct.see block community nutrition institute.but the agency bears a heavy burden in attempting to show that congress prohibit ed all judicial review of the agency compliance with a legislative mandate.dunlop bachowski.
title vii,as the government acknowledges,imposes a duty on the eeoc to attempt conciliation of a discrimination charge prior to filing a lawsuit.see brief for respondent.that obligation is a key component of the statutory scheme.in pursuing the goal of bring ing employment discrimination to an end,congress chose c ooperation and voluntary compliance as its preferred means.ford motor eeoc,quoting alexander.accordingly,the statute provides,as earlier noted,that the commission shall endeavor to eliminate an alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.b see supra,at.that language is mandatory,not precatory.national railroad passenger corporation morgan,noting that the word shall admits of no discretion.and the duty it imposes serves as a necessary precondition to filing a lawsuit.only if the commission is unable to secure an acceptable conciliation agreement that is,only if its attempt to conciliate has failed may a claim against the employer go forward.f.
courts routinely enforce such compulsory prerequisites to suit in title vii litigation and in many other contexts besides.an employee,for example,may bring a title vii claim only if she has first filed a timely charge with the eeoc and a court will usually dismiss a complaint for failure to do so.see,at.similarly,an employee must obtain a letter before bringing suit and a court will typically insist on satisfaction of that condition.see,mcdonnell douglas green,see also,hallstrom tillamook county,upholding dismissal of an environmental suit for failure to comply with a notice provision serving as a condition precedent united states zucca,affirming dismissal of a denaturalization suit because of the government failure to comply with a mandatory prerequisite.that ordinary part of title vii litigation see a prerequisite to suit,enforce a prerequisite to suit supports judicial review of the eeoc compliance with the law conciliation provision.
the government,reiterating the seventh circuit view,contests that conclusion,arguing that title vii provides no standards by which to judge the eeoc performance of its statutory duty.brief for respondent.the government highlights the broad leeway the statute gives the eeoc to decide how to engage in,and when to give up on,conciliation.in granting that discretion,the government contends,congress deprived courts of any judicially manageable criteria with which to review the eeoc efforts,at quoting heckler chaney.and in that way congress demonstrate d its intention to preclude judicial review.brief for respondent.
but in thus denying that title vii creates a reviewable prerequisite to suit,the government takes its observation about discretion too far,at quoting,at.yes,the statute provides the eeoc with wide latitude over the conciliation process,and that feature becomes significant when we turn to defining the proper scope of judicial review.see infra,at.but no,congress has not left everything to the commission.consider if the eeoc declined to make any attempt to conciliate a claim if,after finding reasonable cause to support a charge,the eeoc took the employer straight to court.in such a case,title vii would offer a perfectly serviceable standard for judicial review without any endeavor at all,the eeoc would have failed to satisfy a necessary condition of litigation.
still more,the statute provides certain concrete standards pertaining to what that endeavor must entail.again,think of how the statute describes the obligatory attempt to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.b.those specified methods necessarily involve communication between parties,including the exchange of information and views.as one dictionary variously defines the terms,they involve consultation or discussion,an attempt to reconcile different positions,and a means of argument,reasoning,or entreaty.american heritage dictionary,ed.that communication,moreover,concerns a particular thing the alleged unlawful employment practice.so the eeoc,to meet the statutory condition,must tell the employer about the claim essentially,what practice has harmed which person or class and must provide the employer wit
