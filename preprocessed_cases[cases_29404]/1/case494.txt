this case requires us to decide for the first time whether an illegal alien,convicted under the travel act for promoting an unlawful activity involving controlled substances,remains eligible for adjustment of status.concluding,as we do,that the board of immigration appeals bia correctly answered this question in the negative,we uphold the order of removal and deny the alien petition for judicial review.
background 
the petitioner,josé ramón,is a native of the dominican republic.he originally entered the united states under a false name and without a valid visa.several years later,federal authorities charged him with aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine.he pleaded guilty,inter alia,to a reduced charge of traveling in interstate commerce to promote an unlawful activity in violation of the travel act.the sentencing court imposed a incarcerative term,to be followed by three years of supervised release.
the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings on november,the ins claimed that the petitioner was deportable on three grounds,namely,i as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document,a a ii as an alien who had been convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance,id.a b i and iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,id.a a iii.the government based the latter two charges on the petitioner travel act conviction.
at a removal hearing before an immigration judge ij,the petitioner conceded deportability on the basis of his illegal entry into the united states.he denied the other charges,contending that the travel act violation was neither a offense nor an aggravated felony.he also requested a discretionary adjustment of status and waiver of deportation pursuant to h 
relying on the record of the petitioner conviction,including the plea agreement which revealed that the petitioner had pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce for the specific purpose of promoting a business enterprise involving cocaine,the ij found that the travel act conviction constituted both a offense and an aggravated felony.accordingly,the ij declared the petitioner ineligible for discretionary relief,h,and ordered his removal.the bia affirmed this decision without opinion.see id.b i a formerly designated as e see also albathani ins,cir describing operation of streamlined affirmance without opinion procedure.this timely petition for judicial review followed.
ii.analysis 
the petitioner advances two closely related assignments of error.first,he claims that the travel act is not a law relating to a controlled substance.second,he protests the classification of his travel act conviction as an aggravated felony.
we first consider the applicable standard of review.this case hinges in substantial part on the proper determination of what constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance under the immigration and nationality act ina.the petitioner argues that the bia incorrectly construed the relevant section of the ina,a b i,to include the travel act violation.in his view,that statute can not be deemed sufficiently related to a controlled substance because the crime traveling in interstate commerce is separate and distinct from the underlying activity.for essentially the same reason,the petitioner challenges the bia determination that the travel act violation constituted illicit trafficking,as that term is used in a b a determination that not only converted the offense into an aggravated felony for purposes of a a iii but also eliminated any chance for the petitioner to obtain discretionary relief an adjustment of status and withholding of deportation.
so viewed,this case turns on a pure question of law whether a particular crime here,a violation of the travel act is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance within the purview of the ina.that question,as framed,does not implicate the ins exercise of administrative discretion.consequently,the question engenders de novo review see ins,d explaining that courts normally review de novo an agency construction of federal statutes ins,cir same.
we turn next to the petitioner principal argument that the travel act violation is separate and distinct from the underlying activity.the bia rejected this argument.so do we.
the ina provides for the removal of an alien who has been convicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance.a b i.in interpreting the phrase relating to,the bia looks to the degree to which the violation in question is connected to underlying activity.in re,bia.if the violation and the underlying activity are so closely related that the two could not be considered separate or distinct,then the two are essentially one and the violation is of a law relating to the underlying activity.id.quoting matter of beltran,bia.
this brings us to the travel act,which provides in relevant part 
whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to promote,manage,establish,carry on,or facilitate the promotion,management,establishment,or carrying on,of any unlawful activity,and thereafter performs or attempts to perform any of the acts specified shall be punished as provided.
a.the travel act defines the term unlawful activity to include,among other things,any business enterprise involving narcotics or controlled substances id.b.
against this backdrop,we turn to the case at hand.as said,the petitioner pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce to promote a business enterprise involving cocaine a controlled substance.the conduct underlying the proscribed travel the promotion of a business enterprise involving cocaine was tantamount to aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics.the plea agreement makes manifest the petitioner admission of his involvement in that underlying conduct and,thus,his culpability for it.united states salerno,cir pleading guilty to interstate travel in furtherance of drug trafficking is tantamount to pleading to a felony drug offense.we see nothing separate or distinct,as a practical matter,between the travel act violation and the petitioner involvement in the cocaine trade.thus,common sense indicates that the petitioner violation of the travel act was a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the petitioner makes a number of.none has merit.
first,he suggests that a violation of the travel act can not be a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance because the travel act covers a myriad of criminal activities,many of them,gambling,bribery.as he sees it,the travel act fundamentally relates to racketeering rather than to drug trafficking indeed,the travel act placement in the united states code so indicates.for this reason,he likens his offense to misprision of a conspiracy to possess an illegal offense that the sixth circuit once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance,see castaneda de esper ins,cir and to the illegal carriage of a firearm during the commission of a offense that the bia once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance notwithstanding that the felony in question was itself,see matter of carrillo,bia.
we do not regard these precedents as persuasive authority here.in the first place,both cases were decided under an earlier version of the ina,a repealed,which was not as sweeping in its definition of a offense as is the current version.the ninth circuit,in refusing to follow castaneda de esper and carrillo on facts very much like those of the case at bar,found this change in the statutory language significant.see johnson ins,cir.we agree.
more petitioners in castaneda de esper and carrillo were both found guilty of violating general statutes that made no specific reference to activity.thus,in castaneda de esper,at,the petitioner was convicted under for having knowledge of a felony and concealing that fact.similarly,in carrillo,at,the petitioner was convicted under c for illegally carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony.in both cases the statute of conviction was a generic statute that did not mention controlled sub
