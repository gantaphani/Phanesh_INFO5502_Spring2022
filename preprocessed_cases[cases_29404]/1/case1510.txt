this case presents the question whether the united states army corps of engineers the corps exceeded its authority under the clean water act cwa when it promulgated nationwide permit nwp,a general permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the united states that allows projects to proceed only after receiving individualized authorization from the corps.we conclude that the corps complied with the cwa when it promulgated nwp.the contrary judgment of the district court is therefore vacated.
the clean water act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the united states without a permit.see a.the army corps of engineers has authority under the cwa to issue two types of permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material individual permits and general permits.the corps issues individual permits under section a on a basis for discharges at specified disposal sites,after providing notice and opportunity for public hearing.id.a.the corps issues general permits,which authorize categories of activities rather than individual projects,under section e.that section provides,in relevant part,that 
the corps may,after notice and opportunity for public hearing,issue general permits on a state,regional,or nationwide basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material if the corps determines that the activities in such category are similar in nature,will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately,and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.any general permit issued under this subsection shall set forth the requirements and standards which shall apply to any activity authorized by such general permit.
pursuant to section e,the corps has promulgated a number of general permits,all but one of which authorize projects that comply with the permits terms to proceed without prior approval by the corps.the exception,nwp authorizes discharges of dredged or fill material associated with surface coal mining and reclamation that projects be individually authorized by the corps.nwp authorizes 
d ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the associated with surface coal mining and reclamation operations provided the coal mining activities are authorized by the doi,office of surface mining osm,or by states with approved programs under title v of the surface mining control and reclamation act of and provided the permittee notifies the district engineer in accordance with the notification general condition.in addition,to be authorized by this nwp,the district engineer must determine that the activity complies with the terms and conditions of the nwp and that the adverse environmental effects are minimal both individually and cumulatively and must notify the project sponsor of this determination in writing.
issuance of nationwide permits.
in this litigation,plaintiffs,a coalition of environmental groups,have raised various challenges to nwp.the district court did not reach most of those challenges,holding simply that nwp is facially invalid under chevron natural resources defense council,d,because it conflicts with the unambiguous meaning of section e.the district court accordingly suspended existing authorizations under nwp and enjoined the corps from issuing further nwp authorizations in the southern district of west virginia.id.at.this appeal followed.
the district court concluded that nwp conflicts with the unambiguous meaning of section e for essentially four reasons.first,it concluded that nwp defines a procedure instead of permitting a category of activities.second,it concluded that section e unambiguously requires determination of minimal impact before,not after,the issuance of a nationwide permit,and that,in violation of this requirement,nwp provides for a post hoc,evaluation of environmental impact.id.third,it concluded that section e unambiguously requires that general permits authorize discharges to proceed without further involvement from the corps,and nwp violates this requirement because it authorizes projects to proceed only after receiving individualized approval from the corps.id.finally,it concluded that nwp violates the statutory requirement that the corps provide notice and opportunity for public hearing before issuing a permit.id.none of these conclusions withstands scrutiny.
at the outset,we note that,while our review of the district court construction of section is de novo,our review of the corps construction of section is governed by the supreme court decision in chevron.under chevron,if the requirements of section are unambiguous,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.however,if section is ambiguous or silent with respect to the questions at issue,we must defer,under chevron,to the corps interpretation of its governing statute,so long as that interpretation is permissible in light of the statutory text and reasonable.asika ashcroft,cir per curiam.
the district court first concluded that nwp fails to comply with section e because it defines a procedure instead of permitting a category of activities.we disagree.nwp plainly authorizes a category of activities.the category of activities authorized by nwp consists of those discharges of dredged or fill material that are associated with surface coal mining and reclamation operations,so long as those operations are authorized by the department of interior or by states with approved programs under the surface mining control and reclamation act of,are preceded by notice to the corps,and are approved by the corps after the corps concludes that the activity complies with the terms of nwp and that its adverse environmental effects are minimal both individually and cumulatively.see.at.
the district court erroneously reasoned that nwp does not authorize a category of activities because it is defined by procedural requirements rather than objective requirements or standards.nwp imposes no limit on the number of linear feet of a stream,for example,that might be impacted by a valley fill or surface impoundment.it does not limit the total acreage of a watershed that might be impacted.as an initial matter,we note that,by virtue of its incorporation of the requirements of the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra,nwp does contain substantive requirements more importantly,nothing in section e or in logic prohibits,much less unambiguously prohibits,the use of procedural,in addition to substantive,parameters to define a category.the district court therefore erred when it concluded that nwp does not define a category of activities.
the district court next concluded that nwp violates the unambiguous terms of section e because it allows the corps to defer the determinations until after issuance of the nationwide permit.the statute unambiguously requires determination of minimal impact before,not after,the issuance of a nationwide permit.section e allows the corps to issue a general permit only if it determines that the activities in the subject category will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately,and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.e.the district court concluded that the corps did not make the required determinations before issuing nwp,but instead opted to make those determinations on a basis after issuance of the permit.
it is clear from the record before us that the corps did make the required determinations before it issued nwp.see id.at stating that the corps determined that nwp will authorize only those activities with minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment,individually or cumulatively.the decision document for nwp and the supplement to that document,set forth at pages of the joint appendix,contain the corps analysis of the anticipated environmental impact of the activities authorized by nwp.id.at this document contains a general assessment of the foreseeable effects of the individual activities authorized by this nwp,the anticipated cumulative effects of those activities,and the potential future losses of waters of the united states that are estimated to occur until the expiration date of the nwp.the corps impact analysis took account of a variety of factors,including public commentators opinions,id.at stating that the corps uses substantive public comments on proposed nwps to assess the expected impacts and considering several suggestions made by public commentators nwp incorporation of smcra requirements,id.at stating that the review required under smcra will ensure that the permit will not authorize activities that affect historic properties,stating that the review required under smcra will ensure that the permit will not authorize activities that will jeopardize any endangered species the nature of the activities authorized by nwp,id.at the activities authorized by this nwp are unlikely to adversely affect salinity gradients,since the nwp authorizes surface coal mining activities that are typically located in inland areas,the nature and scope of the work authorized by the nwp will most likely restrict the extent of the beneficial and detrimental effects to the area immediately surrounding the surface coal mining and reclamation activity.the applicability of a variety of general conditions to nwp,id.at no toxic discharges will be authorized by this nwp.general condition specifically states that the material must be free from toxic pollutants in toxic amounts,general condition requires permittees to avoid and minimize discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the united states to the maximum extent practicable on the project site.and data about usage of previous versions of nwp,id.at estimating,based on usage of previous versions of nwp,that,over the duration of this issuance of nwp,approximately activities could be authorized resulting in impacts to approximately acres of waters of the united states,from february,to february,approximately individual activities were authorized under approximately nwp verifications,impacting approximately acres of riverine and palustrine waters within west virginia.based on the types of activities authorized within west virginia during previous years,the districts anticipate similar use of this nwp in the future.nwp generally does not cause the loss of wetlands in the state of west virginia.based on these considerations and others,the corps concluded that the activities authorized by nwp will not result in significant degradation of the aquatic environment.id.at.this determination was sufficient to meet the requirements of section e.
the district court held that the corps did not satisfy section e because it did not provide an ex ante guarantee that the activities authorized by nwp would have only a minimal impact.the district court reasoned that,under section e,t he issuance of a nationwide permit functions as a guarantee ab initio that every instance of the permitted activity will meet the minimal impact standard,and that,by permitting the corps to engage in post hoc,evaluation of environmental impact,nwp runs afoul of the statutory requirement of initial certainty.id.at.
the district court erred.it is simply not the case that issuance of a general permit functions as a guarantee ab initio that every instance of the permitted activity will have only a minimal impact.neither the phrase guarantee ab initio nor the phrase initial certainty appears in section e.and neither that section nor any other provision of the cwa specifies how the corps must make the determinations,the degree of certainty that must undergird them,or the extent to which the corps may rely on procedures in making them.
for two reasons,we do not believe that an interpretation of section e that would require initial certainty is tenable.first,section e gives the corps authority to revoke or modify a general permit if,after issuing the permit,it determines that the activities authorized by such general permit have an adverse impact on the environment.e.this provision demonstrates that congress anticipated that the corps would make its initial determinations under conditions of uncertainty and that those determinations would therefore sometimes be inaccurate,resulting in general permits that authorize activities with impacts.it also demonstrates that congress expected that the corps would engage in policing of the activities authorized by general permits in order to ensure that their environmental impacts are minimal 
second,it is impossible for the corps ex ante determinations of minimal impact to be anything more than reasoned predictions.even under the paradigmatic general permit envisioned by the district court,where the parameters of the authorized activities are delineated in objective,measurable terms,the corps determinations would necessarily be a forecast only.this is so because the environmental impact of the activities authorized by a general permit depends on factors that,as a practical matter,are outside the corps ability to predict with certainty ex ante.this uncertainty is especially acute when the corps issues a nationwide permit like nwp because the corps must attempt to forecast the environmental effects the authorized activities could have if undertaken anywhere in the country under any set of circumstances.as the intervenors contend,i t is impossible to conceive of a class of discharges that invariably could have no adverse environmental effects,individually or cumulatively.any individual fill,depending on its location,might have more than a minimal adverse effect.it could,for instance,be located at a site that is a critical habitat for an endangered species.moreover,any class of fills could have more than a minimal adverse effect on a cumulative basis,depending on the number and location of the fills.intervenors br.at citation omitted.
given section e recognition of the possibility that activities authorized by a general permit could result in a impact,as well as the impossibility of making an ex ante guarantee that the authorized activities could never result in a impact,we can not agree with the district court conclusion that section e allows the corps to issue general permits only for those activities that will invariably have only minimal effects on the environment.
nor can we agree with the district court implicit conclusion that the corps may not rely on the availability of procedures,such as nwp requirement of individualized authorization,when it makes its determinations.see id.at.the statute is silent on the question whether the corps may make its minimal impact determinations by relying in part on the fact that its procedures will ensure that the authorized projects will have only minimal impacts.we must therefore defer to the corps conclusion that it may do so if that conclusion is permissible in light of the statutory language and is reasonable.it is both.again,nothing in the statute specifies how the corps must make the determinations.and,given the inevitable ex ante uncertainty the corps confronts when issuing a nationwide permit,its reliance on procedures is a reasonable,if not the only possible,way for it to cement its determination that the projects it has authorized will have only minimal environmental impacts 
in concluding that section e permits the corps to rely in part on procedures to make its determinations,we do not suggest that section e permits the corps completely to defer the determinations until after issuance of the permit.we would have substantial doubts about the corps ability to issue a nationwide permit that relied solely on,determinations of minimal impact,with no general determinations.in such a case,the corps determinations would consist of little more than its own promise to obey the law.
apparently,the district court believed that such was the case here.see the category of activities authorized by nwp is nothing more than the collection of activities that the corps determines,during reviews that take place long after the issuance of nwp,will have minimal effects.it is true that the corps acknowledged in its decision document that the pcn and requirements would operate to ensure that nwp adverse effects on the environment would b
