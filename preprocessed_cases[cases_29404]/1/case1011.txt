appellant was a kindergartener during the school year,his first under the supervision of appellee collingswood borough board of education collingswood.he had previously been educated in the camden school system,which had identified him as a special needs student and developed an individualized education plan iep for him.collingswood adopted the camden iep in substantial part,with the consent of mother.in january,filed a due process petition alleging violation of rights under the individuals with disabilities in education act idea.sometime later,she filed a second due process petition expanding the claims.and subsequently moved out of state,at which point the new jersey administrative law judge alj dismissed the pending due process petitions as moot.filed this suit in the district court challenging the alj orders.the parties filed for summary judgment and the district court granted collingswood motion,thereby upholding the alj orders.timely appealed.
we must now resolve three questions whether the move rendered all of claims moot if the claims are not moot,whether summary judgment was nonetheless proper because idea rights were not violated and whether was a prevailing party for purposes of attorneys fees.we hold that the district court erred in determining that the claims were moot and in entering summary judgment.it correctly found that was not a prevailing party entitled to attorneys fees.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand this case to the district court for further factual development.
background 
an african american male with special educational needs,was enrolled in an class in the camden city public schools for the school year.there were fewer than ten students in the class,supervised by four adults.according to the iep generated in camden,he exhibited characteristics consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and oppositional defiant disorder odd.appellant app.although his cognitive abilities were at or above grade level,he had difficulty with integration skills.generally speaking,he experienced problems with hyperactivity,aggression,distractibility,and impulsivity.in camden,had experienced issues with throwing objects,hitting peers,running away,and temper tantrums.once a behavior intervention plan bip was created,his negative behaviors began to diminish.
the iep required an extended school year program esy of at least thirty days,in a behavioral disabilities program with counseling services.this summer program was intended to modify his aggressive and impulsive behaviors before he entered a regular kindergarten with support services in september.the iep specifically noted that would be at high risk for failure in a regular kindergarten without supportive services.
and his family moved to collingswood,a suburb of camden,in september and enrolled in collingswood schools the iep team in collingswood essentially adopted the iep developed in camden.the team consisted of a case manager,regular education teacher,his special education teacher,a psychologist,and declined to have placed in the special education kindergarten because his brother was in that class.it is indisputable that was placed in a regular classroom,with typically developing children and sessions for speech and counseling.had no aide or other supportive services in that regular kindergarten classroom.
although the behavior plan from camden remained part of iep,it was not implemented in collingswood,and he experienced behavioral issues in the early part of the school year.on november,requested that a functional behavior assessment of be performed,in hopes of addressing behavioral issues.collingswood agreed.philip concors,a certified behavior analyst with whom collingswood frequently works,performed the assessment.
on january,collingswood began providing with a aide in the classroom.
initially unrepresented by counsel,filed a due process petition on january.she alleged that collingswood had placed in a regular classroom and had failed to provide the aide until january,in violation of the iep.she also alleged that he had been subject to discipline without consideration of the fact that his behavior was a manifestation of his disability.finally,she asserted that the iep and behavior plan were incomplete because they did not include specific target behaviors,methods,and documentation processes,and because they were not developed from the baseline of a behavior assessment.the petition sought an independent psychiatric evaluation an independent behavioral assessment and a positive behavior intervention plan designed by a consultant who would oversee it compensatory education for the period of time did not have a aide an esy and a requirement that the iep include proper goals and objectives.
by filing the petition,triggered the idea requirement.pursuant to j,the child who is the subject of due process proceedings shall remain in his educational placement until all such proceedings have been completed.approximately a month after the filing of the petition,collingswood conducted an iep meeting at which it implemented a behavior plan based on concors evaluation.the plan specifically approved the use of physical restraints on refused to attend this meeting,although she was part of the iep team.she argued that the requirement mandated continuation of the old iep until the alj held otherwise.
in march,collingswood filed a motion to dismiss the second claim in the petition,which sought an independent psychiatric evaluation and an independent behavioral assessment.collingswood argued that had not requested them before she filed the petition,as she was required to do under new jersey law.collingswood also claimed that it had already agreed to provide them.argues to this court that,although collingswood has repeatedly represented to the alj that it agreed to provide these evaluations at its own expense,using the experts provided by,it stalled for five months.in june,the alj ordered that collingswood pay for the evaluations.
remained in the regular classroom,with an aide,through april.there were numerous incidents involving his behavior,including some in which he was physically aggressive toward other students,his aide,and other adults in the building.appellant app.parents of other students in his class became upset with his presence in the classroom and even organized online to agitate for his removal from the classroom.
toward the close of the school year,the iep team met again and proposed an placement for collingswood sent a letter seeking her authorization to send records to several programs so that those programs could determine whether they would accept him as a student.refused,invoking her rights.
apparently as a result of her frustration with the use of restraints against and his treatment in the classroom,unilaterally decided to keep at home for the last six weeks of the school year.iep required an esy,and collingswood provided with tutoring in a vacant classroom during that summer.it was opinion that this placement violated the iep,which provided that esy be in a classroom.appellant app.
academic year 
began the school year in a regular classroom with a aide.his behavior problems continued.in late august,collingswood filed for emergent relief,seeking a change in status so that it could officially implement the behavior intervention plan that was designed at the february iep meeting and which had,arguably,been in use unofficially in the spring of.in the alternative,collingswood sought to place outside the district and asked that the alj order to authorize the release of records for this purpose.the alj denied this motion without prejudice,as collingswood had failed to include any facts relating to the current school year.
in september,chosen expert,kathleen mccabe odri,completed her functional behavior assessment and his second expert,robertson tucker,completed his psychiatric evaluation.mccabe odri observed at home and in his classroom.she concluded that the overall behavior system is severely inadequate in addressing behavioral and social challenges.appellant app.she recommended particular behavior intervention strategies and suggested that the collingswood staff would benefit from certain training.finally,she concluded that restraints were not recommended for id.at.
tucker recommended a highly structured first grade class which offers support services and a aide providing behavior modification instead of resorting to restraint.id.at.he also indicated that restraints were contraindicated in most situations and that should receive social skills training and counseling in school.
on october,collingswood again sought emergent relief,this time seeking only an placement for.it based the request on a number of fall disruptive incidents,in which behavior escalated to the point that he punched,scratched and hit teachers,hit other students,ran out of classrooms,and ripped up other students work.the alj found that behavior placed him and students around him at risk of harm and therefore ordered that be placed on home instruction until a suitable placement in a highly structured setting with behavioral supports was found.the alj further ordered to cooperate in the process of finding him an placement.
in early december,collingswood informed that the archway school had accepted refused to send to archway without a new iep and stated that she would not cooperate in the development of a new iep until ordered by the alj to do so.was still on home instruction in february,when indicated at a hearing that she would prefer that be placed at the cherrywood school,run by mccabe odri.cherrywood was primarily a school for autistic,and the district argued that it was not an appropriate placement.cherrywood staff submitted an affidavit describing the collingwood staff tour of cherrywood,at which plescia,head of special education for collingswood,allegedly referred to as a predator,the devil,street smart,and highly aggressive.appellant app.
the parties failed to agree on a placement,and,on april,the alj entered an order finding archway to be the appropriate placement and changing to place him there.id.at.appealed and did not send to archway.
conclusion of the case before the alj 
on july,counsel advised collingswood that and had moved to georgia and that they would be withdrawing all claims except those for compensatory education.
on july,filed a second petition for due process nearly identical to the first except that it sought,as its sole relief,compensatory education for the period of time collingswood failed to provide a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment.appellant app.this represented an expansion from the initial petition,which had sought compensatory education only for the time period before the aide was initially provided.this petition also alleged that restraints had been improperly used on collingswood filed a notice of insufficiency,alleging that had failed to plead specific issues,relevant facts,and relief sought with regard to the restraints.the alj entered an order dismissing the new petition for insufficiency on july,the same day on which he was made aware that had moved out of state.
on august,the alj issued an order dismissing all remaining claims and closing the case.appellant app.had conceded that the move rendered moot all the claims except those for compensatory education.the alj,however,denied the motion to amend the petition to expand the compensatory education claim,finding both undue delay and mootness the alj then dismissed both pending petitions one filed by and one by collingswood as moot.
district court proceedings 
originally filed a complaint in the district court on february,appealing the november order of the alj that placed him on home instruction.the district court case proceeded in tandem with the case before the alj throughout the spring and summer.after amended the complaint several times,the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court granted collingswood summary judgment motion and entered judgment in its favor.engaging in plenary review of the alj decision,while giving due weight to the alj factual findings,the district court held that the present dispute ha d been rendered moot by move from new jersey to georgia.d.collingswood pub,d.it noted that all compensatory education claims are rendered moot by a child move out of a school district.however,several of the orders on appeal concerned the appropriate placement for,and one concerned use of restraints against him.the court found itself unable to award relief if it held in favor on these issues,particularly in the form of compensatory education.
with regard to the remaining order on appeal,the august dismissal for mootness,the district court found that it was also without power to award compensatory education as relief.because had voluntarily moved to georgia,that state had necessarily assumed the obligation to evaluate educational needs as they currently exist and provide him with a fape and any necessary special education services.id.in a footnote,the court also held that claim for compensatory education for the period of time he was not provided a aide also fails on the merits because collingswood did not deny him a fape during that period.id.at.essentially,it found that the iep never required a aide and that collingswood acted swiftly to remediate the situation once it was discovered.it did not address the other denials of fape alleged.
finally,the court declined to award attorneys fees to on the basis of prevailing party status.it found that there was no causal connection between the filing of the petition and collingswood provision of the independent assessments,as had not properly requested these assessments before filing for due process.id.at.
filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.analysis 
argues that his move to georgia did not render moot his claims for compensatory education,as the district court determined.
compensatory education is a remedy that has received the imprimatur of this court.lester gilhool,cir.the idea grants a district court reviewing an idea claim the authority to grant whatever relief it determines is appropriate.i.the supreme court has held that if parents have paid for a disabled child education because the public schools were failing to provide fape,reimbursement of this tuition constitutes appropriate relief sch.comm.of burlington dep t of,the court found that any other result would render the child right to a free appropriate public education,the parents right to participate fully in developing a proper iep,and all of the procedural safeguards less than complete.id.since this could not have been congress intent,the court was confident that congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case.id.
in miener ex rel.miener state of missouri,the eighth circuit extended this rationale to countenance the award of compensatory educational services,that is,those educational services that a special needs student ought to have received during the period of time that fape was not provided.cir.as in the case of the reimbursement remedy approved in burlington,the court found that imposing liability for compensatory educational services on the defendants merely requires them to belatedly pay expenses that they should have paid all along.id.at quoting burlington,at.as for the policy goals of the idea,the court was confident that congress did not intend the child entitlement to a free education to turn upon her parent ability to front its costs.id.at.
we adopted these conclusions in lester gilhool,at.we concluded that congress,by allowing the courts to fashion an appropriate remedy to cure the deprivation of a child right to a free appropriate public education,did not intend to offer a remedy only to those parents able to afford an alternative private education.id.at.
acknowledging that compensatory education was a potentially valid remedy,the district court nonetheless determined that claims were moot.d at.because the judicial power extends only to cases and,const.art.iii,a claim is moot if no such case or controversy exists.t he requirement that an action involve a live case or controversy extends through all phases of litigation cnty.of morris nationalist movement,cir.accordingly,if developments occur during the course of adjudication that eliminate a plaintiffs personal stake in the outcome of a suit or prevent a court from being able to grant the requested relief,the case must be dismissed as moot.id.quoting blanciak allegheny ludlum,cir.
admittedly,c ase law in this circuit addressing the effect of moving out of a school district during the course of litigation for compensatory education is spotty.east orange bd.of,wl,at.we have not squarely addressed the question,and we certainly have not done so in the context of an move.we have,however,stated that compensatory education is an equitable remedy that compensates a special needs student for rights the district already denied him.lester,at.thus,several district courts within this circuit have held that an move does not render claims for compensatory education moot,wl,at granting compensatory education to student who had moved to adjacent school district while explicitly limiting ruling to instate move situation neshaminy sch.dist.karla,wl,at,finding compensatory education claim not mooted by move.the eighth circuit also has held that an move does not moot a claim for compensatory education.indep.sch.dist.ex rel,cir.
the district court,like the alj,relied heavily on the one district court decision within the third circuit that holds that a compensatory education claim is rendered moot by a move out of state.in old bridge twp.bd.of,wl,the court dismissed claim as moot.however,it focused on the fact that sought prospective relief,which would be impossible to grant.id.at.had originally sought only a revised iep,and only in response to the motion to dismiss for mootness did he seek to amend his prayer for relief to ask for reimbursement of the costs of hiring a life coach.id.the court did specifically address the question of compensatory education,and it found that,given the move out of state and the fact that parents had not fronted money for his education while he lived in new jersey,plaintiffs own actions have made any relief,including an award of compensatory education,impossible.id.at sic.
an unpublished decision of the district court,is neither persuasive nor binding.continuity of residence can not be prerequisite to the grant of compensatory education.as the neshaminy court noted,a rule that rendered idea claims for compensatory education moot upon a move out of district would allow a school district to simply stop providing required services to a student with the underlying motive of inducing this student to move from the district,thus removing any future obligation under idea which the district may owe to the student,and thereby frustrating the purpose of the idea.neshaminy sch,wl,at.we find this rationale indisputably persuasive.
the idea works because each school district bears the obligation to educate special needs students,often at substantial cost.see lauren ex rel.jean deflaminis,cir it is undisputed that the district is the local education agency responsible for providing a fape to the student.to comply with the idea,a school district no longer responsible for educating a child must still be held responsible for its past transgressions.were we to uphold the district court ruling,we would create an enormous loophole in that obligation and thereby substantially weaken the idea protections.we therefore hold that a claim for compensatory education is not rendered moot by an move,even if that move takes the child out of state.
ruling otherwise would particularly impact lowincome special needs students.because compensatory education is at issue only when tuition reimbursement is not,it is implicated only where parents could not afford to front the costs of a child education.see miener,at.accordingly,families,disproportionately likely to have a disabled child,would be particularly burdened by a holding that compensatory education can not be obtained after a move.see dep t of,office of special educ.and rehab,annual report to cong.on the implementation of the individuals with disabilities education act vol,available at sec.we can not reward school districts who fail to provide fape to special education students until those students move.
the district court asserted that,apparently because moved out of state,georgia has necessarily assumed the obligation to evaluate educational needs as they currently exist and provide him with a fape and any necessary special education services.d at.as a result,compensatory educational services are subsumed within the education he is currently receiving from georgia,and the court can grant him no effective relief.id.
this subsumption theory is incompatible with the very notion of compensatory education as a remedy based on past harms and it is therefore not supported by our case law see lester,at noting compensatory education is a remedy for rights already denied to a special needs student.we must therefore reject the contention propounded by collingswood at oral argument that compensatory education would remain available to had he transferred to a private school or begun home schooling,but that his transfer to another public school district with its own idea obligations renders his claim moot.
further,the district court erred in concluding that there was no compensatory education that collingswood could provide once lived in georgia.one accepted form of compensatory education relief is the establishment of a fund to be spent on the child education,which collingswood would certainly be able to provide if fape was found to have been denied.see,ferren,f d upholding compensatory education fund as appropriate under idea heather northampton area sch,d,utilizing fund as compensatory education remedy.further,we have noted that there is no case law from our sister circuits that supports the argument that a court power to grant equitable relief under the idea is simply limited to monetary awards.ferren c,at.
appropriate remedies under the idea are determined on a basis.in each case,a court will evaluate the specific type of relief that is appropriate to ensure that a student is fully compensated for a school district past violations of his or her rights under the idea and develop an appropriate equitable award.id at.the district court also could have ordered collingswood to pay new district or to contract with a local provider in his new home in order to provide tutoring,counseling,or other support services.see pihl.dep of,cir noting that compensatory education can take many forms,including tutoring and summer school.as collingswood conceded at oral argument,such contracting is a regular part of the resolution of idea claims.
because the very purpose of the idea would be undermined by a contrary holding,we find that the district court erred in asserting that claims for compensatory education were rendered moot when he moved to another state.of course,we do not intend to restrict the potential forms of compensatory education to those discussed above.indeed,we encourage the district court to consider any form of compensatory education proposed.
denial of fape 
because we find that claims were not rendered moot by his move out of state,we turn next to collingswood argument in the alternative,that is not entitled to compensa
