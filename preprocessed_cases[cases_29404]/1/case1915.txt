discussion 
standard of review 
whether the sec application to the district court for enforcement of its order is authorized under exchange act e,precluded by f,f,or barred by the statute of limitations in,is a question of statutory interpretation that this court reviews de novo see united states wagner,cir.
ii.exchange act e authorizes the sec to apply for enforcement of its orders 
statutory framework 
the nasd is a,national securities association registered with the sec.the sec exercises broad supervisory authority over the nasd,but the nasd is responsible for enforcing securities laws and its own conduct rules against its member companies and their employees.b.any person or company subject to nasd disciplinary action may seek review with the sec pursuant to exchange act d.d.in turn,any person aggrieved by an sec order may appeal to the appropriate united states court of appeals.a.
in addition to serving an appellate role over nasd actions,the sec may also directly enforce national securities laws and nasd rules by filing complaints against alleged violators in district court pursuant to exchange act d,d.in pertinent part,d provides that 
w henever it shall appear to the sec that any person is engaged or is about to engage in acts or practices constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter,the rules or regulations thereunder,the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district court to enjoin such acts or practices,and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.
the sec may pursue both injunctive relief and civil monetary penalties.id.the sec may also seek a mandamus in a district court to enforce the exchange act and the rules and orders issued thereunder.exchange act e,e.more specifically,
u pon application of the sec the district courts shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus,injunctions,and orders commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this title,the rules,regulations,and orders thereunder,or the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member 
e.the sec authority under exchange act e is constrained by provisions in f,f.the sec may not 
bring any action pursuant to subsection d or e of this section against any person for violation of,or to command compliance with,the rules of a organization unless it appears to the sec that such organization is unable or unwilling to take appropriate action against such person in the public interest and for the protection of investors,or such action is otherwise necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
the plain language of exchange act e authorizes the sec to seek judicial enforcement of all orders 
defendant contends that exchange act e does not empower the sec to seek enforcement of the nasd order of january,because e empowers the sec to enforce orders issued only in connection with its direct enforcement activities and not orders issued in connection with its appellate authority over the nasd under exchange act.he argues that the sec has separate and distinct roles under exchange act and.section d authorizes the sec to serve an appellate role over nasd disciplinary actions,while d empowers the sec to directly enforce national securities laws and nasd rules.defendant maintains that e does not authorize the sec to seek enforcement of orders issued pursuant to the sec appellate role under because the mandamus provision of e is structurally separate from the sec appellate powers.defendant contends that congress empowered the sec to seek mandamus for enforcement of its orders under e,but did not include a similar provision in.defendant maintains that the court should interpret the exchange act as precluding the sec from seeking a mandamus in a district court for enforcement of orders issued pursuant to its appellate authority under,in accordance with the maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.
the court finds that defendant contentions are unpersuasive because they ignore the plain language of exchange act e and seek to create a structural separation in the exchange act which simply does not exist.exchange act e expressly empowers the sec to solicit writs of mandamus,injunctions,and orders commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this title,the rules,regulations,and orders thereunder or the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member.e emphasis added.the reference to this title in this provision implicates the entire exchange act,and permits the sec to apply to the district court for enforcement of orders issued pursuant to any section in the exchange act,not just direct enforcement activities under.therefore,exchange act e simply does not differentiate between orders issued under and orders issued under.
three circuit courts of appeals have had the opportunity to rule on the use of exchange act e to enforce sec orders which affirm nasd disciplinary rulings,and all three courts have held that the sec may use e for applications to enforce orders originally issued pursuant to the sec appellate authority under.see sec vittor,cir w e conclude that the sec order sustaining the nasd disciplinary sanctions was unquestionably an order enforceable under e.sec mccarthy,cir the sec does not lose standing to enforce its orders in district court simply because it fulfills an appellate function,rather than one of direct enforcement or regulation,in making such an order.lang french,cir inasmuch as
