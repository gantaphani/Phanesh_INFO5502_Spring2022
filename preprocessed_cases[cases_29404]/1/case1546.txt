libby bianco petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia affirmance of a final order of removal.bianco contends the bia improperly searched outside the records of her prior state court conviction to determine she had committed a crime of domestic violence under a e i.the petition is denied.
statement of facts 
bianco is a citizen of venezuela who was first admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant in.she became a lawful permanent resident on january.
on november,the department of homeland security department filed a notice to appear for bianco.it alleged that her admission a term we will the united states occurred in when she became,conditionally,a lawful permanent resident.it also alleged that on october,she was convicted in pennsylvania of aggravated assault and possessing an instrument of crime,something made or adapted for criminal use,with intent to employ it criminally.see.a.bianco was charged with removability as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.see a a i i.
in a hearing before an immigration judge ij,bianco admitted her nationality and citizenship but denied the other factual allegations in the notice to appear.she also denied the charge of removability.the department submitted evidence that she had been convicted in pennsylvania state court of aggravated assault for stabbing mark bianco in april.libby bianco would be removable if she committed a crime of moral turpitude within five years after the date of admission.id.the ij determined that because the aggravated assault was committed within five years of the date of bianco adjustment of status in,she was removable as charged.
on appeal,the bia applied a decision of this court that an adjustment of status by an alien who was previously admitted as a nonimmigrant is not an admission under the immigration laws.martinez mukasey,cir.because there was no evidence in the record concerning the date of bianco admission for purposes of the statutory period,the bia remanded for the ij to determine the date of bianco admission.
perhaps aware that the requirement for removal based on a crime of moral turpitude could not be met,on remand the department filed a second charge of removability.newly alleged was that bianco was removable as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence after admission,which does not have the limitation.see a e i.evidence that the victim of bianco assault was her husband derived from records of the pennsylvania proceedings,and included the police criminal complaint and an affidavit of probable cause.
the ij found on remand that bianco had been admitted on february.the aggravated assault was committed in april,more than five years after her admission.therefore,the crime of moral turpitude was too dated to use as a basis for removal.
the ij then rejected bianco argument that the department could not file supplemental charges after a remand from the bia.the ij also held that the department met its burden to prove bianco was convicted of aggravated assault,a crime that satisfied the definition of a crime of violence under a.the record was found to contain sufficient evidence that bianco crime was committed against her spouse,even though the victim being her husband was not an element of the offense.the ij held that evidence from outside the record of the criminal proceeding could be used to determine the relationship between bianco and her victim.consequently,the ij ordered bianco removed for having committed a crime of domestic violence.
the bia affirmed.bianco now seeks reversal.
ii.discussion 
the only issues on appeal are legal ones.we review the bia conclusions of law de novo.zhu gonzales,cir.
bianco alleges two points of error in the bia dismissal of her appeal.first,she contends the bia erred in concluding that her conviction for aggravated assault constituted a crime of domestic violence pursuant to section a e i.she complains the bia either should have limited its review to the statutory elements of her prior conviction or,at most,to a small category of evidence that would not include the affidavit of probable cause and the criminal complaint.to be clear,bianco does not deny that her husband was the victim of the assault.the issue is whether proof of the domestic relationship must appear in certain limited records of the conviction.
in her second point of error,bianco insists that the department ought not have been permitted to lodge an additional charge after the case was remanded by the bia.we now consider the arguments in that order.
evidence used to determine the domestic nature of her crime 
bianco argues that the evidence used to prove her marriage to the victim of her assault was inadmissible.she urges us to apply to this fact issue the principle that evidence supporting the details of a prior conviction must in some circumstances come solely from the statute of conviction or,if the statute contains multiple offenses,from certain other documents contained in the record of the conviction.see gonzales,cir.the categorical approach of examining only the statute of conviction,and the modified categorical approach of looking at a limited set of documents apart from the conviction itself,apply in several contexts when a prior conviction has relevance to a current order against the individual.id.
we have applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether a prior offense committed by an alien was a crime involving moral turpitude.amouzadeh winfrey,cir.we wrote that our search is for the inherent nature of the crime,as defined in the statute rather than the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.id.quoting okabe ins,cir.when the statute of conviction has discrete subsections,some involving crimes of moral turpitude and others not,we look at the record of conviction to determine which subsection applied.id.appropriate documents to examine include the charging document such as an indictment,a written plea agreement,a plea colloquy transcript,and any factual finding explicitly made by the trial judge and assented to by the defendant.nolos holder,cir.these limitations are drawn from supreme court authority that applied the armed career criminal act.shepard united states,applying e.to prove the nature of a prior relevant conviction under that act,the court permitted introduction only of the records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction,as such documents avoid on the issues and satisfy concerns that the relevant facts have been found by a jury or were confirmed by the defendant.id.at 
bianco argues the same limited evidence must be the source of any proof that her conviction was for domestic violence.the immigration statute in question provides that an alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence is deportable.a e i.the statute also defines crime of domestic violence to be 
any crime of violence as defined in section of title against a person committed by a current or former spouse of the person,by an individual with whom the person shares a child in common,by an individual who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the person as a spouse,by an individual similarly situated to a spouse of the person under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction where the offense occurs 
bianco does not challenge that her aggravated assault conviction is a crime of violence.she does argue,though,that because nothing in the record of conviction identifies the victim as her husband,the offense can not qualify for these purposes as one of domestic violence.
the pennsylvania statute under which bianco was convicted provided seven alternative methods by which the offense could be committed.a.bianco was charged under subsection,which provides that a person who attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon is guilty of aggravated assault.id.at a.this subsection was cited in the charging instrument,and the charge itself tracked the statutory language.focusing on the specific relevant elements of this pennsylvania statute does not bring into view any required dom
