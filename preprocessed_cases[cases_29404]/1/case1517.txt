this case presents the issue of whether the individuals with disabilities education act idea requires an educational agency to include in its procedural safeguards notice,mandated by west,an explicit statement that parents in virginia have a period in which to request a due process hearing and to indicate when that period begins to run.because we find that requirement neither explicit in the idea or its implementing regulations,nor required by the policy and spirit of the idea,we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss.
is an child who lives in fairfax county,virginia,and has been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder on october,fairfax county public school board fairfax county found eligible for special education services.from november,through the end of the school year in,attended a,for autistic children at greenbriar east elementary school.
in june,fairfax county proposed an individualized education program iep for that continued the,program,adding only limited supplemental speech,language,and occupational instruction,father,was not satisfied with the iep and requested that fairfax county provide with intensive applied behavioral analysis training,an alternative educational method for autistic children.fairfax county refused to incorporate educational ideas and,by letter dated july,rejected the proposed iep.on july,fairfax county responded,explaining why it had refused request for accommodation,and provided with a notice of his right to appeal its decision,by requesting a due process hearing or an administrative appeal,along with a pamphlet outlining the procedural remedies available to parents who disagree with iep decisions under the idea.although the letter went into detail about procedural rights,neither it nor the enclosed pamphlet informed of any limitations period that might be applied to right to request a due process hearing or when that limitations period would begin.
by letter dated august,withdrew from the fairfax county public schools because fairfax county refused to agree to his proposals.further informed fairfax county that he would continue to pursue all appropriate and legal means at his disposal to seek the compliance of fairfax county with the law with respect to his son education.at.on august,fairfax county replied to letter,reminding him that he had the right to appeal the contents of the iep either through an administrative review or an impartial due process hearing and enclosing a second copy of the procedural safeguards required by the idea.at.this letter also did not notify of any applicable limitations period.did not immediately request a due process hearing or an administrative review but simply enrolled in a private school program for autistic children,paying for it himself.
on january,over months after rejected fairfax county proposed iep and removed from the fairfax county public schools,filed a request for a due process hearing,requesting reimbursement for private tuition expenses.fairfax county moved to dismiss request as under virginia limitations period,ann.michie,and under the doctrine of laches,in response,argued that fairfax county could not rely on the limitations period because fairfax county failed to notify of the limitations period and,alternatively,that claim did not accrue until the summer of when actually paid for private educational expenses.the administrative hearing officer agreed with fairfax county,holding that fairfax county had provided with a full explanation of his procedural rights under the idea and that fairfax county was not required under the idea to notify of the limitations period applicable to due process hearings.the hearing officer further held that claim accrued by august of,because that is when had knowledge of the events that formed the basis of his claim,and thus that request for a due process hearing was under virginia limitations period.
on january,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court for the eastern district of virginia challenging the hearing officer decision,arguing that his claims for tuition reimbursement were not because fairfax county failed to notify him of the applicable limitations period count i,and that his claims were not because they did not accrue until he had fully paid the private educational costs count ii.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment to,reversing the hearing officer on count i,and holding that the limitations period was equitably tolled by fairfax county failure to provide notice of the limitations period pursuant to the idea implicit requirement that educational agencies give notice of all applicable limitations periods.ex rel.fairfax county school,d.given its disposition of count i,the district court found count ii to be moot.id.at.fairfax county timely noted its appeal.
fairfax county contends that the district court erred because the text of the idea does not mandate that educational agencies give notice of the limitations period for requesting a due process hearing or its accrual date and the fourth circuit has already held that the idea does not require educational agencies to provide notice of the applicable limitations period when that time frame is longer than four months.responds that the district court correctly held that the idea implicitly requires notice to ensure that parents have a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
it is important to note that the idea itself contains no limitations period for requesting due process hearings at the time the idea was enacted,if a federal statute created a cause of action but provided no limitations period,the general rule wa s that a state limitations period for an analogous cause of action is borrowed and applied to the federal claim,provided that the application of the state statute would not be inconsistent with underlying federal policies.county of oneida oneida indian nation,d.in schimmel ex rel.schimmel spillane,cir,we analyzed analogous limitations periods in virginia and held that the then limitations period in was consistent with idea policies and that it applied in the context of civil actions filed by parties aggrieved by due process hearing decisions.we later held in manning ex rel.manning fairfax county sch,cir,that the same limitations period was consistent with idea policies in the context of requests for due process hearings while we have decided the question of which limitations period to apply,we recognized in ex rel.em bd.of ed.of henderson county,cir,that we had not decided the issue presented in this case whether the idea requires educational agencies to inform parents of the applicable limitations period,id.at.in this case,the district court resolved that issue in the affirmative.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.gadsby ex rel.gadsby grasmick,cir.summary judgment should be granted if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.the facts in this case are not in dispute.thus,the sole legal issue is whether the idea and its implementing regulations require educational agencies in virginia to provide notice of the limitations period applicable to requests for a due process hearing.as explained below,we believe that the district court erred in concluding that it does.
to determine whether the idea or its implementing regulations require that notice be given of a limitations period applicable to a due process hearing,we begin,as we must,with the text.united states ron pair enters,d when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.citation and quotation marks omitted.only if the text of the statute is ambiguous or if the statutory scheme is inconsistent or incoherent need we inquire further.robinson shell oil,d our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.quoting ron pair,at.if a statute is ambiguous,the question for the court is whether the implementing regulation is based on
