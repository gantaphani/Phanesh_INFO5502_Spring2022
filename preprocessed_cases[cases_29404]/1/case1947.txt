ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the defendants interlocutory appeal.sample bailey,cir.appellate courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals only from final decisions of district courts.johnson jones,d citing.i nterlocutory before the end of district court the exception,not the rule.id.the supreme court has held that certain collateral orders amount to final decisions immediately appealable under the statute,even though the district court may have entered those orders before perhaps long before the case has ended.id.at.quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.
the supreme court recently addressed the doctrine in will hallock,d.will involved the question of whether a refusal to apply the judgment bar of the federal tort claims act is open to collateral appeal.id.at.the court held that the judgment bar is not open to collateral appeal,in so holding,the court emphasized the modest scope of the doctrine,id.at.the opinion explains 
since only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify,then,as orders that can not be reviewed effectively after a conventional final judgment,the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under cohen and as digital equipment explained,that something further boils down to a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.
id.at quoting digital equip.desktop direct,d.will established the following rule it is not mere avoidance of a trial,but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest,that counts when asking whether an order is effectively unreviewable if review is to be left until later.id.at emphasis added.the court provided examples of orders that are immediately appealable,including orders rejecting absolute immunity,nixon fitzgerald,d,and qualified immunity,mitchell forsyth,d.id.at.we therefore have jurisdiction to review the defendants claims of qualified immunity pursuant to both mitchell and will because we hold that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,we do not address the question of our jurisdiction as to the defendants claims.
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of defendant s claims that they are entitled to absolute or qualified immunity de novo,as that issue is a question of law.spurlock satterfield,cir.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the district court treated the defendants claim as a motion for summary judgment.in reviewing the district court denial of a motion for summary judgment,we mak e all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party to determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists.ireland tunis,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting pusey city of youngstown,cir.
qualified immunity 
t he supreme court has held that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.dickerson mcclellan,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.the central purpose of affording public officials qualified immunity from suit is to protect them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.id.quoting elder holloway,d internal quotation marks omitted.we employ a test in reviewing claims for qualified immunity 
first,we determine whether,based upon the applicable law,the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff show that a constitutional violation has occurred.second,we consider whether the violation involved a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known.third,we determine whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.
sample,at quoting feathers aey,cir alteration in original.we address each of the defendants arguments regarding qualified immunity in turn below.
summers leis 
the defendants first assert that the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the basis of a perceived factual dispute such a holding,they claim,is impermissible in light of our decision in summers leis,cir.appellants br.at.in summers,the district court denied the defendant summary judgment motion because it believed that any decision regarding qualified immunity was premature and should await the close of discovery.id.at.however,the plaintiff failed adequately to assert his need for further discovery,as required by federal rule of civil procedure f.id.we held,i n the absence of a sufficient affidavit,there is no justification for the district court determination that a motion for summary judgment would be premature until the close of discovery.id.
barnes responds that summers is inapplicable to this case because the district court did in fact address the merits of the defendants claims.appellee br.at.we agree.the district court denied the motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity on the basis of disputed issues of fact it did not,however,decline to address the claims as in summers.as we explained above,we may review the legal question of whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,notwithstanding that the district court denied summary judgment to the defendants on the basis that there are disputed issues of fact.
malicious arrest 
barnes asserts a claim with regard to the offense of interfering with a conservation officer.appellee br.at.we recognize a separate constitutionally cognizable claim of malicious prosecution under the fourth amendment.thacker city of columbus,cir.such a claim encompasses wrongful investigation,prosecution,conviction,and incarceration.id.at citing spurlock,at.although this court has yet to resolve the elements of a federal malicious prosecution claim,it is clear that a plaintiff must show,at a minimum,that there was no probable cause to justify his arrest and prosecution.id.at alteration in original.the relevant kentucky statute provides as follows no person shall resist,obstruct,interfere with or threaten or attempt to intimidate or in any other manner interfere with any officer in the discharge of his duties under the provisions of this chapter.stat.ann.barnes states that there was no testimony provided to support the officer s false assertion barnes interfered with their duties.appellee br.at.
barnes claim must fail,however,b ecause he can not show the absence of probable cause.thacker,at.he does not dispute that the grand jury indicted him on the charge of interfering with a conservation officer,at indictment rather,he claims that the defendants misled the grand jury,which led to his improper arrest,appellee br.at.however,it has been long settled that the finding of an indictment,fair upon its face,by a properly constituted grand jury,conclusively determines the existence of probable cause for the purpose of holding the accused to answer.higgason stephens,cir.therefore,because barnes was indicted pursuant to a determination made by the grand jury,he has no basis for his constitutional claim.id.
in addition to the preclusive effect of the indictment,a review of the facts of the case also demonstrates that the defendants had probable cause to seek an indictment against barnes.although barnes was acquitted of the charge of interfering with the duties of a conservation officer,he was convicted of wanton endangerment pursuant to kentucky revised statute.section states,a person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the second degree when he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of physical injury to another person.the jury instructions given in barnes criminal trial state 
y ou will find the defendant guilty of wanton endangerment under this instruction if,and only if,you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt all of the following 
a.that in this county on or about september,and within months before the finding of the indictment herein,he pointed a firearm at officer tony wright and 
b.that he thereby wantonly created a substantial danger of physical injury to officer tony wright.
at jury instructions.because the jury found barnes guilty of wanton endangerment according to this instruction he may not obtain relief pursuant to if such relief would imply the invalidity of this conviction.heck humphrey,d given this,we must accept that barnes did point his gun at the officers and that he did create a danger to them in doing so.pointing a gun at an officer in a manner that creates a substantial danger of injury clearly establishes probable cause for the charge of threatening or attempting to intimidate an officer in violation of we therefore reverse the district court denial of qualified immunity as to barnes claim of malicious prosecution.
first amendment retaliation 
barnes asserts that because the defendants sought his indictment and arrest in retaliation for his criticism of them,their conduct violated his first amendment rights.as a general principle,t here can be no doubt that the freedom to express disagreement with state action,without fear of reprisal based on the expression,is unequivocally among the protections provided by the first amendment.mccurdy montgomery county,cir.the freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.city of houston hill,d.the defendants do not contest the right to express such disagreement they claim,though,that barnes
