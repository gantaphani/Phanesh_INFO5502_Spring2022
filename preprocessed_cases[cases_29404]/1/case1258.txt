opinion of the court 
james barbera barbera petitions for review of final orders of the united states department of labor benefits review board the board affirming in part and reversing in part orders of administrative law judge edith barnett alj barnett and affirming orders of administrative law judge linda chapman alj chapman petitioner makes two claims.first,he claims that the board erred in affirming alj barnett denial of a de minimis award under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the lhwca,et,where alj barnett found proof of petitioner present medical disability and a reasonable expectation of future loss of capacity.second,he claims that,a absent a finding of abuse of discretion,the board erred in reversing alj barnett award of attorney fees to petitioner counsel,and b the board further erred in subsequently affirming alj chapman significant reduction in counsel hourly rates.petitioner specifically alleges that the board erroneously departed from its proper standard of administrative review.
because we conclude that,on the findings made by alj barnett and supported by substantial evidence,and on the law as pronounced by the supreme court in metropolitan stevedore rambo,d,petitioner was clearly entitled to a de minimis award,we will reverse the board and remand for determination of that award.further,because we conclude that alj barnett award of attorney fees was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law,and that the board was therefore without authority to disturb that award,we will reverse the board and reinstate alj barnett award of attorney fees.
the basic facts are not in dispute.petitioner employment as a maintenance manager for global terminal container services,global required him to inspect and estimate damage on shipping containers by climbing stacked containers and securing access through heavy container doors sometimes corroded by rust.on april,while attempting to force open the doors to a stacked container,petitioner suffered an accident at global pier in jersey city,new jersey.as a result of this accident,he sustained a disabling herniation to his lower back.because he was unable to continue his previous employment due to his disability,petitioner sought and found employment as a surveyor with china ocean shipping company in charleston,south carolina.petitioner orthopedic surgeon concluded that petitioner injury required a marked restriction of activities and that further spinal degeneration and progression of symptomology were inevitable 
petitioner sued for workers compensation pursuant to the and his employer,global,challenged jurisdiction and petitioner right to compensation.on february,following a hearing and a complete review of petitioner medical record,alj barnett found that a petitioner met the status and situs requirements for jurisdiction under the lhwca,and b petitioner had been temporarily totally disabled for a period of several months and had sustained a permanent partial disability.accordingly,she awarded petitioner medical benefits under the lhwca.alj barnett did not,however,award any compensation for lost wage earning capacity because petitioner was then employed in another position for wages comparable to his earnings.as more fully explained in her supplemental decision and order of april,despite her finding that petitioner serious back condition was likely to deteriorate and m ight cause loss of wage earning capacity in the future and despite her awareness that s ubstantial authority does exist for de minimis awards where,as here,there is proof of a present medical disability and a reasonable expectation of future loss of capacity because this circuit had not considered the issue,alj barnett felt compelled to follow the board policy of disfavoring any de minimis award 
on the issue of petitioner attorney fees,alj barnett directed counsel to submit a fully documented fee application.in her supplemental decision and order she admonished the employer counsel for requiring petitioner to litigate every jurisdiction,which should not have been for turning the motions for fee awards into a second major litigation.after a complete review of the attorney fee application,alj barnett found that petitioner prevailed on jurisdiction,disability,and the award of medical benefits she also observed that a party can not litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by opposing counsel in response.in a second supplemental decision and order issued on may,alj barnett ordered the employer to pay directly to petitioner counsel the sum of in fees and costs for his successful representation of petitioner and in fees and costs for defending his fee application.
both the denial of a de minimis award and the award of attorney fees were timely appealed and considered together.on february,the board issued a decision and order in which it acknowledged that de minimis awards are appropriate where a claimant has established a significant possibility of future economic harm as a result of the injury but reasoned that a s alj barnett determination that claimant did not establish a significant possibility of future economic harm is supported by substantial evidence,it would affirm the denial of a de minimis award.on the issue of attorney fees,the board held that alj barnett erred in failing to apply the supreme court holding in hensley eckerhart,d,requiring that an attorney fee award be commensurate with the degree of success obtained in the case.the board concluded that although alj barnett cited hensley,she did not apply its holding in awarding an attorney fee in excess of.the board therefore vacated that award and remanded and reassigned the case to alj with directions to adjust the fee award after taking into account the limited results obtained in this case,specifically that only medical benefits,but no disability benefits,were awarded.
twenty months later,in october,alj chapman found that the number of hours reflected in the fee petition was reasonable,but reduced the hourly rates by for lack of evidentiary justification that they were the prevailing rates for similar legal work in the area.she further reduced the lodestar figure by in accordance with her conclusion that the award of future medical benefits represented no more than of the relief requested.upon motion for reconsideration submitting evidence that the rates awarded by alj barnett were the prevailing rates for attorneys with comparable experience,and challenging the reduction in the degree of success to,alj chapman denied that motion but changed the rationale for her reduction in the rates.she concluded that a the rates were nonetheless unreasonable because the amount of time charged by counsel to this matter strongly suggested to alj chapman that counsel lacked expertise and b because alj barnett refusal to grant a de minimis award indicate d that she did not view the possibility of future economic harm to be significant enough to overcome the board disfavor of such awards,counsel had achieved a relatively small portion of the relief requested 
on january,the board affirmed alj chapman fee reductions,holding that petitioner failed to show any abuse of discretion and that petitioner primary claim for compensation had been denied at this time,the board was also asked to revisit its denial of a de minimis award in light of the supreme court decision in metropolitan stevedore rambo,d in a footnote,the board replied that 
even though the board did not rely on the supreme court rambo decision,which had not yet been issued,the board used the significant possibility of future economic harm standard of the underlying ninth circuit decision which is consistent with the standard used by the supreme court in its decision.while judge barnett denial of a de minimis award may have been based on a determination that the third circuit did not speak on the issue and the board did not favor such awards,the board,in affirming,relied on correct law.
decision and order of the board,january.
we exercise plenary review over the board interpretation of law and we also exercise plenary review to satisfy ourselves t
