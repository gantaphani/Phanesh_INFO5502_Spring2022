background 
unless otherwise noted,the following facts are undisputed.briggs has worked in michigan for the postal service in a variety of positions since.joint appendix at briggs dep.at.briggs began working on environmental issues in december,when he was promoted to the position of district environmental compliance coordinator decc in grand rapids,michigan.as a decc,briggs was at an executive and administrative schedule eas pay grade of.at briggs dep.at.in,the postal service engaged in a national reorganization which reduced the number of environmental compliance positions.at briggs dep.at.as part of this reorganization,the seven decc positions that existed in the great lakes area,consisting of the states of michigan,illinois,and indiana,were eliminated and replaced with four environmental compliance specialists ecs for the region.the job postings released in june for the new ecs positions stated that only the existing deccs were eligible to apply for the ecs positions,which meant that the pool of applicants was limited to briggs and the six other deccs in the great lakes.the ecs positions would be compensated at the pay grade.two of the new ecs positions would be located in detroit,one would be in chicago,and one in indianapolis.
because briggs was the decc working in district farthest from the locations of the new ecs positions and his home was not a commutable distance to any of the ecs positions,he would have needed to relocate his family if he were to be selected for an ecs position.briggs dep.at.before applications for the ecs positions were being accepted,briggs contacted phillip pickard by telephone to discuss his concerns about the need to relocate.pickard held the title of manager of environmental programs,would be supervising those who would be selecting the new ecs positions,and was one of briggs functional managers.briggs questioned pickard over the telephone about why the two new ecs positions in michigan were to be located on the east side of the state rather than on the west side where briggs worked as a decc.pickard explained that the postal service faced a greater likelihood of environmental fines and citations on the east side of the michigan.briggs responded that he did think that it was fair that he was the only decc who would have to relocate in order to be eligible for an ecs position.briggs reports that pickard responded,well,based on your background and experience y ou very well qualified you wo have a problem finding a job someplace else.at briggs dep.at.confused by this response,briggs asked pickard what he meant by that statement.pickard replied,well,there are other deccs who have much less time than you do in the postal service and would have a lot harder time finding a residual position if they were one of the successful bidders for the ecs positions.id.briggs expressed his concern that pickard statements suggested that the had already begun to consider whom to place in the various ecs positions,and then ended the phone conversation.
after considering the relocation,briggs decided he would be willing to move to detroit or chicago,and so he applied for those three ecs positions.in june,briggs submitted written applications for these three positions,along with the required ksa essays to demonstrate that he possessed the necessary knowledge,skills,and abilities for the ecs position.towards the end of july,briggs and the other ecs applicants were asked to come to the postal service area office in bloomingdale,illinois to interview with pickard and the review board.judy,an area environmental compliance specialist and a functional manager of briggs and the other deccs,was the chairperson of the ecs selection review committee.after the interviews,the review committee issued recommendations about the ecs candidates to pickard,and briggs was not one of the four recommended candidates.pickard was not obligated to follow the recommendations of the review board,but because he agreed with their choices,he approved their four recommended candidates for the four ecs positions.out of the seven applicants,six were men and one,jennifer jendras,was a woman.five of the seven applicants including briggs were over the age of forty,and two including jendras were in their thirties.jendras was chosen for the chicago position,and the two michigan and the indianapolis positions were offered to male employees in their forties.after briggs was not selected for the ecs position,he worked for a few months as a manager of retail sales before becoming a manager of injury compensation.both of these positions were at the pay grade.in december,briggs was promoted to the position of manager of vehicle maintenance for the greater michigan district,compensated at the pay grade.
on october,briggs filed this lawsuit against the postal service,alleging that he was denied the promotion to the ecs position in favor of jendras because of his age and sex in violation of title vii and.discovery ensued,and on december,the postal service filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of briggs claims.briggs opposed the motion,arguing that under a theory of either direct or indirect evidence of discrimination,he had established genuine issues of material fact on his age and sex claims that required submission to a jury.in an opinion dated march,the district court granted summary judgment to defendant after it determined that briggs had not established any genuine issues of fact about whether the postal service asserted reason for hiring jendras,that she was an overall superior candidate,was a pretext for discrimination.the district court also rejected portions of briggs affidavit for consideration at the stage,because the court found that the statements were assertions of argument rather than of fact,and were inconsistent with his previous deposition.the court then rejected briggs claim that pickard conversation with him in june constituted direct evidence of age or sex discrimination.finally,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to defendant on briggs claim.the district court dismissed briggs claims with prejudice,and briggs filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment to the postal service was proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a dispute over a material fact is not considered genuine unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.shamaeizadeh cunigan,cir.
a.the district court refusal to consider portions of briggs affidavit 
as a preliminary matter,we review the district court refusal to consider a portion of briggs affidavit,which briggs submitted as an appendix to his motion in opposition to the postal service motion for summary judgment,when the district court was considering the motion.as this decision was an evidentiary ruling,we review the district court refusal to consider a portion of briggs affidavit for an abuse of discretion.aerel,pcc airfoils,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on erroneous findings of fact,applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion,or makes a clear error of judgment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
briggs argues that pickard statements to him over the telephone in june made before applications for the ecs positions were even being accepted constitute direct evidence that unlawful age and sex discrimination motivated the ecs promotion decision.at oral argument,briggs argued that pickard statements indicate that pickard had preselected the ultimately successful candidates before the formal ecs selection process began,and that this constitutes direct evidence of age and sex discrimination,or in the alternative,evidence of pretext under the mcdonnell douglas framework.briggs first recounted pickard alleged june statements in his deposition,and then later in greater detail in his affidavit.in his deposition,briggs stated that,during the june conversation with pickard,briggs expressed his unhappiness to pickard that briggs was the only decc who would have to move in order to take one of the new ecs positions.in response,briggs stated that pickard said,well,based on your background and experience y ou very well qualified you wo have a problem finding a job someplace else.at briggs dep.at.briggs then testified that he asked pickard what he meant by that response,to which briggs testified that pickard said,well,there are other deccs who have much less time than you do in the postal service and would have a lot harder time finding a residual position if they were one of the successful bidders for an ecs position.id.in his subsequent affidavit,briggs stated that during his june phone conversation with pickard 
mr pickard told affiant that affiant would not have a problem finding another job within the postal service,whereas the and selected candidates,including jennifer jendras,would have a more difficult time finding alternative positions within the postal service due to their limited knowledge and experience in postal operations.
in other words,pickard all but advised that despite his superior qualifications,affiant was not going to be promoted.
at briggs aff.at alterations in original.
the district court refused to consider both the statement in the affidavit about jendras and the other subsequently selected candidates as being less qualified than briggs and the sentence in of the affidavit because it concluded that these statements are lawyer argument rather than statements of fact to be considered in determining whether this case should go forward.at dist.op.at.the district court properly relied upon federal rule of civil procedure e,which states that supporting affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,and shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.we firmly agree with the district court decision to strike of the affidavit,because this portion was on its face explicitly not a reflection of fact but rather an argumentative interpretation of statements of fact from the june telephone conversation,as evidenced by the terms i n other words,and all but advised.striking of briggs affidavit was proper under rule e and therefore was not an abuse of discretion.
whether the district court decision to strike the description of jendras as less qualified than briggs and other more senior,ecs candidates was an abuse of discretion is a closer question.the district court concluded that this statement was inconsistent with the earlier deposition and therefore inappropriate for consideration at the stage under reid sears,roebuck,cir stating that a party may not create a factual issue by filing an affidavit,after a motion for summary judgment has been made,which contradicts her earlier deposition testimony.at dist.op.at.the district court therefore relied upon the principle that briggs failure to mention such a material piece of evidence when asked about the june telephone conversation during the deposition was akin to admitting at the deposition that such evidence did not exist.the district court reasoned that briggs subsequent statement that the material piece of evidence did exist was therefore contradictory.the district court also stated,it is inconceivable to this court that,if pickard had actually said that jendras was less qualified than briggs,briggs would not have mentioned this fact during his deposition.id.
in these circumstances,we conclude that the district court refusal to consider the affidavit description of jendras and the other subsequently selected ecs candidates as less qualified was an abuse of discretion for two reasons.first,the district court essentially stated that it did not believe that pickard had actually called jendras less qualified,and it appears that this disbelief factored into the district court admissibility determination.this adverse determination against briggs as the nonmoving party is inconsistent with the district court obligation to view the evidence in the light most favorable to briggs.the supreme court explains 
credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge,whether the judge is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.the evidence of the is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the nonmovant favor.
anderson liberty lobby,d.see also pack damon,cir in evaluating a motion for summary judgment,the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
second,our most recent precedent on whether or not a subsequent affidavit is contradictory to a previous deposition for the purposes of admissibility at the stage clarifies a relatively narrow definition of a contradiction.in aerel,we declined to extend the reid rule barring the admission of contradictory affidavits to bar a party who was not directly questioned about an issue at deposition from supplementing incomplete deposition testimony with a sworn affidavit.at.we reasoned 
such an affidavit fills a gap left open by the moving party and thus provides the district court with more information,rather than less,at the crucial summary judgment stage.because the deponent is under no obligation to volunteer information not fairly sought by the questioner,we see no reason to apply reid and its progeny to such a situation.
id.while briggs was questioned generally about that june conversation,he was not expressly asked what pickard had said to him during that conversation.as briggs was not under any obligation to volunteer everything pickard said during that conversation,he should not be prevented from providing greater detail in a later affidavit.with the benefit of our reasoning aerel we conclude that the district court did abuse its discretion excluding the reference in briggs affidavit to the ecs candidates who were eventually selected as being less qualified than briggs.nevertheless,for the reasons explained below,even when considering this additional phrase of briggs affidavit,we conclude that briggs has been unable to show the existence of any genuine issue of material fact on either his age or claims.
briggs claim 
briggs argues that this court should reverse the district court dismissal of his claim because he has demonstrated genuine issues of material fact under both a theory and a theory of discrimination.briggs is correct that he can establish age discrimination either by presenting direct evidence of discrimination or by proceeding under mcdonnell do
