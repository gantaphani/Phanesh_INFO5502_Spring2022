factual and procedural history 
employer is a corporation in memphis,tennessee,that is in the business of slaughtering and butchering livestock and processing the meat after slaughter.employer admitted and the alj found that employer was one engaged in commerce within the meaning of section,and of the act and that the united food and commercial workers,local union is a labor organization within the meaning of section of the act.
the united food and commercial workers union has represented employer production and maintenance employees for over forty years.the collective bargaining agreement cba provided that the employees were guaranteed a hour workweek.the cba further provided that there shall be no strikes,lockouts,slowdowns or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of settlement as provided in this agreement of any controversy which might arise.
in,employer encountered increased costs of production and began to entertain the idea of cutting the employees workweek back to ten to fifteen hours per week.richard freudenberg freudenberg,a plant manager at employer facility and an employee for over forty years,met with union representative john canada canada in january and presented employer plan of a temporary suspension of the hour workweek in favor of a ten to workweek.the only alternative to this proposal was a layoff,which was impracticable for employer who required at least workers per species of livestock in order to complete the slaughtering process,and a layoff would cause employer to be unable to maintain that number of employees.canada agreed to the proposal of the reduced workweek and agreed that the reduction in hours would begin february.freudenberg testified that he had an policy and that any employee who was dissatisfied was free to talk to him at any time,but that no employees came to him to discuss this workweek reduction,nor did anyone file a grievance as required by the cba.
petitioner testified before the alj that the employees became dissatisfied upon hearing rumors of the reduced workweek plan but were unsuccessful in their attempts to contact their union representative.petitioner said that some employees believed they should have been laid off rather than have their work hours reduced.
on february,the day before the reduced workweek was to go into effect,some of the employees began to discuss the possibility of talking with freudenberg about the situation.a large number of employees left their work stations and proceeded to the front of the plant.according to petitioner,the employees wanted to talk to freudenberg about why this change was being made without employer first having sought the consent of the employees.
david green,a safety and sanitation inspector for employer,contacted freudenberg on his cell phone to tell him that the employees had said that they were on strike and had walked out and they refused to go back to work until they had talked with freudenberg.he had heard petitioner walk onto the kill floor,where several animals had already been slaughtered that morning,and yell to his fellow employees l et go.according to green,e veryone walked out.as everyone was walking out,anybody that was left exited the building also.green reported this to freudenberg,who arrived at the plant between and,twenty to minutes after green call.
the employees gathered in front of the plant and insisted upon speaking to freudenberg as a group.according to petitioner,some of the employees were shouting to freudenberg.he told them that they needed to return to work and that he could only speak with them individually,not as a group.petitioner came to freudenberg truck where freudenberg told him to get the employees back to work,but petitioner refused and insisted that they simply wanted to talk to him.the parties are,for the most part,in agreement on the facts to this point.
the factual disputes arise regarding what happened next.freudenberg testified that petitioner told him the employees were on strike because of the new workweek,and showed him a piece of paper with names on it,which he said was intended to be an employee vote to make petitioner the new shop steward.freudenberg knew that he could not negotiate with petitioner,who was not recognized by the union,and he had no intention of explaining to the assembled employees what agreement had been reached with the union,which he considered to be the union responsibility.
rather than discuss the issue with them,freudenberg told the employees they had fifteen minutes to return to work or they would need to leave the property.if they chose not to return to work and to leave the premises,employer would consider them as having voluntarily quit and abandoned their jobs.according to freudenberg,some employees asked if they were being fired,and he told them that they were not but reiterated that they needed to return to their work stations or leave the premises.he went so far as to say that he had pleaded with them to return to work because there was a certain amount of time within which the slaughtered livestock had to be processed before the meat was rendered unfit for human consumption.freudenberg said that some employees did return to work at that point,but others did not.among the latter was a employee named melvin guy whom freudenberg said he warned about losing his job if he left.freudenberg expressly denied that he had told individually or as part of a return to the plant the next day.
according to petitioner and the other striking employees,freudenberg said that they were not being fired,but that they should put up their things in their lockers and return the next day.petitioner testified that he went into the dressing room to remove his work clothes and put them in his locker,and on his way out he dropped his pen.when he stopped to pick it up,he said that freudenberg told him to take it with him because he might need it to fill out job applications.petitioner said he questioned freudenberg about whether he was being fired,and freudenberg responded that he was not and that he should return the next day.freudenberg concurs that he made a comment about petitioner taking the pen with him to fill out job applications but says he never told petitioner he was to return the next day.
the employees that testified they were told to return the next day said they believed freudenberg meant they should return the next day to resume work.however,none of them stated that they believed they were simply being given the rest of the day off,nor could they explain why they would have received a day off.
ultimately,freudenberg ordered the employees who did not return to work to exit the premises,which they did by congregating just off the premises to await the arrival of canada,the union representative.they said that,as they left the premises,the gates were closed behind them.freudenberg insisted that the gates were closed but were not locked because employer never locked the gates while the plant was operational,partly because customers and suppliers would need access to the premises.while the employees waited for canada,kathy furlong,a employee of employer,called the news station and the mayor office to inform them of the strike,though she also testified that she thought she would be returning to the plant the next day.canada eventually arrived and drove up to the
