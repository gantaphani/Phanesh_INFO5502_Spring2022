wood,circuit judge.
it has been more than seven years since roadway express roadway fired peter cefalu.the litigation over this action,however,lives on this petition for review represents the parties second trip before this court.see roadway,united states dep t of labor,cir roadway i.the case originated in august,when cefalu filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration alleging that he had been sacked in violation of the surface transportation assistance act of.roadway dismissed cefalu on february,just after he submitted a notarized statement at a grievance hearing asserting that roadway had instructed him to falsify his driving log.
at a hearing before an administrative law judge alj at the department of labor,roadway asserted that it fired cefalu because it recently had learned that he had lied in on his job application.though cefalu application stated that he had voluntarily left two previous jobs,in fact he had lost both positions on grounds of reckless driving.during discovery,cefalu sought to uncover the source of roadway information,but roadway steadfastly refused to comply with the alj discovery order requiring it to divulge this piece of evidence.in response,the alj imposed an evidentiary sanction that prohibited roadway from introducing any information that the company had learned from its source.unable to cite cefalu dishonesty or accident history,roadway failed to rebut cefalu argument that he had been fired for engaging in protected conduct under the act.the alj entered judgment for cefalu and ordered his reinstatement the administrative review board arb affirmed.
when roadway filed its first petition for review with this court,we upheld the imposition of the evidentiary sanction against roadway at the merits stage.see roadway i,at.we found,however,that the sanction should not have gone so far as to prevent roadway from arguing that concerns made cefalu reinstatement impossible or impractical.see id.at.we remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether roadway would have fired cefalu in the absence of his protected conduct.see id.on remand,first the alj and then the arb concluded that roadway failed to meet this burden.because the petition for review addresses the arb decision,we will not mention the alj separately unless there is some particular reason to do so.
roadway argues in its new petition that the arb misinterpreted the scope of the remand order when it prevented roadway from presenting arguments related to cefalu dishonesty.in addition,roadway points to cefalu five previous trucking accidents as evidence that considerations weigh decisively against cefalu reinstatement.the arb rejected these arguments,and we find that its ruling is supported by substantial evidence.
because the parties fiercely contest the reach of roadway i,we should begin by rehearsing the relevant aspects of that decision.our opinion was careful to distinguish between the use of the evidentiary sanction at the merits stage from its use at the remedial stage of the proceedings.at the merits phase,precluding roadway from relying on information derived from its undisclosed source was an appropriate sanction,we reasoned,because otherwise cefalu would be unable to show that roadway proffered explanation was pretextual.id.at.for instance,the source could have revealed that roadway had known about cefalu driving record long before it fired him.id.at.that the sanction effectively doomed roadway merits case was unfortunate,but the alternative would have forced cefalu to litigate with one hand tied behind his back.id.
prevailing on the merits did not,however,mean that cefalu was automatically entitled to have his old job back.id.this may seem to be at odds with the act,which provides that any employee who has been fired for engaging in protected activity must be reinstated to her former position without any changes in pay or other benefits.b a.but reinstatement is not always a proper remedy,as it could obligate an employer to reinstate an incompetent or unqualified employee.id.to address this concern,we invoked the mixed motive framework that the supreme court set forth in healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.although roadway is now trying to rely on mckennon nashville banner pub,to justify its decision to fire cefalu,that case is a poor fit for the facts.as the secretary brief points out,roadway knew of and asserted dishonesty as grounds for terminating cefalu in the first instance,while mckennon addresses the use of evidence acquired after the wrongful discharge.under the healthy approach,once the plaintiff demonstrates that her protected conduct played a substantial role in the defendant decision to fire her,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that it would still have terminated the plaintiff in the absence of her protected conduct.id.at.
applying this general principle to cefalu case,we concluded that roadway should have been given an opportunity to argue that it would have terminated cefalu because of his record of trucking accidents.we explained that a remand was necessary because 
roadway was entitled to show that cefalu indeed dissembled in his employment application to the company.cefalu wrote that he resigned from his previous position.in fact,he was fired for reckless driving.cefalu,in turn,should have the opportunity to show that roadway does not terminate everyone with such a record,perhaps if the person has had a clean record for a certain number of years in the interim,or other extenuating circumstances exist.
we went on to note that remanding the case for further proceedings on remedy did not implicate the same concerns that motivated the imposition of the evidentiary sanction at the merits phase 
roadway withholding of the identity of its informant in no way prevented cefalu from contesting roadway claim that reinstatement was an inappropriate remedy because of public safety.nothing about how,why,or when roadway learned about cefalu misstatement is pertinent to cefalu effort to keep his job despite his conceded earlier problems.if the facts are as roadway contends,then concerns,or even regulatory rules,may make it impossible for roadway to reinstate cefalu.roadway therefore should have been permitted to refer to cefalu earlier driving record during the remedial stage.
on remand,roadway took our opinion as an invitation to submit evidence that it would have fired cefalu for lying about his previous driving record.roadway offered evidence that it had fired a number of employees who had made false statements.the alj,however,declined to explore the issue of dishonesty,as he understood the remand to be limited solely to addressing concerns raised by cefalu driving record,and the arb endorsed this decision.
with respect to the risk cefalu driving posed to the public,roadway submitted the following evidence about cefalu five earlier trucking accidents.
united parcel service.cefalu swerved his truck out of the way of a car,lost control,and crashed into a drainage pipe ditch.it is not clear how much damage the truck suffered,but cefalu was fired for reckless driving.
anr advance transportation.cefalu fell asleep while driving and his truck struck a guardrail.the truck suffered major damage and cefalu was fired for reckless driving.
august,roadway.when cefalu was parking,he ran his truck into the edge of a parked truck.the trucks suffered approximately in damage.roadway issued a warning letter to cefalu.
may,roadway.while backing up his truck in an effort to couple his to a trailer,cefalu damaged the of the.roadway issued a warning letter to cefalu.
october,roadway.no details of this accident are contained in the record.
besides cefalu driving record,roadway also offered employment records showing that it had fired four other drivers involved in similar or less severe accidents.cefalu countered by presenting evidence that approximately other drivers had not lost their jobs after getting themselves into analogous or worse accidents.in weighing the evidence presented by both sides,the alj ultimately sided with cefalu and found that roadway failed to show that it would have fired him even in the ab
