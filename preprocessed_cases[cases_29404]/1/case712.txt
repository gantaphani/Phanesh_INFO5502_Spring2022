petitioner marino de la rosa,a native of the dominican republic,appeals from the june,final decision and order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the october,decision of immigration judge ij helen sichel denying de la rosa application for deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat,and ordering his removal from the united states to the dominican republic.see united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,treaty doc.
the ij issued that october,order of removal following a may,decision by the bia reversing and vacating the ij june,decision granting deferral of removal,and remanding de la rosa record to the ij for the sole purpose of ordering removal.on appeal,de la rosa argues that he has shown a sufficient likelihood that he would be subject to torture upon removal to the dominican republic,and that the bia erred in reversing the june,decision of the ij.
we find the bia committed error in its review of the ij factual findings and of the evidentiary record in de la rosa.the bia may not engage in during an appeal from the decision of ij,and may only review the ij factual findings for clear error.d i.the bia employed an improper standard of review by considering the evidentiary record in de la rosa case and by finding facts inconsistent with the findings of the ij.on this basis,the bia concluded that the weight of the evidence did not show that it is more likely than not de la rosa would be tortured upon removal.additionally,the bia may have rested its decision on an alternative ground,concluding that the ij factual findings and de la rosa submissions,as a matter of law,necessarily precluded a finding of government acquiescence to torture.due to our concerns with the bia treatment of the government acquiescence standard for torture under the cat,we remand to the bia for precedential consideration of this issue.
therefore,we vacate the bia june,and may,decisions,and we remand de la rosa record to the bia for further proceedings consistent with the court opinion.given the amount of time this panel has spent with this case,we shall retain jurisdiction over any appeal that may be made.
background 
de la rosa,born in the dominican republic in,entered the united states in to play professional baseball.based on the sponsorship of his,a united states citizen,he was admitted to the united states on november,as a lawful permanent resident.removal proceedings were initiated against de la rosa in december of after he pled guilty in to the crime of conspiracy to distribute and possess,with intent to distribute,cocaine and heroin,in violation of sections,a,a,and b a of title of the united states code.he was charged with removability pursuant to sections a a iii and a b i of the immigration and nationality act due to his status as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and as an alien who,after admission,was convicted of a violation involving a controlled substance.de la rosa was found ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal on february,because of his conviction for a serious crime.
over the next several years,he sought relief under article of the cat and gave testimony in support of that application to the ij,ultimately resulting in the june,decision and order granting him deferral of removal pursuant to c and a.the bia reversed and remanded the ij decision with the instruction to issue an order of removal.following the ij compliance with that instruction,the bia dismissed de la rosa appeal,and de larosa filed the petition for review now before this court.that appeal was expedited,and the court has granted a temporary stay of removal pending its disposition.
de la rosa claim for relief under article of the cat revolve around his cooperation with federal prosecutors following his arrest for involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy.by assisting the government,de la rosa obtained a significant downward departure in his own sentencing and facilitated the conviction of other individuals,including a dominican national named jonas brito brito.de la rosa contends that he will more likely than not be tortured or killed upon removal to the dominican republic due to a number of facts,including the express,repeated desire of brito and others to kill him the presence of brito family and contacts currently in the dominican republic,including a brother in the government the corruption and ineffectiveness of the dominican authorities and the pattern of dominican government involvement in unlawful killings.
to establish entitlement to relief under the cat,de la rosa bears the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that removal will cause him to be subject to torture.torture is defined as the infliction of severe pain or suffering by,at the instigation of,or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official.see,a.in the june,decision granting de la rosa deferral of removal,the ij determined that de la rosa met that burden,having demonstrated that it is more likely than not that the dominican police will show willful blindness to,or even actively participate in,torturing killing him.both the may,bia decision reversing the ij and the june,bia decision dismissing de la rosa appeal rejected this conclusion,finding that the weight of the evidence simply does not indicate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured,and that the evidence fails to show that the government would acquiesce in acts to torture him.
ii.discussion 
as an initial matter,the real act of limits our jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against individuals removable for having committed crimes involving a controlled substance to constitutional claims or questions of law.see u.a c,d.we have found this section to so limit our jurisdiction in withholding of removal cases.see pierre gonzales,cir.we have also assumed,without discussion,that section a c is applicable to deferral of removal claims under the cat,poole mukasey,cir.we have not,however,expressly held that the section is applicable to deferral claims.it should be noted that the ninth circuit draws a distinction between withholding and deferral claims,treating the jurisdictional limits imposed by section a c as inapplicable if the conviction does not provide the basis of the ij decision on relief under the cat.see mukasey,cir distinguishing ashcroft,cir and stating that w hen an ij does not rely on an alien conviction in denying cat relief and instead denies relief on the merits,none of the provisions apply to divest this court of jurisdiction.quoting morales gonzales,cir.in the instant case,we need not address this jurisdictional issue because the appeal raises only questions of law.
bia standard of review of ij factual findings 
since september,the bia has been bound to review the factual findings of immigration judges only for clear error.see xian tuan ye dep t of homeland,cir.the board will not engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.facts determined by the immigration judge,including findings as to the credibility of testimony,shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.d i.the bia did not comply with this regulatory command in reviewing the ij factual findings,but rather applied a standard that substantially deviated from clear error and may have been de novo.whatever the precise level of review undertaken by the bia with respect to the ij factual findings in de la rosa case,it constituted error.
in its may,decision reversing the ij determination of de la rosa cat claim,the bia articulated its standard of review as that of determining the weight of the evidence.in exercising this review,the bia appears to have made its own factual findings based on all evidence.in doing so,the bia characterization of facts deriving from the evidentiary record is demonstratively at odds with factual findings made by the ij,including several directly inconsistent findings.for example,the bia deviated from the ij factual findings when it determined that de la rosa failed to establish that brito family would be able to i
