opinion of the court 
this immigration case hinges on the relationship between prescription drugs and controlled substances.the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,prohibits the unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in interstate commerce.see t e a.similarly,the controlled substances act csa,bans the unauthorized distribution of controlled substances.see a.some prescription drugs like oxycontin are also controlled substances,but many like lipitor,zithromax,and thousands of other common medications are not.importantly,the fdca wholesale distribution provisions make no distinction between those prescription drugs that are controlled substances and those that are not.
with this background,we answer two questions.first,is a conviction for violating the fdca wholesale distribution provisions an aggravated felony specifically illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title under a b and a a iii second,are these fdca provisions laws relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title under a b i our answer to both questions is no.accordingly,we grant the petition for review,reverse,and vacate the order of removal.
background 
petitioner ramone borrome is a citizen of the dominican republic,and since august has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states.in may,a special agent with the united states food and drug administration fda filed a criminal complaint against him and two other men in federal court.the next month,a grand jury returned a indictment.
count one charged the three defendants with having unlawfully,intentionally,and knowingly engaged in the unauthorized wholesale distribution in interstate commerce of prescription drugs in violation of t and e,to wit,borrome,and his two distributed the prescription drugs combivir,diflucan,oxycontin,serostim,viagra,zerit,and zyprexa without being licensed to do so.at.count two alleged a conspiracy.significantly,the indictment did not charge any of the three defendants with violating the csa.according to his judgment of conviction,borrome pled guilty to count one while count two was dismissed on the government motion the district court sentenced him to four months imprisonment followed by four months home confinement.
in june,borrome was served with a notice to appear for immigration removal purposes.he filed a motion to terminate,which the immigration judge ij denied.
in a written opinion,the ij found borrome removable under a b and a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.the ij concluded that the hypothetical federal felony test required him to compare the fdca wholesale distribution provisions to the csa to determine whether borrome fdca conviction is analogous to a felony under the csa.he noted that the csa makes it a felony to distribute knowingly or intentionally a controlled substance.see a b c.turning to borrome indictment,he further noted that borrome pled guilty to distributing oxycontin,which contains the schedule ii controlled substance oxycodone.see b xiii.none of the other six prescription drugs listed in borrome indictment contains controlled substances.thus,the ij reasoned,because borrome offense involved the unauthorized distribution of a schedule ii controlled substance,it is an aggravated felony under a b pursuant to the hypothetical federal felony test.at.
the ij also found borrome removable under a b i as an alien convicted of violating any law relating to a controlled substance.after reiterating the reference in borrome indictment to oxycontin,the ij concluded that borrome conviction is plainly a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.id.at.
in december,the ij ordered borrome removed to the dominican republic.in march,on the government motion,the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed the ij decision without opinion pursuant to e.borrome timely petitioned for review.before his counsel could file a motion to stay removal,he was removed from the united states.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the ij had jurisdiction over borrome removal proceedings under.the bia had jurisdiction to review the ij order of removal and its underlying denial of borrome motion to terminate under b and.
we generally have jurisdiction under to review final orders of removal from the bia.but a c provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable under,among other provisions,a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony or a b i for having been convicted of violating a law relating to a controlled substance.we have jurisdiction,however,to determine our jurisdiction.in other words,we have jurisdiction to determine whether the necessary facts are present in a particular case,specifically whether the petitioner is an alien and whether he has been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses.see papageorgiou gonzales,cir valansi ashcroft,cir.furthermore,nothing in a c precludes our review of questions of law presented in a petition for review.see a d.
when the bia affirms an ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.konan att y,cir.we review de novo,without affording the attorney general deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the purely legal questions of whether a violation of particular federal criminal statutes is an aggravated felony and whether those statutes are laws relating to a controlled substance.see denis att y,cir bobb.att y,cir valansi,at 
iii.analysis 
removability under a b and a a iii conviction for committing an aggravated felony 
first,we must determine whether as the ij concluded borrome conviction for violating the fdca wholesale distribution provisions,see t e a,is an aggravated felony under a b and a a iii.
any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.with respect to a controlled substances offense,aggravated felony means illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title the definitional section of the csa,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.t he term drug trafficking crime means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et,the controlled substances import and export act et seq,or chapter of title,which includes the maritime controlled substances laws.c.
we have held,however,that in addition to a federal felony conviction for violating any of c three statutes,a state controlled substances conviction may also qualify as an aggravated felony under a b.when presented with such a conviction,we have applied two independent tests to determine whether the conviction is an aggravated felony the hypothetical federal felony test and the illicit trafficking element test.see,evanson att y,cir garcia att y,cir gerbier holmes,cir.under the hypothetical federal felony route,we compare the offense of conviction to the federal controlled substances act to determine if it is analogous to an offense under that act.evanson,at.under the illicit trafficking element test,a state felony drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony if it contains a trafficking element.id.
when applying either the hypothetical federal felony test or the illicit trafficking element test under a b,and in making aggravated felony determinations in general,we presumptively start our analysis by applying the formal categorical approach.garcia,at.under this approach,we must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,and may not consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes,including the particular facts underlying a conviction.id.quoting singh,at quoting taylor united states,d.there are two instances where we may depart from the formal categorical approach when conducting an aggravated felony analysis when c onfronted with a disjunctive statute of conviction,one in which there are alternative elements,to determine which of the alternative elements was the actual basis for the underlying conviction,evanson,at see also garcia,at singh,at and when the language of a particular subsection of a the aggravated felony enumerating statute invites inquiry into the underlying facts of the case.evanson,at quoting nijhawan att y,cir.
can the hypothetical federal felony test apply to a conviction for violating federal law 
as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether the hypothetical federal felony test can apply to a conviction for violating a federal law,like the fdca,that is not one of the three federal controlled substances laws enumerated in c and incorporated in a b.we hold that it can 
as noted,a b incorporates c,which defines a drug trafficking crime as any felony punishable under the csa,the controlled substances import and export act,or the maritime controlled substances laws.c emphasis added.in this statute,congress referred to felonies punishable under,not convictions obtained under,the three enumerated statutes.gerbier,at quoting matter of barrett,bia.therefore,c does not require an actual conviction under one of its three laws.id.a conviction that is hypothetically punishable as a felony under one of c three statutes can also qualify as a drug trafficking crime.id.at.
thus far the bia and our court have applied this hypothetical federal felony test only to convictions for violating state controlled substances laws.see,evanson,at garcia,at gerbier,at matter of davis,bia.ordinarily when an alien is convicted of violating a federal controlled substances law,he is convicted under the csa.in those cases,there is no need for the hypothetical federal felony test because c makes an actual federal felony conviction under the csa a drug trafficking crime,and thus,via a b,an aggravated felony.but in this case the government argues that the fdca wholesale distribution laws create the same bases for removability as c three controlled substances laws 
notwithstanding the unusual circumstances of this case,we conclude that the hypothetical federal felony test can apply to a conviction for violating a federal law other than those enumerated in c.there is nothing in the text of either a b or c that limits application of the hypothetical federal felony test to state controlled substances convictions.in fact,a specifically indicates that the term aggravated felony applies to an offense whether in violation of federal or state law.when applying the test,the key inquiry is simply whether the alien conviction is hypothetically punishable as a felony under any of the three controlled substances laws listed in c.
ii.does borrome fdca conviction meet the hypothetical federal felony test 
having determined that the hypothetical federal felony test can apply in this case,we turn to whether it is met.to do so,we first consider whether the presumption in favor of the categorical approach applies to our analysis.it is well established that the aggravated felony enumerating statute at issue here,a b,does not permit departure from the categorical approach nor does it invite inquiry into the underlying facts of a conviction.see evanson.at garcia,at.if we were to depart from the categorical approach,we would have to find justification for that departure in borrome statutes of conviction.we conclude,however,that the fdca wholesale distribution statutes,t and e a,do not permit departure from the formal categorical approach because they are not disjunctive statutes that define distinct offenses.they are instead a single offense that is not categorically punishable under any of c three controlled substances statutes.therefore,a conviction under these fdca provisions fails the hypothetical federal felony test.
we begin by unraveling what borrome statutes of conviction,t and e,actually prohibit.in pertinent part,t prohibits the distribution of drugs in violation of section e of this title.section e a,in turn,provides that n o person may engage in the wholesale distribution in interstate commerce of drugs subject to subsection b of this section in a state unless such person is licensed by the state in accordance with the guidelines issued under subparagraph b.the term wholesale distribution means distribution of drugs subject to subsection b of this section to other than the consumer or patient,with some exceptions not relevant here.e b.section b the relevant part of the subsection b of this section to which e a and e b refer subjects to certain prescription requirements 
a drug intended for use by a man which a because of its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect,or the method of its use,or the collateral measures necessary to its use,is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug or b is limited by an approved application under section of this title to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.
for simplicity,these are called prescription drugs.
section b does not provide a list of specific drugs subject to its prescription requirements.whether a drug is a prescription drug by virtue of b a is a question of fact for the jury.see united states munoz,cir.the fda does,however,publish in what is colloquially known as the orange book a list of what are prescription drugs by virtue of b b because they are limited by an approved application under section of title to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.see food drug,dep t of health human,approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations to ed,available at.
the term controlled substance appears nowhere in t and e.a controlled substance is defined in the csa to mean a drug or other substance,or immediate precursor,included in schedule i,ii,iii,iv,or v of part b of this subchapter.a list of controlled substances is provided in and supplemented by.the only way to discern an overlap between prescription drugs and controlled substances is to compare the list of prescription drugs in the fda orange book and the list of controlled substances in the csa and its corresponding regulations.when doing so,it is clear that,while some prescription drugs contain chemicals that are also regulated as controlled substances under the csa,many do not.for example,oxycontin one of the seven drugs listed in borrome indictment is a prescription drug,see approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,supra,at,and it contains the controlled substance oxycodone,see b xiii.in contrast,viagra another of the seven drugs listed in borrome indictment is a prescription drug,see approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations at,but it does not contain a controlled substance.
although some prescription drugs do contain controlled substances,t and e a make no distinction between convictions involving prescriptions drugs that do contain controlled substances and those that do not.in other words,under t and e a,a conviction for the unlicensed wholesale distribution of viagra is no different than a conviction for the unlicensed wholesale distribution of oxycontin.
this is the pivot point for our hypothetical federal felony analysis.when making aggravated felony determinations under a b,w e must rely only on what the convicting court must necessarily have found to support the conviction.jeune att y,cir quoting steele blackman,cir.when borrome pled guilty to violating the fdca wholesale distribution provisions,the convicting court did not necessarily have to find whether the prescriptions drugs involved also contained controlled substances.such a finding would be irrelevant under t and e a because those statutes define a single offense,not separate and distinct offenses.therefore,t and e a do not permit departure from the formal categorical approach.
when we apply the categorical approach,we see daylight between the elements of a csa controlled substances distribution conviction and an fdca prescription drug distribution conviction.under the csa,it is unlawful to knowingly or intentionally distribute a controlled substance.a.under the fdca,it is unlawful to engage in the wholesale distribution in interstate commerce of prescription drugs without a proper license.e a.a
