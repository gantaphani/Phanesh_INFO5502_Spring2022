ada title ii claims against the nyslrs 
sovereign immunity 
the nyslrs moved to dismiss on the basis of new york state and the nyslrs sovereign immunity from suit.the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.the eleventh amendment has been interpreted as also barring suits in federal court against a state brought by that state own citizens.see woods rondout valley cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.although nyslrs is not itself a state,t he immunity recognized by the eleventh amendment extends beyond the states themselves to state agents and state instrumentalities that are,effectively,arms of a state.id.quoting regents of the of cal.doe,d.

a court must determine,on a basis,which aspects of the state alleged conduct violated title ii to what extent such misconduct also violated the fourteenth amendment and insofar as such misconduct violated title ii but did not violate the fourteenth amendment,whether congress purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.

b.the reasonable modification requirement of title ii of the ada 
the ada was passed by large majorities in both houses of congress in after decades of deliberation and investigation into the need for comprehensive legislation to address discrimination against persons with disabilities.lane,at.congress found that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination,including outright intentional exclusion,the discriminatory effects of architectural,transportation,and communication barriers,overprotective rules and policies,and failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices crowder kitagawa,cir alteration in original quoting a.the ada aims to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.it forbids discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major areas of public life employment,which is covered by title i of the statute public services,programs,and activities,which are the subject of title ii and public accommodations,which are covered by title iii.lane,at.
title ii of the ada,public services,provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.united states georgia,at quoting.the statute require s that covered entities make reasonable accommodations in order to provide qualified individuals with an equal opportunity to receive benefits from or to participate in programs run by such entities.tsombanidis west haven fire dep t,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
to prove a violation of title ii,a party must therefore establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability that he was excluded from participation in a public entity services,programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public entity and that such exclusion or discrimination was due to his disability.
hargrave vermont,cir.
a qualified individual with a disability is defined as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices,the removal of architectural,communication,or transportation barriers,or the provision of auxiliary aids and services,meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.

c.the district court decision as to whether the plaintiff is a qualified individual 
the district court began its analysis of whether the plaintiff adequately alleged that she is a qualified individual with a disability by observing that new york state courts have interpreted a similar filing deadline provision as 
a condition precedent to the ripening of any rights or entitlement to disability benefits,and have concluded that the statutory filing period may not be extended or waived by the state agency,even where the applicant claims that the disability giving rise to his or her claim for disability benefits also rendered him incapable of asserting his or her claim in a timely manner.

the district court then concluded that,unlike requiring reasonable modification of the state defendant own rules,policies or practices over which it has discretion,r equiring the state defendant to violate state law is not a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law,dist.lexis,at.for this proposition,the court relied principally on herschaft new york board of elections,cv,wl,dist.lexis,denominated not for publication,aff on other grounds,app x cir summary order,in which the court rejected a pro se plaintiff requested modification of new york state deadline for gathering signatures for an election nominating petition.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the herschaft court opined,without citation to authority,that 
a two to extension,although not excessive in scope,is unreasonable simply because it would require the board of elections to violate a state statute requiring that signatures for independent nominating petitions be gathered and submitted within a certain time frame the board of elections has no statutory authority to waive the requirement.it is the court opinion that an accommodation that would require a defendant to violate an otherwise constitutional state law is inherently unreasonable.
id.at,dist.lexis,at footnote omitted.the district court also cited aughe shalala,which reasoned that modification of a federal statutory age requirement would essentially rewrite the statute,so it must be seen as a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program,id.at.
whether the filing deadline is an essential eligibility requirement.with respect to title ii requirement that a qualified individual meet the essential eligibility requirements of a covered program,the district court apparently concluded that so long as a mandatory eligibility requirement is set by a state statute,it will be an essential eligibility requirement,and any modification of it will work a fundamental alteration of the program.on appeal,the nyslrs argues that title ii does not require waiver of the essential eligibility requirements for state programs or receipt of state benefits,nyslrs br,and construes our opinion in henrietta as deciding that to state a reasonable modification claim under the ada,the plaintiff must meet the formal legal eligibility requirements for benefits or services,id.at quoting henrietta,at.
at the outset,we note that the portion of henrietta cited by the district court and by nyslrs arose in an entirely different setting from that presented by this case.there,the state defendant argued that it should be permitted to rebut the plaintiffs prima facie title ii claim by showing that the plaintiffs are no less successful in gaining access to benefits than the.such a showing would suggest an alternative reason for the plaintiffs low rate of obtaining benefits systemic problems that create obstacles to access for everyone.henrietta,at.the issue we confronted was the meaning of the term benefits in the statutory command that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity.see at.
we concluded that the ada plainly define s benefits by reference to a plaintiff facial legal entitlements.henrietta,at.we reasoned further that t he statute use of the term qualified suggests that we must look not to the administration of the program for which the plaintiff is qualified,but rather its formal legal eligibility requirements.id.in context,these statements can not properly be read to define essential eligibility requirements as all formal legal eligibility requirements.that issue was not before the henrietta court.the only question there was whether the term benefits referred to the public program as it was in fact administered,or the program as it was intended to operate by law.see id.although it looked to the statute use of the term qualified and the regulations use of the phrase essential eligibility requirements in order to construe the statutory term benefits,id.at,the henrietta court did not construe the phrase essential eligibility requirement itself.we thus did not determine there that the phrase essential eligibility requirements as it is used in necessarily means a program formal legal eligibility requirements.because henrietta did not resolve the issue before us,we must construe the relevant statutory language in the first instance.
of course,s tatutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.bustamante napolitano,cir internal quotation marks omitted.at the outset,then,we review the statutory text,considering the ordinary or natural meaning of the words chosen by congress,as well as the placement and purpose of those words in the statutory scheme.united states aguilar,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the relevant text defines a qualified individual as 
an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices,the removal of architectural,communication,or transportation barriers,or the provision of auxiliary aids and services,meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.
emphases added.the text thus distinguishes between two categories of requirements rules,policies,or practices,which are subject to the requirement of reasonable modification,and essential eligibility requirements,which are not.
the fact that congress provided that rules,policies,or practices would be subject to reasonable modification,and contrasted this flexibility with the requirement that a qualified individual meet the essential eligibility requirements of a program within the same sentence suggests that congress meant these categories to have different meanings.generally,identical words used in different parts of the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning.but where,as here,congress uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended.cruz miguel holder,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
courts have therefore reasoned that essential eligibility requirements,unlike rules,policies,and practices,are not subject to reasonable modification or waiver.see pottgen missouri state high school activities ass n,cir observing that when an individual can not meet an eligibility requirement determined to be essential,the only possible accommodation is to waive the essential requirement itself but w aiving an essential eligibility standard would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program at issue.footnote omitted pga tour,martin,d t he waiver of an essential rule of a golf competition for anyone under title iii of the ada would fundamentally alter the nature of the tournaments.
o ne of the most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.corley united states,d internal quotation marks and alteration omitted see also duncan walker,d it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.in light of the fact that congress used the phrases rules,policies,and practices and essential eligibility requirements as two distinct categories,the application of this canon of statutory construction presents a fundamental obstacle to construing essential eligibility requirements to mean all formal legal eligibility requirements,as the district court did and as the nyslrs would have us do too.
the statute uses the phrase essential eligibility requirements,not simply eligibility requirements.had congress intended all formal legal eligibility requirements to be,the phrase eligibility requirements would have sufficed it would have been unnecessary to use the phrase essential eligibility requirements.title ii applies to the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,which,being public,will typically define their eligibility requirements wholly by applicable legal requirements.that is the case here all the relevant eligibility requirements for participation in the program are set by law.if essential eligibility requirements meant all formal legal eligibility requirements,every eligibility requirement would be essential and,impermissibly rendering the word essential superfluous.therefore,the term essential eligibility requirements does not refer to all formal legal eligibility requirements 
cases interpreting the essential eligibility requirement language indicate that whether an eligibility requirement is essential is determined by consulting the importance of the requirement to the program in question.see,pottgen,at t o determine whether the plaintiff is a qualified individual under title ii of the ada,we must first determine whether the age limit is an essential eligibility requirement by reviewing the importance of the requirement to the interscholastic baseball program at issue.id.at deciding that high school baseball program age limit was essential because a n age limit helps reduce the competitive advantage flowing to teams using older athletes protects younger athletes from harm discourages student athletes from delaying their education to gain athletic maturity and prevents coaches from engaging in repeated to gain a competitive advantage.these purposes are of immense importance in any interscholastic sports program.
this reading is reenforced by the regulations the relevant section of the ada,which require a public entity to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.b.the regulations indicate that essential eligibility requirements are those requirements without which the nature of the program would be fundamentally alter ed.id.these terms seem to us clearly to contemplate that some relatively minor eligibility requirements,even if set by statute,will not be deemed essential because they will not be necessary to prevent the fundamental alteration of the program nature.
the supreme court decision in pga tour,martin,d,further illustrates the point.the plaintiff in martin was a professional golfer with a disability that prevented him from walking an hole golf course.id.at.he requested permission to use a in contravention of the pga rules as a reasonable accommodation under title iii of the ada and the pga defended on the basis that allowing use of the would work a fundamental alteration in the nature of the tournament.id.at.
the court began its analysis by observing two ways in which a modification of the pga rules might fundamentally alter the tournament 
it might alter such an essential aspect of the game of golf that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally changing the diameter of the hole from three to six inches might be such a modification.alternatively,a less significant change that has only a peripheral impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabled player,in addition to access to the competition as required by title iii,an advantage over others and,for that reason,fundamentally alter the character of the competition.
id.at footnote omitted.
the court reasoned that the use of carts is not itself inconsistent with the fundamental character of the game of golf because the essence of the game is shotmaking using clubs to cause a ball to progress from the teeing ground to a hole some distance away with as few strokes as possible.id.at.it therefore concluded that the walking rule is at best peripheral to the nature of the pga athletic events,and thus it might be waived in individual cases without working a fundamental alteration.id.at see also id.at a modification that provides an exception to a peripheral tournament rule without impairing its purpose can not be said to fundamentally alter the tournament.the pga argument to the contrary that all the substantive rules for its competitions are sacrosanct and can not be modified under any circumstances was for that reason effectively a n incorrect contention that it is exempt from title iii reasonable modification requirement.id.at.but congress intended that an entity like the pga carefully weigh the purpose,as well as the letter,of the rule before determining that no accommodation would be tolerable.id.at.
rather than simply deferring to the entity providing the service in question,deeming the rules as set by that entity as sacrosanct,id.at,and construing any modification of those rules as a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service,the martin court undertook an independent analysis of the importance of a rule for the service in light of the service purpose to determine whether a requested modification would fundamentally alter its nature.similarly here,we read the ada to require us to analyze the importance of an eligibility requirement for a public program or benefit,rather than to defer automatically to whatever formal legal eligibility requirements may exist,no matter how unimportant for the program in question they may be 
and,perhaps most fundamentally,reading essential eligibility requirements to mean all formal legal eligibility requirements seems to us to run counter to the ada broad remedial purpose by allowing states to insist that whatever legal requirements they may set are never subject to reasonable modification under title ii of the ada.were we to adopt such a construction of the ada,the class of rules,policies,or practices subject to reasonable modification under title ii would be vanishingly small,and nearly all eligibility requirements for the receipt of public services would be essential eligibility requirements.
in the ada,congress provided a broad mandate to effectuate its sweeping purpose to forbid discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life,including public services id.at.as a remedial statute,the ada must be broadly construed to effectuate its purpose of providing a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.noel new york city taxi and limousine comm n,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to adopt the nyslrs construction would be to render title ii effectively impotent,which would be contrary to the broad remedial purpose of the ada an act that has been described as a milestone on the path to a more decent,tolerant,progressive society.martin,at quoting bd.of trustees of of garrett,d kennedy,concurring.
finally,here,as the plaintiff and the amici point out,new york state already waives or extends the filing deadline for disability retirement benefits for certain classes of individuals for example,an nyslrs member on unpaid medical leave may file an application within a year after termination of employment,see n.ret.and soc.sec.law b,and an nyslrs member with a qualifying world trade center condition faces no deadline whatsoever,see id.the fact that the state itself waives the deadline in the enumerated circumstances strongly suggests that the filing deadline is not essential.martin,at t he walking rule is not an indispensable feature of tournament golf either.the pga permits golf carts to be used by golfers in several of its tournaments other than the one in question.at this stage,it can not be said as a matter of law that the filing deadline is an essential eligibility requirement,and therefore dismissal is inappropriate because it is not clear from the face of the complaint that the plaintiff allegations are insufficient as a matter of law to support a claim upon which relief may be granted.halebian,at.

as noted above,i n the ada,congress provided a broad mandate to effectuate its sweeping purpose to forbid discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life,including public services martin,u.at.congress found that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination,including outright intentional exclusion,the discriminatory effects of architectural,transportation,and communication barriers,overprotective rules and policies,and failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices crowder,at alteration in original quoting a.the ada aims to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.title ii of the ada represents congress attempt to apply this clear and comprehensive national mandate to the services,programs,or activities,of any state or local government and any department,agency,or other instrumentality of a state,united states georgia,at omission in original quoting.and although congress did not include an express preemption provision,it did include a provision expressly abrogating the sovereign immunity of the states.see.
the natural effect of title ii reasonable modification requirement,crosby,at,in light of the foregoing observations,requires preemption of inconsistent state law when necessary to effectuate a required reasonable modification.congress clearly meant title ii to sweep broadly.if all state laws were insulated from title ii reasonable modification requirement solely because they were state laws,state law would serve as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in enacting title ii.marsh,at.far from provid ing a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities,b,the ada would be powerless to work any reasonable modification in any requirement imposed by state law,no matter how trivial the requirement and no matter how minimal the costs of doing so.we conclude that the ada reasonable modification requirement contemplates modification to state laws,thereby permitting preemption of inconsistent state laws,when necessary to effectuate title ii reasonable modification provision 
our conclusion is further supported by hargrave.there,as we have discussed,we upheld an injunction of a facially discriminatory vermont statute.vermont had argued that in the context of the statute and implementing regulation requiring states to make reasonable modifications in policies or practices in order to avoid discrimination unless the modifications would constitute a fundamental alteration to the relevant service,program,or activity,hargrave,at quoting b,enjoining the law would fundamentally alter the program at issue.rejecting this argument and upholding the injunction,we spoke of the ada preemption of these statutory provisions.id.at emphasis added.while the nyslrs argues that hargrave did not hold that title ii preempted facially nondiscriminatory state laws or mandated waiver of such laws,nyslrs br.at,it provides no persuasive reason why,in light of the concerns discussed above,title ii would preempt facially discriminatory laws in pursuit of its broad purpose,but fail to preempt state law when necessary to achieve a reasonable modification to accomplish the same broad goals.
last,we observe that the proposition that the ada preempts inconsistent state law when appropriate and necessary to effectuate a reasonable accommodation under title ii is also consistent with decisions from our sister circuits.see,barber colorado dep t of revenue,cir ultimately concluding that there was no conflict between state law and the ada in the case before it,but observing that the court in no way affirm ed the district court conclusion that a n accommodation that would have required defendants to willfully ignore or violate the law is per se not reasonable.citation omitted quinones city of evanston,cir the defendant believes that it is compelled to follow the directive from the state,but the supremacy clause of the constitution requires a different order of priority.a discriminatory state law is not a defense to liability under federal law it is a source of liability under federal law.emphasis in original williams foods,cir similar.as the ninth circuit explained 
the court obligation under the ada is to ensure that the decision reached by the state authority is appropriate under the law and in light of proposed alternatives.otherwise,any state could adopt requirements imposing unreasonable obstacles to the disabled,and when haled into court could evade the antidiscrimination mandate of the ada merely by explaining that the state authority considered possible modifications and rejected them.
we are mindful of the general principle that courts will not the public health and safety decisions of state legislatures acting within their traditional police powers.however,under federal antidiscrimination laws such as the ada which require reasonable modifications to public health and safety policies,it is incumbent upon the courts to insure that the mandate of federal law is achieved.

the nyslrs argues that title ii requires reasonable modification only of rules,policies,or practices not state statutes,nyslrs br,and seeks to distinguish crowder,which contemplated the modification of a mandatory hawaii state administrative regulation rather than a state statute,see crowder,at,on this ground,nyslrs br.but as a general rule,duly promulgated state regulations have the force of law for these purposes as do statutes.see,state kotis,under hawaii law,a dministrative rules,like statutes,have the force and effect of law.allstate ins.rivera,under new york law,a duly promulgated regulation has the force of law.internal quotation marks omitted.from the standpoint of the ada preemptive force,we can discern no reason to distinguish between the preemption of state statutes and state regulations.crosby,at noting that a variety of state laws and regulations may conflict with a federal statute and be preempted.and for the reasons discussed above,we do not read the ada to prohibit reasonable modifications to state statutes when appropriate.
we have examined nyslrs other arguments regarding title ii and find them unpersuasive.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiff title ii claim against the nyslrs on the ground that r equiring the state defendant to violate state law is not a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law.mary jo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.because the determination of what constitutes reasonable modification is a highly,inquiry,w hether the plaintiff proposed alternative to new york filing deadline constitute s a reasonable modification or a fundamental alteration can not be determined as a matter of law on the record before us.crowder,at see also mcgary city of portland,cir t he question of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation under the ada requires a,individualized analysis of the disabled individual circumstances and the accommodations that might allow him to meet the program standards.quoting wong regents of of,cir.
e.the district court decision as to whether the plaintiff adequately alleged that she is disabled 
again title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.emphasis added.a disability is defined as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.major life activities are further defined to include caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,seeing,hearing,eating,sleeping,walking,standing,lifting,bending,speaking,breathing,learning,reading,concentrating,thinking,communicating,and working.
although neither defendant argued to the district court that the plaintiff had failed to plead adequately that she was disabled within the meaning of the ada,the district court considered the issue sua sponte.it concluded 
the complaint does not sufficiently allege that plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the ada.although plaintiff alleges that she has suffered from an unidentified mental illness since adolescence,she does not allege any additional facts plausibly suggesting that such mental illness substantially limited one or more of her major life activities.accordingly,plaintiff complaint does not state a cognizable claim under title ii of the ada.see,tylicki onge,app x,cir,finding that the plaintiff complaint did not adequately plead a disability under title ii of the ada where it contained no allegations describing how his supposed mental condition substantially limited a major life activity.

although the district court noted that it would be possible for plaintiff to amend her title ii claims to sufficiently plead this element as against the library unless those claims would otherwise be futile,id.at,dist.lexis,at,it did not afford the plaintiff this opportunity because it concluded that all of the plaintiff claims against both defendants were barred on other sufficient,independent grounds.
on appeal,the plaintiff submits that the failure to provide her with an opportunity to present evidence of disability can be cured by the usual practice of this court to grant a party leave to amend the complaint on a rule b motion.pl.br.citing bellikoff eaton vance,cir w hen a motion to dismiss is granted,the usual practice is to grant leave to amend the complaint.internal quotation marks omitted.
inasmuch as the district court thought that it would be possible for the plaintiff to amend her allegations regarding her disability such that at least some claims could go forward,mary jo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,in light of the fact that the plaintiff has now requested leave to amend on appeal,and since our decision today removes the futility the district court saw in allowing the plaintiff to amend her complaint at least as to claims against the nyslrs,we decline to pass on the sufficiency of the plaintiff allegations of disability on appeal.instead,we vacate the district court decision in this regard,and remand with instructions to grant the plaintiff motion for leave to amend her complaint to plead adequate allegations of disability if such a motion is made.
title ii abrogation of sovereign immunity 
nyslrs argues that even if the plaintiff can state a claim against it under title ii,title ii fails to validly abrogate the state sovereign immunity for the reasonable modification claim made here.nyslrs br.the plaintiff responds that,a s appellant mary jo seeks injunctive relief in connection with her claim against nyslrs,this court can avoid adjudication of the eleventh amendment issue by permitting the appellant to amend her complaint to name a state official in his official capacity as a defendant.pl.reply br.

ii.title ii claim against the library 
a.the district court decision 
the plaintiff also asserted a claim against the library alleging that its failure to file an application on her behalf or to reclassify her termination as an unpaid leave of absence violated title ii of the ada.as noted,the ada forbids discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major areas of public life employment,which is covered by title i of the statute public services,programs,and activities,which are the subject of title ii and public accommodations,which are covered by title iii.lane,at.the district court dismissed this claim because it concluded that the plaintiff,an employee of the library,could bring a claim against her employer under title i of the ada but not under title ii.
title i of the ada,employment,provides in pertinent part that n o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.title i applies to government employers,which are covered entities.
noting that the supreme court and the second circuit ha ve not expressly considered th e issue of whether title ii applies to employment discrimination,mary jo,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,and acknowledging that courts are split on the issue,id.at,dist.lexis,at,the district court followed what it described as the decisions of the most recent district court cases in this circuit,to conclude that title i of the ada is the exclusive remedy for plaintiff claims of discrimination against the library,all of which relate to the terms,conditions,and privileges of her employment with that entity,id.at,dist.lexis,at alteration in original quoting a.
the district court also cited zimmerman oregon dep t of justice,cir,as the leading case concluding that public employees exclusive remedy against their employers under the ada is title zimmerman concluded that congress unambiguously expressed its intent for title ii not to apply to employment.id.at.it reasoned that a common understanding of the term services,programs,or activities in title ii command that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,referred only to the outputs of a public agency,not to inputs such as employment.id.at.
first,employment by a public entity is not commonly thought of as a service,program,or activity of a public entity.second,the action words in the sentence presuppose that the public entity provides an output that is generally available,and that an individual seeks to participate in or receive the benefit of such an output.
consider,for example,how a parks department would answer the question,what are the services,programs,and activities of the parks department it might answer,we operate a swimming pool we lead nature walks we maintain playgrounds.it would not answer,we buy lawnmowers and hire people to operate them.the latter is a means to deliver the services,programs,and activities of the hypothetical parks department,but it is not itself a service,program,or activity of the parks department.similarly,consider how a member of the public would answer the question,what are the services,programs,and activities of the parks department in which you want to participate,or whose benefits you seek to receive the individual might answer,i want to participate in the wednesday night basketball league,or find out about the free children programs for the summer months.the individual would not logically answer,i want to go to work for the parks department.
the zimmerman court concluded that when viewed as a whole,the text,context and structure of the ada show unambiguously that congress did not intend for title ii to apply to employment.under these circumstances,we do not resort to legislative history,and we do not defer to the attorney general regulation,id.at,which provides that title ii does apply to employment actions against public employers,see a.contra bledsoe palm beach county soil water conservation,cir extensive legislative commentary regarding the applicability of title ii to employment discrimination in the ada legislative history is so pervasive as to belie any contention that title ii does not apply to employment actions.
in addition to cases following zimmerman analysis,the district court noted dicta from the supreme court decision in board of trustees of university of alabama garrett,d 
n o party has briefed the question of whether title ii of the ada is available for claims of employment discrimination when title i of the ada expressly deals with that subject.see,e,russello united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion internal quotation marks omitted.
