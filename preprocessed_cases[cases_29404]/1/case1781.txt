petitioner winnie greer appeals a judgment of the tax court finding her ineligible for relief from joint and several liability for federal income tax deficiencies and additions to tax arising from disallowed investment credits claimed on her tax return and carryback refunds claimed for the previous three years.greer sought relief based on the tax code provision,b,and provision,f.the tax court denied relief because greer failed to discharge her duty to inquire into the benefits reflected in her and her husband joint tax filings.the tax court denied equitable relief largely on the same basis.because we can not say that the tax court clearly erred or abused its discretion,we affirm.
background 
the tax court set forth the relevant facts,which the parties do not dispute 
at the time the petition was filed,petitioner resided in kentucky.
petitioner graduated from high school in floyd county,kentucky,in.she then attended the university of kentucky,for years and transferred to louisiana state university from where she graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in music in.petitioner also received a master degree in music education from marshall university in.petitioner did not pursue studies in economics,finance,or accounting in her formal education.
petitioner married daniel greer in,and they remain married.petitioner and greer have two daughters,born in and in.greer is a licensed chemical engineer and was employed by ashland oil,from through july.
from september through may petitioner was employed as a high school music teacher.after that she pursued graduate studies and raised her daughters.from to she acted as a choir director at the episcopal church where she and greer became members sometime in and.
in petitioner began a photography business.she specialized in wedding and portrait photography.she opened her first photography studio in late in the family home.improvements were made to the home in,and the structure remained petitioner photography studio even after petitioner and her family moved their residence in.
throughout the years of her marriage up to and including the years in issue,petitioner relied upon greer to manage their financial affairs.greer did not conceal any financial activities from petitioner or mislead her with respect to those activities.however,he was the primary decisionmaker,and she relied upon him to direct their investments and make decisions regarding their finances and taxes.
in greer and petitioner father founded g l communications,g l,a closely held cable television business that operated in boyd and greenup counties of kentucky.g l was taxed as an s corporation until the sale of its assets in november.petitioner and greer each owned shares of g l stock.petitioner was not active in g l management,nor was she an employee of g l.in petitioner and greer each continued to own shares.they each received a cash distribution of attributable to their respective portions of the proceeds of the sale.thus their combined distribution from g l was.following the sale of g l assets in,two identical forms,statement for receipts of dividends and distributions,were issued to petitioner and greer,each reflecting a dividend distribution of,a capital gain distribution of,and a nontaxable distribution of for a total distribution to each of.
motivated by the anticipated income tax consequences of the g l dividends and distributions,greer invested in madison recycling associates,madison.the background of this transaction and its consequences are fully described in previous judicial opinions,greer commissioner greer i,cch,wl,madison recycling associates commissioner,cir,affg.cch,wl,and madison recycling associates commissioner,cch,wl.we simply note here that the result of those opinions is that respondent has assessed joint deficiencies in income tax and additions to tax against petitioner and greer for the years through.these deficiencies and additions to tax are the liabilities from which petitioner seeks section relief.the parties previously agreed that any request by petitioner for relief from joint and several liability under section would not be determined in the most recent tax court litigation reflected in greer i.
the joint income tax return for petitioner and greer was prepared by john artis.artis advised greer that because the tax benefits associated with madison significantly exceeded the dollars invested,the madison investment was fairly aggressive.petitioner was not a party to those discussions and relied totally on greer to make the decision to claim the tax benefits associated with madison.greer chose not to seek an opinion from artis regarding the merits of the madison transaction.in greer i,we found as fact that greer expected that madison would provide tax savings of approximately for each dollar invested,and the record in this case is consistent with that finding.
on december,greer signed a check for payable to madison and drawn on the joint checking account of petitioner and greer to purchase a limited partnership interest in madison.this was the only checking account that petitioner and greer had at the time.at the time of the madison investment,petitioner knew greer was purchasing an interest in madison,and they briefly discussed the madison transaction before the investment.
in march madison filed a partnership return for the taxable year ended december,which reported a loss of and a tax credit basis of million.petitioner and greer filed joint individual income tax returns for the years,and.the losses and investment credits reported on the joint returns for,and were as follows 
of the credit reported on the joint federal income tax return,the net credit used in from madison totaled because was eliminated in the alternative minimum tax computation,and only an additional was allowed as a credit against alternative minimum tax.as a result,credits were available to be carried back to,and.
the distributions from g l were reported on the joint return.reflecting the listed ownership of shares by each,the dividends and capital gain distributions reflected on the federal income tax return were divided equally between greer and petitioner on two separate forms,kentucky individual income tax return,which were filed using the status married filing separately.petitioner signed both the federal joint income tax return and her separate kentucky form for.on february,petitioner and greer signed a form,application for tentative refund,for the years,and,seeking a refund totaling as a result of carrying back to those years the credits from the madison investment.subsequently in august petitioner also signed a declaration relating to the form,which was requested by the internal revenue service to confirm the execution of the original form.petitioner discussed the execution of this declaration with greer.in october three refund checks related to the form were deposited into the joint account of petitioner and greer.the total deposit resulting from these checks was.there is no explanation in the record for the discrepancy of between this amount and the amount claimed on the form.petitioner did not review the joint federal income tax return,nor did she review the form.petitioner did not ask greer for details about the madison investment,and she did not ask greer or artis any questions about the joint federal income tax return or the form.however,petitioner was aware of the madison investment.
greer comm r greer ii,cch,wl,at.
the internal revenue service irs began auditing madison in and issued a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa disallowing the partnership claimed tax benefits in.greer comm r greer ii,cir in madison partners challenged the fpaa on grounds,beginning what would be a legal battle.in,the greers filed amended returns for,remitting a check for to cover the disallowed benefits plus interest and penalties.the greers then brought suit in federal district court to recover those funds.the case was dismissed pending the outcome of the madison litigation,but the court ordered the irs in the meantime to refund the money,plus interest,which it did.
the tax court upheld the fpaa for madison in,and the second circuit affirmed in.madison,cch,aff,cir.on september,the irs issued the greers a notice of deficiency for in tax and in interest.the greers challenged the amount,but both the tax court and the sixth circuit denied relief.greer i,cch,aff,greer iii.on september,greer submitted form,requesting relief from the deficiency as an innocent spouse.on december,the irs denied her request,finding that she knew of the madison investment,that the money for the investment was drawn from the greers joint bank account,that she signed the form requesting refunds,and that she received the benefit of those refunds.an appeals officer then denied her appeal,based on her failure to inquire into the claimed deductions 
greer acknowledges that she was aware of greer investment in madison and that she did not inquire about the large deduction and credits claimed with respect to madison t he madison loss deduction and investment tax credit itc business energy investment credit beic were large enough to put greer on notice even given her limited involvement in the family financial affairs and educational background that further inquiry was warranted to determine the legitimacy of those tax benefits.this is especially true given that the carryback of the from madison to,and essentially eliminated the tax the couple previously paid for these years,respectively.
supplemental appendix at.the appeals officer also determined that it would not be inequitable to hold greer liable,noting that her claim that the debt would wipe out over half of her net worth did not amount to economic hardship.the appeals officer noted that greer had declined a settlement offer of fifty percent relief of the deficiency.at.
greer then petitioned for review by the tax court.the tax court held a trial on january.in addition to the evidence summarized above,the court heard testimony that greer never believed that the irs would disallow his claimed losses,that greer generally felt she should not question greer financial decisions,and that greer probably would support greer if she were granted relief and the irs collected all of his assets.the documentary record reflected that as of september,greer assets totaled.as of june,the irs estimated the accrued liability at.
on january,the tax court entered judgment for the irs,finding that greer did not qualify as an innocent spouse because she should have at least made further inquiry about the extraordinary tax benefits reflected on the joint return for.greer ii,wl,at.the court found that rather than having no reason to know of the tax understatement,as required for relief,she chose not to know.id.the court next considered several factors in determining whether greer merited equitable relief.it found that she had failed to prove that economic hardship would result from full liability,that she had not shown that she had no reason to know of the understatement,that she had not received any unusual financial benefit from the money withheld,and that she had complied with the tax laws following the years in question.id.at.placing special emphasis on her failure to establish that she had no reason to know of the deficiency,the court denied relief.id.greer timely filed this appeal.

section b relief 
pursuant to d,taxpayers filing joint returns are jointly and severally liable for any understatement of tax.a taxpayer is excepted from this general rule if he or she can establish status as an innocent spouse under.a taxpayer who is still married,as greer is,bears the burden of establishing each of the following five elements to qualify for the exception 
a a joint return has been made for a taxable year 
b on such return there is an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of one individual filing the joint return 
c the other individual filing the joint return establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know,and had no reason to know,that there was such understatement 
d taking into account all the facts and circumstances,it is inequitable to hold the other individual liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such understatement and 
e the other individual elects in such form as the secretary may prescribe the benefits of this subsection not later than the date which is years after the date the secretary has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election.
b richardson comm r,cir.here,the government agreed that greer meets elements a and e.see greer ii,wl,at.greer now makes arguments about element b,contending under a nominee theory that the understatement is attributable only to greer because he was the true owner of the shares of g l whose sale profits the madison losses offset,and about element d,noting that she did not benefit from the tax windfall and that liability would cause her economic hardship.the tax court,however,did not reach these issues,and they are not properly before us on appeal.the tax court denied relief entirely on the basis of element c,the requirement that the taxpayer did not know,and had no reason to know,of the deficiency.the parties stipulate that greer had no actual knowledge of the tax deficiency.pet r br.at.thus,the sole issue that we confront in reviewing the denial of relief here is whether greer established that she had no reason to know of the understatement resulting from the madison losses.
courts have interpreted the element to encompass two separate types of constructive knowledge.first,a spouse may have reason to know of an understatement reflected on the tax filings.second,even if a spouse does not have reason to know of an understatement,he or she nonetheless may have reason to know of a possible understatement,giving rise to a duty to inquire into that possibility.kistner comm r,cir price comm r,cir.as the ninth circuit has explained 
even if a spouse is not aware of sufficient facts to give her reason to know of the substantial understatement,she nevertheless may know enough facts to put her on notice that such an understatement exists.such notice is provided if the spouse knows sufficient facts such that a reasonably prudent taxpayer in her position would be led to question the legitimacy of the deduction.in such a scenario,a duty of inquiry arises,which,if not satisfied by the spouse,may result in constructive knowledge of the understatement being imputed to her.
price,at citations omitted.here,the tax court invoked the latter ground,holding that greer knew enough to trigger a duty of inquiry,which she failed to discharge.greer ii,wl,at.we therefore review whether the tax court clearly erred in determining that greer had a responsibility to inquire about a possible understatement on the greers filings.
applicable legal test 
as an initial matter,this case presents us the opportunity to decide what test should be used in determining whether a taxpayer had a reason to know of an understatement,or to suspect a possible understatement,resulting from disallowed deductions or credits.the tax court previously has stated that in all is,in both and will find that a taxpayer had reason to know of an understatement if he or she had knowledge of the transaction giving rise to the claimed tax benefits.see bokum comm r,aff on other grounds,cir.we have followed this test in cases.see kosinski comm r,cir holding that taxpayer was not entitled to relief when she knew of and played an active role in fraudulent transactions that allowed couple to income richardson,at same,when taxpayer knew of transactions that shielded couple income from taxation purcell comm r,cir denying relief from liability for omitted income when taxpayer knew of transaction giving rise to that income,and denying relief from liability for impermissible deductions when taxpayer could not prove that the deductions that her spouse had taken had no basis in law or fact,as required by an older version of the provision.we have not applied the test to cases.
in price commissioner,the ninth circuit pointed out that the test is appropriate in cases,but not in cases 
we decline to follow the tax court literal superimposition of the legal standard developed in omission cases onto deduction cases in part because to do so would for the most part wipe out innocent spouse protection in the latter category.such a standard may be workable in omission cases simply because the understatement is caused by includable income being left off a return.therefore,it is considerably easier for a spouse to show that she was unaware of the transaction giving rise to the omission,and thus to qualify for relief.but because deductions are necessarily recorded,any spouse who at least reads the joint return will be put on notice that some transaction allegedly has occurred to give rise to the deduction.as a result,if knowledge of the transaction,operating of itself,were to bar relief,a spouse would be extremely ever to be able to satisfy the lack of actual and constructive knowledge element of section b in a deduction case.
thus,adoption of such an interpretation would do violence to the intent congress clearly expressed when it expanded coverage of the provision to include relief for spouses from deficiencies caused by deductions for which there is no basis in fact or law.it would also hinder congress broader purpose in enacting section b that of seeking to remedy an giving the section an unduly narrow and restrictive reading.
price,at citations omitted.the court went on to hold that in cases,a spouse has reason to know of the substantial understatement if a reasonably prudent taxpayer in her position at the time she signed the return could be expected to know that the return contained the substantial understatement.id.at.it identified four factors to be considered in making that inquiry the spouse education,the spouse involvement in the family financial affairs,the presence of unusual or lavish expenditures beyond the family norm,and the other spouse evasiveness or deceitfulness concerning the family finances.id.
all circuits to have ruled on the price approach have adopted its test for cases.see hayman comm r,cir reser comm r,cir resser comm r,cir erdahl comm r,cir kistner comm r,cir.one circuit has declined to decide the issue.see doyle comm r,app x,cir unpublished opinion holding that the petitioner could not prevail under either the test or the price test.in an unpublished order,a panel of this court applied the price factors in an situation,but it did not cite price.see streck comm r,wl,at cir.june,unpublished order see also alt,app x at citing streck and applying the factors in an case.in the instant case,the tax court applied price,and the commissioner has briefed the test four factors.
based on the persuasive logic of the ninth circuit and on our own case law,we now join our sister circuits in formally adopting the price test for cases.the test leaves room for a taxpayer to claim relief in claims,because the understatement arises in such cases from information being left off a return,and the spouse otherwise may not have known or had reason to know that information.in cases,the understatement arises from information being included on the return,so a spouse who signs a tax return necessarily learns of the transaction the test writes the provision out of the law in such cases.a more nuanced approach is thus required,especially given that an understatement arising from a deduction usually is not obvious from the face of a tax return.a taxpayer who knows how much money the family earned will know that tax has been understated if income is omitted from the return,as it is common knowledge that income is taxable.see price,at.by contrast,a taxpayer who is aware of an investment may or may not know that tax benefits claimed on its basis are impermissible,depending on that taxpayer level of sophistication and how much he or she knows about the investment.see reser,at i n the,it was common knowledge that investors could legally obtain large tax benefits through clever investment strategies.the price test takes account of this difference.
the price test also is consistent with our own binding case law.in shea commissioner,cir,we applied a test under which a taxpayer reason to know of an understatement depends on the circumstances which face the taxpayer and whether a reasonable person in the same position would infer that omissions or erroneous deductions had been made.id.at.in establishing this test,we relied on sanders united states,cir,which set out three of the four factors later adopted by the ninth circuit in price.shea,at.the price test provides a helpful way of guiding the inquiry that we established for cases years ago in shea.
while the price factors are used to determine whether a spouse had reason to know of an understatement,they may also be employed to determine whether a spouse had a duty of inquiry.park,at kistner,at erdahl,at.in cases,courts have also considered whether the tax returns set forth deductions or credits large enough,relative to the size of the underlying investment or of reported income,to prod a reasonable taxpayer into further investigation.see reser,at,friedman comm r,cir park,at price,at.
application 
the tax court held that greer had a duty to inquire into the legitimacy of the tax benefits claimed on the basis of the madison investment 
three of the four price factors would support the conclusion that petitioner should have at least made further inquiry about the extraordinary tax benefits reflected on the joint return for.she knew there was substantial additional income,yet she signed forms reflecting tax refunds generated in the years through as a result of the reporting of the madison investment.almost in refunds was deposited into the same joint checking account on which the check of for the madison investment was drawn.these refunds were in addition to tax savings of over sought through the aggressive reporting of the madison transaction on the joint return for.petitioner chose not to know she was not deceived or misled.
greer ii,wl,at.we review the price factors to determine whether the tax court clearly erred in holding that a reasonable person with greer background and in her circumstances would have known to inquire into the stated tax liability.
education greer has a master degree in music education,but she has no specific education in financial affairs.the tax court emphasized that she is an intelligent,person and weighed this factor against her.greer ii,wl,at.the cases are clear,however,that it is financial education,not education in general,that matters.see reser,at noting that taxpayer with law degree had an education that albeit advanced,provided her with no special knowledge of complex tax issues resser,at holding that education factor favored spouse who had master degree in medical communications because her training gave her no special understanding of finance alt,app x at evaluating taxpayer with master degree in education and noting that courts have examined the type of education received,specifically,whether the education provided a special knowledge of complex tax issues internal quotation marks omitted korchak,wl,at in granting relief,emphasizing that taxpayer with in physiology had no financial training.
involvement in family finances the tax court observed that greer knew of the g l distributions,signed tax returns and the form request for refunds,and shared a joint checking account with greer from which the madison investment was made.greer ii,wl,at.these facts,however,mainly go to greer awareness of the madison transaction.the facts relevant to her involvement
