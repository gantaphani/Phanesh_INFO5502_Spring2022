mohammed bayo is not the most sympathetic of litigants.he is a citizen of guinea,but he stole a belgian passport and used it to enter the united states fraudulently.why,one might ask,would he go to the trouble of doing this guineans are entitled to visit the united states,provided they observe the required formalities.but guinea is not one of the countries that comes within the state department visa waiver program vwp belgium is.see visa waiver program vwp.html countries last visited.bayo ploy enabled him to enter with a minimum of bureaucratic fuss and then to evade detection for more than four years.
his luck ran out only when he pushed it by petitioning for adjustment of status based on his marriage to an american citizen.the government knew that someone had entered with the illegal belgian passport,and bayo petition enabled it to connect that passport to him.at that point,the department of homeland security dhs promptly processed his removal without a hearing,as it normally would with any legitimate vwp participant who overstays his visit.summary procedures are the quid pro quo for the united states government waiver of the normal visa requirements.bayo waiver was memorialized in the form vwp waiver that he signed upon his arrival in the united states.the wrinkle is that the form was in english,and bayo asserts that he speaks only french.
before us is bayo petition for review of dhs administrative order of removal.see a.bayo offers three reasons why we should grant the petition and remand the case for plenary removal proceedings before an immigration judge ij.the advantage of such proceedings is that he would be able,in principle,to seek relief from removal in them such relief is not available in the summary vwp process.first,bayo contends that the vwp waiver he signed is void ab initio,because he is a guinean citizen and the program can not be applied in any way to citizens of countries.second,he argues that his lack of english proficiency renders invalid the particular waiver he signed,as he did not know what he was signing,and in his view his waiver must be assessed according to the familiar standard that applies to constitutional rights.third,he asserts that even if the waiver is valid,he should nevertheless be permitted to pursue his application.although there is merit in some of his points,in the end we conclude that he can not demonstrate prejudice from the errors that occurred here.we therefore deny his petition for review.
the visa waiver pilot program was established by congress to determine if a visa waiver provision could facilitate international travel and promote the more effective use of the resources of affected government agencies visa waiver pilot program,june.only citizens of vwp countries may participate in the program,and just countries currently qualify.see a.the vwp operates through a reciprocal waiver arrangement the united states waives its visa requirement,and in exchange,the visitor waives her right to contest admissibility determinations or removal except for asylum.see a,b.vwp entrants are also treated differently,and perhaps more favorably,when they apply for asylum,because they are entitled to bypass the process and proceed directly to an ij.see b.bayo has not argued that he would be entitled to asylum,and so we have no need to discuss that possibility further.
at the time of bayo entry,the terms of the vwp were memorialized in form,which had to be filled out and signed by all vwp entrants upon their arrival in the united states.it describes the visitor waiver of rights as follows 
waiver of rights i hereby waive any rights to review or appeal of an immigration officer determination as to my admissibility,or to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action in deportation.
the form further elaborates on the conditions that apply to the visitor sojourn in the united states 
warning you may not accept unauthorized employment or attend school or represent the foreign information media during your visit under this program.you are authorized to stay in the for days or less.you may not apply for a change of nonimmigrant status adjustment of status to temporary or permanent resident,unless eligible under section b of the ina or an extension of stay.violation of these terms will subject you to deportation.
in response to the implementing recommendations of the commission act of,stat,the dhs recently implemented the new electronic system for travel authorization esta,which requires visitors to fill out the form online in advance of travel to the united states.see the electronic system for travel authorization mandatory compliance required for travel under the visa waiver program.the form is now offered in different languages on the esta website.see welcome to esta.last visited.
as we noted at the outset,bayo is a native and citizen of guinea,and guinea is not a vwp country.belgium is,however,and bayo acquired a stolen passport from that country that enabled him to enter the united states without a proper visa on july.upon arrival at newark airport,bayo signed an form,even though he asserts that he neither speaks nor reads english.bayo overstayed the days to which an ordinary vwp traveler is entitled and eventually settled in indianapolis,indiana,where he met tatiana sia,a united states citizen.on april,he married her.he then sought an adjustment of status to legal permanent resident status based on that marriage.
on september,immigration and customs enforcement ice received information from the national security investigation division,compliance enforcement unit that bayo had entered the united states illegally under a belgian passport.this information with its immigration files enabled ice to locate bayo pending and applications for lawful permanent residence status based on marriage.ice officers visited bayo home on november,and questioned him about his immigration status.he freely admitted to using the stolen passport and turned it over.the dhs then promptly ordered bayo removal,selecting as the basis for its action bayo overstay under the vwp.fraud was another potential removal ground.in accordance with the terms of the form that he signed,bayo received no removal hearing.
as a preliminary matter,we must briefly discuss our authority to act in this case,as the vwp waiver bayo signed might be read to preclude judicial review.the first two issues that bayo raises challenge the fundamental validity of the vwp waiver itself his third point concerns a potential exception to the waiver.the scope of our review is narrow,but confers authority on the courts of appeals to review vwp decisions,among others.other mechanisms,including notably habeas corpus,are no longer open to persons resisting vwp removal orders.see a.at a minimum,we may consider whether the statutory criteria on which the vwp rests have been met.compare ashcroft,cir court has jurisdiction to determine whether a particular alien claim falls within the scope of a statute see generally united states ruiz,d i t is familiar law that a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.the predicate questions we may look at here include whether bayo vwp waiver is valid and whether he may invoke a valid exception to his waiver.we may not consider more generally whether bayo might be entitled to stay in the country on some other ground,such as,for example,by adjusting his status based on his marriage.
these limitations define our inquiry in this appeal.three questions are properly before us first,may an alien who is not eligible for the vwp,but who enters using fraudulent documents that trigger use of the vwp,be held to the terms of the vwp waiver second,what is the standard for the waiver of the procedural rights that are covered by the vwp and third,assuming a valid vwp waiver,does an alien who entered under the vwp and then overstayed have an independent right to adjust his status on the basis of marriage to a united states citizen 
in their original briefs,the parties did not address the question whether bayo vwp waiver is void because he is not a citizen of a vwp country.because we thought that this question was potentially dispositive of the case,we requested supplemental briefing on it.
in his supplemental brief,bayo notes that the statutory language establishing the vwp does not say anything about nationals of countries possibly being eligible for the program.he infers from that silence that the vwp is entirely inapplicable to citizens of countries.he then reasons that he can not be held to the terms of a vwp waiver that never should have been before him in the first place.the final step in his argument is the assertion that he must therefore be subject to ordinary removal procedures including a hearing before an ij just as if he had never entered under the vwp.see a an immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.see also a a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states or,if the alien has been so admitted,removed from the united states.
the government concedes that the statutory language establishing the vwp does not specifically mention the admission of aliens from countries,but it does not attach such an elaborate set of consequences to this silence.it takes the position that the vwp regulations,which it says are entitled to deference under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,address the possibility of aliens fraudulently entering under the program.those regulations also,in its view,mean that someone in bayo position may be held to the terms of the vwp waiver.the government further appeals to the background principle of immigration law under which aliens should generally be held to the terms of their entry.to hold otherwise,the government argues,would allow savvy aliens to manipulate the vwp and would hinder the government attempts to remove promptly aliens who have abused the system.
to begin,we must reject bayo contention that statutory silence tells us very much.see negusie holder,d noting that statutory silence is not conclusive.silence might signify something about the scope of a statute,but it equally might highlight an issue that congress did not anticipate or that it chose to leave open.it is under these circumstances that congress has implicitly delegated authority to the relevant agency to resolve the issue.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d a mbiguities in statutes within an agency jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.
in our view,the attorney general appropriately has acted here to clarify the scope of the vwp as it pertains to certain abuses of the program,insofar as the vwp regulations address the situation of ineligible aliens entering fraudulently under the vwp.see a mentioning vwp applicants who might be ineligible or who present fraudulent documents b noting that aliens who have been admitted under the vwp are deportable under the program if they are deportable under one of the grounds listed in.the board of immigration appeals also has interpreted the regulations to apply to aliens.see in re kanagasundram,t he provisions of are not limited to aliens who are actually nationals of vwpp designated countries,but specifically encompass individuals who present fraudulent and counterfeit travel documents from such countries.see also zine mukasey,cir holding that aliens entering under the vwp should be held to the vwp waiver terms.
in assessing those regulations,our first question is whether we find the statute ambiguous.as we indicated earlier,we do the fact that it says nothing about nationals of countries creates the ambiguity that drives both bayo and the government arguments.the vwp regulations answer that ambiguity by applying the terms of the program to those who enter under the vwp,even if they are ineligible for it.our only task under chevron is to determine whether the attorney general interpretation,as expressed in the vwp regulations,is reasonable.we find that it is.there is little reason to think that congress would have wanted to confer the benefits of the vwp on ineligible aliens while sparing them the costs of entering under the program.we say this in full recognition of the fact that applying the terms of the vwp to ineligible aliens may also confer on them the possible benefit in asylum cases of being able to skip the interview and proceed directly to an ij.see kanagasundram,at.but the fact that there may be some benefits to the ineligible aliens as well as burdens simply means that the attorney general had to balance several factors in the course of interpreting the statute.he was entitled,in doing so,to adopt an approach that preserves the government ability to remove aliens who fraudulently enter under the vwp just as promptly as it can remove legitimate vwp entrants.
our conclusion on this issue is in line with our earlier decisions.we have dismissed attempts by aliens to take control of their removal proceedings for overstay by pleading fraud.see milande ins,cir to prove overstay,the respondent need only show a nonimmigrant admission for a temporary period,that the period has elapsed,and that the nonimmigrant has not departed.any fraud or misrepresentation at time of entry is irrelevant to the charge of overstay.we have also safeguarded the government ability to select the ground on which to remove aliens who are here illegally.see ntovas ahrens,cir in the administrative proceedings the ground selected and relied upon by the government was not fraud or misrepresentation and plaintiff has not the power to substitute for his own convenience a ground not involved in the deportation proceedings.the government in this case was therefore entitled to select overstay under the terms of the vwp as the ground for removing bayo.
immigration law draws a bright line between an alien who has effected an entry into the united states and one who has never entered.zadvydas davis,d.we acknowledge that those who stand at the threshold of admission are subject to special rules.see shaughnessy united states.a n alien on the threshold of initial entry stands on a different footing whatever the procedure authorized by congress is,it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.internal quotation marks omitted.the parties,however,do not dispute that bayo has entered the united states,and so the entry fiction doctrine does not apply to him.once he crossed the border,bayo became entitled to certain constitutional rights,including the right to due process.see plyler doe,d aliens,even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful,have long been recognized as persons guaranteed due process of law by the fifth and fourteenth amendments.yick wo hopkins.the fourteenth amendment to the constitution is not confined to the protection of citizens its provisions are universal in their application,to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction.
the government argues that bayo waived these rights by signing the vwp form,but bayo counters that the waiver he signed is invalid because he did not understand it.if the vwp waiver were a contract,bayo argument would almost certainly fail.see paper express,pfankuch maschinen gmbh,cir a party who agrees to terms in writing without understanding or investigating those terms does so at his own peril.williston on contracts ed.one who signs or accepts a written contract,in the absence of fraud or other wrongful act on the part of another contracting party,is conclusively presumed to know its contents and to assent to them.the vwp waiver,however,is no normal contract.it includes a waiver of the right to a full immigration hearing that waiver implicates both statutory rights and,in the final analysis,the constitutional right to due process.
in criminal cases,courts both indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.johnson zerbst.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court also has established constitutional standards for waivers of constitutional rights in civil cases.see fuentes shevin,d in the civil area,the court has said
