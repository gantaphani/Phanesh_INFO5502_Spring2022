this appeal turns primarily on the standard of review that courts should apply when examining conclusions reached by the internal revenue service irs following a collection due process cdp hearing.see b.while courts generally have agreed that review in this context is for abuse of discretion,no court has had the occasion to parse that standard and analyze how it plays out with respect to subsidiary factual and legal determinations made by the irs during the cdp process.we grapple with that issue today.
the issue arises in a case in which the taxpayers offered to settle their tax liability for pennies on the dollar.the irs determined that the taxpayers could afford to pay more because they owned valuable real estate and,therefore,rejected the offer in compromise.in a appeal,the tax court reviewed the irs underlying ownership determination de novo,found that the taxpayers were not the owners of the real estate in question,and directed the irs to accept the offer in compromise.it later ordered the irs to pay attorneys fees to the taxpayers as prevailing parties.
we hold that the tax court employed an improper standard of review with respect to the irs subsidiary determinations.applying a more deferential standard to these determinations consistent with the nature and purpose of the cdp process,we conclude that the irs did not abuse its discretion when it rejected the taxpayers offer in compromise.the irs acted reasonably in determining that the taxpayers were the owners of the property and,thus,the equity in the property was appropriately considered when the irs evaluated the compromise offer.consequently,we reverse the tax court judgment.
background 
the taxpayers are a married couple arthur dalton,and beverly dalton.in and,respectively,they purchased two adjacent lots abutting thompson lake in poland,maine.in,they deeded both lots,subject to an existing mortgage,to arthur dalton,the father of arthur dalton,for.although the grantee agreed to assume the mortgage,the record contains no evidence that the mortgagee released the taxpayers from liability.
in,arthur dalton,purchased an abutting lot.he then deeded all three lots the property to a grantor trust of his creation.he appointed himself as the sole trustee,specified that the trust would expire upon the death of the last survivor of himself and the taxpayers,and designated the taxpayers children as the trust beneficiaries.
notwithstanding these maneuvers,the record contains substantial evidence suggesting that the taxpayers continued to treat the property as their own.for one thing,they continued to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of the property.for another thing,long after the trust had taken title,beverly dalton a new mortgage on the property and,in the mortgage papers,represented herself to be an owner of the property 
the property contains a large house,and the taxpayers moved into the house in.the impetus for the move was the failure of their business and the consequent loss of their massachusetts home.the property has remained their principal residence since that time.the taxpayers have never had a written lease,but they insist that they entered into an oral lease with the trustee.they assert that under the terms of the oral lease,they agreed to care for the trustee elderly wife,manage and maintain the property,and pay rent roughly equal to the amount needed to defray mortgage payments and real estate taxes.
arthur dalton,passed away in.the trust indenture gave arthur dalton,the power to name a successor trustee.he appointed robert pray beverly dalton brother.the widow of arthur dalton,entered an facility a few years later.since then,the taxpayers have been the sole inhabitants of the property.they continue to maintain the premises and supply funds to the trust sufficient to cover the mortgage payments and real estate taxes.beverly dalton,who has the power to sign checks written on the trust account,ensures that mortgage and tax payments are kept current.
the record also indicates that the trustees and the taxpayers have been less than scrupulous in observing certain formalities.to cite one example,the trust did not file any tax returns until after the present controversy with the irs was under way.to cite another example,the mortgagee,key bank,has since forwarded paperwork to arthur dalton,indicating that he is the payor of the mortgage and,thus,the person eligible to take the concomitant interest deduction for tax purposes.
in,the taxpayers refinanced the mortgage.the bank records anent the new mortgage list the taxpayers as the owners of the property.
the current trustee,pray,lives in texas but insists that he controls the trust corpus.he claims that he speaks to the taxpayers three to four times per year regarding the property and that he visits annually to ensure its condition.he has kept no records or even notes commemorating any of these meetings or discussions.
the taxpayers troubles with the irs began just before their business went bankrupt.the taxpayers owned and operated challenger construction,which in withheld payroll taxes but never paid the retained amounts to the united states.the irs determined that the taxpayers were personally liable for those amounts.see a jean united states,cir.with accrued interest,the taxpayers alleged indebtedness now exceeds.
in perhaps eyeing the taxpayers equity in the property the irs gave notice of its intent to levy.see a.the taxpayers did not dispute the amount of taxes owed but,rather,requested a cdp hearing and offered to settle their debt for a total of.see id.b,c a iii.they denied that they had any ownership interest in the property and asserted that,based on their assets and income,they could never come close to satisfying their total tax liability.
after gathering information from the taxpayers and hearing their arguments,the irs rejected the offer in compromise in reaching this decision,the irs applied principles gleaned from federal case law and found that the taxpayers were the real owners of the property that is,that the trust was merely a nominee for the taxpayers and held naked legal title purely for their convenience.relying on this finding,the irs concluded that the offer in compromise was insufficient because the taxpayers ownership interest in the property could be liquidated to generate substantially more funds 
the taxpayers appealed,and the tax court directed the irs to reconsider the nominee issue in light of maine law.see dalton comm r,cch.on remand,the irs concluded that a maine court likely would borrow nominee principles from federal law and reiterated its finding that the trust was a mere nominee.accordingly,the irs stood by its rejection of the offer in compromise.
the taxpayers again repaired to the tax court.reviewing the irs ownership finding de novo,the court determined that the trust was not a nominee of the taxpayers under maine law.dalton comm r.the court added that federal law would dictate the same result.id.at.accordingly,the irs had abused its discretion in rejecting the taxpayers offer because the irs had premised that rejection on an erroneous view of the law.id.at.to add insult to injury,the court thereafter awarded attorneys fees to the taxpayers on the ground that the irs was not substantially justified in rejecting the offer.dalton comm r,cch citing.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we begin our analysis by identifying the applicable standards of review.we then proceed to discuss the merits of the tax court rulings.
standards of review.
where,as here,the amount of the underlying tax liability is not in dispute,we review the irs disposition of an offer in compromise following a cdp hearing for abuse of discretion,ceding no special deference to the tax court intermediate review.see murphy comm r,cir olsen united states,cir see also,at.the parties agree with this paradigm.they disagree,however,as to how a court should review the preludial findings on which the irs bases its rejection of an offer in compromise.
the taxpayers argue that any finding predicated on a material error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.see,united states walker,cir.this means,they say,that any abstract legal question that formed a part of the irs decisional calculus must be accorded de novo review.the irs argues for a more deferential standard.
in the exercise of powers of judicial review,one size does not fit all.the taxpayers construct that questions of law engender de novo review even when a matter is committed to a lower court or an agency discretion,see,r g mortg.fed.home loan mortg,cir can usefully be applied in many contexts.but the taxpayers attempt to impose that construct across the board overlooks the peculiar nature of the cdp process.as we explain below,a court role in the cdp process is simply to confirm that the irs did not abuse its wide discretion and as part and parcel of that inquiry to ensure that the agency subsidiary factual and legal determinations were reasonable.
the appropriate conception of the standard of review for cdp cases flows naturally from the history and structure of the legislation that created the cdp process.congress inaugurated this process in as part of a legislatively crafted taxpayer bill of rights.see internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of,stat.prior to that time,the irs could reach a delinquent taxpayer assets by lien or levy without providing any sort of process.see phillips comm r.this model created a potential for abuse.congress recognized this risk,and its goal in establishing the cdp process was to safeguard taxpayers by affording them a opportunity to ward off harassment and to avoid groundless attachments.see olsen,at living care alts.of utica,united states,cir.
the cdp process has its own standards there is no obligation to conduct a hearing,no formal discovery,no requirement for either testimony or,and no transcript.see living care,at,reg.d,q a.rather,the hearing typically comprises informal oral and written communications between the irs and the taxpayer.see reg.d,q a.following this exchange of information,which may include the making of an offer in compromise,the irs is tasked with deciding whether it is reasonable to proceed with its intended collection action.see c olsen,at living care,at.
to be sure,congress did not give the irs the final say in the cdp process.instead,it provided for judicial review of the irs determinations.see d.but congress must have intended this direction for judicial review to operate in light of the cdp process itself and given the limited scope of the cdp process and the scant record that it customarily generates,olsen,at,a court can not be expected to conduct the same level of judicial review that would follow,say,a bench trial or a more formal agency proceeding.see living care,at.
we conclude,therefore,that judicial review must be tailored to effecting the purpose of the cdp process that is,to ensuring that the irs determinations,whether of fact or of law,are not arbitrary.see murphy,at christopher cross,united states,cir robinette comm r,cir olsen,at living care,at.thus,a court should set aside determinations reached by the irs during the cdp process only if they are unreasonable in light of the record compiled before the agency.see murphy,at finding no abuse of discretion when the irs reached a reasonable conclusion regarding a taxpayer ability to pay and,accordingly,rejected an offer in compromise.any more intrusive standard of review would result in the courts inevitably becom ing involved on a daily basis with tax enforcement details that judges are neither qualified,nor have the time,to administer.olsen,at quoting living care,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this case illustrates both the wisdom and the utility of the standard of review that should accompany appeals from cdp dispositions.the pivotal question in connection with the appropriateness of the taxpayers offer in compromise relates to the actual ownership of the property.especially when a claim is made that one party is a nominee for another,such questions are notoriously.oxford capital united states,cir per curiam.the cdp process neither allows for discovery,nor does it bring before the irs all of the parties in interest the trust,which holds record title to the property,is conspicuously absent.and even though the irs had the benefit of some documentary evidence and a few affidavits,it could not any of the affiants,compel production of other relevant documents,or subpoena third parties.see reg.d,q a,c.these circumstances make it almost certain that not all of the facts that will ultimately inform the determination of who actually owns the property were before the irs.
congress knew about the incomplete nature of the record that would be available to the irs during the cdp process,and,thus,congress must have known that it would make little sense for a court to undertake de novo review of subsidiary determinations made during that process.see olsen,at living care,at.the more sensible course and the one that we are confident that congress envisioned is for a reviewing court to consider whether the factual and legal conclusions reached at a cdp hearing are reasonable,not whether they are correct.
this case is a poster child for the reasonableness standard.were we to decide definitively who owns the property,we would be adjudicating the rights of a third party the trust that has had no opportunity to be heard.the trust would not be bound by our decision,see cruz melecio,cir,and it could relitigate the ownership issue in an independent proceeding.such a duplication of effort would both undermine the significant public interest in the speedy and efficient resolution of disputes and open the door to inconsistent decisions.see z b,tastee freez int l,cir.that would,in turn,cast a shadow over the integrity of the judicial system.see montana united states,d.
de novo review would also give the taxpayers two bites at the cherry.for example,were we to rule that the trust is the real owner of the property,the taxpayers would carry the day.if,however,we were to rule that the taxpayers are the real owners,the commissioner in all likelihood would have to relitigate the point in a separate proceeding to which the trust is a party.the need for relitigation would,in effect,create a second opportunity for the taxpayers to dispute ownership.we do not think that congress could have intended so curious a result.
in sum,a court job is not to review the irs cdp determinations afresh.rather,its job is twofold to decide whether the irs subsidiary factual and legal determinations are reasonable and whether the ultimate outcome of the cdp proceeding constitutes an abuse of the irs wide discretion 
b.the cdp hearing.
we turn next to the reasonableness of the irs subsidiary determinations and the appropriateness of its ultimate decision.we start with some background.
there are three sets of circumstances that may induce the irs to accept a taxpayer offer in compromise following a cdp hearing.these include doubt about the taxpayer liability,doubt about the collectability of the tax indebtedness,or a finding that the proffered compromise would promote effective tax administration.reg.b.in this case,the taxpayers say that doubts about collectability should have prompted the irs to accept their settlement offer.john heywood,dialogue prouerbes eng.tongue explaining that f or better is half a loaf than no bread.
the irs does not abuse its discretion when it rejects an offer in compromise premised on doubts about collectability as long as it reasonably determines that more than the proffered amount may be collectable.see murphy,at.the irs rejected the taxpayers proffered compromise because it concluded that their perceived ownership interest in the property represented a significant source of additional funds.we explain briefly why we do not think that the irs abused its discretion in formulating this rationale.
the irs has broad powers to levy against property and rights to property belonging to taxpayers in order to collect delinquent debts.a.an ownership interest in land is attachable property within the meaning of the levy statute.see leasing united states,d.here,however,the taxpayers assert that they have no ownership interest in the property.whether a particular asset belongs to a taxpayer is a ques
