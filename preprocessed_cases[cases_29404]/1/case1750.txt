this is an appeal from an order of the district court affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security denying appellant cathy ferguson applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.ferguson identifies two procedural errors which are said to require remand to the commissioner for further consideration of a fully developed record.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
claimant cathy ferguson was born in.she has a high school education.from to,she worked in various a materials handler,an assisted living center aid,and a maintenance worker.she has not worked since february,when she alleges she became unable to work due to anxiety,paranoia,stress,nerves,voices,depression.the extensive medical records show a history of degenerative disc disease,back pain and arthritis,conditions which result in some physical limitations.however,ferguson disability claim is based primarily on her mental impairments.there is no question about the existence of mental impairments the challenge for ferguson has been in adducing objective medical findings that demonstrate the impairments are so severe as to render her disabled.
her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income were filed on august.a hearing was conducted by administrative law judge william hafer in lima,ohio on june.in a opinion issued on may,the alj denied the claims.the alj found that ferguson physical impairments were not severe,but her mental impairments,identified as residual type schizophrenia and panic disorder,were severe.still,the alj determined that she retained the residual functional capacity to perform unskilled work in settings requiring no more than superficial contact with others without rigid deadlines and high production standards.that is,the alj concluded that she remained able to perform her past relevant work as a cleaner and materials handler.
on review,the appeals council vacated the alj decision and remanded for a more thorough evaluation of claimant credibility,complaints of pain,and ability to perform activities.on remand,alj hafer conducted a second hearing,on november,before issuing his second decision on july,again denying ferguson claims.the second decision is lengthy and thorough.again,the alj determined that ferguson had the following impairments degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis of the cervical spine degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine hypertension schizophrenia,and panic disorder.the alj found these impairments to be severe,but concluded they did not,alone or in combination,meet the severity requirements for a disability finding.the alj reiterated his earlier finding that ferguson retained the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work.ferguson request for review by the appeals council was denied on april,and the second alj decision was upheld.the appeals council considered additional medical evidence submitted by ferguson,but found that it was cumulative and did not alter the outcome.
ferguson sought judicial review pursuant to g.the action was commenced in the northern district of ohio,where the parties consented to have magistrate judge vernelis armstrong conduct all proceedings in the case and render final judgment,pursuant to c.on september,the court affirmed the final decision of the appeals council approving the alj decision.the district court rejected each of three claims of error asserted by ferguson,holding that the alj did not improperly ignore a treating physician opinion,in violation of social security ruling ssr that the alj did not err in questioning ferguson credibility insofar as the complained of severity and frequency of her symptoms were not supported by the objective medical evidence and that the alj conclusion that ferguson had not demonstrated the required level of severity of impairments to meet the definition of disability is supported by substantial evidence.
on appeal,ferguson insists that the alj violated ssr by discounting a treating physician opinion without first contacting the physician for clarification and contends the district court erred by declining to remand the matter to the alj for reconsideration in light of new evidence never considered by the alj.
ii.analysis 
ssr recontact requirement 
the gravamen of ferguson first claim is that the alj improperly rejected the opinion of one of her treating physicians.the record indicates that ferguson received treatment from a psychiatrist,ruth erulkar,from march until november.the record of erulkar treatment is limited to handwritten office notes,reflecting ferguson reported history and subjective complaints,as well as medications prescribed.among these notes is one statement of opinion by erulkar patient will not be able to work due to her agoraphobia and panic attacks.paranoia present,note.this note was entered just twelve days before the second hearing conducted by the alj and was addressed in his decision as follows 
on november,erulkar stated,patient will not be able to work due to her agoraphobia and panic attacks.paranoia present.exhibit,page.i reject erulkar opinion,which is not supported by erulkar own objective findings.erulkar notes are handwritten and only partially legible.generally,they consist of phrases,not complete sentences.it is often difficult to discern when erulkar is merely recording the history and complaints offered to her by the claimant and when she is noting objective mental status abnormalities that she has observed.however,they appear to contain mostly the claimant history and complaints.in any event,viewing the record as a whole,including the paucity of objective abnormalities recorded by the examiners who have evaluated the claimant,along with the claimant daily activities,social functioning,and general tendency to exaggerate her symptoms,i reject erulkar opinion of disability.
ferguson construes the alj treatment of erulkar notes as reflecting the alj failure to understand the bases for her opinion that ferguson was unable to work.in such a circumstance,ferguson contends,where the bases for a treating source opinion are not clear,the alj was obliged,pursuant to social security ruling,to make every reasonable effort to recontact the source for clarification.instead,she argues,the alj chose to throw up his hands and disregard the notes entirely.the district court did not specifically address ferguson charge that the alj had a duty to recontact erulkar.rather,the court held the alj complied with ssr by basing his assessment of ferguson residual functional capacity upon the record as a whole after conducting an extensive examination of numerous opinions,including that of erulkar.
on appeal,the district court ruling on ferguson claim that the alj failed to apply the correct legal standard is reviewed de novo.valley comm r of soc,cir.
social security ruling purports to clarify social security administration policy on how we consider medical source opinions on issues reserved to the commissioner,including whether an individual is disabled under the social security act.soc.sec.rul,wl at july,for purposes of ssr,medical opinions are defined as statements from physicians and psychologists or other acceptable medical sources that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of the claimant impairment s,wl at.the provision at issue recognizes that even though some issues,such as whether an individual is disabled,are administrative issues reserved to the commissioner,
adjudicators must always carefully consider medical source opinions about any issue,including opinions about issues that are reserved to the commissioner.for treating sources,the rules also require that we make every reasonable effort to recontact such sources for clarification when they provide opinions on issues reserved to the commissioner and the bases for such opinions are not clear to us.
id.the ruling goes on to identify two conditions that must both be met to trigger the duty to recontact the evidence does not support a treating source opinion and the adjudicator can not ascertain the basis of the opinion from the record.id.at emphasis added while the former of these requirements is met in this case,the latter is not.
first,however,we reject ferguson characterization of the alj error.while the alj said he rejected erulkar opinion of disability,the language and analysis of his thorough decision clearly refutes the charge that he threw up his hands and ignored or disregarded erulkar notes entirely.the alj explicitly referred to and quoted from erulkar notes extensively.further,he actually relied on erulkar office notes in rejecting other medical opinions of record.specifically,he rejected the opinions of michael wagner,john miga,and roseann umana,who all concluded in that ferguson mental impairments were not severe.with reference to erulkar notes,the alj found,despite the scarcity of objective evidence relating to the claimant mental status,that she has some mental impairments that cause a significant restriction in her ability to perform basic activities,decision.thus,the suggestion that the alj outright dismissed,ignored and disregarded erulkar notes is groundless.
further,to the extent the alj rejected erulkar opinion of disability,he did so not because the bases for her opinion were unclear to him,but because those bases,ferguson history and subjective complaints,were not supported by objective medical evidence 
the claimant complaints are not fully supported by the objective and psychological evidence,as has been described in detail above.the most striking aspect of this case is the gulf between the claimant complaints of extreme mental symptoms,panic attacks that last all day long,auditory hallucinations,communications from her television and computer directed specifically to her,and paranoid ideation and the almost complete lack of objective evidence to support her dramatic complaints,decision.again,the alj stated specifically i reject erulkar opinion,which is not supported by erulkar own objective findings,decision.
at the time of the alj decision,the record was largely devoid of objective medical evidence substantiating the severity of ferguson anxiety and paranoia.to this day,ferguson has not even argued that erulkar opinion of disability was in fact based on undisclosed objective medical evidence that would have been forthcoming if only the alj had inquired.
this striking gulf,as the alj put it,between ferguson subjective complaints and the objective medical evidence,is all the more striking in light of the chronology of the administrative proceedings.when the alj made his final decision in july,ferguson had been granted a second bite at the apple.she had been advised in the alj first decision,in may,that her subjective complaints were insufficient to establish disability and there was no objective medical evidence indicating that she could not still perform her past relevant work.when this decision was vacated by the appeals council and the case remanded for a more thorough evaluation,ferguson was afforded another opportunity to remedy the identified shortcomings in her claims by supplementing the record and making a more credible showing in a second hearing.
indeed,ferguson did supplement the record with additional medical evidence,including additional notes from erulkar.yet,though she was represented by counsel,she failed to adduce additional objective medical evidence substantiating the severity of her mental impairments.erulkar office notes are fairly characterized in the alj second opinion as consisting mostly of the claimant history and complaints.erulkar only statement of opinion is encapsulated in the one handwritten statement that ferguson will not be able to work due to her agoraphobia and panic attacks.
this disability opinion is not explained in any way,is not tied to any physical examination findings or empirical testing results,and is not justified by reference to findings made by other physicians.though she treated ferguson for some two years during the pendency of her application for disability benefits,erulkar appears not have conducted any testing or prepared any report or letter explaining any objective medical bases for her opinion.as a consequence,the supplemental evidence furnished by erulkar amounted,in material part,to no more than a statement of her opinion,based on ferguson own,that ferguson was,an opinion that relates to an issue reserved to the commissioner an opinion that is never entitled to controlling weight or special significance.soc.sec.rul,wl at.see also warner comm r of soc,cir determination of disability is prerogative of commissioner,not treating physician,and treating physician opinion is entitled to substantial deference only if supported by objective medical evidence.
because erulkar opinion on this issue reserved to the commissioner was not supported by the objective medical evidence,the first precondition triggering the alj recontact obligation was arguably met.as to the second precondition,however,the bases for erulkar opinion can not be said to be unclear.ferguson reported history and subjective complaints were the bases for erulkar opinion.these bases were not unclear.they were in fact sufficient,in light of the other record evidence,to persuade the alj that ferguson suffered from severe mental impairments.but they were insufficient to persuade the alj that ferguson was disabled.this determination,whether ferguson had carried her burden of showing that she is disabled,is the case dispositive issue reserved to the alj.in this respect,erulkar opinion was deemed unpersuasive not because its bases were unclear,but because they were not corroborated by objective medical evidence.
it follows that the alj ssr duty to make every reasonable effort to recontact erulkar was not triggered and therefore not violated.see poe comm r of soc,app x,cir a n alj is required to a treating physician only when the information received is inadequate to reach a determination on claimant disability status,not where,as here,the alj rejects the limitations recommended by that physician.deboard comm r of soc,app x,cir same 
in sum,we find no error.the burden lies with the claimant to prove that she is disabled.foster halter,cir.the alj has discretion to determine whether additional evidence is necessary.id.at.here,the alj thorough opinion demonstrates that he carefully considered the entire record in this case,including erulkar notes that he identified substantial evidence supporting the determination that ferguson was not disabled and that he did not abuse his discretion in failing to recontact erulkar,because the bases for her opinion,though wanting,were not unclear or ambiguous.we therefore uphold the district court rejection of ferguson claim that the alj violated ssr.
remand for consideration of new evidence 
in her second claim,ferguson contends the district court erred when it declined to remand the matter to the alj for consideration of new evidence that was accepted by the appeals council,but never considered by the alj.the new evidence consists of two letters from psychologist carol loeffler.
in the first letter,addressed to erulkar and dated july,loeffler summarized the results of two tests she had administered to ferguson,the minnesota multiphasic personality and the symptom,letter.while acknowledging that the results of the were technically invalid because ferguson was unable to complete the test in one sitting,loeffler characterized the testing as suggesting a person who is experiencing tremendous internal and external distress,who struggles with distorted thinking with delusions,who feels hopeless,withdrawn,overwhelmed and guilt ridden,who ruminates and has rigid rituals and superstitious phobias,and who may be immobilized by multiple symptoms and complaints.id.loeffler characterized these impressions as consistent with the results of the.she summarized her overall impressions overall,ferguson struggles to maintain her hold on reality.her level of appropriate functioning has been severely compromised.she has reached the point where she is questioning her quality of life and wishes she were dead,loeffler letter.
the second letter is addressed to the social security administration and is dated september.
