david welch appeals a final order of the administrative review board arb finding that his discharge by cardinal bankshares corporation did not violate the whistleblower protection provision of the act.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm.
cardinal bankshares corporation is a bank holding company with its common stock listed on the nasdaq bulletin board.as of december,cardinal had outstanding over million shares of common stock,held by approximately stockholders of record.cardinal is the sole owner of a single financial institution,the bank of floyd.cardinal and the bank of floyd share a board of directors and managing officers,and ronald leon moore serves as the chief executive officer of both entities.hereinafter,we refer to the bank of floyd and cardinal interchangeably as cardinal.
welch,the petitioner in this case,is licensed as a certified public accountant in virginia and holds a bachelor and a master degree in business administration.welch began working for cardinal in as a accounting officer,and,in,moore hired welch as cardinal chief financial officer cfo.welch responsibilities as cfo of cardinal included preparing and reviewing entries on cardinal general ledger accounts devising and implementing accounting procedures and preparing various reports and financial statements,including the quarterly reports and annual reports that cardinal is required to submit to the securities and exchange commission sec,see.
welch came to believe that cardinal accounting practices were seriously deficient in several respects.according to welch,moore and others who lacked accounting expertise routinely made entries in cardinal general ledger welch asserts that this practice itself violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap.he also contends that this practice resulted in ledger entries that violated gaap.
most notably,on one specific occasion,cardinal recovered two loans that it had previously written off,expecting that they would not be recouped.cardinal recorded the unexpected recovery of these loans,totaling,as income welch maintains that gaap does not permit such recovered loans to be reported as income and instead requires that they be listed on a company loan reserve account.welch attempted to change the ledger entries so that the loans would be recorded in the loan reserve account instead of as income,but moore refused to authorize these changes.according to welch,these incorrect entries caused cardinal to overstate its income by in its report to the sec.larrowe,plc,cardinal independent auditor,eventually corrected these entries in cardinal annual report during the audit,but neither cardinal nor larrowe ever submitted a corrected report to the sec.
finally,welch claims that moore would often communicate directly with larrowe about financial matters without including welch.welch alleges that by so excluding him,moore restricted his access to larrowe,and that this restricted access prevented him from performing his tasks as cfo and prevented him from confirming the accuracy of cardinal financial reports.
welch forcefully communicated his concerns about these assertedly improper accounting practices in multiple formal memoranda to moore and others immediately following the july,effective date of the act of,stat.welch also contends that he raised these concerns orally with moore and others as they arose in 
on august,welch informed larrowe in writing that he could not sign a representation letter to larrowe confirming that cardinal provided larrowe with accurate financial information for the first and second quarters of,because moore and others had made ledger entries without his supervision and because moore and larrowe had excluded him from their communications loop on various issues.
on august,welch refused to certify cardinal report to the sec,as required by the act.in a memorandum explaining his refusal to certify the quarterly report,welch claimed that he could not certify to the accuracy of the company financial reports because,among other concerns,unauthorized persons had recorded ledger entries.welch identified the entry as income of the in recovered loans as evidence of the inaccuracies he believed this practice had caused.moore ultimately certified cardinal quarterly report himself,because welch refused to do so.
on september,welch submitted another formal memorandum to moore,insisting that cardinal needed to change its accounting practices before welch could certify the pending report to the sec.welch again complained about the entry of the in recovered loans as income,this time arguing that cardinal needed to correct its report that listed the as income welch also repeated his complaints that moore had excluded him from communications with larrowe and that unauthorized persons had made ledger entries.
following this barrage of criticism,welch relationship with moore deteriorated rapidly.on september,moore called a meeting of cardinal board of directors to discuss moore dissatisfaction with welch.moore related to the board the content of welch memoranda and his belief that welch concerns were unfounded.moore also reported that in august,state examiners had found numerous errors in a quarterly call report that welch had prepared and submitted to the federal reserve and the virginia state corporation commission.in addition,moore related that the examiners had commented that many of the charts,graphs,and spreadsheet reports prepared by welch were unnecessary and.moore advised the board that the situation has deteriorated to the point that welch seems to have become disaffected and apparently is unwilling or unable to do what needs to be done to comply with the law.the board decided to ask the audit committee legal counsel,douglas densmore,and outside auditor,michael larrowe,to investigate and prepare a report on welch assertions,including his claim that cardinal needed to correct its sec report because cardinal had improperly reported the in recovered loans as income.
on september,welch held what he characterized as a briefing for senior personnel at cardinal.during this briefing,welch alleged that three cardinal employees were parties to fraudulent acts,outlined his belief that cardinal accounting practices violated the act,and proposed that he leave cardinal quietly upon receipt of a generous severance package.following the meeting,densmore and larrowe attempted to meet with welch to discuss his charges,but welch repeatedly refused to meet with them without his personal attorney.
at a meeting of cardinal board of directors on september,the board voted to suspend welch without pay pending the results of densmore and larrowe investigation.following his suspension,the board ordered welch to meet with densmore and larrowe without counsel to discuss his accusations,but welch again refused to meet without his attorney.
on october,densmore and larrowe presented the results of their investigation to the board.they concluded that welch concerns regarding cardinal accounting practices lacked merit.they also concluded that welch had seriously breached his fiduciary duty to cardinal by refusing to meet with them to discuss his charges,and they recommended that cardinal discharge him.the board unanimously voted to discharge welch,effective immediately.
welch then filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha,alleging that cardinal had dismissed him in violation of the whistleblower protection provision of of the act,supp.v.welch alleged that his various communications to cardinal constituted protected activity under the act and that cardinal fired him because of this protected activity.based on an investigation by osha,the secretary of labor dismissed the complaint,finding that,although welch engaged in protected activity,cardinal did not fire him because of that activity.rather,the secretary found that cardinal fired welch because welch refused to meet with densmore and larrowe without counsel,which the secretary concluded constituted a legitimate reason for welch discharge.
welch appealed and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.see.following the hearing,the alj issued a recommended decision and order,finding that at least three of the concerns that welch communicated to cardinal constituted protected activity under the act.specifically,the alj found that the act protected welch communications about cardinal entry of the in recovered loans as income cardinal general practice of allowing persons without accounting expertise to make ledger entries and welch restricted access to larrowe.the alj found that cardinal fired welch because of these protected activities and ordered him reinstated with back pay.the alj later issued a supplemental recommended decision and order,stipulating the amount of back pay to which the judge found welch entitled.
cardinal appealed the alj order to the arb,which reversed,finding as a matter of law that none of welch communications constituted protected activity under the act and dismissing welch complaint.welch appeals.
the act creates whistleblower protection for employees of companies by prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees because they provided information about potentially unlawful conduct.specifically,the act provides 
no company,or any officer or employee of such company,may discharge an employee because of any lawful act done by the employee 
to provide information regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,or securities fraud,any rule or regulation of the sec,or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders,when the information is provided to 
a person with supervisory authority over the employee

the whistleblower protection provision of the act adopts the framework applicable to whistleblower claims brought under the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,b.see b.accordingly,an employee bears the initial burden of making a prima facie showing of retaliatory discrimination the burden then shifts to the employer to rebut the employee prima facie case by demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected activity.b b.
the department of labor dol regulations implementing provide that in order to make a prima facie showing,an employee complaint must allege that the employee engaged in protected activity the employer knew,actually or constructively,of the protected activity the employee suffered an unfavorable personnel action and the circumstances raise an inference that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.b.
to satisfy the first element and establish that he engaged in protected activity,an employee must show that he had both a subjective belief and an objectively reasonable belief that the conduct he complained of constituted a violation of relevant law.livingston,at.additionally,an employee must show that his communications to his employer definitively and specifically relate d to one of the laws listed in.platone flyi,arb case,ier cases,cch p,slip op.at arb,internal quotation marks omitted.the arb held that welch failed to make out a prima facie case because he did not establish that he had engaged in protected activity the arb did not make any determination as to the other three elements necessary for a prima facie case.
under the administrative procedure act,a which governs our review here,see b a we may only disturb the arb decision if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we review questions of law de novo,giving deference to the arb interpretation of.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d on questions of fact,we will uphold the arb findings if supported by substantial evidence.see knox dep t of labor,cir.
before turning to the central dispute the arb erred in holding that welch had failed to establish that his communications constituted protected activity under briefly address contentions made by the parties as to the standard for establishing protected activity.
cardinal initially argues that livingston holds that the act only protects communications relating to material violations of a listed law.as cardinal itself concedes,however,in livingston,we merely noted that a statement or omission must concern a material fact to violate b of the securities exchange act and sec rule.at.although many of the laws listed in of the act contain materiality requirements,nothing in nor in livingston indicates that contains an independent materiality requirement 
the parties remaining contentions involve the arb interpretation of to require that an employee communications to his employer definitively and specifically relate to one of the listed laws for these communications to constitute protected activity.see,platone,arb case,slip op.at internal quotation marks omitted.this requirement ensures that an employee communications to his employer are factually specific.an employee need not cite a code section he believes was violated in his communications to his employer,but the employee communications must identify the specific conduct that the employee believes to be illegal.fraser fiduciary trust.int l,d,see also bechtel constr.sec y of labor,cir considering standard for protected activity under the whistleblower provisions of the energy reorganization act.g eneral inquiries do not constitute protected activity.fraser,d at internal quotation marks,omissions,and citations omitted.
welch maintains that by requiring his communications to definitively and specifically relate to a listed law,the arb has interpreted to require that an employee complain of an actual violation of a listed law in order to engage in protected activity,and that such a requirement contradicts the text of the statute,which provides that an employee who complains of conduct that he reasonably believes violates a listed law engages in protected activity.a.we agree that such a requirement would contradict the text of,but the definitively and specifically language does not in fact require that an employee complain of an actual violation.indeed,the arb has squarely held that protects an employee communications based on a reasonable,but mistaken,belief that conduct constitutes a securities violation.see halloum intel,arb case,ier cases,slip op.at arb,accord allen,at.
cardinal also misreads the definitively and specifically language,though in a different manner.cardinal contends that the definitively and specifically language imposes a heightened pleading standard in whistleblower cases.the arb,however,has held that,for the requirement that an employee communications definitively and specifically relate to a listed law,the relevant inquiry is what an employee actually communicated to his employer prior to the termination it is not what is alleged in the employee osha complaint.platone,arb case,slip op.at emphasis added.thus,contrary to cardinal assertions,the definitively and specifically language clearly does not impose a heightened pleading standard in whistleblower cases.
accordingly,we turn to the central issue in this welch established that his communications constituted activity protected by.
the arb held that welch had failed to establish that any of his communications constituted protected activity under of the act.the arb offered two rationales for its holding both relate to the requirement that welch have an objectively reasonable belief that the challenged conduct violated relevant law.although we must reject the first rationale,we find no error in the second.
the arb initially held,as a matter of law,that welch could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that reporting the in recovered loans as income violated relevant law the arb reasoned that even if cardinal erroneously reported the as income instead of recording it in the loan reserve account,the erroneous entries still showed that cardinal had in fact recovered that it previously did not have,and that therefore welch could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that the loan entries might mislead investors.
the arb suggested that the misclassification of it
