this case involves the disclosure provision of the privacy act of.the district court granted summary judgment for the national drug intelligence center,holding that the information in the disclosed document is not a record within the meaning of the act.we disagree and now reverse.
gary jacobs is the president and ceo of laredo national bank,which conducts business in the united states and mexico.jacobs has been the of the bank for years.he claims that the national drug intelligence center ndic violated the privacy act by leaking part of an internal analytical document,the white tiger report the report,to the press.the report alleged that jacobs was involved in a mexican and organization.
the ndic is part of the department of justice.its function is to coordinate and consolidate drug intelligence from and agencies.specifically,the ndic analyzes the structure,membership,finances,and activities of organizations.
in,the fbi and the dea asked the ndic to conduct a strategic assessment of a mexican criminal organization that was allegedly involved in money laundering and drug trafficking in the united states,mexico,and several other countries.as a result,the white tiger project was born ndic analysts collected and reviewed pertinent information from thousands of agency records,including records from the dea,fbi,customs service,and the attorney office.the analysts placed these records in the ndic retrievalware database.retrievalware is the ndic system.
retrievalware is located within the ndic computer system.the main network system of contains retrievalware and two other component parts,the unit group and the unit home directories,both of which store microsoft word documents.
the white tiger report contained several different sections.the section at issue in this case is the executive summary,which summarized the entire report.neither the report nor the executive summary were stored in retrievalware,but rather in one of the other component parts of the main network system unit group or unit home.
in march,ndic supervisor daniel huffman mailed a draft version of the executive summary to donald schultz,a professor at the army war college.however,neither ndic management nor the agencies participating in the white tiger project had reviewed this version of the executive summary yet.the office of the inspector general of the justice department conducted an investigation into the leak and concluded that huffman disclosure of the document to schultz was unauthorized and recommended significant discipline.general janet reno also acknowledged that the release of the draft ndic report was not authorized by either the ndic or the department of justice.
in may,donald schultz sent the executive summary to dolia estevez,a reporter for the mexican newspaper,el financiero.later that month,el financiero published a article entitled,the hanks,in the gun sight of drug enforcement they constitute a threat,it is warned translated from spanish.the article purported to rely heavily on an unpublished official document from the ndic and contained allegations of wrongdoing against jacobs.specifically,the article discussed the activities of a family referred to as the hank group and reported that the family laundered money through jacobs bank,stating,
the analysis states that hank rhon uses front men or men of straw to acquire interests in the united states.one of these characters,it says,is gary jacobs,the president of the laredo national bank,who,according to the ndic,lacks personal resources sufficient to acquire the shares he owns in the bank.
in may,jacobs filed suit against the ndic in the southern district of texas,claiming that by leaking the executive summary,the ndic violated the privacy act by disclosing records maintained in a system of records.specifically,jacobs alleged that the executive summary was derived from items of information records that the ndic analysts retrieved from retrievalware the system of records.
the ndic has not provided jacobs with either the information about him in retrievalware or a copy of the executive summary.however,jacobs believes that a confidential customs service report from november was included in the retrievalware records that formed the basis of the executive summary information on jacobs.jacobs believes this for three reasons first,such reports were generally scanned into retrievalware second,el financiero stated that the executive summary relied on customs service cases and third,the language of the el financiero article,which purports to quote the executive summary,is similar to the language of the customs report jacobs provided the following comparison in his brief 
jacobs claims that as a result of the accusations against him published in el financiero,his reputation has been significantly damaged and he has lost substantial business opportunities in both the united states and mexico.
in september,the ndic moved to dismiss jacobs complaint or,alternatively,for summary judgment.jacobs also for partial summary judgment against the ndic on the issue of liability.
the district court heard oral argument on the motions in december,granting the ndic and denying jacobs.the district court did not issue written reasons for its decision,but did make the following statement at the summary judgment hearing 
i going to grant the motion to dismiss for summary judgment of the ndic here and that i do think that the records here are maintaining a system of records under the privacy act,section a,where it defines record and system of records and i do both on the motion to dismiss the summary judgment motion i think it clear that they do,and that this is not a privacy act matter.
jacobs filed a motion to reconsider,which the district court denied.judgment was entered in april.this appeal followed the only issue before the court is whether the information about jacobs in the executive summary constitutes a record contained in a system of records within the meaning of the privacy act.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.bettersworth fdic,cir.
the privacy act of,safeguards the public from unwarranted collection,maintenance,use and dissemination of personal information contained in agency records by allowing an individual to participate in ensuring that his records are accurate and properly used.henke dep t of commerce,ellipsis in original quoting bartel faa.the act provides four causes of action for an agency failure to amend an individual record pursuant to his request for an agency denial of access to an individual records for an agency failure to maintain an individual records with accuracy,relevance,timeliness,and completeness and for an agency failure to comply with other privacy act provisions,which has an adverse effect on the individual see gowan dep t of the air force,cir listing the four causes of action.the remedy available to a successful plaintiff depends on which cause of action he pursues.for the first two causes of action,a successful plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief,and,if the plaintiff has substantially prevailed,the court may also award attorney fees and costs.id.at citing g,g.for the latter two,a successful plaintiff may recover damages,attorney fees,and costs,but only if he proves that the governmental agency acted willfully.id.at citing g.
here,jacobs asserts the fourth cause of action he claims that the ndic willfully disclosed a record contained in a system of records in violation of b and that the disclosure had an adverse effect on him.section b provides that n o agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,unless the disclosure falls within one of twelve statutory exceptions.b.the ndic has not alleged that any exception applies to this case.
thus,for jacobs to survive summary judgment on his disclosure claim,he must present evidence of the following elements the information is a record in a system of records the agency disclosed the information the disclosure had an adverse effect on him and the disclosure was willful.quinn stone,cir.only the first element is at issue the information disclosed about jacobs is protected by the act as a record within a system of records.
jacobs argues that the record that was disclosed in this case is the information about him that was retrieved by his name from retrievalware and put into the executive summary.the ndic,by contrast,argues that the disclosed record is the executive summary,itself.according to the ndic,the privacy act does not apply because the executive summary was not contained within retrievalware system of records that is,the document,itself,was not retrieved from retrievalware by jacobs name.the ndic cites little authority to support its interpretation of the statute and instead tries to distinguish those cases relied upon by jacobs.it can not.jacobs interpretation of the statute is supported by both the statute text and the cases interpreting it.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
the privacy act prohibits the disclosure of any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication.b.the act defines record in the following way 
t he term record means any item,collection,or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency,including,but not limited to,his education,financial transactions,medical history,and criminal or employment history and that contains his name,or the identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to the individual,such as a finger or voice print or photograph.
a emphasis added.the statute further defines system of records as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.a emphasis added.
this case fits plainly within the statute.first,the executive summary accused jacobs of being a front man for the hank group and organization and opined that jacobs did not have the financial capability to purchase the bank shares that he owned.the executive summary thus included information about jacobs.see a.
second,the ndic has conceded that ndic analysts on the white tiger project retrieved information from retrievalware using jacobs name as a search term.moreover,deposition testimony by white tiger analysts indicates that information from retrievalware was cut and pasted into the report one analyst testified that he moved information from retrievalware to his home directory or shared drive so that he could incorporate it into the report another analyst testified that he opened two parallel windows on his with the search results from retrievalware and the other with his draft section of the he incorporated notes and exact quotes from retrievalware records into his draft section of the report a third analyst testified that as a general matter,information from retrievalware could be cut and pasted into a microsoft word document.in addition,a white tiger analyst also testified that analysts working on the report did not conduct any independent investigations into the activities of the hank group.taken together,this information raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the disclosed information was retrieved from retrievalware using jacobs name as a search term.
finally,retrievalware qualifies as a system of records under the statute.retrievalware is located within.in,several years before the beginning of the white tiger project,the ndic published a notice in the federal register identifying as its privacy act system of records.
under a straightforward application of the statute,then,jacobs has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the statute applicability,which defeats the ndic motion for summary judgment.
the ndic argues,however,that the statute only protects against the disclosure of a physical document that is contained in a system of records.thus,it contends,the privacy act does not apply to the disclosure of the executive summary in this case because it was not stored in retrievalware.we reject this argument.
a myriad of cases has held or assumed that the act protects against oral disclosures as well as the nonconsensual dissemination of letters and memoranda containing information from a system of records for example,in pippinger rubin,the tenth circuit used the privacy act legislative history to support a broad interpretation of the disclosure provision,cir.there,information about pippinger from his employer record system was orally disclosed by his former coworkers in deposition testimony.id.at.in interpreting the term disclose which is not defined in the privacy act,the pippinger court stated,
the court broad interpretation of the privacy act prohibition against disclosure is clearly consistent with congressional intent.as the joint house and senate report explained,a primary purpose of b is to require employees to refrain from disclosing records or personal data in them,within the agency this section is designed to prevent the office gossip,interoffice and interbureau leaks of information about persons of interest in the agency or in the community,or such actions as the publicizing of information of a sensational or salacious nature or of that detrimental to character reputation.
id.at first emphasis in original quoting,at,reprinted in.
we agree with the tenth circuit characterization of the statute the privacy act legislative history supports a broader interpretation of the privacy act than the one advanced by the ndic in this case.the disclosure provision is meant to protect against just the sort of governmental activity that took place leaking and publicizing of information that is detrimental to character reputation.see id.both the statute plain text and its legislative history support the application of the privacy act to this case.the caselaw applying the act disclosure provision confirms our conclusion.
jacobs principally relies on bartel faa,the seminal case interpreting the privacy act disclosure provision.that case involved both an oral disclosure and the disclosure of letters,analogous to the executive summary disclosed in this case.id.at.
in bartel,the plaintiff,bartel,worked as an inspector for the faa.id.at.contemplating the filing of an eeoc complaint alleging reverse discrimination,bartel requested employment information about several other inspectors.id.the information he received consisted of virtually complete airman files of three of his coworkers.id.despite being assured that the requested information was available to the public,some of the information in the files was not public.id.bartel acquisition of the files was therefore a potential privacy act violation.id.
bartel then filed a discrimination complaint with the faa eeo office.id.shortly thereafter,one of bartel superiors,vincent,instituted an investigation into bartel request for the employment files.id.documents collected pursuant to the investigation were placed in a file called a report of investigation,or roi.the investigation closed without any criminal charges being filed against bartel.id.at.bartel soon left the faa for civilian employment.id.at.
the next year,vincent learned that bartel was seeking reemployment with the faa.id.vincent then sent the three airmen whose files had been requested letters notifying them of the apparent privacy act violation by bartel.id.these letters contained bartel name and place of work and stated that bartel had obtained records about them,potentially in violation of the privacy act.id.vincent also disclosed bartel alleged privacy act violation over the phone to an investigator for flight resources,with whom bartel was interviewing for a job.id.bartel was denied several jobs because of vincent letters and phone calls.see id.
bartel sued the faa,alleging that vincent letters and phone conversations themselves constituted nonconsensual disclosures in violation of b of the privacy act.id.the district court dismissed bartel complaint.id.at.the circuit reversed.id.
in the course of its analysis,the bartel court assumed a broad definition of record,stating,
it is of course obvious that the letters were not themselves agency records.on the other
