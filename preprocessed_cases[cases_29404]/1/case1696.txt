anthony robinson,a federal prisoner,appeals from the district court denial of his motion for return of property,in which robinson sought to recover cash that was administratively forfeited by the federal bureau of investigation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
this case concerns whether the fbi,after seizing cash from anthony robinson during a narcotics investigation,satisfied the notice requirements of due process before declaring the cash to be administratively forfeited.the underlying facts of the seizure and forfeiture are not in dispute.on november,houston police effected a traffic stop of robinson at the request of the fbi,who were investigating robinson as part of a drug investigation.inside robinson car,officers discovered large sums of cash in a crown royal bag under the driver seat,in the glove compartment,and in a small black suitcase.fbi agents seized the money but released robinson.robinson provided the agents with a home address of forest cedar,houston,texas,which was also on his driver license,and a business address of bissonnet.
the fbi subsequently initiated administrative forfeiture proceedings for almost eight months after the seizure,the fbi sent a certified letter postmarked june,to robinson home address,informing him of the seizure and the intent to forfeit.the letter provided information about a claimant right to contest the seizure by filing a claim of ownership and the right to file a petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.the letter was returned on december,marked unclaimed.
the fbi then searched its choicepoint database and discovered four additional addresses associated with robinson name and social security number.within one week of the return of the unclaimed letter,four similar certified letters notifying robinson of the seizure and forfeiture were sent to the alternate addresses.one of the letters was sent to robinson business address at bissonnet and one letter was sent to forest cedars,which is a variation of the home address on robinson driver license.another letter was sent to pouter.each letter was returned marked unclaimed,attempted,not known,or moved,left no address.
a few months later,the fbi searched its choicepoint database once again and discovered two more addresses linked to robinson.the fbi mailed to these addresses certified letters postmarked march.one of the letters was addressed bissonnet,apt.c,which is a variation on the business address that robinson had given the fbi.the letters were returned marked unclaimed and moved,left no address.
the fbi also published public notice of the seizure and forfeiture for three successive weeks on three different occasions in the new york times.the notice appeared on july,july,july,december,december,january,april,april,and april.when no one filed a claim of ownership or a petition for remission or mitigation,the fbi declared the cash to be administratively forfeited on june.
meanwhile,robinson was initially indicted along with two codefendants on may,for drug offenses.robinson was charged in a superseding indictment on september,with drug trafficking and money laundering.a jury found robinson guilty on four counts,and the district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of months in prison.this court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal.united states ingram.cir.
on june,robinson filed a pro se motion in district court for return of property under fed.e and.robinson argued that the money was seized during an illegal search and seizure,that he was not given notice of the forfeiture as required by,that the delay prior to the government initial notice deprived him of due process,and that the criminal judgment did not order any property forfeited.
the government filed a response,asserting that it should be granted summary judgment because its attempts to notify robinson about the forfeiture satisfied due process.the government attached to its motion an affidavit from an fbi paralegal specialist in the forfeiture and seized property unit and copies of the certified letters and newspaper publications discussed above.
robinson filed a reply in which he argued that the government first notice was sent almost eight months after the seizure,constituting an unreasonable delay in violation of due process.he also asserted that he had lived at the home address on forest cedar for four months after the seizure before moving to pouter.he argued that he had spoken to an fbi agent,who advised him that he had to get an attorney and file a claim for the money.his attorney allegedly then called the fbi,learned the amount of money involved,and was told that a notice would be sent to robinson.robinson further argued that the fbi did not send a notice to his business address until thirteen months after the seizure,that delivery was unreasonably attempted on christmas day,and that the notice published in the new york times was unreasonable because he lives in houston.
the district court treated robinson motion as a civil complaint for equitable relief because no criminal charges were pending,and it granted summary judgment to the government.the court held that the government efforts to contact robinson about the forfeiture,evidenced by the seven certified letters that were returned unclaimed,and its publishing of notice in the new york times,which it found was a newspaper of general distribution within the district,were reasonably calculated to give robinson notice and satisfied due process.the court noted that letters had been sent to three addresses at which robinson acknowledged he had lived and done business,the addresses on forest cedar,bissonnet,and pouter.
with respect to the delay between the seizure on november,and the government first letter in june,the court first noted that robinson supported his argument that the delay was unreasonable by relying on cases involving delays by the government in initiating civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings.because the forfeiture proceeding in this case was administrative,not judicial,the court opined that it was unclear whether the cases cited by robinson were applicable.
the court then noted that the cases cited by robinson used a balancing test for determining an unreasonable delay,analyzing the length of the delay,the reason for the delay,the claimant assertion of his rights,and prejudice to the claimant.see united states eight thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars in currency,d citing barker wingo,d.the district court held that,even assuming the applicability of this test,the delay in this case was not unreasonable.
the court held that the delay was reasonable because robinson had not sought the return of his funds or otherwise contested the forfeiture during the criminal proceeding.robinson also failed to show that the delay caused him any prejudice.in addition,the delay was justified because the seizure was made during the course of a lengthy criminal investigation and the supreme court has indicated that pending criminal proceedings may present justification for a delay in instituting civil forfeiture proceedings.see,at.the court concluded that there was no showing that the government was lax in its investigation or that the subsequent criminal charges against robinson were not pursued with reasonable diligence.robinson filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
although robinson filed his motion for return of property pursuant to rule g,the district court properly construed it as a civil complaint and the denial of the motion as a grant of summary judgment.see clymore united states,cir united states robinson,cir.this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo.robinson,at.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
iii.discussion 
robinson raises four arguments on appeal.he argues that the delay of over seven months between the seizure of the cash and the government first notice of forfeiture was unjustified and violated due process the government written notice included only one letter to his residence and one letter to his business address without any attempt to resend the notice to those addresses the publication of notice in the new york times,rather than the houston chronicle,was not reasonably calculated to provide him notice of the forfeiture and because the government indicted him more than one month before the cash was administratively forfeited,it knew he would be in custody and easily notified of the forfeiture,but it did not take steps to do so.
forfeiture background 
proceeds of drug trafficking are subject to civil forfeiture under federal law.kadonsky united states,cir a.when the government seizes property valued at less than or any monetary instrument,it may use administrative forfeiture procedures,but must provide notice before forfeiting the property or money.robinson,at see a.to satisfy this notice requirement,the government must publish notice of the administrative forfeiture and send written notice to any party who appears to have an interest in the seized article.kadonsky,at a.

delay in notice 
robinson argues that his due process rights were violated because the government waited over seven months before attempting to notify him about the forfeiture.he relies primarily on,d,and united states in currency,cir.
in,the supreme court addressed whether an delay in the government filing a civil forfeiture proceeding violated due process,and held that the proper analysis of the delay required consideration of the four barker factors length of the delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant assertion of her rights,and prejudice to the defendant.at.the court held that the delay was quite significant.id.at.however,with respect to the reason for the delay,the court noted that the government was initially involved in a investigation of whether to grant the petition for remission and that the pending criminal proceeding further complicated the process.id.at.the court held that p ending criminal proceedings present justifications for delay in instituting civil forfeiture proceedings.id.at.because the government diligently pursued the pending administrative and criminal proceedings,the court held that the government had legitimate reasons for the delay.id.at.
in,this court applied the supreme court holding in to a case similar,but not identical,to the instant case.there,cash was seized from the defendant during a lawful arrest,and six months later the government filed an administrative notice of its intent to seek forfeiture,at.the defendant filed a petition for remission,but the government did not file a civil forfeiture complaint until seven months later and thirteen months after the initial seizure.id.the district court denied the government forfeiture petition because the delay was inordinate and denied the defendant his right to prompt resolution of the issue.id.
this court noted that the opposition to the forfeiture arose from the six months delay in giving notice of forfeiture and the total of thirteen months delay in bringing a forfeiture complaint.id.at.this court held that the delay was substantially less than the eighteen months in,but of critical importance was the fact that for the first six months period nothing was done by the government.id.at.this court distinguished,where the claimant was officially notified eight days after the seizure and the notification was followed by administrative proceedings and a criminal prosecution during the delay.id.in contrast,this court noted that the government delayed for six months with no explanation and no excuse before notifying the defendant about the forfeiture.id.at.this court also held that the deprivation of a substantial sum of money for more than one year was undoubtedly a significant burden.id.at quoting,at.this court concluded that the government must explain and justify any extended delay and that,absent such explanation,the dismissal of the government claim must be affirmed.id.
robinson contends that there is no appreciable difference between his case and.he notes that the nearly delay in his case is two months greater than the period in.the government argues that and are inapposite because those cases involved judicial forfeitures,whereas this case concerned an administrative forfeiture.this position is without merit.
this court in confronted the government delay in giving administrative notice of an intended forfeiture,and the decision was grounded in due process.at w e base our decision on the constitutional requirement of due process,which relied on,is applicable to this case.moreover,this court has also applied the barker balancing test in an unpublished but precedential case analyzing a claimed due process violation because of a delay in the initial publication and mail notice following a seizure of cash during a drug investigation.see united states in united states currency,slip op.at,cir.may,cir.unpublished opinions issued before january,are precedential.thus,contrary to the government assertion,the balancing test is applicable to robinson claim.
the government further argues that this district court,and consequently this court,lack jurisdiction to collaterally review unreasonable delay issues.the government is correct to the extent that district court review of a final administrative forfeiture is limited.district courts lack jurisdiction to review the merits of such a forfeiture unless the agency failed to follow statutory and constitutional due process standards.see united states schinnell,cir once the administrative forfeiture was completed,the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the forfeiture except for failure to comply with procedural requirements or to comport with due process.due process standards,however,encompass the timeliness of the forfeiture notice.see,robinson united states,cir an unreasonably long retention without instituting a forfeiture proceeding can constitute a denial of due process.citing,d.
whether the delay in the government first notice to robinson was unjustified presents a close question in light of this court decision in.there,this court was critical of the government for failing to offer an explanation for the delay from the seizure to the first notice,at.here,the government waited nearly eight months from the november,seizure before it attempted to send its first notice to robinson.in light of the circumstances as a whole as discussed below,however,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment upholding the forfeiture.
length of delay 
first,there is no obvious bright line dictating when a hearing must occur,at.similarly,there is no obvious bright line as to when the government must first notify a party of its intent to forfeit seized funds.the first factor of the analysis,the length of the delay,does not automatically require a conclusion that due process was violated.rather,we consider the length of the delay in relation to the other factors,and the government must explain and justify substantial delays in seeking forfeiture of seized property,at.
