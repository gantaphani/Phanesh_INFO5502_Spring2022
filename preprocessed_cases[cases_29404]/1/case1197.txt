opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on a petition for review of a disposition of the benefits review board board awarding benefits to edward difidelto under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,following his sustaining an injury compensable under the lhwca.the sole issue in these proceedings is whether delaware river stevedores,drs,difidelto employer,had authority under a provision of the lhwca,j section j,to require difidelto to report information regarding his earnings when it was not paying him compensation at the time of its requests section j provides that an employer may inform a disabled employee of his obligation to report his earnings to the employer from employment or and further provides that if the employee fails to report or knowingly or willfully omits or understates his earnings,he forfeits his right to compensation with respect to any period during which he was required to file the report.knowledge of the amount of an employee earnings may be useful to an employer as those earnings may enable it to reduce or even eliminate the obligation that it otherwise would have to make payments to a disabled employee on account of a injury 
ii.factual and procedural history 
the material facts and procedural history with regard to these proceedings are not in dispute.on january,difidelto suffered a injury in the course and scope of his employment with drs entitling him to receive benefits from drs under the lhwca.initially,drs voluntarily made the payments without an adjudication or order,but on november,it discontinued them as it controverted its obligation to do so on the basis of a medical opinion that difidelto had recovered fully from his injuries.when drs controverted difidelto claim,it requested the district director of the office of workers compensation programs to refer the case to the office of administrative law judges.not surprisingly,difidelto rejected drs position,and thus he prosecuted a claim for benefits under the lhwca.
after drs requested a hearing in the case,and at a time that it no longer was making payments to difidelto,it sent three forms to his attorney,pursuant to section j,seeking information about his earnings from employment or.the director,office of workers compensation programs director,adopted form for the reporting of earnings pursuant to section j.the first and second forms that drs sent on january and february,respectively,identified the reporting period as being from january,to january.thereafter,on april,drs sent difidelto attorney a third form requesting information about difidelto earnings between january,and april.although difidelto received drs requests,he refused to report his earnings as he contended that he did not have a legal obligation to do so as long as drs was not paying him compensation.
an administrative law judge alj held a hearing in this case on july,following which on june,he issued his decision and order awarding difidelto benefits.in his june,decision and order,the alj found,inter alia,that even though difidelto was entitled to reinstatement of his compensation payments,he had forfeited his right to compensation for the period between january,and april,because he failed to report his earnings as drs requested.
in reaching this result,the alj indicated that forfeiture penalties apply if an employee fails to respond or responds inaccurately to a form request.in considering the applicability of the section j reporting requirement,the alj determined that the decisive factor is whether earnings information is sought for periods during which an employee earnings could affect employer liability for compensation.app.at quoting plappert marine corps,ben.bd.serv,aff,ben.bd.serv.en banc.inasmuch as drs request covered a period for which difidelto sought and obtained compensation,the alj applied the forfeiture to that period and denied him compensation from january,to april.
difidelto then filed a timely request with the alj to reconsider the june,decision and order.in support for his argument against forfeiture,difidelto relied on the regulation implementing section j,a,and the legislative history of section j,as set forth in a house of representatives conference report.difidelto contended that both authorities describe a disabled employee within section j as an individual to whom the employer is paying compensation when it requires an earnings report.clearly,even though drs had paid difidelto compensation,it was not doing so when it sent him the forms and thus difidelto,at that time,did not consider himself to be a disabled employee for purposes of section j.
on june,the alj issued a decision and order granting claimant request for reconsideration.in the june,decision and order,the alj corrected technical deficiencies in the june,decision and order with respect to the time periods during which difidelto was entitled to total versus partial compensation the alj,however,rejected difidelto request that the alj reconsider his findings with respect to the forfeiture of benefits as the alj adhered to his view that,according to plappert,the reporting obligation applies to any period during which the employee claims compensation.
on july,difidelto filed a timely appeal to the board.difidelto argued again that a disabled employee must be receiving compensation when the employer asks for his earnings information pursuant to section j.a divided panel on july,issued its decision and order in which it affirmed the order of the alj awarding compensation at a partial rate but vacated the alj order on the forfeiture issue and remanded the case to the alj to make further findings regarding difidelto compensation status at the time drs requested that difidelto complete and return the forms.the dissenting member would have reversed the alj outright on the forfeiture issue because,in her view,difidelto was not a disabled employee within section j when drs sent him the forms.
on july,the director filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion to hold the difidelto appeal in abeyance with the board to await its decision in briskie weeks marine,ben.bd.serv,another appeal then pending before it concerning the same issue involved here.difidelto and drs joined in the director request.before the board ruled on the july,motion,it decided briskie on august.in briskie the board concluded that section j was somewhat ambiguous,and thus it looked to the section implementing regulation and legislative history for guidance on the forfeiture issue.ultimately,the board held in briskie that section j applied only during a period in which an employer was paying compensation.
in light of briskie,drs resort to forfeiture was foreclosed in this case,and thus the board panel upheld difidelto entitlement to the entire compensation award.on october,the board issued its final order in this case,styled as an order on motion for reconsideration,in which,relying on briskie,it reversed the alj decision and order on the forfeiture issue.on december,drs timely filed a petition for review with this court 
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the board had jurisdiction over difidelto appeal because he timely filed his petition for review of the alj decision.see c,a.the director timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the board july,order,which led to the board october,order at issue here.we have jurisdiction over drs petition for review as it timely filed it within days of the board october,order on reconsideration.see c a.venue is proper in this court,as difidelto suffered his injury in new jersey.see c.

iv.discussion 
it is evident from chevron that in these proceedings dealing with statutory construction,we must make an initial determination,and,depending upon our first determination,possibly make a second determination.as might be expected,each side argues that section j unambiguously requires that we decide the case in its favor.drs contends that a person is a disabled employee within section j at the time of injury,the moment at which his incapacity to earn wages arises.thus,regardless of difidelto possible medical recovery,drs contends that he is a disabled employee within section j.on the other hand,difidelto and the director argue that disabled employee for purposes of section j must mean an individual to whom compensation for disability is being paid at the time that the employer sends the individual a form.
this division of views is understandable inasmuch as neither section j nor any other provision of the lhwca defines disabled employee.the lhwca does indicate that d isability means incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment,and employee means,with exceptions not germane here,any person engaged in maritime employment id.at.nevertheless it is not clear that we should combine these two terms to define disabled employee for purposes of section j without regard for whether the employer is paying compensation to him when it seeks earnings information from the employee inasmuch as section j simply does not address this point explicitly.
this case involves an application of section j when an employee actual physical condition changes or may have changed as drs initially voluntarily paid difidelto compensation and then discontinued doing so when it asserted that he had recovered from his injury.certainly,it is possible that the term disabled employee within section j may have a temporal element so that an employee originally disabled may not always thereafter be regarded as disabled within that section.indeed,it is ironical that although drs asserts that difidelto was a disabled employee when it sent him the form requests,it thought that he had recovered from his injury,whereas difidelto claims that at that time he was still physically disabled.
as we have indicated,the director and difidelto make an argument that a disabled employee must mean an individual to whom compensation for disability is being paid pursuant to.director br.at see difidelto br.at.but we are not convinced that congress intent is unmistakable on this point.in this regard we point out that although the term disabled employee for purposes of section j need not necessarily be linked to the definitions of disability and employee in sections and,it would not be unreasonable to link them because an employer legitimately might want to know whether an employee capacity to earn his wages had been impaired even though the employer is not paying him compensation.after all,as is the case here,an injured employee might seek compensation from an employer declining to pay it,and,if the employer is required to pay benefits,the employee earnings could reduce or even eliminate the compensation payments the employer otherwise would be obliged to pay.
yet there is a limitation on an employer need to know the amount of an employee earnings at a time that the employer is not paying compensation because even if an employee knowingly and willfully omits or understates any part of his earnings,see j,the employer may recover compensation it has paid only by a deduction from the compensation payable to the employee.id.at j.moreover,if it is determined that an employee is not disabled and is not entitled to benefits,he will not be required to refund earlier payments to which he had not been entitled,for in that circumstance he has an obligation to reimburse his employer only by deduction from ongoing compensation.see j.thus,if drs had demonstrated that difidelto had,in fact,not been disabled when drs had been making payments to him,knowledge of the amount of his earnings during the time drs had been making payments might not have been of assistance to 
furthermore,we point out that,as the director has noted,section j is only one of three provisions in the lhwca permitting an employer to recoup previously paid compensation.we consider all these provisions as they might give an employer reason to seek the form information.thus,j provides that if an employer has made advance payments of compensation,he shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of any unpaid installment or installments of compensation due.additionally,provides that an employer may obtain reimbursement from unpaid compensation if modification proceedings result in a decreased compensation rate that applies retroactively to past payments.but inasmuch as these provisions allow an employer to recoup advances or overpayments only from future payments,they are of no use to an employer so long as it is not paying compensation.moreover,as we have indicated,the information that an employer might obtain from the answers to a form is of no use to an employer not currently making payments even if the employee had obtained his earlier payments through willful misreporting,for even in that aggravated circumstance the employee need not make repayments.see lennon waterfront,cir stevedoring servs.of am.eggert,cir indeed,the director in his brief states that this limitation on the source of funds from which the employee must make repayment extends even to fraud cases.director br.at.
nevertheless,though we conclude that the information that an employer might obtain from the answers to a form may be of no use to it if it is not paying compensation,still we believe that the director overstates the information lack of value when he asserts that an employer has an effective remedy in forfeiture only if it also owes future compensation payments to the employee.forfeiture affords no relief to an employer otherwise,and the proceedings would be an exercise in futility.director br.at emphasis in original.while it may be that the answers to a form are useless to an employer in advance payment,retroactive modification,and misrepresentation cases if the employer is not making payments,as we have explained the answers might be valuable to an employer not making payments in cases involving disputes over employees right to ongoing or future compensation.as the director acknowledges,i f the employee eventually obtains an award and the employer begins paying compensation,then the employer may request earnings information concerning any period of disability covered by the award.director br.at.see plappert,ben.bd.serv.at.
the director asserts that inasmuch as an employer who starts to pay compensation may request a statement of the employee earnings at that time,it gains no advantage by seeking the information before it has any use for it.director br.at.we are,however,far from certain that an employer who is obliged to pay compensation does not obtain any benefit from having an employee earnings information before the payments are due.in this regard,we reiterate that the answers to a form could reveal information that might allow an employer to reduce the amount of or even eliminate the payments for which it is liable.thus,the director position seems to overlook the difference between starting and stopping payments,and the necessary delay between these events,and not starting them or starting them in a reduced amount by reason of an em
