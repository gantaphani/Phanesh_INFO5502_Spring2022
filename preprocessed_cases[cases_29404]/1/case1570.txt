at issue in this case is the federal emergency management agency fema administration of the home repair provisions of section of the stafford act,entitled federal assistance to individuals and households and codified at.the district court issued a preliminary injunction requiring fema to publish standards that comply with j.fema appealed,and this court issued a stay of the injunctive relief pending the outcome of the appeal.we now vacate the district court grant of injunctive relief and remand the case.
this suit arose in the wake of hurricane dolly,which damaged thousands of homes in the rio grande valley.president bush declared dolly a major disaster,and fema made available housing assistance,including home repair under.more than families sought assistance from fema,which approved the distribution of million under its individuals and households programs,including million for housing assistance.
fema denied assistance to numerous homeowners,often by sending written explanation that denial was due to insufficient damage because b ased on your fema inspection,we have determined that the disaster has not caused your home to be unsafe to live in.this determination was based solely on the damage to your home that are sic related to this disaster.the plaintiffs in this case comprise homeowners and a group representing homeowners who unsuccessfully challenged fema determinations through the administrative appeals process.
plaintiffs then filed the instant suit,pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,et.the complaint alleges that fema violated a and j by failing to adopt and implement ascertainable standards necessary to insure that housing repair assistance under c is made available to victims of hurricane dolly in an equitable and impartial manner.it also alleges that fema use of an unpublished deferred maintenance policy violates a by promoting economic discrimination.fema failure to publish and apply ascertainable standards,plaintiffs assert,is the proximate cause of ongoing irreparable injuries to plaintiffs and their families.
plaintiffs sought only injunctive relief.they asked the district court to enjoin fema to publish and apply ascertainable standards to make its housing repair assistance decisions enjoin fema to reconsider all denials of housing repair assistance for disaster hurricane dolly using the new standards enjoin fema to provide timely and adequate notice of its actions to applicants for home repair assistance and award plaintiffs their costs and litigation expenses.
the district court granted a preliminary injunction based on j,which the court found established mandatory,affirmative requirements on fema.the court rejected plaintiffs theory based on a,which it found imposed only a discretionary burden on fema.the court noted that j does not contain the same discretionary language,and that,while fema had discretion to determine the content and specificity of the eligibility requirements,fema housing eligibility regulations simply duplicated and failed to supplement the enabling statute.section j,the court explained,necessitates that fema regulations include further criteria and standards of eligibility beyond those identified by federal law.
the district court performed the required preliminary injunction balancing test,finding that plaintiffs had a likelihood of success on the merits,that there was a substantial threat that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction,that the threatened injury to plaintiffs outweighed the damage the injunction would cause fema,and that the public interest favored the injunction.the court found that if fema were to outline more specific criteria and standards for eligibility,decisions made by fema implementing eligibility requirements could increase the relief awards granted to some or many of the plaintiffs,which would alleviate their injuries.
having determined that a preliminary injunction was appropriate,the court enjoined fema to 
publish definite and ascertainable criteria,standards,and procedures for determining eligibility for relief assistance beyond which is identified sic by federal law in compliance with the congressional mandate found in j and 
reconsider plaintiffs applications for housing relief assistance for damage from hurricane dolly,disaster,using the ascertainable criteria,standards,and procedures for determining eligibility for relief assistance published in compliance with paragraph.
within sixty days of entry of this order,file a proposed plan by which fema will comply with this order,including what specific actions it plans and its proposed dates for completing each action.plaintiffs shall have twenty days to respond to fema proposed plan with any objections.
fema filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to a and moved to stay the injunction in this court.we granted the motion to stay and sua sponte expedited the appeal.
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should only issue if the movant shows a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted the threatened injury outweighs any harm that will result to the if the injunction is granted and the injunction will not disserve the public interest.ridgely fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.although the ultimate decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion,a decision grounded in erroneous legal principles is reviewed de novo.byrum landreth,cir quotation omitted.each element of the injunction analysis typically involves questions of fact and law.the factual components of the decision are subject to a standard of review,while legal conclusions are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.white carlucci,cir citations and quotation omitted.
in their briefing,the parties primarily debate the district court finding that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.we likewise find that this issue,which turns on whether fema has complied with j,resolves the appeal.
initially,the parties dispute whether j is a requirement to prescribe certain rules or a grant of authority that fema may or may not exercise.we agree with plaintiffs that j requires fema to promulgate regulations.subsection j is phrased in mandatory language,in contrast to other parts of the stafford act that give fema discretion about what regulations to create.compare the president may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this chapter emphases added,with id.j the president shall prescribe rules and regulations to carry out this section,including criteria,standards,and procedures for determining eligibility for assistance.emphasis added.if j leaves the decision whether to promulgate regulations within fema discretion,it adds nothing to the statutory scheme in light of the agency general discretion to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary granted by.because we can not presume that j is meaningless,we conclude that the section must impose some requirement on fema to promulgate,inter alia,housing eligibility regulations.
having concluded that j is a requirement to prescribe certain rules rather than a grant of authority that fema may or may not exercise,we turn to the critical issue in this case whether fema has complied with j.in,fema published an interim final rule,which,according to fema,contains the regulations called for by j.see.the parties vigorously dispute the extent to which the regulations set forth ascertainable criteria,standards,and procedures for determining housing assistance eligibility.
