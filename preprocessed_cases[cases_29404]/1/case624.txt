this appeal raises two issues of first impression in this circuit whether the notice requirements of immigration and nationality act ina a,a are satisfied by service of a notice to appear that indicates that the date and time of a hearing will be set in the future,followed by service of a separate notice specifying the precise date and time of the hearing and whether such notice triggers the rule of ina d a,d a notwithstanding any defect in service of subsequent notices of change in the time or place of the hearing under ina a,a 
we hold that a may be satisfied by a combination of notices and that,once notice complying with a is provided,the rule of d a is triggered,notwithstanding any defects in subsequent notices under a.
background 
in september,guamanrrigra entered the united states without inspection.on april,guamanrrigra was served with a notice to appear april nta,which was mailed to him directly at his port chester,new york,address.the april nta informed guamanrrigra that he was removable under ina a a i,a a i as an alien present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled,and under a a i i,a a i i as an alien who,at the time of application for admission,was not in possession of valid entry documentation.accordingly,it ordered guamanrrigra to appear before an immigration judge of the united states department of justice at federal.boston,ma room on a date to be set at a time to be set to show why he should not be removed from the united states.notice to appear,file no,april,emphasis added.
on may,the immigration court in boston mailed to guamanrrigra a notice of hearing in removal proceedings may notice of hearing at the address listed on the april nta,indicating that his hearing had been scheduled for august,at.it is undisputed that guamanrrigra and his counsel received both the april nta and the may notice of hearing.
on august,an ij in boston granted guamanrrigra motion for a change in venue to the immigration court in new york city.on august,the immigration court in new york city mailed a notice of hearing august notice of hearing to guamanrrigra counsel,notifying him that a hearing was scheduled for august,at.the certificate of service indicates that the august notice of hearing was sent to billy cris vidal,guamanrrigra attorney at the time,at street in manhattan.the eoir form notice of attorney appearance,however,contains a different address for vidal.a.it is therefore not clear whether the august notice of hearing was ever received by guamanrrigra counsel.guamanrrigra,for his part,contends that he guamanrrigra never received this notice and there is no record evidence that it was mailed to his home address in port chester 
when guamanrrigra did not appear at the august,hearing,the ij conducted an in absentia hearing pursuant to ina b a,b a and ordered guamanrrigra removed to ecuador.
notwithstanding this order,guamanrrigra remained in the united states undisturbed for several more years until,on january,he was stopped for speeding in springfield,vermont.a united states immigration and customs enforcement electronic hit appeared in the computer system employed by the police officer,notifying the officer of the outstanding removal order in the new york immigration court.guamanrrigra was taken into custody and transferred to the franklin county jail,where he was detained for over a month.
on january,guamanrrigra counsel filed a motion to reopen his removal proceeding and to rescind the august in absentia order of removal,claiming that guamanrrigra had never received a notice to appear or a hearing notice relating to the august,proceeding.in a written order dated february,the ij granted guamanrrigra motion to reopen,finding that,because the august notice of hearing had not been mailed to the address guamanrrigra counsel provided in his standard appearance form,and because a copy of that notice was not mailed directly to guamanrrigra,there was sufficient evidence to suggest that guamanrrigra had not received notice of the august,hearing.
guamanrrigra subsequently appeared at a june hearing in new york,where he confirmed that he had received the april nta and the may notice of hearing,admitted the allegations contained therein,and conceded removability.he sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal and adjustment of status pursuant to ina b,which permits the attorney general to cancel removal and adjust the status of an otherwise deportable alien who,among other conditions,has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of his application.b a the government moved to pretermit guamanrrigra application for cancellation of removal arguing that guamanrrigra had not been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of ten years immediately prior to his january application for relief,because the service of the april nta had stopped the accrual of time of continuous presence in accordance with the rule of d a in response,guamanrrigra counsel argued that the failure of the department of homeland security dhs to include the date and time of the projected hearing in the april nta,as required under a g i rendered the document fatally defective,and therefore service of the april nta had not terminated guamanrrigra accrual of time of continuous presence.
following briefing and a september merits hearing,the ij issued an oral decision denying guamanrrigra application for cancellation of removal and ordering him removed to ecuador.the ij found that personal service of the april nta on guamanrrigra revealing to him that he is in proceedings and the consequences of failing to appear in proceedings,constituted proper service under a,notwithstanding the fact that the april nta did not specify the date and time of the projected hearing.moreover,the ij found that guamanrrigra concerns that service of the april nta was not properly consummated under a were mitigated by the fact that he indisputably received a notice of hearing on may,that specified the date,time,and location at which his hearing would be held.accordingly,the ij found that guamanrrigra continuous presence in the united states was tolled as of april,when he was properly served with the notice to appear pursuant to section a of the act,and therefore he was ineligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under b.
guamanrrigra appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.in september,the bia dismissed guamanrrigra appeal,affirming the ij decision denying cancellation of removal.relying on the seventh circuit decision in dababneh gonzales,cir,the bia held that a notice to appear indicating that the date and time of the alien hearing is forthcoming,combined with a subsequent notice of hearing specifying the date and time of the hearing,complies with the notice requirements of a,and therefore service of these documents triggers the rule under d,so as to cut off guamanrrigra accrual of time of continuous presence in the united states.the bia also found that,contrary to guamanrrigra argument,neither the boston immigration court order transferring venue to new york city prior to his initial hearing on august,nor the new york city immigration court subsequent failure to provide proper notice of his august,hearing,vitiate d the effectiveness of notice that guamanrrigra had already received.
guamanrrigra timely petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.
