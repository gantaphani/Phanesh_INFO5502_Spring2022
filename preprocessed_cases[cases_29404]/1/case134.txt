appellant thomas atwater sought review of his dismissal from his teaching position in the manchester essex regional school district school district,first in massachusetts state court and then in massachusetts federal district court.concluding that atwater claims were barred by res judicata,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees,the school district and the massachusetts commissioner of elementary and secondary education commissioner.atwater now appeals the grant of summary judgment,presenting a number of reasons why res judicata does not bar his federal claims from adjudication in federal court.finding none persuasive,we affirm.
background 
conduct unbecoming 
atwater was a teacher with professional status in the school district until march,when he was informed by letter of the district superintendent intention to dismiss him from his employment for inappropriate sexual conduct toward a student the particular instances giving rise to atwater dismissal are not necessary for our determination,and so we do not review them in detail here.atwater invoked his right under.laws ch,to seek review of the superintendent action by filing a petition for arbitration with the commissioner.pursuant to the procedures required by section,the commissioner coordinated the selection of a private arbitrator to resolve atwater challenge to his dismissal after a arbitration,the arbitrator issued a page decision affirming atwater dismissal for conduct unbecoming of a teacher and finding that the superintendent and the school district did not violate section in dismissing him.
a multiplicity of lawsuits 
on august,atwater filed suit in massachusetts superior court challenging the discharge of his employment and seeking to vacate the arbitrator decision.over three weeks later,on august,atwater filed this complaint in federal court.three counts advanced supposed violations the arbitrator failed to employ the statutory standard in determining his petition count,which meant she exceeded her statutory authority under section count,and,acting on behalf of the commissioner,she exhibited bias and prejudice against him count.three counts advanced supposed violations ineffective administrative supervision,transgressing his right to procedural due process count improper delegation of a governmental function count and improper insulation of determination by private individual from meaningful judicial review,transgressing some sort of generalized due process right count.in footnotes to his complaint,atwater,citing england louisiana state board of medical examiners,asserted that he included the state claims for completeness but did not submit them for the federal court adjudication.
the very next day,august,atwater amended his complaint so that it contained exactly the same six claims as his complaint.and he noted that he had included the federal claims only for completeness and not for the state court adjudication,again citing to england.along with his amended complaint,atwater submitted to the state court a notice of reservation of federal claims,apprising that court that he had sued the same defendants in federal court on the same grounds.he again stated that he included the federal claims only to inform the state court and for completeness,and he purported to reserve the claims for adjudication in federal court,once more referencing england.he also noted his intent to seek a stay of the action in federal court pending the state court determination on his claims and after the conclusion of any additional proceedings.
in answering the amended complaint,the commissioner and the school district objected to atwater attempt to reserve his federal claims,stating that he had improperly sought an england reservation of the federal claims in counts four,five,and six.the commissioner specifically noted that the federal court had not yet remitted atwater to state court on abstention grounds,and the school district added that his claims should be dismissed for improper claim splitting.the commissioner and the school district made the very same points in answering the complaint.
in a joint scheduling conference statement,the parties,citing railroad commission of texas pullman,moved the federal court to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the related case.resolving that case first will affect substantially the constitutional issues before the federal court,the parties wrote,so a stay based on pullman abstention principles is appropriate.but the parties stressed that,by joining this motion,neither the commissioner nor the school district waive d their objections to atwater contention that he has effectively reserved his federal constitutional claims for this c ourt consideration.the district court responded by entering an order of closure for statistical purposes,dismissing the case without prejudice to the parties moving to restore the case to the docket if any further action is required upon completion and termination of any state court proceedings 
a state court adjudication 
atwater proceeded with his claims in state court.on cross motions for summary judgment,the court rejected atwater claims and affirmed the arbitrator decision.in a footnote appearing on the opening page of its decision,the court wrote that atwater had also alleged three claims in his complaint but had expressly reserved them for adjudication in federal court.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc upheld the entry of summary judgment for the commissioner and the school district,with a footnote in the opinion background section saying 
atwater also raised three federal claims,including federal due process claims,which he has reserved for adjudication by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.thus,these claims are not before us.

back to federal court 
after the conclusion of his case,atwater filed a motion to reopen his case,seeking to adjudicate his federal claims.neither the commissioner nor the school district opposed the restoration of the case.but both took pains to again emphasize their view that atwater purported england reservation was a nonstarter.
the commissioner and the school district moved for summary judgment,arguing that the state court judgment was res judicata in the federal proceeding and that his attempted england reservation failed.atwater opposed the motions and for summary judgment himself,asserting that principles did not bar his federal claims and that his england reservation was effective.rejecting atwater arguments,the district court held that his supposed england reservation was ineffective and that his federal claims could have been litigated in the previous case and so were barred under res judicata.consequently,the district court denied his motion and granted summary judgment to the commissioner and the school district.this appeal followed,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
the parties who agree on little else correctly agree that res judicata bars atwater claims unless an exception applies atwater insists that three exceptions are in play.he first argues that his england reservation lets him escape the preclusive effect of the judgment.alternatively,he argues that the state courts expressly reserved his right to pursue his claims in federal court and that we must respect what they did.and finally,he argues that,regardless of ordinary rules,the equities require that we let his federal case go forward.
we first set out the standard and then deal with each argument in turn.
summary judgment standard 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the facts in the light most favorable to atwater.see alvarado donahoe,cir.summary judgment is called for when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gerald of,cir quoting mart√≠nez burgos guayama,cir see.a.the presence of for summary judgment neither dilutes nor distorts this standard of review.mandel boston phoenix,cir.
england reservation 
thanks to the supreme court england decision,parties forced by a federal judge to litigate their claims in state court can return to federal court and have their claims heard,free of any preclusive effect of the judgment.what is required is an england reservation.see england,at see also geiger foley hoag llp ret.plan,cir.here is how that works if a plaintiff has first filed suit in federal court,and if that court orders a pullman abstention a type of abstention that,basically,permits the federal court to ask a state court to clarify a murky question of state law involved in the case and if the plaintiff tell s the state court that it wishes to litigate its federal claim in federal court,then the plaintiff can go back to the federal forum for determination of the federal question after the state court has decided the issue,without preclusion principles standing in the way.see duty free shop,admin.de terrenos de,cir see also rivera feliciano acevedo vila,cir.
atwater never says that his case fits perfectly within this paradigm.he just thinks that it is close enough.the district court closure order,he writes,shared many characteristics of a order it stopped all proceedings and effectively relegated him to state court,though it permitted any party to move to reopen the case after proceedings ended.functionally,the closure order is nearly indistinguishable from a pullman abstention order or so he asserts.
close enough counts with horseshoes and hand grenades but not with england reservations.the right to reserve claims arises only when the district court abstains under pullman.see,geiger,at citing san remo hotel,city cnty.of san francisco,and duty free shop,at.and the simple truth is that the district court closure order is not a order.sure,the parties jointly requested that the court enter a pullman stay.but the district court took a different tack.the court spent no time checking whether substantial uncertainty exists over the meaning of the state law in question or whether resolving the question will or may well obviate the need to resolve a significant federal constitutional question both of which are essential pullman prerequisites.batterman leahy,cir emphasis added.rather,as the court later explained,it assumed that,like many similarly situated plaintiffs,atwater had chosen to proceed first in state court because he thought he had a greater likelihood of success there.and the reason behind the court order of closure for statistical purposes which is what the court called it practically leaps off the printed page of that document to avoid the necessity of counsel to appear at periodic status conferences,or file status reports certainly this is not the stuff of a pullman abstention.see generally duty free shop,at holding that england,and its reservations,are not relevant where the purpose of the abstention is not clarification of state law.
if that were not enough to sink atwater argument and it most assuredly is there is also this.under our caselaw,litigants must first file suit in federal court to secure an england reservation.see,barreto rosa varona mendez,cir citing allen mccurry,and partido nuevo progresista perez,cir noting that,for an england reservation to be effective,a plaintiff must initially file suit in federal court and have the district court abstain from hearing the case pending resolution of the state claims in state court duty free shop,at explaining that england permits a plaintiff who files a case in federal court before state proceedings begin to tell the state court that it wishes to litigate its federal claim in that federal court fuller ramon gil,cir stressing that to make an england reservation,a litigant must establish its right to have its federal claims adjudicated in a federal forum by properly invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court in the first instance.atwater filed suit in state court first,which undoes his theory.
state court reservations 
even putting england aside,atwater thinks that he should still win.his argument goes something like this massachusetts takes the view that plaintiffs can split claims among different suits something the rule normally forbids if the court in the earlier action expressly reserves plaintiffs right to bring those claims in a later action.perroncello donahue,rev on other grounds,the key being an express reservation.or the lack of it.anyway,trying to squeeze himself within this narrow exception,atwater points to the footnotes discussed above as proof that the state forum approved his claim splitting meaning,the argument continues,that the judgment can have no preclusive effect the federal claims 
but devastating to his position,atwater points to nothing that remotely suggests that this is what the state courts had in mind when they penned these fleeting passages.for our part,we see no clue in the record that he ever asked the state courts to say that the judgment has zero preclusive effect on the federal claims.and the opinions themselves reveal no whisper of a hint of an intimation that the state courts had anything to say on that subject neither court tossed around words like res judicata or claim preclusion,and neither cited let alone discussed any authority touching on a state court ability to reserve a litigant right to maintain a further suit,free of certain concerns.that speaks volumes.
in law,as in life,context matters.and taken in their proper context,the footnotes are simply descriptions of what atwater said he had done regarding his claims,not on the effect of his actions and certainly not rulings that the judgment carries no preclusive effect in this instance.consequently,his argument has no traction.
not so fast,atwater says.clinging to our opinion in thomas contoocook valley school district,cir,and the ninth circuit opinion in dodd hood river county,cir,he still believes that he holds a winning hand.neither decision helps him,however,not even a little bit.
as for thomas,in that case a school board in new hampshire had made two findings concerning a school decision not to renew teacher thomas contract first,thomas had performed her job poorly,and second,her health issues had no direct bearing on her nonrenewal.at.on administrative appeal,a state agency upheld the finding but said her health concerns were a factor in the school decision,adding and this is what matters for our purposes whether the school action infracted laws is a question best left to another tribunal before which thomas had a pending discrimination claim.id.at.the new hampshire supreme court later affirmed,and eventually thomas discrimination claim found its way to federal court.id.relying on section b of the restatement,we saw no other interpretation of the agency decision but as an express reservation of thomas discrimination claim for further adjudication a reservation the new hampshire supreme court did not disturb,we noted,which meant that res judicata did not apply.id.at.of course,there we were interpreting new hampshire law,not massachusetts law,which is a blow to atwater argument.also unfortunately for him,nothing resembling the type of express reservation in thomas is evident here.
as for dodd,the ninth circuit did say that a court may be able to reserve part of a plaintiff claim for subsequent litigation by expressly omitting any decision with regard to it in the first judgment.at emphasis added concluding that the oregon courts sufficiently reserved plaintiff federal claims by repeatedly acknowledging that those claims were not before them and were pending in the federal district court.the ninth circuit was applying oregon law,which finds a reservation express under section b of the restatement if a litigant insists that he has reserved his federal claims for decision in federal court and the state court then does not address those claims.at.
the restatement section b is an exception to the general rule against claim splitting set out in section.the rule section a claim for purposes includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction,or series of connected transactions,out of which the action arose.the exception section b the general rule does not apply to extinguish the claim,and part or all of the claim subsist
