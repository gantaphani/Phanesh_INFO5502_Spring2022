janice andreoli appeals the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of her employer on her title vii claims for hostile work environment and retaliation,and on her rehabilitation act claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodation.andreoli proffered evidence of sexually harassing behavior toward her by her coworker,larry delutiis,while she was employed by the department of defense at the defense supply center in philadelphia dscp.the district court held that,even if she proved the other elements necessary for a hostile work environment claim,her employer could not be held liable because management took prompt and adequate remedial action upon learning of delutiis conduct,thus availing itself of the defense approved by the supreme court in burlington industries,ellerth,d.we conclude that in doing so,the district court resolved issues of disputed fact that should have been submitted to a jury.
andreoli also contended that her employer retaliated against her after she engaged in employment activities protected by title vii,including speaking with the equal employment opportunity eeo office at the dscp.andreoli further asserted that the continuing abuse she endured at her workplace rendered her disabled and that the dscp failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation.we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of her employer on both of these claims because andreoli did not proffer sufficient evidence to support a finding that her employer alleged adverse actions were causally connected to her protected employment activity under title vii,or that she is disabled within the meaning of the rehabilitation act.we will therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings on andreoli hostile work environment claim.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on andreoli hostile work environment claim based on the conclusion that,under the applicable law,andreoli employer could not be held liable for delutiis conduct.although this ruling was essentially,we think it helpful to discuss the elements of a hostile work environment claim before delving into the lengthy factual underpinnings of this case.
in order to state a claim under title vii for discrimination resulting from a hostile work environment,an employee must show that the employee suffered intentional discrimination because of her sex,the discrimination was pervasive and regular,the discrimination detrimentally affected the employee,the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position,and the existence of respondeat superior liability.weston pennsylvania,cir.here the district court focused on the last factor,and only that factor,and we will do so as well.
an employer will be liable for the harassing conduct of the alleged victim coworker if the employer was negligent or reckless in failing to train,discipline,fire or take remedial action upon notice of harassment.bonenberger plymouth,cir citing bouton bmw of,cir.an employer is negligent if it knew or should have known about the harassment,but failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action.jensen potter,cir internal quotations omitted.even if the remedial action does not stop the alleged harassment it is adequate if it is reasonably calculated to end the harassment.id.quoting knabe boury,cir.
in most cases,the focus will be on the timing and nature of the employer response.we have found an employer actions to be adequate,as a matter of law,where management undertook an investigation of the employee complaint within a day after being notified of the harassment,spoke to the alleged harasser about the allegations and the company sexual harassment policy,and warned the harasser that the company does not tolerate any sexual comments or actions.see knabe boury,cir.on the other hand,we have denied summary judgment in favor of an employer when there was a delay between when the employer was notified of the complaint and when the employer took remedial action.jensen,at.we have also denied summary judgment in favor of an employer when there was evidence that the employee supervisor knew about the harassment and did nothing for three months,despite other evidence that the alleged harasser supervisor later took immediate action upon learning of the harassment.bonenberger,at.we reasoned that a jury should decide whether the employer remedial action was prompt and adequate.
here,the district court decided that the remedial actions taken by andreoli employer were prompt and adequate,as a matter of law.we will now review the factual background of andreoli claims in some detail in order to explain more fully our grounds for concluding that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding the adequacy and promptness of andreoli employer remedial actions.we will then discuss our rationale for affirming as to the other two claims.
most of the underlying facts are undisputed.where there is a dispute,we view the facts in the light most favorable to andreoli.abramson william paterson coll.of,cir.
andreoli worked as a federal employee at the dscp from until,when she stopped coming to work because she was suffering from stress disorder and depression in reaction to the behavior of her coworker,larry delutiis.it all started in,when delutiis began making offensive,comments to andreoli about women from work or women that he had seen outside of work.his comments and actions were,at best,objectionable and,at worst,lewd and harassing 
when this conduct first began,andreoli told delutiis repeatedly that his comments were unwelcome and also complained to her supervisors at the dscp.there is no evidence that the supervisors to whom andreoli complained,including her assistant shift supervisor and her shift supervisor,theodore desanto,took any action to prevent or remedy the ongoing harassment.in response to andreoli complaints,the first line supervisor on her shift told her not to bother him with this shit.app.at.nothing was done after andreoli,visibly shaking and crying,told desanto that delutiis had pushed his hand between her legs and refused to remove it.desanto ignored andreoli distress,and joined delutiis in laughing at the suggestion that andreoli had pushed delutiis hand between her legs and told him to feel her or finger her.app.at.andreoli complained and made specific requests for a shift change,but the supervisor in charge of all three shifts of workers at the dscp failed to act,and tried to avoid discussing the matter with andreoli.
there was one exception to this pattern of supervisory inaction division chief robert olewnik.after failing to elicit any response from the four supervisors to whom she complained,andreoli sought out olewnik and told him of the escalating,pervasive,hostile,sexually harassing situation with delutiis.olewnik was not surprised.he assured andreoli that he would take care of it.app.at.however,despite these assurances,nothing happened,and andreoli sought his help a few more times.several months after andreoli first complained,olewnik transferred delutiis to a different shift.he also refused to promote delutiis to a supervisory position at the dscp,in part because andreoli had told him that delutiis had put his hand under her dress.app.at.delutiis retaliated against olewnik by filing a reverse discrimination charge against the dscp.andreoli provided an affidavit describing delutiis harassment to olewnik for use in defending against delutiis discrimination complaint,which delutiis eventually withdrew.olewnik left the dscp in july.
delutiis did not change his ways after he was transferred to a different shift.in,delutiis again began making derogatory comments about women in andreoli presence,referring to his nickname and making remarks about how women should not be in positions to make any decisions.delutiis would linger around the office after his shift was over and andreoli had begun work on her shift,hanging around the sheet or sitting in the print room or the break room.delutiis also commented that he was going to switch to the second shift,andreoli shift.
andreoli spoke to her immediate supervisor,robert crawford,about what she had been through with delutiis.crawford replied,well,janice,that was a long time ago.you need to get over that.app.at.she then spoke to provision chief rosemarie badame.andreoli,visibly shaken up and crying,told badame that delutiis was trying to get on her shift,that he stalked her and sexually harassed her,and that the harassment was ongoing.app.at.badame replied that andreoli was not the first person to complain about delutiis behavior,but that if andreoli were to tell anyone about the harassment,delutiis would find out.then,there would be nothing badame could do to save andreoli because delutiis has a pattern of harassing people.app.at.in,andreoli applied for a position as an it specialist and was transferred to delutiis shift 
in february of,while andreoli was pursuing a fellowship at drexel university,she contacted her employer eeo office about filing a complaint,and did file a formal complaint in march.in the interim,she completed the drexel fellowship and returned to work at the dscp.the dscp was in a new location,and andreoli was assigned a workspace in an alcove in the building,where the copy machine had previously been housed and the water cooler was located.delutiis took advantage of andreoli new workspace location to stoop down and brush his leg against her while he was getting a drink.the water cooler was eventually moved,after andreoli made several requests.
delutiis bad behavior continued.it escalated in april,when he began to physically threaten andreoli while driving his government vehicle in the dscp parking area.on the first occasion,andreoli was sitting on a cement post outside one of the dscp buildings and delutiis drove a government van very close to andreoli and parked in a area next to where she was seated.twice later that month,delutiis was again driving a government van and swerved towards andreoli as though to run her over as she was crossing the parking lot.andreoli did not originally report these incidents to dscp management,out of concern that her supervisors had begun to view her as a constant complainer,until delutiis drove toward her on may.
andreoli went immediately to the office of her second line supervisor,dudley bolbat,but was unable to get a meeting with him that day.the next morning,andreoli informed him about the ongoing harassment by delutiis and delutiis threatening behavior,including the car incident.in response,bolbat asked andreoli if she minded if he discussed the matter with his wife and got back to her.app.at.a day or two later,bolbat told andreoli that delutiis had been instructed to beep his horn if andreoli was in his way in the future.not surprisingly,this instruction was ineffective in putting a stop to delutiis behavior.about a month later,delutiis again drove a government van through the parking lot towards andreoli,who was standing with her sister near the dscp building door.andreoli heard a screeching of tires coming towards her and her sister,and both women lost their footing.delutiis parked the van in the area next to where andreoli and her sister were seated and walked into the building.contrary to bolbat alleged instructions,delutiis did not beep his horn.
andreoli reported this incident to bolbat and to the detectives at the dscp.in response,a traffic hearing was held almost two months later,focusing on the general safety of delutiis driving,rather than his intent to threaten and harass andreoli.the hearing officer did not allow andreoli to discuss prior incidents of harassment,and ultimately ruled in delutiis favor.although a dscp detective was initially eager to pursue the matter further and investigate andreoli allegations,his attitude changed dramatically during the time that andreoli was away from work on vacation.when andreoli called him after she had returned from her vacation to discuss the investigation,he told her that he could not speak with her and cut short their phone conversation.app.at.the detective sudden lack of interest in investigating delutiis behavior greatly upset andreoli and she was unable to report to work on the following day,or for the rest of the week.she then sought psychiatric help in july of and took a medical leave of absence from the dscp.at this time,andreoli was diagnosed as suffering from depression and panic disorder.
in december of,andreoli wrote to her dscp supervisor to request that the dscp accommodate her disability by allowing her to work from until,so that she could work without being in contact with delutiis.in april,the dscp denied this request and asked andreoli to submit medical documentation to help the dscp identify possible accommodations for andreoli.andreoli counsel replied that andreoli would be able to work anywhere other than on the same physical site as delutiis.in june,dscp notified andreoli counsel that a suitable assignment for andreoli could not be identified.
it is undisputed that delutiis was never interviewed by the agency eeo office about the formal complaint andreoli filed in march,nor did delutiis at any time receive training about sexual harassment from the dscp.no supervisor or manager at the dscp ever spoke to,disciplined,or counseled delutiis about his behavior towards andreoli.app.at.the only guidance given to delutiis by the dscp was in the form of a memo instructing him to stay away from andreoli,which he received in august of,after andreoli had already taken leave from the.at.
andreoli filed a complaint against her employer in federal court in december,asserting claims under title vii for hostile work environment and retaliation and under the rehabilitation act for failure to provide reasonable accommodation.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.this appeal followed.
we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of andreoli employer,and we apply the same standard that the district court should have applied.abramson william paterson coll.of,cir summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.farrell planters lifesavers,cir.
hostile work environment 
the district court concluded that andreoli could not succeed because her employer established,as a matter of law,that it took prompt and adequate remedial action to terminate the harassment and prevent further incidents.the district court evaluated the promptness and adequacy of management remedial actions as follows 
defendants argue that after learning of each incident of delutiis objectionable behavior,management employees at the dscp took prompt and adequate remedial action to terminate the harassment and prevent further incidents.i agree.defendants acted almost immediately after learning of the alleged harassment in an attempt to remedy delutiis objectionable behavior and prevent any further harassment.
app at.the court also took into consideration the fact that andreoli affirmatively place d herself in a position of close contact with her alleged harasser by applying for a job that required her to work the same shift as delutiis.app.at.we have two problems with this analysis.
first,the district court placed the burden on andreoli employer to establish that it was not vicariously liable for delutiis conduct by proving that it took prompt and adequate remedial action and that andreoli failed to take advantage of the preventive opportunities offered to her.see burlington industries,ellerth,d holding that employer has affirmative defense to vicarious liability for supervisor conduct if employer acted promptly and reasonably to prevent and correct the alleged harassment and employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive opportunities offered to her.in this case,however,because delutiis was not andreoli supervisor,there is no presumption of employer liabilit
