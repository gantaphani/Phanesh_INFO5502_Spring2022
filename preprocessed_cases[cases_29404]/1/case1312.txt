this case is the latest chapter in a dispute between nora collins and pond creek mining company pond creek regarding her claim to survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act,the act.collins petitions for review of an april decision of the benefits review board brb affirming the denial of benefits by an administrative law judge alj.she challenges the alj ruling that she failed to prove that her husband pneumoconiosis hastened his death.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the brb decision and remand for an award of benefits.
johnnie collins worked in various jobs for more than years between and,including at pond creek for the last eleven.he was also a regular smoker during this time,though he later quit.when he stopped working for pond creek in,collins filed a claim for lifetime benefits under the act.
five years later,alj lawrence ruled in his favor.see collins pond creek coal,bla.under the act implementing regulations,a miner has pneumoconiosis if he meets one of two conditions.he must either have clinical pneumoconiosis a particular set of diseases recognized by the medical community or legal pneumoconiosis a broader category that includes any chronic lung disease arising out of coal mine employment.see a barber director,owcp,cir.the alj determined that although the did not show collins to have clinical pneumoconiosis,the miner did have a chronic respiratory condition known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd.moreover,the best evidence indicated that his work in the coal mines had contributed to this condition.as a result,he was afflicted with pneumoconiosis for purposes of the act.determining that the pneumoconiosis had totally disabled collins,the alj ruled him entitled to benefits.pond creek did not appeal,and the mining company provided collins the required payments until his death in.
shortly after collins died,collins applied for survivor benefits pursuant to a.pond creek opposed an award to the widow and asked for a hearing before an alj.alj morgan ruled in that the alj decision was not entitled to collateral estoppel on the issue of whether collins suffered from pneumoconiosis.upon reweighing the evidence,he concluded that collins did not suffer from pneumoconiosis.after several additional administrative rulings,collins petitioned this court for review.we vacated the alj denial of benefits.see collins pond creek mining,cir.we held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did indeed apply to the holding of the alj decision that collins suffered from pneumoconiosis due to coal dust exposure.furthermore,we rejected alj morgan alternate holding,affirmed by the brb,that even if collins had suffered from pneumoconiosis,collins had failed to establish that collins death was due to the disease.see collins,at.we remanded for further proceedings to determine if pneumoconiosis contributed to collins death.
in the nearly eight years since our decision,this matter has continued to bounce back and forth in the administrative process.there have been three different decisions by two different aljs and three decisions by the brb.most recently,alj lesniak determined in that collins was not entitled to survivor benefits.he found that the physicians opinions relied upon by collins were not sufficiently reasoned or documented to support a finding that collins pneumoconiosis caused his death.the alj also refused to consider as supportive of collins the opinions of two doctors for pond creek who found that collins death was in fact hastened by copd,although they believed the copd was caused by smoking,not pneumoconiosis.the brb affirmed this ruling in,echoing the analysis advanced by the alj.collins has petitioned this court for review.
the arguments of the parties center on the proper weight to be accorded the various medical opinions in the case.a brief review of these opinions is thus necessary.
maan younes,a board certified internist and pulmonologist,was collins treating physician for the last three years of his life.during that period,younes often stated in his treatment notes that collins suffered from copd and pneumoconiosis.in collins death certificate,completed less than a week after he died,younes stated that his patient had died of cardiac arrest due to or as a consequence of respiratory failure,and that coal workers pneumoconiosis had contributed to the death.at.
expanding on the earlier form less than two months later,younes explained in a letter to the department of labor that collins had severe coal workers pneumoconiosis and copd when he died,requiring hospitalization once or twice a month.he died at home,one day after he insisted on being released from the hospital after his condition had temporarily stabilized.younes added that collins had severe respiratory disability from his coal workers pneumoconiosis and there is no question that his severe pneumoconiosis is a major contributing factor to his death.at.younes then stated the evidence for pneumoconiosis collins decades of work in the coal mines,the content of his chest,and his severe pulmonary disease.hospital records from just nine days before collins death noted the severity of his lung condition,described his history of coal workers pneumoconiosis,and recommended that doctors not administer aggressive cardiac treatment because of the severity of his pulmonary problems.
following collins death,the department of labor asked dominic gaziano,a board certified internist and pulmonologist,to review the miner file in early and answer a questionnaire regarding the circumstances of his death.he filled out the form provided to him,indicating that although the miner did not die from pneumoconiosis,he was disabled by it and that the disease played a role in collins death.gaziano further stated in the comments section of the form that collins died as a result of failure in a background of severe heart and lung diseases.i believe coal workers pneumoconiosis was a significant contributing factor in his death.at.
for its part,pond creek asked seven medical experts to examine collins medical records.each of the seven doctors found that collins did not have pneumoconiosis.six of the seven reported that collins had severe pulmonary disease due to smoking,with at least five of those doctors explicitly classifying the pulmonary disease as copd.four of the doctors gregory fino,george zaldivar,dahhan,and samuel spagnolo stated that the death was due purely to cardiac causes.
representative of the opinions is that of fino,a board certified internist and pulmonologist.fino reported that collins did not show signs of pneumoconiosis,and that his copd was caused by cigarette smoking,not his work in the mines.fino further argued that collins death was due to heart disease,and that even if he had been afflicted with pneumoconiosis,the lung disease would not have exacerbated the particular cardiac condition that caused the death.fino thus found not only that collins copd was unrelated to coal dust exposure,but also that the copd did not hasten his death.
of particular note were the opinions of thomas jarboe and morgan,both of whom pond creek enlisted to evaluate collins file.jarboe stated that collins was totally disabled by copd,though the copd was caused by smoking and not exposure to coal mine dust.he then concluded that collins died from a combination of his copd and his cardiac disease.morgan also stated that collins copd was due to smoking.he believed that the miner death was due to a heart arrhythmia,and that the arrhythmia was exacerbated by an oxygen deficiency known as hypoxemia,which was caused by copd.both doctors thus agreed that collins copd contributed to his death.
under the act,we evaluate whether an alj decision that has been affirmed by the brb was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law.see collins pond creek mining,cir.substantial evidence consists of sufficient relevant evidence to convince a reasonable mind that the evidence is adequate to support a conclusion.scott mason coal,cir.we review the alj and brb conclusions of law de novo.id.
in order for collins to prevail under the act,she must show that she was the surviving spouse of a mine
