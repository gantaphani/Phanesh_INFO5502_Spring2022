it is axiomatic that a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal must dismiss the case.petitioner reynaldo sorcia sorcia asks this court to review the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia to deny his petition for cancellation of removal and his motion to reopen removal proceedings so that he could pursue cancellation of removal after an adjustment of status for which he had an application pending.however,because sorcia raises no constitutional claims or questions of law,we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal.a b.further,because the bia based its denial of sorcia motion to reopen on a determination that sorcia did not merit the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal,we also lack jurisdiction to review the denial of the motion.see obioha gonzales,cir.accordingly,the appeal is dismissed.
sorcia is a citizen of mexico.he became a temporary resident of the united states on november,and a lawful permanent resident on december.on february,he was placed in removal proceedings following the filing of a notice to appear with the immigration court he was charged with removability pursuant to a e i,which states that a ny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence is deportable.
sorcia appeared before an immigration judge ij in atlanta,georgia,and admitted that he had been convicted of three offenses misdemeanor domestic violence on february,misdemeanor assault and battery on april,and misdemeanor domestic violence on november.in light of the domestic violence convictions,sorcia conceded his removability,and the ij found by clear and convincing evidence that sorcia was removable.
thereafter,sorcia petitioned the ij for cancellation of removal.because sorcia had not been convicted of an aggravated felony and had resided in the united states for more than years after becoming a lawful permanent resident,he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal.under a,
t he attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
nonetheless,even where statutory eligibility is established,an ij retains discretion to grant or deny an application for cancellation of removal,and the applicant must establish that he warrants the relief sought.in re c v t,bia.
t here is no inflexible standard for determining who should be granted discretionary relief,and each case must be judged on its own merits.id.at citing in re l,bia.in applying his discretion,the ij must balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section c relief appears in the best interest of this country.in re marin,bia,abrogated on other grounds by in re edwards,bia see also in re c v t,at finding the marin balancing test appropriate when considering requests for cancellation of removal under a 
the ij noted that sorcia residency in the united states constituted a significant positive equity weighing in favor of cancellation of removal.the ij also found that sorcia family ties to citizens of the united states lawful permanent residents constituted a positive factor.moreover,the ij found that sorcia history of steady employment weighed in his favor.
however,sorcia criminal history weighed against him.the court observed that sorcia past criminal actions all involved violence and had twice involved the use of firearms.further,sorcia had attempted to minimize his responsibility for his offenses.also,given that sorcia convictions occurred over a period of years,the ij opined that they demonstrated a propensity to resort to violence.the court additionally noted that sorcia had failed to pursue treatment for anger management to address this propensity.
the ij also considered collaterally the fact that sorcia had been charged with committing a lewd act on a minor,despite the fact that this charge had not been prosecuted.the ij further considered as an additional significant negative factor that sorcia engaged in tax fraud.the court concluded that 
a n individual who was given the grace of this nation by making him a lawful permanent resident and has responded by repeatedly engaging in violent activities that endanger both his family and other individuals in this nation and has filed demonstrably fraudulent tax returns is not deserving of a favorable exercise of the court discretion 
the ij accordingly denied sorcia request for cancellation of removal by order of february.sorcia appealed to the bia.
the bia issued a decision dismissing sorcia appeal.like the ij,the bia opined that sorcia length of residence in the united states,family ties in this country,and steady employment history all weighed in his favor.after considering the equitable factors weighing in sorcia favor,the bia opined that sorcia criminal history and lack of rehabilitation outweigh the favorable factors in this case.the bia concluded that sorcia criminal history indicated an increased likelihood that he would have future encounters with the criminal justice system and an adverse impact on the safety of his family and community.notably,the bia expressly disavowed reliance on either the charge of committing a lewd act on a minor or sorcia questionable tax history.reasoning that it would not be in the best interests of the united states to grant sorcia cancellation of removal,the bia dismissed his appeal on july.in the same decision,the bia denied sorcia motion to reopen his removal proceedings.
on april,sorcia petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.the government filed a motion to dismiss,or in the alternative,transfer the petition.the government sought dismissal on the grounds that venue was improper in this circuit under b.alternatively,the government requested this court to transfer the case to the eleventh circuit pursuant to.before turning to the merits of sorcia case,we address the government motion.
the government motion to dismiss relied on b,which states that a petition for review of an order of removal shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.for reasons unique to the procedural history of this case,the parties dispute where the ij completed the proceedings.sorcia maintains that the proceedings were completed in charlotte,north carolina.the government argues that the proceedings were completed in atlanta,georgia.
even assuming that sorcia chose incorrectly when he appealed the bia decision to this court,that error would not deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction.while we have not previously addressed the issue,courts in other circuits have unanimously held that b is a nonjurisdictional venue provision.see avila,cir moreno bravo gonzales,cir georcely ashcroft,cir nwaokolo,cir per curiam jama gonzales,cir per curiam refusing to raise the nonjurisdictional venue issue sua sponte bonhometre gonzales,cir this conclusion is not surprising,insofar as b is titled venue and forms.also,the statute says nothing about jurisdiction.see moreno bravo,at in view of the extraordinary attention congress directed toward federal jurisdiction over petitions for review in,it is hard for us to believe that the legislature would then neglect to express a similarly clear intent or any intent at all to circumscribe jurisdiction.without hesitation,we join the six circuits concluding that b is a nonjurisdictional venue provision.accordingly,we decline the government motion to dismiss this appeal based solely on sorcia failure to comply with b 
in the alternative,the government requests that this case be transferred to the eleventh circuit.the government cites a statute providing 
whenever an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed,and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.
emphasis added.however,as explained above,the failure to comply with b does not affect our jurisdiction over sorcia petition,so arguably is inapplicable to cure failures to comply with that venue provision.see moreno bravo,at the case sub judice,of course,does not involve because we do in fact have jurisdiction to consider the merits,being concerned only with venue and convenience.some courts have reached the opposite conclusion,however,essentially reasoning that jurisdiction as used in was not meant to have a strictly technical meaning,and could also address transfer for lack of venue.rodriguez roman ins,cir f or purposes of the transfer statute,a court lacks jurisdiction if venue does not lie.
we hold that,which speaks exclusively of jurisdiction,does not mandate transfer where venue is lacking.however,this does not mean that we lack authority to transfer cases when we have jurisdiction but lack venue.although the authority to transfer a case under exists only when the transferring court lacks jurisdiction,courts have inherent power to transfer cases over which they have jurisdiction but not venue.see dornbusch,cir per curiam alexander.in dornbusch,the fifth circuit analyzed cases decided prior to the enactment of and noted that no court which expressly addressed the matter held that it had no authority to transfer a case,over which it had jurisdiction but lacked venue,to another court of appeals having both jurisdiction and venue.at collecting cases.likewise,we follow this reasoning and hold that where we have jurisdiction but lack venue,we have inherent authority to transfer a case to another circuit where both venue and jurisdiction exist.however,we further conclude that in the exercise of such inherent authority it is appropriate,as in the related context,to consider whether the interest of justice mandates transfer.see moreno bravo gonzales,at.here,we conclude that it would not be in the interest of justice to transfer this case to the eleventh circuit for several reasons.
first,sorcia confusion regarding where the proceedings were completed is understandable.after the proceedings began in atlanta,sorcia moved to change venue to charlotte.the ij denied the motion but later stated 
as you know,we opening a court in charlotte on november the.given that we already gotten into this,i going to keep this on my docket.i will leave it up to you whether you wish to appear in court or whether you want to appear in charlotte via televideo.
notice was sent to sorcia counsel indicating that a hearing would take place on february,in atlanta.on december,a letter was sent to sorcia counsel indicating that the location of the hearing has been changed to charlotte.sorcia counsel contacted the ij in atlanta,mentioning the change of location letter and stating that he preferred to be present in atlanta with my client and his family instead of charlotte.sorcia counsel thus filed a second motion for change of venue with the charlotte court.on january,the atlanta immigration court received this second change of venue motion and rejected it.on february,the ij in atlanta issued an order stating counsel and respondent may appear in atlanta.dhs may appear either in person or via televideo from charlotte.
the february,hearing the final hearing on the merits was conducted in atlanta,with the government participating via videoconference from charlotte.indeed,the ij stated the court is sitting in atlanta.yet,the transcript heading for that hearing indicated the place as charlotte,north carolina.even the heading of the order of the immigration judge indicated the location of the immigration court in charlotte though that conflicted with the statement in the order explaining if the proceedings should be appealed the oral decision will become the official opinion in this case.the oral decision was undisputedly issued from atlanta.after viewing these facts as a composite,we conclude that atlanta is the location where the proceedings were completed.see ramos ashcroft,cir holding that even when teleconferencing takes place,immigration proceedings are completed where the court is located and the order is issued.nevertheless,under these convoluted circumstances,it is understandable that sorcia was confused as to the place of completion.
further,because the matter has been thoroughly briefed and orally argued before this court,we are reluctant to force the parties to relitigate in the eleventh circuit.bonhometre,at g iven that this case has been thoroughly briefed and argued before us,and given that bonhometre has waited a long time for the resolution of his claims,we believe it would be a manifest injustice to now transfer his case to another court for duplicative proceedings.accord moreno bravo,at.moreover,whether or not the suit has any possible merit bears significantly on whether the court should transfer,and if it does not,the court should not waste the time of another court by transferring the matter.id.at quoting phillips seiter,cir.the weakness of sorcia argument on the merits,discussed below,further counsels against transferring his petition to the eleventh circuit.
finally,we are unpersuaded by the government assertion that litigating this case in the eleventh circuit would be more convenient.the government primary argument is that the bia cited an eleventh circuit case for a proposition in its decision.specifically,the bia cited naijar ashcroft,cir,to support the statement that a motion to remand must include a demonstration of prima facie eligibility for the relief sought.the government overlooks the fact that a federal regulation,c,and a decision by the supreme court of the united states,ins abudu,were cited by the bia in support of the same proposition.further,that same proposition is supported by fourth circuit case law.see hussain gonzales,cir.we therefore find the government argument regarding convenience unavailing.
in sum,we deny the government motion to dismiss or transfer this matter on the basis of improper venue we turn now to the merits of sorcia appeal.
sorcia first argues that the ij did not properly weigh sorcia favorable and adverse equities before denying the requested cancellation of removal.brief of petitioner at.the government argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review this discretionary decision.we agree.
the government correctly points to a statute stating that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,and except as provided in subparagraph d,and regardless of whether the judgment,decision,or action is made in removal proceedings,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section of this title.
a b.subparagraph d clarifies that n othing in subparagraph b shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d.since cancellation of removal is placed in the ij discretion under,this court has jurisdiction over sorcia appeal only if it concerns constitutional claims or questions of law.see also jean gonzales,cir holding that the court has no jurisdiction over any aspects of denial of relief under except constitutional claims or questions of law.
sorcia does not argue that his appeal presents constitutional claims.nor,despite his contention to the contrary,does he raise a question of law.instead,throughout his brief,sorcia contends that the bia should have given more weight to the positive factors and less weight to the negative factors affect
