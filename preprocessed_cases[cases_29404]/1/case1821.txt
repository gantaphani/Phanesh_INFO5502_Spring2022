zeinab petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals decision denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.asserts that her failed marriage to a lebanese imam,whom she met and married shortly after entering the united states,and her subsequent marriage to a christian,place her at risk of violence if she returns to lebanon.the immigration judge denied asylum claim because she did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the united states.her claim does not fall under one of the exceptions that would give this court jurisdiction to review a denial based on untimeliness.does not qualify for relief on either of her other two claims because the ij determination that did not testify credibly is entitled to deference under the standards set forth in the real id act of.
zeinab,a native and citizen of lebanon,entered the united states on september,with a tourist visa.her stated reason for coming to the united states was to care for her ailing mother,who has resided legally in this country since.received two extensions,which allowed her to stay until march.she did not leave the country when her extended visa expired.instead,she remained in the united states with no official status.ins served with a notice to appear on december.after several initial hearings,appeared before an ij on november,and filed an application for withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture.at that hearing,her attorney conceded that was not eligible for asylum because she did not file her application within one year of entering the united states.
explained in her application that,after entering the united states,she married an imam named haydar jawad.this marriage,which took place under islamic law and has since been terminated under the same law,never became official under law because jawad was already married to another woman.listed various ways that her had abused her,including giving her drugs to cause her to miscarry,threatening to have her killed if she returned to lebanon,threatening to have her deported,taking away her passport,and beating her.she stated in her application that she feared returning to lebanon because jawad,who was a member of hezbollah and a man of standing in the lebanese community,could easily have her killed there.
the merits hearing was scheduled for march,more than fifteen months later.in the meantime,on february,filed an addendum to her application,stating that changed circumstances both in lebanon and in her personal situation made her eligible for asylum.with regard to her personal situation,she reported that since the time of her divorce from jawad,she had married a christian man and given birth to two children.according to,her marriage was a violation of islamic law and placed her life in danger should she return to lebanon.testimony at the hearing ultimately led the ij to conclude that account lacked credibility and that fear of persecution was based on her deteriorated relationship with her rather than on a protected ground.at the hearing,testified about several instances of abuse.she recounted a time when her husband came to the arabic school where she taught and dragged her out of the classroom by her hair.also submitted a letter from a coworker who recounted learning about the incident from students,looking for,and not finding her.testified in contrast that the did find her after the beating and brought her back into a classroom to comfort her.acknowledged that her account differed from her own,and said that fear prevented her from testifying at the hearing.
also testified that at the time of this beating she was six weeks pregnant.later on the day of the beating,her husband gave her some medicine for abdominal pain resulting from the beating.the medicine caused her to start bleeding.after the bleeding continued for nine days,husband took her to a clinic.testified that the nurse told her that,because of all the bleeding,the child could not be brought to term.instead,received an abortion.in apparent contradiction to testimony,her medical records reflect a normal pregnancy and an elective abortion.
also testified about a civil lawsuit she pursued and won against jawad.the first time she mentioned the lawsuit was in the context of the account,and the implication was that the suit somehow arose from that incident.later gave more details about the lawsuit,saying that she was awarded that jawad had stolen from her.the pleadings that filed in the civil lawsuit indicate that jawad induced her to marry him by promising to sponsor her for citizenship and to provide a home for her.after the marriage,he asked her to give him to rent a house,and she gave him the money.jawad did not keep either promise.instead he abused and threatened.the pleadings do not mention the incident.won a judgment against jawad.based on the documents from her civil case and initial reticence to discuss the fact that the lawsuit was about money,the ij concluded that marriage to jawad had primarily been for the purpose of obtaining citizenship.
after divorcing jawad,met and married wisam halia,a native iraqi and naturalized citizen.halia is a christian however,he and married under islamic law.like previous marriage,this marriage is also unofficial because wisam divorce from another woman has been pending for three years.while explained that the initial delay in finalizing the divorce occurred because halia left the country to serve as a contractor with the military,she was unable to explain why the divorce had not been finalized in the year and a half since halia return.testified that she has since given birth to twins,the children of halia.she did not present official birth certificates for these children,although she did present documents issued by the hospital.
testified that she fears reprisal in her own country because of jawad connections to hezbollah and because she married and bore children to a christian man.she testified that jawad had told others of his intent to harm her if she returned to lebanon,but that she believed she would be safe in the because of the rule of law.she also testified that she fears hezbollah will issue a fatwa against her because she has breached islamic tradition by marrying a christian man.when specifically asked on,she testified that her siblings in lebanon had warned her that people were looking for her in lebanon.
at the conclusion of the testimony,the ij dismissed the translator,after asking whether there was any objection,and hearing none.the ij then heard closing arguments and discussed procedural matters with attorney.near the conclusion of closing argument,the ij asked the attorney to provide official versions of various documents.six weeks later,having received no additional documents,the ij issued his decision.the opinion was issued on april.
the ij denied all relief.several grounds supported the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.first,the ij barred asylum application as untimely.the ij found that no extraordinary circumstances excused the late filing.he also found that general unrest in lebanon and remarriage did not constitute changed circumstances,because neither circumstance materially affected her eligibility for asylum.further,the ij found that account was not credible.in addition to noting the inconsistencies stated above,the ij also noted that testified that she had not seen jawad since her divorce,while her current husband testified that she had seen jawad at his deposition for her civil suit.the ij also noted that did not say anything about a warning from her siblings either in her asylum application or on direct examination,but claimed for the first time on that her siblings told her that people were looking for her in lebanon.furthermore,failed to submit reasonably available corroborating evidence,such as birth certificates for her children.
six days after the opinion was issued,filed additional evidence and a motion to reopen.the ij issued an order denying the motion.the ij noted that,although the court had agreed to consider additional evidence,it had not given the petitioner any date certain be
