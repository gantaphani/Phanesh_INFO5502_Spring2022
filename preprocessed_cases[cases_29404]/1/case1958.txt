this case involves a forfeiture of the defendant weapon pursuant to a because the weapon was found to be a machinegun within the terms of the national firearms act nfa,b,and was not registered to the,william alverson alverson,in violation of d.alverson claims that the government failed to satisfy the burden required to justify the forfeiture because it did not show that the defendant firearm was designed to shoot automatically or could be readily restored to shoot automatically under the nfa definition of a machinegun.b.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment granting the united states motion for summary judgment.
background 
in the fall of,the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf field office in lexington,kentucky was informed that mk specialties mks was selling firearms made from receivers marketed as the mks.the lexington atf office determined that alverson had purchased one of these weapons.in early january,atf special agents verified that alverson was in possession of such a weapon,and on january,atf special agents seized it from him.subsequent to its seizure,atf firearms enforcement officer richard vasquez examined the weapon and issued a report,concluding that the defendant weapon was a machinegun within the meaning of the nfa.atf also conducted a search of the national firearms registration and transfer record and found that the defendant weapon was not registered to alverson or any other person.
following the seizure,alverson filed a claim of ownership of the defendant weapon,contesting the forfeiture on the ground that it was not a machinegun under the nfa.on october,the united states filed a complaint for forfeiture in rem,claiming that the defendant weapon was a machinegun under b and was not registered to alverson,in violation of d.the united states moved for summary judgment,and alverson filed a motion to stay.the district court dismissed alverson motion to stay and granted the government motion for summary judgment.alverson then timely filed an appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment.

standard of review

burden of proof 
in,congress enacted the civil asset forfeiture reform act cafra,which,among other reforms,placed on the government the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture in most civil forfeiture proceedings.id.c.cafra states that a suit or action brought under any civil forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of any property shall be governed by cafra burden of proof requirements.c.however,cafra later limits the application of this provision by stating that civil forfeiture statute does not include b the internal revenue code of.id.i see also deep sea fisheries,pounds of blue king crab,cir explaining that cafra applies to all civil forfeitures under federal law unless the particular forfeiture statute is specifically exempted in i.the nfa provision under which this forfeiture was initiated,a,is contained in title,which is the internal revenue code of therefore,cafra does not govern the burden of proof here.see united states v.one harrington richardson rifle,model,caliber serial,cir order applying the standard to a forfeiture pursuant to the nfa.
we now turn to the law governing the burden of proof necessary to sustain this forfeiture pursuant to the nfa.the treasury fund forfeiture act of provided that 
e xcept as provided in paragraph and section b of the internal revenue code of,the provisions of law relating to a the seizure,summary and judicial forfeiture,and condemnation of property for violation of customs laws,b the remission or mitigation of such forfeiture,and c the compromise of claims,shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred,or alleged to have been incurred,under any applicable law enforced or administered by the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms.

statutory interpretation 
the nfa defines a machinegun as any weapon which shoots,is designed to shoot,or can be readily restored to shoot,automatically more than one shot,without manual reloading,by a single function of the trigger.b.the statute does not define designed to shoot or can be readily restored,and neither the supreme court nor the sixth circuit has defined these terms.
the atf rulings 
the government argues that we should rely on several atf rulings the rulings that define designed to shoot and can be readily restored and that classify various modified weapons as machineguns because they were designed to shoot automatically.typically,where a statute is ambiguous and the implementing agency has interpreted the statute,a court will determine what,if any,level of deference the interpretation should be afforded and then defer accordingly.the supreme court has distinguished between the more deferential standard of chevron,under which agency interpretations will control as long as they are based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron natural res.def.council,d,and the less deferential standard of skidmore,under which the weight of an agency interpretation depend s upon all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control,skidmore swift.see united states mead,d.chevron deference will be afforded to agency interpretations,like the atf rulings,that were not made pursuant to rulemaking or formal adjudication,only where the reviewing court determines that congress intended such agency action to have the force of law.mead,at.see also christensen harris county,d.
the amount of deference that the rulings merit is unsettled and we need not decide this question in this case.the atf rulings,even if entitled to full chevron deference,would provide little guidance,as their explanation of can be readily restored to shoot hardly helps to clarify the statutory definition of this provision moreover,the rulings have little bearing on whether the defendant weapon can be readily restored to shoot automatically because the weapons at issue in the rulings were classified as machineguns based on the atf determination that they were designed to shoot automatically 
available evidence 
in support of its motion,the government submitted a firearms technology branch report of technical examination ftb report written by atf officer richard vasquez after his investigation of the defendant weapon that detailed its characteristics and the methods used to restore it to automatic shooting capacity the claimant objects to the admissibility of the ftb report,as it was unsworn and not accompanied by an affidavit.see dole elliott travel tours,cir citing adickes kress,d holding that unsworn statements may not be considered on a motion for summary judgment.we need not resolve this dispute,however,as claimant expert witness,robert kraft,testified at his deposition that the defendant weapon could be converted to fire automatically in four to six hours to manufacturer specifications and in two to three hours with parts.because we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,see adickes,at,given the conflict between the ftb report and the claimant testimony,we are obliged to credit the claimant expert in any event,regardless of the admissibility of the ftb report.as we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment,johnson karnes,cir,we will assume that it would require six hours to restore the defendant weapon to automatic shooting capacity.
can be readily restored to shoot automatically 
we have not interpreted the phrase readily restored in a published opinion or in the context of a weapon like the defendant webster third new international dictionary defines readily to mean with fairly quick efficiency,without needless loss of time,reasonably fast,speedily,with a fair degree of ease,without much difficulty,with facility,and easily.webster third new international dictionary.this definition identifies several components of readily,most notably,speed,ease,and efficiency.the inclusion of limiting modifiers,with fairly quick efficiency,without much difficulty,and reasonably fast,id.emphasis added,makes clear that readily is a relative term,one that describes a process that is fairly or reasonably efficient,quick,and easy,but not necessarily the most efficient,speedy,or easy process.
in the context of the nfa and its use as a modifier describing the manner of firearm restoration,readily has been read to encompass several elements of restoration time,how long it takes to restore the weapon ease,how difficult it is to restore the weapon expertise,what knowledge and skills are required to restore the weapon necessary equipment,what tools are required to restore the weapon availability,where additional parts are required,how easily they can be obtained expense,how much it costs to restore the weapon scope,the extent to which the weapon has to be changed to allow it to shoot automatically feasability,whether the restoration would damage or destroy the weapon or cause it to malfunction.see daniel,united states,cir ease and scope united states alverson,cir expertise ease,and scope united states smith,cir time and equipment united states,d,time,ease,expertise,and equipment united states seven misc.firearms,time,ease,expertise,equipment,availability,expense,and feasibility united states cook,wl,at cir.july,availability.
the statutory canon of construction noscitur a sociis,or it is known by its associates,instructs that the meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.black law dictionary ed see also parker metro.life ins,cir.r eadily restored,therefore,must not be construed as an abstract phrase,but rather its contours should be determined in the context of what it means to be able to readily restore a machinegun as opposed to some other object.the sort of object being restored,primarily its complexity,helps to determine whether a given amount of time,money,expertise,and skill required to restore it is considered a ready restoration.for example,a car that could be restored in ten hours for would likely be considered readily restored,whereas a skateboard that required the same inputs likely would not be considered readily restored.although the dissent asserts,based on common sense,that a process of restoration that takes in excess of four to six hours could not be ready,dissenting opinion.at,this contention lacks meaning because it is too abstract and fails to consider what readily restored means in the context of a highly complex firearm.
the decisions of several other courts make clear that the defendant weapon,which would require,according to alverson own expert,a maximum of six hours to convert to fire automatically,can be readily restored under the nfa.the eighth circuit held that a semiautomatic rifle that would take an working day in a properly equipped machine shop to convert to shoot automatically qualified as a machinegun under the nfa smith,at united states shilling,cir holding that disassembled guns that could be made to shoot automatically were readily restor able daniel,at upholding the use of a jury instruction defining a machinegun as those weapons which have not previously functioned as machine guns but possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by simple modification or elimination of existing component parts alverson,at concluding that an automatic weapon that was converted to fire semiautomatically prior to its sale to defendant could be readily restored where it could be modified to shoot automatically by filing down one of its parts united states lauchli,cir in a case prior to the addition of the can be readily restored language to the nfa,deciding that weapons requiring assembly to shoot automatically were machineguns under the nfa.
the defendant weapon in the case at bar can be converted to fire automatically in even less time than the weapon that could be readily restored in smith.alverson expert testified that the defendant rifle could be restored to capacity to manufacturer specifications in four to six hours with particular machinery or in two to three hours by hand manufacturing the parts 
the two relevant cases finding that the weapons there considered were not readily restorable can be distinguished from the defendant weapon.in seven miscellaneous firearms,the district court found that weapons forfeited from a museum collection were not readily restorable where conversion would require expert gunsmith services,tools costing up to,essential parts that could not be found in this country,and between four and perhaps in excess of thirty hours,and could damage or destroy the weapons and cause them to injure the shooter upon firing.at.by contrast,the defendant weapon here had all of the necessary parts for restoration and would take no more than six hours to restore.in vollmer company higgins,the district of columbia circuit rejected the atf rule and held that where a manufacturer had altered an automatic weapon by removing certain features that caused the weapon to be classified as a machinegun,the ability to convert the weapon back to automatic firing capacity did not make the weapon capable of being readily restored.however,that court decision was based on the unreasonableness of prohibiting the company from adding a legal part to a semiautomatic receiver simply because the receiver had once been automatic and because there were no findings to support the contention that the reconfigured semiautomatic receiver was potentially restorable to a machinegun receiver.vollmer magaw,
alverson additionally argues that the defendant weapon can not be readily restored because restore means to bring back to an original condition,and the defendant weapon was not brought back to an original condition as it was made from.this argument lacks force because the definition of restore does not preclude an object from being considered restored without returning it to a condition in which it previously existed.webster third new international dictionary provides several definitions of restore,one of which to bring back to or put back into a former or original state matches the definition alverson cites,and others to put or bring back as into existence or use and to bring back from a changed condition that are broader and make clear that to be restored does not require return to a preexisting state.webster third new international dictionary.several courts have so interpreted readily restored to encompass weapons that were originally legal rifles and only later converted to shoot automatically.shilling,at accord alverson,at see also daniel,at approving jury instruction explaining readily restored to include weapons which have not previously functioned as machine guns but possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by simple modification or elimination of existing component parts emphasis added 
in any event,the parts from which the defendant weapon was manufactured had once been part of an weapon that fired automatically.therefore,modifying the defendant weapon to fire automatically would constitute restoration even under the narrower definition alverson offers.
finally,we reiterate that the government must only show probable cause to justify the forfeiture,and the claimant then bears the burden of proving his case by a preponderance of the evidence.see any all radio station transmission,at.therefore,despite the minimal record available to us on review,the testimony by alverson own witness that the defendant weapon could be converted into an automatic weapon in a matter of hours,which the united states submitted in support of its motion,suffices to meet the government burden.alverson proffered evidence,which consists solely of this same expert testimony and a letter from mks describing some of the features of the receiver,fails to create a genuine issue of material fact,even without consideration of the ftb report or the atf rulings.based on the evidence presented and the legal definition of readily restored,no reasonable juror could conclude that the defendant weapon was not a machinegun under b.
designed to shoot automatically 
as our conclusion that the defendant firearm can be readily restored to shoot automatically is sufficient to classify it as a machinegun and to justify the forfeiture in this case,we decline to consider whether the firearm is also designed to shoot automatically.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment granting the government motion for summary judgment.

this unrebutted evidence establishes that the could be converted by an expert gunsmith with readily available equipment to shoot automatically in four to six hours.the issue therefore becomes whether the,which could be converted by an expert gunsmith with readily available equipment to shoot automatically in four to six hours,is a weapon that,as a matter of law,can be readily restored to shoot,automatically.b in light of that testimony,alongside the reasons that follow,i conclude that the rifle can not be readily restored to shoot automatically 
the inquiry begins with the fundamental purpose of judicial construction of statutes,which is to ascertain and give effect to the original meaning of the words used by congress

although the majority recites a variety of similar definitions for the term readily,it thereafter relies on the modifiers contained in those definitions to conclude that the term encompass es several elements of restoration.this approach clouds the issue and opens the door to future extensions of the word readily in contravention of the objective understanding of the word.in my view,it defies common sense to conclude that a process that takes in excess of four to six hours is a process that is fairly or reasonably efficient,quick,and easy id.
moreover,the majority analysis of whether the could be restored to shoot automatically fails to adequately explain how the defendant weapon,which is a new and entirely separate weapon from the,could be restored in any fashion.restoration acts to return something to its earlier good condition or position.cambridge advanced learner dictionary,http enter term restoration.although no earlier version of the exists,the majority relies on broader definitions for the term restored in an effort to explain that an item need not return to a preexisting state to render it restored.like its efforts to define readily,the majority approach to the term restore further clouds the issue and again assigns to the term a definition without boundaries.for example,pursuant to the majority limitless definition of restore,even a single shot weapon is now conceivably subject to forfeiture.indeed,the skilled technician who is somehow capable of converting a single shot weapon to fire automatically has restored the weapon to shoot automatically because,according to the majority,restoration does not require return to a preexisting state.id.
considering the dictionary definitions for the words readily and restored,i reject the conclusion reached in united states smith,cir,that a firearm is readily restorable to shoot automatically when it takes eight hours to rebuild and reconstruct the rifle by an expert gunsmith in a machine shop.similarly,i reject the majority reliance on smith to reach its conclusion that a somewhat lesser time frame satisfies the readily restorable language in b.
the conclusion reached in united states smith that a rifle can be readily restored is contrary to the weight of recent authority.for example,the district court in united states,d,defined readily restorable as a less than arduous assembly of manageable and available parts by a combination of the ability of a reasonably skilled and informed but not necessarily expert or artistic worker and tools commonly understood by and commonly available to such workers but excluding,for example,the resources available to a master machinist id.at.accord united states seven misc.firearms,finding weapon was not readily restorable because to accomplish such a procedure would require more than four hours in a shop with appropriate tools,expert gunsmith services,and the sum of roughly.
other courts have likewise adopted similar tests for defining what constitutes readily restorable.see,united states woodlan,cir finding weapon readily restorable because it was capable of being modified in two minutes to fire automatically united states woods,cir finding weapon was readily restorable because merely connecting two pieces with a minimum of effort rendered it operable united states catanzaro,finding weapon readily restorable because it required only wo
