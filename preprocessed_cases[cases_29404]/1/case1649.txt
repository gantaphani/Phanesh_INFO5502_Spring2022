before us is a petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed the determination of an immigration judge that the petitioner was not eligible to apply for cancellation of removal on the basis of the rule.because the bia correctly decided that the rule may be applied retroactively to the petitioner convictions and because we lack jurisdiction over the petitioner remaining claims,we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner dervin venion heaven heaven was born in jamaica in and admitted to the united states as an immigrant on march,but has never become a united states citizen.on february,heaven pleaded guilty,pursuant to a plea agreement,to the criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree in violation of new york penal law.following his conviction,the immigration and naturalization service ins took heaven into custody and initiated proceedings to remove him from the united states.the ins filed a notice to appear in immigration court and served it on heaven on december.in the notice,the ins charged that heaven was subject to removal under a b i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b i,which authorizes the deportation of any alien who has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance 
over the next several years,the immigration judge twice found heaven subject to removal and ineligible for cancellation of removal,only to have the case reversed and remanded by the bia for reasons not relevant to the instant petition.on march,heaven submitted an application for cancellation of removal pursuant to ina,which permits the attorney general to cancel the removal of a deportable alien in certain circumstances.the dhs formerly ins then asserted that between august,and september,heaven had been convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses in new york on five for criminal possession of marijuana and once for criminal sale of marijuana.heaven denied these allegations,and the dhs withdrew its claim regarding one of the convictions.
on september,the immigration judge found that the dhs proved that heaven was convicted of possession of marijuana on november,august,and september,and the criminal sale of marijuana on march.the immigration judge then determined that heaven was ineligible for cancellation of removal because,under the rule,heaven and convictions prevented him from having the seven years of continuous residence in the united states necessary for cancellation of removal.see a requiring seven years of continuous residence in the united states to be eligible for cancellation of removal id.d stating that period of continuous residence ends when the alien commits certain deportable offenses.
heaven appealed to the bia,contending that application of the rule was impermissibly retroactive,as the rule was not enacted until,after heaven had received his convictions.on january,the bia dismissed heaven appeal,holding that the rule should be applied retroactively to heaven convictions.heaven then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on april,seeking review of the bia order.on october,the district court transferred the habeas petition to this court pursuant to the real id act of real id act,stat,c see also a making a petition for review in the court of appeals the sole and exclusive means for review of an order of removal.the parties have briefed the issues,and we now turn to the merits of our decision.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
section c of the real id act authorizes us to treat heaven petition for habeas corpus as a petition for review,and this court has jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law raised in a petition for review.see a d.we give deference to the bia interpretation of the ina under the principles of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see also james gonzales,cir we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the ina itself and definitions and phrases within it internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,we review de novo claims of constitutional error,such as due process violations,in immigration proceedings.ali gonzales,cir per curiam anwar ins,cir.
iii.discussion 
heaven raises three issues on appeal whether the rule should have been applied retroactively to his and convictions whether he should be permitted to simultaneously apply for c relief and whether res judicata and collateral estoppel bar consideration of his and convictions.the government contends that congress intended the rule to be applied retroactively and that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over heaven other claims because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.we first consider the application of the rule to heaven case.
retroactive application of the rule 
on appeal,heaven does not contend that he is not subject to removal on the basis of his february,conviction.instead,heaven argues that the immigration judge and the bia erred in determining that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal on the basis of the rule.
the cancellation of removal procedure was created in when congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.as the procedure currently stands,
the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
ina a,a.the iirira further added a limitation on the continuous residence requirement in the second prong of the cancellation of removal criteria as follows 
for purposes of this section,any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end b when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section a of this title that renders the alien inadmissible to the united states under section a of this title or removable from the united states under section a or a of this title,whichever is earliest.
ina a,d.this is known as the rule.
in this case,the bia found that the rule applied to heaven and convictions.because heaven entered the united states in and committed drug offenses in and that rendered him deportable under a,his period of continuous residence in the united states ended after only five years pursuant to the rule.therefore,the bia reasoned that heaven was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he did not have seven years of continuous residence.
heaven,however,argues that his convictions for the drug offenses in and did not render him ineligible for cancellation of removal at that time because the rule was not enacted until therefore,he contends that the bia application of the rule to his convictions is impermissibly retroactive and violates his due process rights under the united states constitution.
retroactive application of statutes 
t he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence landgraf usi film,d.indeed,e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly id.however,retroactive legislation is not,per se,unenforceable.see ins cyr,d i t is beyond dispute that,within constitutional limits,congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.
the supreme court has set out a test to determine when it is permissible to apply a statute retroactively.margolies deason,cir citing landgraf.the first step is to ascertain whether congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively.cyr,at.citing martin hadix,d see also landgraf,at.stating the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.such a requirement ensures that congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the
