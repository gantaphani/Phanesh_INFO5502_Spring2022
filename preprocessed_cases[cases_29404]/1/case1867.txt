delmas conley,doing business as conley trucking,petitions for review of a decision of the national labor relations board nlrb that affirmed an administrative law judge ruling that the petitioner had engaged in various unfair labor practices.the board has also filed an application with the court seeking enforcement of that decision.
in an opinion that was adopted in all substantive respects by the nlrb,the administrative law judge concluded that conley trucking violated provisions of the national labor relations act.specifically,the administrative law judge determined that the company violated the act by discharging an employee who supported unionization,by creating the impression that employees union activities were being monitored,and by threatening various adverse consequences if unionization of the company were to occur.before this court,conley trucking asserts that two of the five unfair labor practices found by the board can not be sustained because the administrative law judge improperly relied upon hearsay evidence in reaching those conclusions and that,without consideration of the hearsay,substantial evidence does not exist in the record to support the board decision.for the reasons discussed below,however,we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the board decision and,therefore,grant the request for enforcement of its administrative order against conley trucking and deny the company petition for review.
factual and procedural background 
this appellate proceeding has its genesis in an unsuccessful effort by the general truck drivers and helpers union local,international brotherhood of teamsters,to organize drivers at conley trucking,a sole proprietorship in portsmouth,ohio,owned by delmas conley and run primarily by conley sons,and rodney.conley trucking does not dispute that its drivers haul and deliver gravel,sand,salt,and stone in dump trucks for customers and that the company is subject to the requirements of the national labor relations act.
some time during the summer months of,conley observed union pamphlets in the company parking lot and informed his father of that fact.additionally,heard employees talking about a union around the workplace and probably disclosed that information to his father as well.nevertheless,no overt efforts at unionization of the conley trucking drivers occurred until october,when teamsters organizer rick kepler met at an area restaurant with drivers jeremy thompson,ata thunderdance,roger rosenogle,and dan gulliver.a second meeting organized by kepler convened at a lucasville establishment on sunday,october,and was attended by thompson,thunderdance,rosenogle,gulliver,tim gilbert,and steve delabar.at that second meeting,each of the conley trucking employees present signed a union card indicating a desire to be represented by the teamsters in workplace negotiations.
jeremy thompson subsequently signed two different affidavits that were prepared by an nlrb agent.in a november,affidavit,thompson claimed 
the following wednesday after the october meeting with kepler i was at the office at conley.there were or other drivers standing around that i do normally talk to.i do know their names.it was about or conley came over.we talked about everyday business.conley then said,i heard something today.i said,what that he said,i heard you,tim gilbert,and steve del a bar were trying to get a union in here.i said del a bar and gilbert had nothing to do with it.that was the end of the conversation.
the day after thompson exchange with conley,tim gilbert was informed that his wife had suffered a possible stroke and had been transported to the emergency room,although she was subsequently discharged after refusing recommended procedures.consequently,gilbert informed rodney holden,a dispatcher and scheduler for conley trucking,that he would not be able to work the following day because of the need to take his wife to the family doctor for a visit.on that friday,october,gilbert drove his wife to her physician,who,after examining test results,commented that gilbert wife should be taken immediately to the emergency room for a spinal tap and additional care that could not be provided in an office setting.once gilbert wife was readmitted to the hospital,gilbert and his daughter drove to conley trucking so that gilbert could receive his weekly paycheck.gilbert was handed an envelope by holden,an envelope that gilbert discovered contained not only his paycheck but also a notice that he had been terminated from his employment due to his.
according to one of the affidavits provided by thompson,comments continued to be made by conley trucking management officials after gilbert termination.for example,thompson stated in one affidavit 
about week to weeks after gilbert was fired i was at the shop.about or other drivers were there.roger rosenogle was there.dave jordan,a mechanic was there.the others i am not sure of.it was after work at or conley told us he could talk about it but he can legally say that he can sell his trucks if he so chooses.he said he ca afford to pay the big wage that the union was promising us.he said his company did generate that kind of money.he said if they could get a union in there and it would benefit the guys they would gladly do it,but they could afford it.i think started talking after one of the employees asked him about it.he said if we wanted a union,it would be our choice and we could vote on it and he did have any say in it.we did reply to this.i recall that said we would make per hour if the union came in because they went in the hole last year with fuel costs being high.
furthermore,thompson later claimed in another affidavit 
about late october or early november,i was loading my work truck at the dock when delmas conley approached me.it was about or no one else was present,but dan conley was getting loaded in the general area.conley told me that he wanted to have an off the record conversation about the union.i told him that it would be off the record.delmas asked me if i had a tape recorder on me and i opened my coat to show him that i did not.delmas said that he would fight the union and would shut the company down.he said that if we stopped right now,no one would lose their jobs,but if it did stop right now,we would all lose our jobs.delmas said that he would shut the company down if we unionized.he said he would use scab labor delmas said that the union was good years ago,but was not worth a fuck now.delmas said that he would fire anyone he wanted and that he owned the company and could do anything he wanted anytime and that no one short of the president of the united states could tell him otherwise.delmas said that if the union won,he would bargain us down to minimum wage and lock us out and use scab labor.delmas said that the union had hurt conley and had set him back years.
other testimony damaging to conley trucking came from conley,who admitted to numerous other comments made by him or by his father in the weeks after the news of potential unionization of the company drivers came to light.for example,testified that he remembered telling ata thunderdance and other drivers that if a union comes in,we start from zero and have to bargain everything.he further admitted that,at a december,meeting,delmas conley expressed his desire that the company stay,that he would not like outside people telling him how to run his business,that if employees want to work for a union trucking company they could go somewhere else rather than unionize his facility,that if employees wanted more control over the business that they could buy and drive their own trucks rather than unionize,and that he would sell them a truck,or even the entire business,rather than have them vote for union representation.
having been informed of these comments and events,the board general counsel filed charges,and eventually a complaint,against conley trucking,alleging the unlawful termination of tim gilbert in retaliation for his union activity,the unlawful creation of an impression of surveillance of employees union activities,and improper efforts to coerce the workers not to vote for the union.although conley trucking officials admitted to making many of the statements that the general counsel alleged were in violation of the act,they countered the allegation of retaliatory termination of gilbert with testimony indicating that gilbert was far from a model employee and that he was fired,not for union activities,but for numerous transgressions of workplace rules,for excessive absenteeism,and for substandard work performance.
in particular,conley testified that gilbert had shown up for work on march,too intoxicated to drive after being found asleep in his own car in the company parking lot with a beer can between his legs.even so,on that occasion,gilbert was not suspended by his employers and received only a written warning.additionally,the company asserted that gilbert was the only driver who had been involved in multiple accidents during the relevant time period,jackknifing a company truck on july,causing approximately in damage,backing his truck into the truck of steve delabar in september,causing another in damage,and backing his truck into another truck driven by charlie floyd.also,conley testified that gilbert was once seen parked in a rest area for an extended period of time with other conley trucking drivers,rather than returning with an additional load prior to quitting work for the day.conley trucking management also alleged before the administrative law judge that gilbert had more missed loads than any other driver for the period between november,and december,and that gilbert was chronically late for work and missed more days of work than the number to which he was entitled.finally,the company contends that gilbert failed to show up for work on saturday,october,a designated mandatory workday,instead opting to remain home to cut firewood for the winter.
in response to the company arguments that gilbert was terminated solely for his substandard work record,the board general counsel adduced testimony that the company failed to discipline gilbert for any of the alleged workplace infractions at the time they were committed,other than the one occasion on which he reported for work while intoxicated.furthermore,testimony established that even though many other drivers had attendance records,that even though other drivers also missed an inordinate number of work loads,and that even though other drivers were involved in accidents resulting in greater vehicle repair costs to the company,no other driver had been terminated by the management of the company before gilbert dismissal.
the general counsel also attempted to introduce testimony from jeremy thompson to substantiate that the conleys were aware of gilbert activities shortly before the termination decision was made.in contravention of the information thompson had previously provided in affidavits,however,once he was sworn at the administrative hearing,he denied that anybody from conley management ever said anything to him about the union.when confronted with his prior affidavit clearly stating that conley had indeed mentioned that he knew that thompson,tim gilbert and steve delabar were trying to bring a union into his workplace,thompson acknowledged the inconsistency but explained that when offering information for the affidavit,he was upset,under the influence also and was angry,so he may have exaggerated the points a little bit.
at the close of the hearing,the administrative law judge recognized that the thompson affidavits offered by the board general counsel constituted hearsay to the extent that the information contained in those affidavits was offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted and not merely to impeach the credibility of the witness testimony.nevertheless,because hearsay evidence is admissible at board proceedings if rationally probative in force and if corroborated by something more than the slightest amount of other evidence,the administrative law judge determined that the affidavits should be admitted as substantive evidence to be evaluated and weighed in the same manner as other testimony.delmas conley conley trucking,nlrb,wl,at,quoting dauman pallet,nlrb.in so ruling,the administrative law judge explained the rationale for his decision as follows 
w hile mindful that board proceedings are to follow the f ederal r ules of e vidence so far as practical,in my view federal labor policy concerns would render decidedly impractical adherence to an evidentiary rule that precluded the administrative law judge from having discretion to substantively consider these pretrial affidavits.
one of the chief concerns that motivated the modern trend to allow the substantive use of some prior witness statements,as reflected in fre d,was concern about witness,witnesses who could be intimidated or were otherwise vulnerable to pressure with the result that their prior statements were a more reliable guide to the fact finder than their testimony in the courtroom.according to the congressional subcommittee considering enactment of the rules of evidence proposed by the supreme court,support for the supreme court proposal to permit an even broader substantive use of prior inconsistent statements than congress ultimately adopted in the fre was based largely on the need to counteract the effect of witness intimidation.the notes of the advisory committee reviewing the rules of evidence proposed by the supreme court opined that the court proposed rule d a provides a party with desirable protection against the turncoat witness who changes his story on the stand and deprives the party calling him of evidence essential to his case.
t he concern with witness intimidation that prompted the modern movement toward permitting the substantive use of some prior inconsistent statements in federal court is even more acute in the arena of board litigation.it is precisely because of the peculiar character of labor litigation with its reliance on witnesses especially likely to be inhibited by fear that,as a matter of effectuating federal labor policy,administrative law judges should have the discretion to consider sworn pretrial affidavits as substantive evidence.for when a witness testifies in marked contradiction to his pretrial statement,and particularly where in the opinion of the administrative law judge that testimony reeks of untruthfulness,and further,where,as here,the employer has met with and discussed the contents of the employee pretrial statements with the employee,the ability of the judge to consider substantively the witnesses pretrial statements becomes an important tool in the search for truth and an antidote to the threat to board enforcement proceedings posed by witness intimidation.

even though the administrative law judge ultimately accepted thompson affidavits as substantive evidence,he also made clear that such admission is not tantamount to crediting the claims in the affidavits over all other evidence.rather,the assertions in the affidavits must be considered with and against the record evidence as a whole,including,the denial of the allegations by witnesses aligned with conley trucking.id.at.in doing so,the administrative law judge concluded that thompson testimony at the hearing was thoroughly untruthful.id.at.nevertheless,he refused to view all contrary evidence as necessarily credible and worthy of belief instead,the administrative law judge required corroboration of the allegations made in thompson affidavits before allowing those statements to serve as substantive evidence made against conley trucking.
as a result,the administrative law judge recommended dismissal of some charges brought against the trucking company and found violations of the act in other circumstances.on one hand,the administrative law judge concluded that conley trucking violated the act in the following instances 
by creating the impression that the company was conducting surveillance of the employees union activity 
by threatening the employees on or about november,that any bargaining with the union would start from zero 
by encouraging union supporters on december,to leave their employment with conley trucking 
by threatening on december,to sell the company trucks,and even the company itself,if the employees voted for the union and 
by discharging tim gilbert in retaliation for his support of the union.
on the other hand,however,the administrative law judge dismissed charges against conley trucking that 
conley stated in early november that the company could sell its trucks if the workers unionized 
conley told the employees that he would change their method of pay should they vote for a union 
delmas conley threatened on october,that he would sell his trucks his business in case of a vote and 
delmas conley stated in late october or early november that he would close his business before allowing unionization,that employees would lose their jobs unless they ceased unionization efforts,and that unionization would result in a pay decrease.
a panel of the board adopted the administrative law judge recommended order with only two minor,modifications.conley trucking then petitioned this court for review of that administrative decision and the nlrb filed a for enforcement of the board order.
discussion 
pursuant to the express language of section of the national labor relations act,employees are guaranteed the right to organize and to bargain collectively for their mutual aid or protection.moreover,section of the act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with those rights or to discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment.a and.see also opportunity homes,nlrb,cir,overruled on other grounds as recognized in nlrb webcor packaging,cir.
the threshold test for determining whether an employment decision constitutes an unfair labor practice is whether the decision at issue was motivated by animus.see nlrb cook family foods,cir.the board bears the initial burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer decision was motivated by the employee exercise of rights protected by the act.see nlrb transp.mgmt,d,overruled on other grounds,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d cook family foods,at.if such a showing is made,the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision regardless of the fact that the employees engaged in protected activity.ishikawa gasket,nlrb,cir citing nlrb fabrications,cir.
this court then reviews de novo any legal conclusions made by the board.see orange place.nlrb,cir.we will uphold the board findings of fact,however,if supported by substantial evidence on the record.see e and f.substantial evidence has been defined as such evidence as is adequate,in a reasonable mind,to uphold the board decision.fabrications,at.deference to the board factual findings is particularly appropriate where the record is fraught with conflicting testimony and essential credibility determinations have been made.tony scott trucking,nlrb,cir quoting nlrb nueva eng g,cir.
in its request for relief,conley trucking asks that the board decision be vacated in its entirety and the complaint of the general counsel be dismissed.as noted by the board and by general counsel,however,conley trucking failed to present proper objections before the board to some of the administrative law judge conclusions and recommendations.indeed,the company exceptions to the administrative law judge finding that it violated a of the act by threatening employees that bargaining with the union would start from zero fail to allege with any degree of particularity the error it contends the judge committed,or on what grounds it believes the judge decision as to this violation should be overturned.delmas conley conley trucking,wl,at.consequently,absent extraordinary circumstances,which are not present in this matter,such an objection that is not properly urged before the board,its member,agent,or agency,shall not be considered by the court.e 
furthermore,conley trucking does not argue in its appellate brief against the validity of the board rulings regarding two other findings by the administrative law judge that were affirmed by the board.any challenges to those rulings have thus been waived.see mcpherson kelsey,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.moreover,conley trucking,through its agents,conceded at the administrative hearing that those offending,comments had indeed been made.
specifically,conley admitted during his hearing testimony that his father invited union supporters to leave their employment with conley trucking by stating that if employees want to work for a union trucking company that he preferred that they go work somewhere else rather than unionize his facility.as noted by the administrative law judge 
it is well settled that an employer invitation to an employee to quit in response to their exercise of protected concerted activity is coercive,because it conveys to employees that support for their union or engaging in other concerted activities and their continued employment are not compatible,and implicitly threaten discharge of the employees involved.
delmas conley conley trucking,wl,at quoting mcdaniel ford,nlrb.
conley also confirmed during his testimony that his father told company employees that if they wanted more control over the business they could buy and drive their own trucks instead of unionize,and added that he would sell them a truck and would,in fact,sell them his entire business.in addition,delmas conley himself admitted at the administrative hearing that he made comments to the employees about outsiders running the company and that he would sell his trucks and his business to the workers if they desired.as the administrative law judge and board concluded,this was not a business offer.conley was telling employees that in retaliation for their desire to unionize he was willing to radically alter the relationship the threat of reprisal for union activity in the comment is manifest and violative of section a of the act.
as a result of admissions by conley trucking of various comments,the failure of the company to argue in its brief that certain conclusions made by the administrative law judge were erroneous,and the decisions of conley trucking and the board general counsel not to file proper exceptions to other determinations made by the administrative law judge,only two rulings by the board remain for our review.both of those conley trucking improperly created the impression of surveillance of employees union activity and that conley trucking improperly discharged timothy gilbert for engaging in activities in support of union upon information contained in affidavits executed by jeremy thompson,affidavits that thompson later repudiated in large part during his hearing testimony.thus,the administrative law judge and board resolution of those questions may be upheld only if we determine that the admission of the recanted affidavits as substantive evidence was indeed proper.
before this court,both parties apparently concede that the information contained in thompson two affidavits,if offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein,constituted hearsay evidence.conley trucking and the board general counsel disagree,however,over whether such hearsay should be admissible as substantive evidence to be evaluated by the administrative law judge and the board itself.
pursuant to the federal rules of evidence,hearsay,defined as a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c,is not generally admissible in federal courts.see.nevertheless,administrative hearings,like the proceeding before the administrative law judge in this labor dispute,are not necessarily bound by the same evidentiary strictures as are federal district courts.indeed,the express language of b provides that such agency proceedings shall,only so far as practicable,be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the united states emphasis added.
