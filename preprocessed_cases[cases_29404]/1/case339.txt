seeking to spur competition in the telecommunications industry,congress a decade ago passed the telecommunications act of the act the act not only permitted competitors to operate their own local exchange networks in competition with the local telephone company,a,d,but also obliged the local incumbent to assist new entrants in several respects,id.b c.pertinently,section places on incumbent carriers a duty to provide competitors the ability to 
interconnect with the incumbent carrier network a for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access b at any technically feasible point within the carrier network c that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary,affiliate,or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection and d on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory 
interconnection allows customers of the competitor to place calls to,and to receive calls from,customers on the incumbent network.huber et,federal telecommunications law ed.incumbent carriers must negotiate interconnection terms with competitors in good faith,facilities,timing,c,and if negotiations fail,either party may petition a state commission to arbitrate any open issues.id.b.
worldnet telecommunications,worldnet,sought to enter the puerto rico market in competition with the local incumbent,the puerto rico telephone company prt.the local regulatory authority in puerto rico is the telecommunications regulatory board of puerto rico the board.in,after the requisite period of negotiation,worldnet petitioned the board for arbitration to resolve issues relating to an interconnection agreement it sought with prt.
these issues included the performance standards to which prt would be example,the time within which prt must enter worldnet service orders or make line repairs for a liquidated damages schedule requested by worldnet to back up the standards.the board appointed an arbitrator,who held a hearing and issued an order adopting among other things worldnet proposed performance standards as well as its proposed liquidated damages schedule for.
the parties amended their interconnection agreement to match the arbitrator order and,as required by the statute,e,submitted the agreement to the board for approval.before the board,prt challenged the terms imposed by the arbitrator,including the performance standards and the liquidated damages amounts.the board ultimately upheld the standards but modified the arbitrator order to allow prt to its performance more slowly over the duration of the agreement after an implementation period of six months during which the performance standards would not be in effect,prt would have to maintain compliance for successive month periods at an percent level,then percent and then percent 
as for liquidated damages,the board said that the amounts endorsed by the arbitrator were unreasonable because they were intended to punish prt,not to compensate worldnet for actual damages.finding that the record lacked evidence as to worldnet predicted actual damages from prt failure to comply with the various performance standards,the board set aside the liquidated damages remedy in its entirety.it concluded that other means,such as the board power to fine prt for breaches,provided prt with a sufficient incentive to perform.
prt and worldnet each sought federal district court review,e prt alleged that the board performance standards impermissibly required prt to provide worldnet with better service than it provided to its own customers and worldnet challenged the board rejection of its liquidated damages proposal.the district court adopting the magistrate judge recommendation affirmed the board as to the performance standards,but remanded the liquidated damages issue for further consideration by the board.
prt now seeks review of the board performance standards ruling,and prt and the board both seek review on the liquidated damages issue.in light of the district court remand to the board for further proceedings,we face at the outset the question whether the district court action constitutes a final decision a jurisdictional requirement for us,subject to various exceptions.
finality is not a label but a bundle of rules and policies,framed by judges,to implement a concept the problem is especially complicated where the district court is itself reviewing an agency.if the district court had affirmed the board outright,the judgment would clearly be final it would also be final if the court had remanded with directions to reach a specified result,since deferring review would serve no practical purpose.catlin united states.
by contrast,where a remand by the district court leaves the agency with latitude for action,a court of appeals will ordinarily defer review of the remand order since the ultimate outcome is uncertain.global naps.dep t of telecomm.energy,cir.but our decisions have made prudential,where deferral would compromise the agency ability to ever get effective review of a district court remand order with which it disagrees 
this is not a risk if the district court tells the agency to better explain its position or address a missed issue.but if the remand requires the agency to take action under a legal standard with which it disagrees,the agency may be compelled to enter a new order further judicial be forced to defend its new order as a proper application of a mandate that the agency opposes and that it has never had an opportunity to challenge on appeal.global naps,at.
in this case,the district court altered the legal template by telling the board that it could not reject liquidated damages solely on the basis that they exceeded worldnet actual damages.this in turn sets the stage for the likely adoption of liquidated damages exceeding worldnet is just what the agency opposes.immediate review is justified in this case not merely for the sake of efficiency but because the board could otherwise be compromised on a later appeal because its own decision would rest on a position that it opposes.
turning to the merits,we start with the district court remand on the liquidated damages issue.where as here judicial review is based on the agency record,we apply to the agency ordinary review standards,accepting the district court decision merely as it may be persuasive.fisheries of,daley,cir.
the ordinary standards for reviewing agency decisions are deferential in varying degrees as to matters of fact,policy and application of general standards,but de novo as to questions of law,global naps,verizon new england,cir,cert.denied,d,save that an agency also receives deference in interpreting its own statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.where a statute prescribes a different review standard,it governs.
here,a further wrinkle exists because the board is itself engaged in reviewing an arbitrator decision and,under the act,may reject an arbitrated agreement or part of an agreement only if the agreement prescribed by the arbitrator does not hold the carriers to their obligations under section primarily interconnection obligations or fails to meet the pricing standards of section d,see e b with the further qualification that 
nothing in this section shall prohibit a state commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of state law in its review of an agreement,including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.
the arbitrator decision is thus the starting point for the board,and we agree with the district court that the board has not adequately justified its rejection of liquidated damages.but our reasoning differs substantially from that of the magistrate judge recommendation adopted by the district court.the difference in reasoning directly affects the board latitude on remand.
the board acknowledged that liquidated damages comprising actual damages would encourage prt to comply with performance standards.but the liquidated damages schedule proposed by adopted wholesale by the worldnet itself conceded not limited to likely actual damages.the board therefore deemed the schedule adopted in the agreement to be unreasonable and punitive.
since worldnet could not identify the portion that comprised actual damages rather than what worldnet deemed an incentive element,the board said it had before it no evidence that would enable it to calculate actual damages.finally,the board pointed to other means to assure prt compliance board fines up to per violation,its contempt power,and court proceedings by worldnet to secure equitable and damages relief for violations of the agreement.
if we were reviewing an ordinary decision by an agency charged with overseeing interconnection,this might well be an adequate explanation for declining to adopt a liquidated damages provision as an enforcement tool.nothing in the act mandates liquidated damages.the burden was on worldnet to supply evidence for a provision it sought.a regulatory agency ordinarily has considerable latitude in deciding how to regulate.
under the act,however,the board review of an arbitrated agreement is constrained by section e quoted above.this provision allows the state agency to override an arbitrator decision on two explicit grounds,neither of which is applicable here.but the statute goes on in a further provision to reserve state authority on such review to impose other requirements of state law so long as not inconsistent with section.id.e.
the board seemingly assumed that liquidated damages exceeding a reasonable estimate of damages to worldnet were forbidden either by puerto rico law or by something inherent in the concept of liquidated damages.this is suggested,although not established,by the board own cryptic description of the arbitrator figures as designed to punish which is a common,along with penalty,for liquidated damages in excess of actual damages.see,space master int l,city of worcester,cir.
it is further suggested,more explicitly,by the board brief in this court.on the liquidated damages issue,it devotes itself to case law from various jurisdictions showing that courts regularly strike down liquidated damages provisions in commercial contracts where the amounts are intended to exceed actual damages.courts have historically been opposed to penalty clauses in private contracts and many still take this view 
yet the interconnection agreements are not ordinary commercial contracts the act dictates their creation they are imposed by involuntary arbitration and agency review if the parties can not agree and their aim is to secure the public benefit of competition.incentive payments not limited to actual damages,civil penalties and criminal fines are familiar devices to achieve public ends.so courts,as a matter of federal law,have allowed states to approve interconnection agreements imposing liquidated damages that include incentive elements exceeding actual compensation 
while the law of some states may forbid such damages provisions even in interconnection agreements,puerto rico courts have been more solicitous of liquidated damages clauses than their counterparts,seeming even in private contracts to permit coercive and punitive clauses so long as they are not excessively so,rochester capital leasing williams int l,wl,at,pr suo.lexis,at rodriguez lopez jimenez aponte,pr app.lexis,at cir.if the board thought that some legal rule precluded it from adopting liquidated damages in excess of actual costs,this was a mistake.
however,local agencies make policy on their own and section e reserves the board authority to establish requirements of state law in its review of an agreement emphasis added.and the act,although imposing certain federal requirements,is intended to defer to state agencies on matters that do not compromise the achievement of federal aims.e city of abilene,fcc,aegerter city of delafield,cir.
in reconciling the limitation on the board authority in section e with the preservation of its authority in section e,we treat an arbitrated agreement governed by section b as a presumptive solution it must be accepted if consistent with sections and d,unless the local agency reasonably finds that the arbitrator solution conflicts with state statutes,agency rules,or considered policy determinations that the agency would follow in matters wholly within its jurisdiction.
this is a workable solution to the inherent conflict,not crisply addressed in the act,between the arbitrator authority and that of the appointing board.the board has to remain free to adopt and implement general policies otherwise,among other problems,different arbitrators could inflict inconsistent interconnection agreements on different new competitors.at the same time,the agency policies that override the arbitrator choice ought be ones that the board would follow in other situations and not just ad hoc preferences.
in this case,it is not enough that the board,if framing the agreement itself,would eschew incentive payments exceeding projected actual damages.rather,the board must reasonably conclude that such incentive payments are inconsistent with regulatory policy that it would adhere to in comparable local cases where the act plays no role.it may take this position on remand despite our own holding that neither federal nor puerto rico law automatically forbids such penalties in this context.indeed,in a regulatory context,terms like penalty or punitive are not usually decisive.
rather,for regulators,creating special incentives for compliance is often a permissible option.see note,above.and,from a prudential standpoint,the more typical questions are whether an extra incentive element in damages is necessary in light of other tools for securing compliance and whether it may have negative effects of its own,especially where the substantive standards are untested or ambitious.in all events,these are the kinds of considerations that expert agencies can weigh better than courts in relation to the conditions before them.
also,although worldnet did not supply information allowing the board to calculate liquidated damages,this information could likely be determined by further hearings at the board or arbitrator level.and,of course,liquidated damages can be reasonable approximations one reason for using them is the difficulty of making exact calculations.vazquez eastern air lines,cir.this does not mean that the board has to pursue such an option the act does not say what should be done if an arbitrator award is found inadequate in part,and the board arguably retains a good deal of latitude in such cases.
on remand,the board must recognize that neither the act nor puerto rico precedent forbids liquidated damages that the arbitrator solution can not be set aside unless it violates general agency policy and that the board should not assume an inability to use liquidated damages.if the board takes the position that liquidated damages may not exceed actual damages,whether to consider further the possibility of designing such liquidated damages is a matter for it to decide.
this brings us to the second large issue raised on appeal,namely whether the board has authority to impose performance standards that require prt to provide service to worldnet superior to the service it currently provides itself.the question turns on issues of both federal and puerto rico law.we begin by tracing briefly how the question arose and how the issues were addressed by the arbitrator,by the board and finally by the district court.
in adopting performance standards largely as proposed by worldnet,the arbitrator recognized prt claim that it was only obliged to provide equal treatment to worldnet and said that prt could present evidence to the board showing that individual standards exceeded the service prt provided to itself.the board decided that it was empowered to adopt performance standards requiring prt to provide worldnet with service superior to the service prt currently provided to its own customers,and the district court agreed.
in this court,prt renews its claim that the board has no power to adopt performance standards requiring superior service,arguing that nothing in the act warrants such standards for competitors and that under federal law prt can not be forced to discriminate against its own c
