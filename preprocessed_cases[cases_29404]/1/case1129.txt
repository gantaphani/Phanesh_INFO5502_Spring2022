opinion of the court 
sioe tjen wong,a native and citizen of indonesia,petitions for review of a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia.a catholic indonesian of chinese descent,wong claims that she has a fear of persecution in indonesia because of her religion and her ethnicity.as we explain below,substantial evidence supports the bia denial of asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.accordingly,we will deny wong petition for review.
born in,wong was raised in situbondo,a city located in eastern java.six of wong brothers and sisters still live in eastern java,as does her mother.her siblings run businesses,and her mother works at home.
wong entered the united states as a in august and overstayed her visitor visa.she filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat in july and was placed in removal proceedings.in her application for relief,wong claimed that ethnic indonesians persecuted her because she was chinese and catholic and that the government failed to control or prevent the persecution.wong asserted that in her hometown,ethnic indonesians often broke the windows of chinese homes when they smelled chinese cooking,threatened ethnic chinese residents with meat cleavers,and heckled them with ethnic slurs.according to wong,o ur churches we re burned,women we re assaulted and raped and people we re murdered by muslims without any consequence at all.administrative record.
when wong was growing up,riots and attacks were widespread in indonesia.wong personally suffered several kinds of harassment and discrimination.for example,wong recalled ethnic indonesians lifting her skirt and grabbing her chest on the way to school.ethnic indonesians also stopped wong in the street,demanded money,threw stones at her,and called her names on her way to church.according to wong,she was not allowed to sing christian songs in public or allowed to learn chinese.once,her parents tried to teach her chinese,and an ethnic indonesian,who overheard the lesson,threatened to burn down the store the wongs owned as well as their house,if the lesson continued.
wong pointed to several specific incidents in support of her application for relief from removal in her affidavit and at a hearing before the immigration judge ij.first,she explained that in the government confiscated businesses run by ethnic chinese,including a store run by her parents.her father opened another business in the,delivering and selling construction materials,but according to wong,ethnic indonesians often placed orders and then refused to pay for the materials.as a result,her father was forced to shut down the business.her father then opened a small fishery,using the name of an ethnic indonesian to start the business because as an ethnic chinese he was not allowed a business license.this business failed too because ethnic indonesians constantly stole fish from her father and the ethnic indonesian whose name her father had used caused him problems.according to wong,these business failures devastated her father and after the fishery business failed,he suffered a heart attack and died in june.
in the early,wong family reacquired the store the government had confiscated in.they had to pay the government for the store,however,and they were not compensated for the loss of the business during the years in which it was closed.to help her mother,wong assisted with running the store and was harassed as a result.wong stated that y oung,drunk ethnic indonesians often came to the store at night,threatening to burn the store down and to burn her face with cigarettes if she did not give them money.
in august,an ethnic indonesian struck wong brother on the back of the head as he was riding his motorcycle home from work.the assailant stole the motorbike,and wong brother was taken to the hospital,where he died.although the hospital officials told wong that her brother had lost too much blood to be saved,wong asserts that n othing was done to help my brother at the hospital because ethnic chinese were required to pay before receiving treatment,even in emergency situations.according to wong,the family reported the incident to the police,but there was no reaction.
wong officially changed her name from sioe tjen wong to veronica wiyanti in march,so that she would not be identified as a person of ethnic chinese descent and discriminated against,later that year,in october,there was rioting in situbondo and the church wong attended was twice set on fire.christian schools and other churches in the town were also burned and in one church,a pastor and his family were killed.in november,after the church burning incidents,wong and her church choir were practicing in a tent near the church when a group of ethnic indonesians threatened to burn them unless they stopped singing and praying.after these incidents,wong could not attend church because it was guarded by the muslim fanatics.
wong explained that in,riots were again rampant in indonesia.ethnic indonesians burned houses and stores and raped chinese women.wong and her family hid in their house for days,while rioters threw stones and broke the front window.the violence continued into.according to wong,she wanted to leave indonesia immediately,but the embassy in jakarta was closed for about a year after the riots.as a result,she was not able to obtain a visa to go to the united states until august.after wong left the country,she learned that her oldest sister had also died.according to wong,the stress of constant harassment by ethnic indonesians caused her sister death.
wong submitted news articles and reports discussing human rights and religious freedom in indonesia,among other materials,to the ij.after holding a hearing and reviewing wong testimony and application,the ij concluded that the instances of discrimination and harassment that wong experienced did not rise to the level of past persecution.according to the ij,wong also failed to identify any grounds to support a fear of persecution.in addition,wong was unable to show a clear probability that she would be tortured if returned to indonesia.as a result,the ij denied wong application for relief on december,but granted her voluntary departure.
wong appealed,and the bia affirmed the ij denial of wong application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat without opinion on march.wong timely filed a motion to reopen with the bia.
after reviewing new reports on country conditions submitted by wong,the bia granted wong motion to reopen on august,and remanded for the ij to consider evidence of changed country conditions in indonesia during the three years since the original ij decision.
on remand,a new ij reviewed the updated evidence,including news articles,recent state department reports,and an affidavit from an expert on indonesia country conditions.based on this evidence,the ij considered whether wong would be singled out for persecution based on her ethnicity and religion and also assessed whether there was a pattern or practice of persecution in indonesia by forces that the government wa s unable or unwilling to control.the ij noted that there we re no credibility issues in this case and that the only issue on remand,therefore,was whether wong had a fear of future persecution in light of the absence of past persecution,or,in the alternative,whether wong could meet the higher standard of a clear probability of future persecution for withholding of removal or demonstrate that it was more probable than not that she would be tortured by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
the ij explained that he was constrained to conclude that the respondent has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that she has a reasonable possibility of future persecution as that term has been defined in the case law if she were to return to indonesia,absent a conclusion by either the bia or the circuit court that such a pattern or practice conclusion would be supported by substantial evidence in this record.on december,the ij denied wong petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,but granted her voluntary departure.
wong again appealed,and the bia dismissed wong case on june.the bia determined that wong had failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic chinese christians in indonesia and noted that the grant of asylum to wong husband was not dispositive of her asylum claim.the bia observed that the state department and international religious freedom reports for indonesia religious freedom reports indicated that the government had taken steps to control violence,and that violence continued only in specific parts of indonesia.
similarly,while the state department and country reports on human rights practices for indonesia country reports documented ongoing harassment and discrimination against ethnic chinese in indonesia,the reports indicated that violence had ended.the bia also determined that wong was not eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the cat.
this timely petition for review followed.

as a threshold matter,we reject wong argument that the bia issued a decision that failed to provide meaningful review of the ij decision.pet r br.at.contrary to wong contentions,the bia explanation of its reasoning is sufficiently detailed for this court to review.
in support of her argument,wong relies on miah ashcroft,cir,in which we held that the bia failure to explain its reasoning precluded this court from conducting a meaningful review of its analysis.in miah,the bia rejected the ij determination that the petitioner was not credible,but then adopted the ij reasoning as to corroboration.the bia did not analyze how its assessment that the petitioner testimony was credible affected the degree of corroboration necessary for the petitioner to meet his burden of proof.because the bia adopted a conclusion of the ij after rejecting the finding of the ij which informed that conclusion,we concluded that meaningful review of the bia decision was not possible.id.at see also awolesi ashcroft,cir noting that we are particularly concerned about being able to give meaningful review to the bia decision where the bia reverses the ij without explanation emphasis in original.
here,in contrast,the bia did not reject the ij decision.rather,the bia considered the merits of wong asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims and dismissed wong appeal.the bia considered the and state department reports and concluded that there was no pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic chinese in indonesia.as we have previously observed,w e will not hold that a bia decision is insufficient merely because its discussion of certain issues could have been more detailed.toussaint att y,cir concluding that the bia decision provided the court with adequate insight into its reasoning and allowed for a meaningful review quoting sevoian ashcroft,cir.the bia need not write an exegesis on every contention.toussaint,at quoting zubeda ashcroft,cir.although the bia explanation in the instant case is brief,we conclude that the decision is nonetheless sufficiently detailed to allow for meaningful review.accordingly,we turn to the merits of the bia decision.
wong contends that the bia decision is not supported by substantial evidence.specifically,wong argues that the bia failed to consider the entire record in assessing the objective basis for her fear of persecution,applied the incorrect legal standard in analyzing her claim,erred in introducing the concept of relocation within indonesia,and misinterpreted her argument regarding her husband asylee status.we disagree.while the record does indicate that chinese christians in indonesia are victims of harassment and intimidation,we can not say that they are subject to a pattern or practice of persecution as defined in lie,at.as we explain further below,the record does not compel a finding that wong has a fear of persecution.
the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien in removal proceedings if the alien establishes that he or she is a refugee under the immigration and nationality act ina.a,b.the ina defines refugee as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
id.a a emphasis added.a person seeking asylum bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she meets this definition.id.b b i.
persecution includes threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.kibinda att y,cir quoting fatin,cir.however,persecution does not encompass all treatment our society regards as unfair,unjust or even unlawful or unconstitutional.id.quoting fatin,at see jarbough att y,cir noting that a busive treatment and harassment,while always deplorable,may not rise to the level of persecution lie,at explaining that robberies motivated by ethnicity do not constitute persecution firmansjah gonzales,cir determining that a requirement to change one name based on ethnicity is not enough to establish a claim for persecution.
the fear of persecution standard has both a subjective and an objective component.see ghebrehiwot,at.first,an applicant must show that his or her subjective fear is genuine and second that a reasonable person in the alien circumstances would fear persecution if returned to the country in question.guo ashcroft,cir quoting zubeda,at.
wong subjective fear of persecution is not contested.as noted above,wong presented credible testimony and neither the ij nor the bia questioned the genuine nature of her fear of persecution.rather,the key issue herein is whether the record compels a finding that wong fear is objectively reasonable and that she has a fear of persecution.
an applicant can satisfy the objective prong of the fear of persecution standard in two ways by showing that he or she would be individually singled out for persecution or by demonstrat ing that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion lie,at quoting b iii a.as part of a pattern or practice claim,an applicant must establish his or her own inclusion in,and identification with,such group of similarly situated persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is r
