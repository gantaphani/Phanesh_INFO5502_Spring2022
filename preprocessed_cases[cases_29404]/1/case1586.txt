annette randall appeals a judgment denying her application for supplemental security income benefits.we affirm.
we first describe the legal framework the social security act ssa,ch,entitles certain disabled individuals to supplemental security income benefits ssi benefits.under the statute,disabled individuals are those who are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.a a.the statute requires that the commissioner of social security establish by regulation uniform standards which shall be applied at all levels of determination,review,and adjudication in determining whether individuals are under disabilities.k see a h i.
accordingly,the commissioner promulgated a complex scheme of regulations for administering benefits,see ch.iii,pts,subpt.p,subpt.i,including a sequential evaluation process for disability determinations,a.a finding that a claimant is disabled or is not disabled at any point in the review is conclusive and terminates the analysis.step three provides that i f you have an impairment s that meets or equals one of our listings in appendix to subpart p of part of this chapter and meets the duration requirement,we will find that you are disabled.a iii.
appendix,in turn,includes diagnostic descriptions for various disabilities and addresses mental disorders in listing,ch.iii,pt,subpt.p,app.the listing.listing contains an introductory paragraph with the diagnostic description for mental retardation and four sets of criteria paragraphs a through d.listing a.
mental retardation mental retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period,the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age.
the required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in a,b,c,or d are satisfied.
mental incapacity evidenced by dependence upon others for personal needs,toileting,eating,dressing,or bathing and inability to follow directions,such that the use of standardized measures of intellectual functioning is precluded 
b.a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of or less 
c.a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function 
d.a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through,resulting in at least two of the following 
marked restriction of activities of daily living or 
marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning or 
marked difficulties in maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace or 
repeated episodes of decompensation,each of extended duration.
in,then annette randall applied to the social security administration for ssi benefits,claiming that a disability had befallen her earlier that year.she was married and lived with her husband and one of her six children.she claimed to suffer from high blood pressure,dizziness,migraine headaches,and nerves.tests conducted in revealed congestive heart failure and related complications.to evaluate her functional capacities,multiple medical professionals examined her,including clinical psychologist alfred buxton,who conducted a review of her personal history,a clinical interview,and a psychometric assessment.
randall obtained an overall iq score of,and buxton rendered the following findings she could cook,clean,communicate,manage time,and travel independently she was alert and responsive and she possessed good receptive and expressive skills for everyday conversational purposes,good social skill,good abilities to attend and concentrate,good judgment and reflective cognition,and fair reasoning.according to buxton,randall would function in the range of mental retardation adaptively,and o n a basis overall general functioning is felt to more closely approximate borderline mental retardation as opposed to mild mental retardation.buxton concluded that randall physical and mental conditions would not preclude gainful competitive employment though there may be some parametric restrictions placed on the type of employment she could engage in on an ongoing basis.
lawrence klusman also assessed randall functional capacities and found that she exhibited no marked limitations in understanding or memory,sustained concentration and persistence,social interaction,or adaptation.according to klusman assessment,
randall level of intellectual development will permit her to acquire simple skills and knowledge.she understands verbal directives and is able to follow them.she can attend to a task and work at an adequate pace during the course of a regular work period.she may not be suited for extensive interaction with the public but would be able to manage brief,structured encounters.she would be most suited for work that has minimal requirements for flexibility,reading skills,or changing task demands.
in six of the seven years preceding her application,randall was employed as a housekeeper.
the regional social security commissioner denied randall application for ssi benefits,so she requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,to whom she argued that her impairments satisfied listing c.at step three of the evaluative process,the alj premised her analysis on an important legal conclusion 
the threshold requirement of listing is that and sic individual have mental retardation,which is defined as significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period.beyond that,there are a number of different ways to meet the requirement of the listing,all depending on either valid iq scores or a limitation of function 
the alj concluded that randall did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals one of the listed impairments in appendix,because randall had failed to meet the threshold requirement of mental retardation,defined as significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period.accordingly,the alj found that randall suffered from no disability within the meaning of the ssa.the appeals council denied randall request for review.
randall sought review in federal court,arguing that substantial evidence did not support the alj rejection of the listing c argument and that the diagnostic description adaptive functioning term ought not operate as an independent measurement of mental retardation under listing the commissioner presented multiple grounds for affirming the alj denial.a magistrate judge mj recommended affirming by concluding that listing c diagnostic description required an independent showing of deficits in adaptive functioning and that the alj decision on that ground was supported by substantial evidence.
randall objected,arguing that listing c imposes no such requirement.the district court agreed with randall and directed the mj to consider only whether the paragraph c conditions had manifested before randall reached the age of.
despite the court instruction,the mj again evaluated randall claim by requiring proof of deficits in adaptive functioning and recommended affirming the alj decision.after randall objected again,the district court adopted the mj position of requiring proof of deficits in adaptive functioning.the court did not reject randall claim on that ground,however,because it found that substantial evidence supported the manifestation of the adaptive deficits during the developmental period.instead,the court concluded that substantial evidence supported rejecting randall claim for failure to satisfy the latter half of paragraph existence of a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function.
in an appeal from an alj denial of ssi benefits,we review the alj decision alone to determine whether she applied the proper legal standard and,if so,whether substantial evidence supports her decision our review of the alj decision is further circumscribed in important respects by the commissioner specific position in this appeal.before this court,the commissioner separates the question whether randall satisfied listing diagnostic description from the question whether she satisfied paragraph c.the commissioner concedes that randall satisfied the listing c iq and physical or other mental impairment and argues only that the alj properly found that randall did not meet the first requirement of listing c because she did not have deficits in adaptive functioning manifested before age.as a result,the only questions before the court are whether satisfaction of listing c requires an independent demonstration of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested before age,listing,and,if so,whether substantial evidence supports the alj decision.
the legal question is straightforward we must construe listing and determine the precise relationship between the diagnostic description substantive requirements significantly subaverage intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning,the diagnostic description temporal requirement initially manifested during the developmental period,the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age and the four severity criteria paragraphs a,b,c,and d.we are presented with three markedly different constructions to choose among.in the context of a claim under listing c,the possible constructions are as follows 
an impairment satisfies listing if the claimant presently exhibits the severity criteria iq and limitation of function.in this reading,the diagnostic description and temporal language pose no independent requirements.
an impairment satisfies listing if a the claimant presently exhibits the severity criteria,and b the severity criteria manifested during the developmental period.in this reading,the diagnostic description substantive language poses no independent requirement.
an impairment satisfies listing if a the claimant presently satisfies the diagnostic description substantive requirements,b the claimant shows that the impairment satisfying the diagnostic description substantive requirement manifested during the developmental period,and c the claimant presently exhibits the severity criteria 
randall argues for construction the commissioner,for.
our circuit has yet to resolve this question.our only opinion to address it,arce barnhart.cir,rejected a listing c claim by concluding,without elaboration,that b ecause there is substantial evidence that the claimant does not have deficits in adaptive functioning,there is substantial evidence that she does not meet listing id.at.that unpublished case does not have precedential effect.see cir.in selders sullivan,cir,we said that section c defines an impairment to include a valid verbal,performance,or full scale score of inclusive,and a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant limitations of function we also opined that a claimant must prove both of these conditions in order to meet his burden under step three.id.at.but because the selders claimant failed to establish the requisite iq score,the court did not reach the issue of whether the diagnostic paragraph imposes any additional requirement.id 
the ssa provides the touchstone for our analysis,because listing represents the commissioner effort to determine which impairments meet the statutory definition of disability.section d definition of disability includes two limiting elements a definition of impairment and a severity requirement.
to qualify as a physical or mental impairment,the condition must be an impairment that results from anatomical,physiological,or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.d.to meet the severity requirement,the impairment must be of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work.d a.this distinction between an impairment existence and its severity is fundamental to an understanding of listing.
like the statute,the secretary regulations separate the question of the impairment existence from the question of its severity.after reciting the statutory definition of disability,see a,section addresses the means by which claimants must prove the existence of an impairment 
if you are not doing substantial gainful activity,we always look first at your physical or mental impairment s to determine whether you are disabled or blind.your impairment must result from anatomical,physiological,or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.a physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs,symptoms,and laboratory findings,not only by your statement of symptoms.
emphasis added.several other sections make it plain that the two inquiries are distinct.the section addressing evidence requires that applicants provide medical evidence showing that you have an impairment s and how severe it is during the time you say that you are disabled.
additional evidence of the separation importance comes from a,which describes the special technique of mental impairment evaluations under the special technique,we must first evaluate your pertinent symptoms,signs,and laboratory findings to determine whether you have a medically determinable mental impairment s.a b.after identifying an impairment,the commission attempts to rate the degree of functional limitation resulting from the impairment s,a b,and only then does the commission address severity,see a d after we rate the degree of functional limitation resulting from your impairment s,we will determine the severity of your mental impairment s.
finally,we come to the listing of impairments,which provides an introduction and set of specific listings for each of various body systems.see listing c.listing addresses nine specific mental disorders and begins with a set of introductory instructions,see listing the listing introductory instructions are no less mandatory than is listing itself,see c.accordingly,every mental disorder listing includes two independent components a diagnostic description of the disorder and specific criteria measuring the disorder severity 
after an introductory paragraph sets out a diagnostic description,most of the listings include the following text the required level of severity for these disorders is met when the requirements in both a and b are satisfied,or when the requirements in c are satisfied,listing.if the listings were our only text,this the is met tempt us to construe the diagnostic description substantive language as a mere precatory introduction to the binding requirements enumerated in paragraphs a through d.but the listings do not stand alone the surrounding statutes and regulations take care to distinguish the severity inquiry from the threshold determination of whether an impairment exists.
more importantly,listing specifically rejects this construction.to ensure that the severity determination is not confused with the predicate determination of impairment,a separates the requirements and requires satisfaction of both we will find that you have a listed impairment if the diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph and the criteria of both paragraphs a and b or a and c,when appropriate of the listed impairment are satisfied.
it is certainly true that t he structure of the listing for mental retardation is different from that of the other mental disorders listings.listing a.listing employs four enumerated paragraphs instead of the typical three to describe the severity criteria,and only one paragraph must be met instead of a combination of two.those differences do nothing,however,to relieve claimants of the initial burden of demonstrating that their impairment satisfies the introductory paragraph diagnostic description.
the statutory and regulatory context informs listing just as much as it does every other mental disability listing,and listing does nothing to disclaim the distinction between an impairment existence and an impairment severity.like its counterparts,listing says that t he required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in a,b,c,or d are satisfied.listing.but again the regulations give a specific instruction that reiterates the need to satisfy both the diagnostic description and the severity criteria if your impairment satisfies the diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph and any one of the four sets of criteria,we will find that your impairment meets the listing.without a challenge to this regulation legitimacy,we must give it effect.
for similar reasons,we find no principled basis for giving effect to only part of the diagnostic description.that is,nothing in listing suggests that the temporal language is any more binding than is the substantive portion of that very same sentence.this is particularly so given that the respective language of the diagnostic description substantive requirement and the language of the severity such different meanings 
accordingly,the alj did not err in construing listing to require an independent showing of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period that is to say,the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age.
our construction of listing accords with the published holdings of at least three and perhaps four other circuits.soon after the revisions,the sixth circuit held that claimants must satisfy the diagnostic description substantive requirements independently of the severity criteria 
a claimant must demonstrate that her impairment satisfies the diagnostic description for the listed impairment in order to be found disabled thereunder.as the commissioner has pointed out,recent amendments to the regulations further clarify that a claimant will meet the listing for mental retardation only i f the claimant impairment satisfies the diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph and any one of the four sets of criteria 
foster halter,cir citations omitted 
there is substantial evidence to support the alj conclusion that randall does not meet the listing for mental retardation.first,the evidence does not demonstrate or support onset of the significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning before age moreover,the evidence does not demonstrate or support onset of deficits in adaptive functioning before age.
in wall astrue,cir,the court adhered to the same construction,concluding that t o come within the scope of listing,a claimant must satisfy that listing diagnostic definition.id.at.part of listing diagnostic definition is the requirement that a claimant exhibit subaverage general intellectual functioning before the age of.id the seventh circuit position was once uncertain but it now utilizes the construction that we adopt in novy astrue,cir,it required that its listing c claimant satisfy the description definition of mental retardation in addition to the severity criteria.an iq between and is insufficient,even with the presence of some impairment,to establish disability per se on grounds of mental retardation.id.rather,t he key term in the introductory paragraph of section of the regulation,so far as bears on this case,is deficits in adaptive functioning.id.at.
the eighth circuit opinions are best read as agreeing.in maresh barnhart,cir,the only eighth circuit decision to confront the text of a,the commissioner argued that the introductory paragraph of the listing requires that the deficits in adaptive functioning are initially manifested before age,and the court agree d with the commissioner that the requirements in the introductory paragraph are mandatory.id.at.although maresh did not use explicit language to embrace the imposition of the diagnostic paragraph substantive requirement,it seems to have done so impliedly when it said that this court disagrees with the commissioner that the listing introductory paragraph requires a formal diagnosis of mental retardation.id.had the maresh court intended to impose only the temporal aspect of the diagnostic description,the distinction between diagnosed and undiagnosed cases of mental retardation would have been unnecessary 
unpublished opinions from three other circuits support our construction.even before the amendments,the eleventh circuit had held that the diagnostic description imposed more than just temporal requirements to be considered for disability benefits under section,a claimant must at least have significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning have deficits in adaptive behavior and have manifested deficits in adaptive behavior before age.crayton callahan,cir.although crayton did not explicitly distinguish these requirements from the severity criteria,later unpublished decisions did 
in morales comm r of soc.cir,the court rejected a claim made under c by citing the diagnostic description,not the severity criteria in brooks barnhart.cir,the court relied on the significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning requirement to deny a listing c claim 
since the revision to listing,some circuits have continued to require only the severity criteria and temporal requirement but not the diagnostic description separate substantive requirement without discussion of the textual change.see grant astrue,cir bailey apfel,cir dictum from another circuit does so as well 
no matter what listing required before,the clarifying revisions best evince the relationship between the diagnostic description components and the severity criteria.accordingly,we join those circuits that pay close attention to that change.
having determined that the alj applied the proper legal standard,we address the question whether substantial evidence supports her factual findings.substantial evidence is more than a scintilla,less than a preponderance,and is such that a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a conclusion.randall sullivan,cir citing richardson perales,d.we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the commissioner.audler astrue,cir.
the alj,by relying on various kinds of evidence,including the buxton and klusman reports,in particular,concluded that randall failed to exhibit significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning.after reviewing the record that was before the alj,we agree that her ultimate finding as to randall adaptive functioning was backed by substantial evidence.in particular,the alj was entitled to rely on the clinical psychologists specific analysis of randall physical and mental capabilities,including the determination that she suffered from only adaptive retardation and that her impairments would not preclude gainful competitive employment.see,domingue barnhart,cir.
randall does not contend otherwise.instead,her only argument is that we can not affirm the alj decision on this ground randall failure to satisfy the diagnostic description adaptive functioning element,because the district court rejected this argument and affirmed on another ground randall failure to establish c additional and significant limitation of function.it is well established,however,that even though the case comes to us on appeal from a final judgment of the district court,we focus our review not on the district court decisional process but on the alj.see,ward celebrezze,cir.the district court rejection of the argument does not prevent the commissioner from reasserting that argument here and prevailing thereby 
in summary,randall has failed to demonstrate that the alj applied an erroneous legal standard or to show that the alj conclusions are supported by less than substantial evidence.as a result,there is no reversible error in the alj denial of randall claim.the judgment is affirmed.
