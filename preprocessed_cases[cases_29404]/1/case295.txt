the sierra club,along with two other conservation groups for simplicity we refer only to the sierra club,challenges the forest service approval of two forest resource management projects in the white mountain national forest forest or wmnf the than forest resource management project than project and the batchelder brook vegetation management project batchelder project.the district court decision,upholding the forest service,provides detailed background,sierra club wagner,d,which we summarize here.
the forest service,an agency of the department of agriculture,is responsible for national forests.the national forest management act nfma,et,provides for management of national forests at two levels,the programmatic or plan level and the project level where the forest service implements the broader programs and goals laid out in the forest plan.ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.
all projects within a forest must comply with the overall plan for that forest,i,which is revised periodically.id.f.the governing white mountain national forest land and resource management plan was most recently revised and adopted in september the plan.the plan was revised pursuant to the forest service regulations the rules,which could still permissibly be considered for plan revisions when the new plan was adopted.see b.
the white mountain national forest covers almost acres in northern new hampshire and western maine.the governing plan promotes multiple uses for the forest including recreation,timber harvesting,and preservation of wildlife and wilderness,as required by the nfma.a,e.the plan classifies approximately acres in the wmnf as appropriate for harvesting timber,but currently harvesting is allowed only on roughly acres annually,a tiny fraction of the forest.
during the plan revision process,the land was inventoried to determine whether it qualified as roadless.a.in the eastern united states,to qualify as roadless,land must meet certain environmental standards including very few constructed roads or recent timber harvesting areas,totaling acres,met these criteria and comprise inventoried roadless areas ira,which can be designated by congress as wilderness areas,thereby affording the lands special protection,b.the forest service recommended that congress so designate acres over and above the acres previously protected.
after adoption of the plan,the forest service evaluated various management areas within the forest to determine what new projects were required to achieve the plan goals.it determined,for the areas encompassing the than and batchelder projects,that more diverse habitats,including new vegetation in younger age classes,were needed and that it would be beneficial to harvest some mature trees to create room for younger trees creating what is known as early successional habitat.
ultimately the forest service proposed to allow timber harvesting of approximately acres in the than project,creating up to acres of early successional habitat.some existing roads would receive maintenance or reconstruction,and a foot section of new road was planned.part of this project would affect the wild river inventoried roadless area,including acres of timber harvesting in that area.
the other proposed action,the batchelder project,involved harvesting on acres,including acres within the south carr mountain inventoried roadless area.the project requires no new road construction,but does authorize maintenance on approximately three miles of road,mile of which is located in the south carr mountain ira.
the national environmental policy act nepa,et,obligates agencies such as the forest service to evaluate the environmental impacts of its proposed actions.dubois dep t of agriculture,cir,cert.denied sub.nom.loon mtn.recreation dubois,d.to comply with nepa,the forest service was first required to determine whether either the than or the batchelder project would have a significant environmental impact.save our heritage,cir.
a detailed environmental impact statement eis is required whenever proposed actions will significantly affect the quality of the human environment,dubois,at.if uncertain about impact,the agency may start with a less detailed environmental assessment ea.if the ea finds a significant impact,a full eis must be prepared if not,the agency makes a finding of no significant impact fonsi,which exhausts its obligation under nepa.id.
the forest service prepared an eis in connection with the plan revision and it was also required to prepare either an eis or ea for both the than and batchelder projects.see also blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir,cert.denied,d.under the plan,specific projects environmental analyses may incorporate by reference tier information that is in the plan eis,so an ea need not start from scratch.
the forest service prepared an initial ea for the than project in may but,after an administrative appeal,issued in november a revised ea for public comment.after receiving comments and after an injunction deferred the operation of new forest service rules relied on in the november draft,the forest service revised the ea and issued the final than ea in april.
despite certain possible adverse effects of the than project on the wild river inventoried roadless sediment inputs to streams,some soil disturbance,and effects on stream forest service concluded that the project would 
not significantly alter the character of the area or the qualities which qualified it for inclusion in the inventory because the harvests are of limited intensity and minimal road systems will be used and that there would be no lasting or significant effect on the roadless character of the area.
it issued a fonsi and thereafter denied the sierra club administrative appeal.
as for the batchelder project,an initial ea draft was withdrawn when the initial than ea was set aside a revised ea was issued in december for public comment followed by a final ea and a revised decision notice with a fonsi in may.the fonsi conceded certain potential adverse effects on wildlife and possible sedimentation of streams,but concluded that no significant impact would result on the south carr mountain area roadless or wilderness characteristics.a sierra club administrative appeal was thereafter denied.
in august,the sierra club filed a complaint in the district court challenging the than project.it amended its complaint to incorporate claims regarding the batchelder brook project in october.on for summary judgment,the district court upheld the forest service actions,granted the forest service motion and denied sierra club.we denied a stay pending appeal but expedited the case.
on appeal,sierra club claims error by the forest service in several respects.we review questions of law de novo,worldnet telecommunications,puerto rico telephone,cir,but are deferential to the agency in its interpretation of its own rules,chevron,natural res.def.council,d,and in judgment calls as to the likely impact of proposed actions.associated fisheries of maine,daley,cir.the latter,reflected in the fonsi findings,are to be upheld unless arbitrary and capricious.marsh oregon natural res.council,d see also a.
sierra club argues first that the forest service erred by applying the best available science standard found in the forest service rules,adopted in,see a,to its evaluation of the than and batchelder brook projects,rather than a set of rules adopted in.one might think from the name that best available science is an unexceptionable standard,but according to sierra club,the rules provided a set of precise tests for evaluating a project impact on species that are more rigorous and were intentionally weakened by the rules.
its brief provides a short description of the difference and,as the characterization is not denied by the forest service brief,we will assume it to be true.see forest watch forest,cir.however,sierra club brief fails to explain whether or how the allegedly more rigorous standards of the rules would likely have altered the forest service ultimate evaluation of the two projects.this may not derail the argument but it reduces one enthusiasm for it.
in all events,sierra club contends that the rules apply in this case,and understanding the argument requires a brief excursion.when the new nfma rules were announced,their transition provision deferred many of the new rules until november a date thereafter extended but the provision said that effective immediately the forest service must consider the best available science in implementing current plan s.a.the parties take this language to supercede the allegedly more stringent rules on species evaluation,but disagree as to whether the transition provision covers the two projects in issue here.
sierra club argues that the plain language of the transition provision applies only to forest plans that were current when the transition provision was adopted in.see utah environmental congress troyer,cir.and,the argument goes,the plan for the forest which had been implemented when the two projects were approved was not current in.the forest service counters that sierra club waived this argument because it was not presented to the district court.
ordinarily,arguments not raised in the district court can not be raised for the first time on appeal,boston celtics.shaw,cir.sierra club agrees that it did not raise its current plan argument in the district court but says that it did there oppose the best available science standard on other grounds and this is enough to allow us to consider its new legal theory in support of the same result.this is a misunderstanding of the requirements for preserving issues for review.
we can affirm a judgment on a legal ground not relied upon in the district court,plymouth sav.bank,cir after all,why send the case back if the result was it is altogether different to reverse a judgment on a ground never raised in the lower court.see in re boston reg l med,cir.we may ourselves choose to consider newly minted arguments from the parties,or devise them ourselves,but this is not an entitlement of the parties see,united states la guardia,cir.
in sum,the sierra club has forfeited the argument,and we decline to consider it.the rules have been enjoined but to return to the rules,instead of the transition provision,is not appealing where,as here,sierra club has not troubled to explain why the outcome would change delay aside if the rules were applied.nor do we find the forest service reading of the transition provision patently wrong,a circumstance that might help persuade us to excuse the forfeiture.
utah envtl.cong.troyer,cir,agrees with sierra club belated,probably prompted troyer is quite possibly wrong in thinking the word current can yield only one meaning.and troyer is at odds with a interpretive rule issued by the forest service,ordinarily entitled to substantial deference where the subject is the agency interpretation of its own regulations.wind,daley,cir.
next,sierra club contends that the than project ea was based on the management indicator species provision of the rules,f,which were enjoined nationwide in march.see citizens for better forestry,d at.admittedly,the final than project ea says once that t he analysis of mis the species analysis was undertaken in the context of f which is only found in the enjoined rules.below,the forest service disclaimed this reference as a typographical the district court agreed.
it appears that when the revised draft than ea was published for public comment in,the rules had been adopted as a rewriting of the long deferred rules.once the injunction against the rules issued,the forest service removed almost all of the references in the draft to the rules and issued the final than project ea shortly thereafter,relying instead on the transition provision best available science standard.but,says the forest service,the one reference to the rules was missed in the.
this is hardly the post hoc rationalization claimed by sierra club,see nrdc envtl.prot.agency,cir,since the agency itself identified the typographical error as such in denying sierra club administrative appeal and the explanation is therefore part of the administrative record.nor does sierra club provide any reason to doubt the forest service explanation.so the citation may fairly be treated as a typographical error but this is not automatically dispositive.
had the revised draft than ea relied on the rules in any way critical to the outcome,sierra club might well have an of missed the than project ea could not be saved by an overnight mechanical deletion of specific references.but whatever weakening attended the rules,sierra club has not shown that those rules were pertinently less demanding than the rule best available science standard.instead,the distinctions it draws are between the rules and the rules,which is not the relevant comparison.
sierra club also contends that because the rules were enjoined by a district court,the rules went back into effect.had we in fact found that the rules did not apply,this argument would have merit.see action on smoking health,at holding that where one agency rule is invalidated the previous rule in force applies.however,because we hold the best available science standard applied,that portion of the rules went back into effect when the rules were enjoined.
sierra club next says that the eas were inconsistent in identifying which rules governed and did not explicitly use the best available science standard on which the forest service now relies.sierra club argument rests heavily on the second circuit opinion in forest watch forest service,cir,which held that forest service failure to consider or mention the best available science standard in implementing two projects amounted to conduct that was arbitrary and capricious.
in fact,the batchelder ea did refer to the best available science standard,the forest service says that the than ea complied with it in substance and the fonsis for the projects state the forest service relied on the best available science all consistent with the forest service view of the transition provision.by contrast,in forest watch,the eas and the fonsis made no reference to best available science and,more significant,there were repeated citations to the rules.forest watch,at.
on top of all this,it is not clear why references to best available science matter unlike forest watch,there is no indication here that the forest service invoked the rules,allegedly misapplied them and is now claiming that it used the newer standard instead.of course,sierra club could point us to some specific substantive dispute and then argue the science relied upon by the agency was not the best.but sierra club identifies no such controversy in this case.
sierra club next argues that even if the rules did not apply to the than and batchelder projects by their own force,they apply because the forest service chose to revise the forest plan so as to incorporate the rules for future projects.the forest service agrees that the conclusion would follow if the premise were correct,see troyer,at but it denies that the plan adopted the rules as requirements for subsequent projects like than and batchelder.
the district court found that the plan did not specifically incorporate the rules and so they did not apply under an adoption theory to the than and batchelder brook projects.wagner,at.the plan does refer to the rules on several different occasions,notably several references to mis monitoring.but the plan does not say that the rules govern plan projects in fact,it states that t he regulations do not require mis monitoring on every project.
in addition to its wrong rules arguments,sierra club objects to the forest service substantive finding that the than and batchelder projects would have no significant impact on the environment.this is an argument that one might think could have promise because the two projects are not trivial and the forest service itself conceded that there would be some negative effects.but sierra club own arguments do not seriously undermine the fonsi findings.
a substantive attack on an impact assessment is not easy.the council on environmental quality ceq and case law standards for significance are perhaps inevitably general,and courts have good reason to take seriously the deference due to the agency in technical and scientific mat
