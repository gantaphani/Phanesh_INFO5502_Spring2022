kwasi acquaah,a native and citizen of ghana,appeals a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying two separate motions to reopen his removal proceedings.an immigration judge ij ordered acquaah removed in absentia when acquaah failed to appear at his hearing due to a mistaken belief as to the proper hearing date.for the reasons set forth below,we deny acquaah petition for review.
background 
factual background 
acquaah was admitted to the united states in january as a nonimmigrant student to attend the university of arkansas.when acquaah stopped attending school the following year,the immigration and naturalization service issued him a notice to appear.the notice informed acquaah that he was subject to removal from the country for failing to comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status.following various delays not relevant to this appeal,the ij sent acquaah notice that he was scheduled for a telephonic hearing on july.
acquaah failed to appear at the office of his attorney,robert klock,to participate in the scheduled telephonic hearing and,as a result,the ij ordered that acquaah be removed from the country in absentia.although acquaah acknowledges that he received proper notice that the hearing was to be held on july,he mistakenly believed it to be on july.to support his claim,acquaah produced evidence that he had requested time off from work on july so that he could participate in the hearing.
acquaah did not discover that he had missed his court appearance until he went to klock office on july.according to acquaah,klock stated that he would promptly file a motion to reopen acquaah removal proceedings and that the motion would likely be granted.acquaah represents that he agreed to pay klock to file the motion,and that he contacted klock multiple times in the following months to inquire as to the status of his case.unbeknownst to acquaah,klock never filed the motion.in response to acquaah inquiries,klock purportedly remarked that no new hearing date had been set and that the immigration court was very slow in processing cases.
almost two and a half years later,in december,immigration and customs enforcement agents took acquaah into custody.ginger tully,acquaah fianc√©e,then contacted klock,who accepted a down payment in exchange for his assistance in getting acquaah out of prison and for filing a motion to reopen the removal proceedings.unhappy with klock representation,tully gave klock notice on january,that she had hired another attorney to handle acquaah case.that attorney,laura ferner,sent klock notice on january,that she intended to file a motion to reopen on acquaah behalf and assert that klock had rendered ineffective assistance as acquaah counsel.
procedural background 
in january,two motions to reopen were filed on acquaah behalf.klock,despite receiving notice that acquaah had new counsel,filed the first motion on january.the motion detailed acquaah mistaken belief as to the hearing date and noted his family connections to the united states.shortly thereafter,on january,ferner filed the second motion to reopen,asserting that klock had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by misrepresenting his intent to file a motion to reopen shortly after the july,hearing date.
the ij denied both motions,finding,among other things,that acquaah mistake as to the correct date of the hearing was not an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening,and that the motions to reopen were now.on appeal,the bia agreed with the ij conclusion that acquaah had failed to demonstrate that any exceptional circumstance existed that prevented him from participating in the hearing.the bia further reasoned that,in the absence of such a circumstance,it need not address whether klock assistance as acquaah counsel was ineffective.this timely appeal,filed by acquaah pro se,followed.

discussion 
failure to appear at a removal proceeding carries the severe consequence of deportation.see b a stating that an alien who receives notice of a removal proceeding but fails to appear shall be ordered removed in absentia if the government establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.an order of removal due to an alien failure to appear may be rescinded,however,upon a motion to reopen filed within days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.b c i.such exceptional circumstances include battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien,serious illness of the alien,or serious illness or death of the spouse,child,or parent of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances,and they must be beyond the control of the alien.e.an ij considers the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that exceptional circumstances exist.denko ins,cir.
as an initial matter,we note that both motions to reopen were filed well outside the time limit prescribed by statute.but acquaah argues that this time bar should be equitably tolled in light of klock ineffective assistance.this court has indeed applied the doctrine of equitable tolling to motions to reopen removal proceedings.see barry mukasey,cir recognizing the doctrine,but declining to apply it where the petitioner neglected to contact her attorney for one year following the bia dismissal of her appeal,and thereby failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing her rights.here we agree with the bia that even if acquaah motions were found to be timely,he would still not be entitled to relief because,as explained below,he has not shown that he missed his hearing due to exceptional circumstances.
acquaah does not dispute that he had proper notice of the hearing date and does not allege that he was ill or in custody at the time of his hearing.rather,he asserts that had klock promptly filed a motion to klock allegedly told acquaah he had motion would have been granted.the key issue on appeal is thus whether acquaah good faith but mistaken belief as to the correct date qualifies as an exceptional circumstance.although this court has not yet determined what constitutes an exceptional circumstance where an alien has received proper notice of a removal hearing,other circuit courts have set a high threshold and are disinclined to view misunderstandings and communication errors as being sufficient.see,gonzales,cir determining that an attorney poor calendaring and failure to personally remind the alien of her hearing date was not an exceptional circumstance uriostegui gonzales,cir holding that an alien misunderstanding as to the correct month of her hearing as told to her in spanish,her native language,by an interpreter was not an exceptional circumstance thomas ins,cir affirming the denial of motion to reopen where an alien appeared ten minutes late at a hearing because he and his attorney had crossed signals about where to meet but see barseghian ins,cir holding,in a unpublished opinion without supporting caselaw,that exceptional circumstances existed where an alien misunderstood a court interpreter to say that his hearing date was a week later than the date of the actual hearing.
notwithstanding this general trend,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit found exceptional circumstances to exist in a situation with certain similarities to acquaah.in kaweesa gonzales,cir,kaweesa,an alien representing herself pro se,inadvertently mistook her may,hearing date for may.id.at.l
