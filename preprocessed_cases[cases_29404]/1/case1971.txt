this suit stems from a challenge to a dredge and fill permit issued by corps defendants pursuant to section of the clean water act,title section by the city of olmsted,a municipality,and a private citizen who opposed the city of cleveland expansion of hopkins international airport.the expansion project called for a new runway,which required the filling and culverting of linear feet of abram creek,the filling of linear feet of abram creek tributaries,and the filling of acres of wetlands.joint appendix at the clean water act not only requires a permit from corps defendants,it also requires a certification from the state involved,in this case,ohio,that the state environmental requirements have been met.the city of cleveland had,therefore,applied to the ohio environmental protection agency oepa for state certification as required by title section.in other litigation,the city of cleveland was dealing with the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the oepa on matters relating to permits for from the existing airport as well as other issues related to the expansion.
background 
before beginning any project that requires a discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters of the united states a party must apply for a permit.this permit is termed a dredge and fill permit.in order to obtain a dredge and fill permit under section,an applicant must first comply with section a 
any applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity including,but not limited to,the construction or operation of facilities,which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters,shall provide the licensing or permitting agency a certification from the state,in which the discharge will comply with certain provisions of this title if the state fails or refuses to act on a request for certification within a reasonable period of time which shall not exceed one year after receipt of such request,the certification requirements of this subsection shall be waived with respect to such federal application.no license or permit shall be granted until the certification required by this section has been obtained or has been waived as provided in the proceeding sentence 
the relevant regulation governing procedures to be taken by the corps defendants in processing permits requiring a section permit provides,in part,that 
n o permit will be granted until required certification has been obtained or has been waived.a waiver may be explicit,or will be deemed to occur if the certifying agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification within sixty days after receipt of such a request unless the district engineer determines a shorter or longer period is reasonable for the state to act 
in accordance with its obligations under federal environmental statutes and regulations,the city of cleveland sought oepa certification of its project pursuant to section.after issuing comments that resulted in the city of cleveland filing a revised section application,the oepa held hearings and expressed further concerns related to the environmental impact of the expansion on abram creek.eventually the oepa expressly waived its authority to act on the section application.
corps defendants then conducted a review of the project.this review requires a balancing of a number of economic and environmental factors,town of norfolk united states army corps of eng,cir,including evaluating the probable impacts of the proposed activity and its intended use on the public interest,a.during its review,corps defendants weigh t he benefits which reasonably may be expected to accrue against the project reasonably foreseeable detriments.id.corps defendants issued the section permit to the city of cleveland the permit required that the city of cleveland undertake certain mitigating activities to offset the environmental degradation of the project.the district court described the mitigation activities as follows

plaintiffs filed suit against the usepa,the then head of the usepa,the regional administrator for region five of the usepa,the corps defendants,the city of cleveland,the mayor of the city of cleveland,and ten doe defendants.their complaint alleged various violations of the clean water act,asked the district court to set aside the section permit,requested an injunction and declaratory relief,and sought an order compelling compliance with section certification.in particular,plaintiffs complained that corps defendants improperly relied on the oepa waiver of the section certification.plaintiffs also argued that the type and quantity of mitigation proposed by the city of cleveland was inadequate and that the proposed permit violated various federal and state regulations,including the federal antidegradation rule.plaintiffs dismissed the city of cleveland and the mayor of the city of cleveland in their first amended complaint.
the district court,in two different opinions,dismissed portions of plaintiffs complaint and granted judgment on the administrative record to corps defendants on the remainder of the complaint.in its first opinion,after dismissing defendant usepa and all parties related to usepa for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court determined that corps defendants were entitled to rely on the waiver by oepa with respect to compliance with ohio requirements,or in the alternative,that plaintiffs failed to support a claim that corps defendants acted arbitrarily,capriciously,or contrary to law in relying on the waiver.
in its second opinion,the district court granted judgment on the administrative record to all remaining defendants.the district court determined that,or as plaintiffs term it,the federal antidegradation rule,applies to states only.as such,the district court held that the federal antidegradation rule was inapplicable to corps defendants.second,the district court found that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious for corps defendants to use compensatory mitigation rather than avoidance mitigation and mitigation by minimization of impacts on existing uses.the district court also found that corps defendants did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner when they concluded that the proposed project would not sufficiently degrade the waters of the united states,as prohibited by c.additionally,the district court found that corps defendants did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when they determined that granting the permit would not violate state water quality standards under b.finally,the district court refused to expand the record and consider the water quality standards handbook handbook because it determined that the handbook would not aid it in reaching a decision.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court rulings in several important respects.first,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in failing to apply a the federal antidegradation rule in granting judgment on the administrative record,because a mandates that existing uses in the stream must be maintained and protected.second,plaintiffs dispute the district court interpretation of federal regulations and the memorandum of agreement between the department of the army and the environmental protection agency entitled the determination of mitigation under the clean water act section b guidelines moa and argue that it was improper for corps defendants to use compensatory mitigation rather than avoidance and minimization of impacts on existing uses mitigation.third,plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of a portion of their complaint,arguing that corps defendants could not rely on oepa waiver.they also argue that the
