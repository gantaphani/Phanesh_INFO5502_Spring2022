the commissioner of internal revenue issued deficiency notices requiring the taxpayers,three privately held agencies and the family that owns and operates them,to pay over million in excise taxes under.the commissioner based the deficiency notices on an internal valuation of assets and liabilities transferred when the agencies converted from exempt to nonexempt status,finding that the taxpayers received a net excess benefit in the amount of million.the taxpayers challenged the deficiency notices in the tax court.during a audit and nearly two years of litigation,the commissioner insisted that the deficiency notices and underlying valuations were correct.at the trial before the tax court,the commissioner for the first time conceded that the deficiency notices were both excessive and erroneous.the tax court recognized that the commissioner deficiency notices were wrong.the tax court also found that the valuation expert the commissioner presented at only support the commissioner presented for imposing excise committed significant errors in his analysis.the tax court nonetheless affirmed the commissioner decision to impose excise taxes,finding that the fair market value of the assets transferred from the exempt entities to the newly created nonexempt entities exceeded the value of the liabilities and debts assumed as consideration by over million.
in this appeal,the commissioner does not dispute that the deficiency notices were erroneous.the commissioner also concedes that the tax court made a million mistake in its valuation analysis.the commissioner nonetheless insists that the tax court correctly found that the taxpayers received a net excess benefit of over million in the conversion from exempt to nonexempt status and collectively owed in excise taxes under a and b 
the taxpayers contend that the tax court made numerous factual and legal errors in valuing the assets transferred in the conversion from exempt to nonexempt status.we agree.as explained below,the tax court erred as a matter of law in affirming the commissioner decision to impose excise taxes after the commissioner failed to meet his burden of proving that the taxes were correctly assessed erred as a matter of law in selecting the method to value the assets and liabilities transferred and made clearly erroneous fact findings in applying that valuation method.we reverse and render because the record establishes as a matter of law that the taxpayers did not receive any net excess benefit and therefore are not liable for the excise taxes assessed.
background 
in,joyce caracci,an experienced nurse,her husband,victor caracci,and a third person started the health agency,to provide home health care in a geographically large and primarily rural part of mississippi.a year later,joyce and victor caracci and the third individual formed two other agencies,health agency,of forest,mississippi and health agency,of grenada,mississippi.the shareholders,directors,and officers of the entities were caracci family members who also worked for the agencies.
the three entities were nonstock,corporations formed under mississippi law.to comply with the medicare regulations in place when the caraccis began their business,the agencies had to be under the internal revenue code c c.in the,the law changed to permit agencies such as to be formed as nonexempt corporations.
the agencies served the rural poor in a large area in northeast mississippi.the agencies were intended to provide home healthcare as an alternative to what joyce caracci believed from her long professional experience was unacceptable institutional care available from nursing homes and other facilities in the region.a large majority of the patients served depended on medicare and medicaid.it is undisputed that between and percent of income consisted of medicare and medicaid reimbursements.
in,medicare reimbursed providers the lesser of the actual reasonable cost or the customary charge,up to a maximum cost cap.medicare paid retrospectively,sending a periodic interim payment known as a two weeks.agencies also submitted quarterly and annual cost reports,which medicare used to adjust disparities between interim payments made and actual costs reported by reimbursing the provider for any underpayment or requiring the provider to remit any overpayment.under the medicare reimbursement system,agencies like effectively had no ability to realize profits.medicare did not even reimburse all of the costs expended,but only costs it deemed allowable.if submitted a claim for reimbursement that medicare denied,the result for was a negative cash outflow.on average,medicare disallowed percent of submitted annual costs.as a result,the greater the volume of more care provided patients and the more revenue it more money it lost.
generated increased revenue and commensurately increased losses from through.financial statements revealed that the corporations expenses exceeded its revenues every year.not only did sustain repeated net operating losses,its capital deficit increased every year from through.at the end of fiscal year,the combined assets and stated liabilities of the three exempt agencies was a negative million 
to ease this precarious financial situation,required its newly hired employees to forgo pay for the first month of employment.paid this amount only when employees left the company.also underpaid salaries and wages during the year,using bonuses to make up unpaid compensation amounts.also deferred or accrued contributions to employee benefit plans.these efforts to ease difficulties affected all employees,including the caracci family members.
during this period,mississippi was the state in the country in payments per medicare recipient.as noted,during,over percent of the services provided went to medicare beneficiaries.state law required agencies in mississippi to operate under a certificate of need con.in,mississippi imposed a moratorium on the issuance of new cons,which prevented new competitors from entering the industry unless they purchased an existing con.the combined entities had cons in nineteen mississippi counties.the corporations ranked first or second in market share in of the rural mississippi counties they served.was a recognized name in home healthcare in mississippi and enjoyed a strong reputation among the state elderly.in,was the first freestanding agency to be accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations,which required achieving or exceeding certain regulatory standards,including standards regulating the quality of patient care.
during and,a change in the medicare regulations was proposed,under which certain healthcare entities accepting medicare payments would change from the retrospective pip system to a prospective payment system to be known as pps.under pps,healthcare providers would file a claim for each service rendered and then wait for it to be processed and paid concerned about the impact of this system on already fragile cash flow,the caraccis consulted an attorney,thomas kirkland.he recommended converting into corporations,which medicare regulations had permitted since the.the conversion to nonexempt status would allow to borrow money that lenders were unwilling to provide to exempt entities.kirkland law firm had represented many agencies in mississippi,and kirkland was a recognized expert in the legal issues relating to such agencies.he advised all his clients to convert to nonexempt status.most of kirkland clients followed his advice.the primary form of conversion used was a transfer of assets from the old exempt corporations to the newly formed nonexempt corporations,in exchange for assuming the debts and liabilities of the exempt corporations.
took a careful and conscientious approach to the conversion.not only did consult with an attorney knowledgeable in the area,it also retained a tax attorney whose accounting firm obtained two contemporaneous appraisals of assets and liabilities.these appraisals showed that liabilities exceeded the value of its tangible and intangible assets.the appraisals specifically showed that the value of the intangible the not result in a positive fair market value because the assets had been consistently unprofitable.these appraisals were consistent with the caraccis conclusion that unless they did something to provide more cash and capital,they would likely not be able to continue to operate.
before changed from to nonexempt status,it investigated other alternatives to meet its need for improved cash flow and access to capital in light of the anticipated change from a pip to a pps medicare reimbursement system.looked for a hospital in its service area that could purchase the agencies,to provide capital and additional patient referrals.the search proved fruitless.discovered that the potential purchasers were uninterested the most likely candidate had acquired a agency the prior year.with no prospective or potential buyer,decided to convert to nonexempt status.
on july,board of directors authorized the conversion of the entities into nonexempt corporations.health agency,was converted to health agency of jackson,health agency,of forrest,mississippi was converted to health agency of carthage,and health agency,of grenada,mississippi was converted to health agency of greenwood.the exempt corporations transferred their tangible and intangible assets to the corporations in exchange for the assumption of,and indemnification against,liabilities.the contemporaneous appraisals performed in support of the conversion showed that the consideration for the agreement to assume the debts and the value of the assets,which had been unprofitable for the previous five years.it is undisputed that after the conversion,the entities continued to operate as before,providing the same services to the same patients in the same manner,subject to the same medicare limits on profit.
in,after an extended audit period,the commissioner issued deficiency notices to the caracci family and the agencies.the commissioner determined that the value of the assets transferred to the nonexempt corporations exceeded the value of the liabilities and debts assumed by approximately million.based solely on that valuation analysis,the commissioner concluded that the transfer provided an excess benefit to the newly created nonexempt corporations and the caracci family,in violation of,which imposes a percent and a percent penalty in the form of excise taxes on excess benefit transactions.the deficiency notices asserted that the taxpayers owed excise taxes totaling.
the commissioner based the deficiency notices on a brief internal memorandum.this memorandum stated this intermediate determination of value should not be considered final until issuance of the final economic report.the deficiency notices were not based on a final economic report,instead using the figures from the intermediate determination of value in stating that the conversion from exempt to nonexempt status resulted in a net excess benefit of and triggered excise taxes and penalties of over million.and the caracci family filed timely petitions in the united states tax court challenging the determination of their tax liabilities.
in the tax court,the taxpayers pointed out that one problem with the deficiency notices was that the valuations made no adjustment for the liabilities that the nonexempt corporations assumed as consideration for acquiring the assets from the exempt corporations.the taxpayers moved for partial summary judgment based on this problem in the deficiency notices.the commissioner responded that the notices were correct,filing affidavits in opposition to the partial summary judgment motion swearing to the validity of the deficiency amounts and the consequent excise tax amounts.it was not until the trial before the tax court that the commissioner acknowledged that the deficiency notices were wrong.on,the commissioner own expert witness admitted that the notices were excessive,incorrect,and erroneous.
on may,the tax court affirmed the finding that the conversion resulted in a net excess benefit triggering excise taxes and penalties,but reduced the amount of the benefit and the resulting amounts that and the caracci family owed.the tax court found that the value of the exempt former entities debts and liabilities that the newly formed nonexempt entities assumed was million.the parties do not challenge this valuation on appeal.the tax court found that the newly formed nonexempt entities received assets from the exempt former entities worth million,exceeding the value of the assumed liabilities by million.in so finding,the tax court rejected both the million figure the commissioner had asserted as the amount of the net excess benefit in its deficiency notices and also rejected the amount that the commissioner expert presented.
both and the commissioner presented detailed expert testimony on the fair market value of tangible and intangible assets at the time of the conversion from nonexempt to exempt status.the expert witnesses for both the taxpayers and the commissioner agreed that traditional valuation methodology uses three approaches income cost and market.an income approach assigns value based on determining how much money an owner will derive from the business in the future.a cost approach values a business by determining how much it would cost to replace the entity tangible and intangible assets a market approach tries to establish the market value of a company,usually by comparing sales or transfers of similar companies.the experts disagreed on how to value assets and what assumptions should be used.the tax court agreed with neither expert,instead selecting aspects from the commissioner expert to piece together its own valuation result.
expert,allen hahn,is a director at pricewatershouse coopers northeast region corporation valuation consulting group.he has written extensively on valuing agencies.the commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to hire hahn for this case,recognizing his expertise.to prepare his analysis of the conversion,hahn spent eight weeks in mississippi,studying the assets and liabilities transferred in the conversion and analyzing the industry in the area.
the commissioner,unable to retain hahn,hired charles wilhoite.although wilhoite is a certified public accountant and codirector of the portland,oregon office of willamette management associations,a business valuation firm,he had no prior experience with the industry.wilhoite spent only two days in mississippi to study the entities in order to value their assets and liabilities and spent one of those days in a hotel room tracking down lost luggage.lacking detailed or thorough knowledge about the industry in general or in the part of mississippi where operated,and about itself,wilhoite instead relied on his general valuation knowledge and experience and the information learned in the single day he spent interviewing chief financial officer.in short,neither the commissioner nor his expert witness did the work necessary to perform an analysis of the entities throughout the extended audit period or during the tax court litigation 
hahn analysis carefully took into account the economic realities of agencies that depended almost entirely on medicare reimbursements rather than on private payers,lost an average of percent annually on their operating costs,did not offer specialized services that could generate profits,and had a capital deficit.hahn used an adjusted balance sheet method to value the assets,adjusting the values identified on the companies balance sheet to their fair market value equivalent hahn prepared both a base case and a best case scenario,developing a range of fair market values for assets ranging between million and million.hahn specifically valued intangible assets,attributing between million and million to the cons and the workforce.hahn found that the entities total liabilities ranged between million and million,concluding that these liabilities exceeded the value of assets by million to million.
to check this asset valuation,hahn also used a market approach,comparing the transactions to thirteen private transactions involving agencies engaged in by publicly traded companies.hahn cautioned that the market approach was only a secondary indication of value because transactions involving other providers were too dissimilar to the transactions used to effect the conversion from exempt to nonexempt entities to serve as the basis for a valuation.hahn noted that although provided only traditional home healthcare,publicly traded companies often used agencies as part of a broader mix of healthcare businesses.heavy dependence on medicare reimbursements also made it difficult to compare with publicly traded companies offering services to a mix that included a much larger number of private payers and far fewer medicare patients than.the commissioner expert conceded that agencies serving patients can make a profit on those services if they are run well by contrast,healthcare agencies can not make a profit on serving medicare patients.hahn also noted that sales of agencies that provided sophisticated treatments could not be included as comparables because these treatments attracted higher payments and reimbursements than the services provided by.
based on the adjusted balance sheet method and the corroboration provided by the comparable market approach,hahn concluded that the liabilities the nonexempt entities agreed to assume from the nonexempt entities exceeded the value of the assets received by to,resulting in no net excess benefit and therefore no excise tax liability.hahn reached this result without applying a minority stock discount,reasoning that the shares represented interests in a loss corporation and without a discount for lack of marketability concluding that the unattractive healthcare market in mississippi was already incorporated into his adjusted balance sheet valuation.
the commissioner expert,wilhoite,lacked the specific information about the entities necessary to value their assets,particularly the intangible assets.wilhoite assumed that those intangible assets had significant value to potential purchasers,despite history of losses,because several agencies acquired in recent transactions incurred losses just before those agencies were purchased for large amounts wilhoite used and approaches to assign values to all assets in general,without valuing any of assets in particular.
for both the market and income approaches,wilhoite determined the market value of invested capital mvic,which represents the market value of ownership equity plus debt invested in a company.the mvic is commonly used in valuing private companies because it minimizes differences in capital structure between private and public corporations wilhoite assumed that this method could be applied to value the entities assets,despite the fact that method is designed to value a company invested capital,not its assets,and the agencies did not have invested capital.
wilhoite calculated the mvic for the entities by extracting a revenue pricing multiple rpm,a percentage that when multiplied by a company annual revenues yield that company mvic.to derive the rpm,wilhoite identified two categories of comparable entities,one made up of publicly traded companies and one made up of merged or acquired entities.wilhoite found the median rpm of publicly traded companies operating agencies to be.because had been nonprofit,wilhoite reduced that rpm by percent to reflect a lower return on invested capital.when multiplied by revenues,this rpm led to an mvic of.wilhoite ran the same analysis comparing merged and acquired companies and arrived at an rpm of and an mvic of.
wilhoite income approach calculated the value to a potential buyer that wilhoite assumed would result from the buyer ability to use a strategy wilhoite determined that the annual value of,based on a historical gap of percent,was.wilhoite applied a capitalization rate of percent and calculated as the present value of to a potential buyer.
wilhoite also assigned a weighted percentage to each of the three values he derived.he assigned the largest weight to the income approach,followed by the publicly traded comparables market approach,followed by the merged or acquired comparables market approach,yielding a mvic of.wilhoite then subtracted the amount of deficit that a buyer of the companies would have to pay for current liabilities and added the value of those current liabilities.based on the accounting rule that the asset side and liability side of a company balance sheet must be equal,wilhoite reasoned that mvic liabilities and owners equity plus current liabilities would be equivalent to the value of the assets.wilhoite valued assets transferred from the nonexempt to the exempt entities at,over million more than the of liabilities assumed by the nonexempt entities.
the tax court rejected wilhoite income method that wilhoite viewed as deserving the greatest that the value of the strategy included too many imponderables.the commissioner does not challenge this rejection of its expert method.the tax court adopted only one part of one of wilhoite approaches,making adjustments and filling in gaps to reach its own conclusion as to value.
the tax court adopted the part of the approach that used publicly traded companies as comparables.in so doing,however,the tax court recognized that even the publicly traded companies wilhoite used as comparables were in fact not comparable to the entities.operated in a much less advantageous market than many of the publicly traded companies,was much more heavily dependent on medicare reimbursements than these companies,and did not offer the sophisticated and profitable therapies that many of these companies did elsewhere in the opinion,the tax court recognized these important aspects of operations and finances that distinguished it from the publicly traded companies wilhoite used as comparables.for example,the tax court recognized dependency on medicare reimbursements for over percent of its revenues and the fact that medicare disallowed percent of costs annually.but the tax court did not discuss these aspects in analyzing whether the publicly traded healthcare companies were sufficiently similar to to be comparables,as wilhoite valuation method required.instead,although the tax court recognized that the publicly traded companies wilhoite selected as comparables were different from in critical aspects,the tax court accounted for the differences by simply reducing the multiplier from to percent.the tax court did not explain the basis for reducing the multiplier by the amount it selected or why that reduction accounted for the differences between the publicly held companies and the agencies.
the tax court rejected hahn primary adjusted balance sheet valuation analysis and his secondary analysis.in rejecting hahn secondary analysis,the tax court failed to recognize that hahn used it only to confirm his primary valuation method,because hahn himself recognized that the publicly traded healthcare companies were not sufficiently similar to the entities to serve as comparables in a valuation analysis.the tax court also rejected hahn adjusted balance sheet approach,believing that it undervalued intangible assets.the tax court justified its reliance on part of wilhoite analysis and its rejection of all of hahn analysis and the fact that only hahn had detailed information about how operations and finances worked under the complex medicare its belief that had the potential to generate income and thus demonstrate a substantial fair market value.the primary reason the tax court gave for this belief was that in,the entities had generated nearly million in revenues but had reported an operating loss that year,in part because the entities deducted depreciation for their automobile fleet and in part because they had declared employee bonuses,without which they would have reported nontaxable income of approximately,or,in other words,more than enough to eliminate the accumulated deficit in net asset value.on appeal,the commissioner concedes that the tax court was simply wrong in this statement,but insists that the error is harmless.
having rejected most of wilhoite analysis and all of hahn,the tax court put together its own valuation analysis with the little that remained of wilhoite methodology.using an rpm of its own modification of wilhoite rpm of the tax court calculated an mvic of million.the court then adjusted that amount by excluding four weeks of employees deferred compensation from the current liabilities that wilhoite had added to the mvic and increasing current liabilities to reflect a reserve for disallowed medicare claims adding current liabilities to the adjusted mvic,the tax court arrived at a fair market value of for the tangible and intangible assets that the new nonexempt entities received from the old exempt entities.the court subtracted the liabilities the old exempt companies transferred to the newly created nonexempt entities the fair market value of the assets,leaving an excess of.because transferred assets far exceeded the consideration paid by the nonexempt assumed debts and tax court found a violation of and ordered the taxpayers to pay in excise taxes.this appeal followed.

a.the legal standards 
section of the internal revenue code prohibits certain acts of between private foundations and company insiders.the statute imposes a percent tax on excess benefit transactions,defined as follows 
e xcess benefit transaction means any transaction in which an economic benefit is provided by an applicable organization directly or indirectly to or for the use of any disqualified person if the value of the economic benefit provided exceeds the value of the consideration including the performance of services received for providing such benefit.

the conclusion is inescapable from the description of the background of this case.there are so many legal and factual of which the commissioner this case from the outset that reversal must result.
the commissioner began the cascade of errors by issuing deficiency notices based on a brief,intermediate internal analysis.that analysis stated on its face that it was intermediate and that a final economic study had to be performed.ignoring this disclaimer,the commissioner issued deficiency notices asserting excise tax penalties against the entities and the caracci family totaling plus interest and income tax deficiencies and penalties totaling plus interest,and retroactively revoking the exempt status of the exempt agencies.internal irs documents reveal that the irs issued the notices on the basis of an intermediate rather than final economic study to prevent the caraccis from correcting what the irs viewed as prohibited transactions,which would have reduced the intermediate sanction penalties.the second reason the irs issued these premature notices was its concern over the statute of limitations.the irs blamed the taxpayers for that problem.one of the irs employees working on this case stated in an affidavit that the agency asked the taxpayers to consent to extend the limitations period and informed the taxpayers that if the statute was not extended,statutory notices would be issued based on the best available information that the irs had at that point,despite the fact that the irs economist needed more time to analyze the case.even more disturbing,the record reveals that despite recognizing the tentative and incomplete nature of the analysis used as the basis for the deficiency notices,the commissioner defended the correctness of those notices for several years into this litigation and only conceded that the notices overstated the commissioner tax claim when the trial began in the tax court.in issuing the deficiency notices,the commissioner did not adjust the analysis by the amount of liabilities the taxpayers assumed.as a result,the deficiency notices greatly overstated the excise tax liability.despite this error,the commissioner insisted throughout a audit and nearly two years of litigation that the deficiency notices were correct.it was not until march,in the opening statement before the tax court and in the of the commissioner sole expert witness,that the commissioner acknowledged that the deficiency notices were excessive and erroneous.this court has recognized that when,as here,the commissioner persists in taking a position in litigation that is 
so incongruous as to call his motivation into question,i t can only be seen as one aimed at achieving maximum revenue at any cost,seeking to gain leverage against the taxpayer in the hope of garnering a,failing that,then a compromise between the value returned by the taxpayer and the unsupportedly excessive value eventually proposed by the commissioner.
dunn,at.in dunn,the result that the commissioner obtained in the tax court was rejected.as in dunn,the result in this case can not stand.
the legal effect of the commissioner concession of error in the tax court is clear.in a tax court deficiency proceeding,once the taxpayer has established that the assessment is arbitrary and erroneous,the burden shifts to the government to prove the correct amount of any taxes owed.portillo comm r,cir.the tax court,however,did not place the burden of proof on the commissioner.instead,the tax court stated that while the parties disputed who bore the burden of proving the central issue in this case namely,the value of the transferred assets,w e do not decide this dispute.instead,the tax court rejected most of the only support the commissioner provided for the net excess benefit finding,the testimony of the commissioner valuation expert.at that point,the commissioner failed to meet his burden of proof.at that point,the tax court should have found in the taxpayers favor.its failure to do so was error,as a matter of law.
in rejecting most,but not all,of the commissioner valuation expert opinions,the tax court made a number of errors in the valuation method it selected and in the facts it found in selecting and applying that method.the tax court use of wilhoite modified method for valuing assets,particularly its intangible assets,is wrong as a matter of law.wilhoite had no experience in appraising healthcare companies and knew very little about the entities or their assets and liabilities.wilhoite did not value specific assets,but instead used a variation on an valuation method to do a general and indirect valuation of assets.the tax court adopted a modified version of wilhoite valuation approach,which is designed to value invested value the assets of a company that had no capital.the tax court did so with no legal support for the use of such a method to value the assets of these agencies,over the recognition of both wilhoite and hahn that this method was inferior to,and less rigorous than,an method.the tax court then compounded this error by deriving the multiple it applied to the entities using the seven public companies wilhoite selected as comparables.put simply,they were not.
the tax court considered the commissioner expert testimony against a record of stipulated or undisputed facts.those facts included that between and percent of revenues came from medicare,compared to a national average of percent,and that medicare only reimbursed up to actual costs and disallowed percent of annual costs,thereby ensuring that the entities would continue to build liabilities,not assets,and could not profit.the more patient care the entities provided,the more revenues they generated,and the more their losses grew.the parties did not dispute that the liabilities of the exempt entities exceeded assets for every year from through.the parties did not dispute that the exempt agencies had million in debts and liabilities that the newly created nonexempt entities assumed.the parties did not dispute that the exempt entities had sustained progressively larger net operating losses and capital deficits for the previous five years.the parties did not dispute that there was no likely potential buyer for.despite these undisputed facts,the tax court valuation method used an valuation method that compared the entities with solvent,publicly traded companies with significant equity and a present ability to generate profits.this aspect of wilhoite analysis,accepted by the tax court,excluded distressed companies from the comparables.six of the seven comparable companies were generating profits at the time of wilhoite comparison and the seventh had substantial equity.had neither equity nor a record of profits.the commissioner expert erred when he stated to the tax court that two of the comparable public companies had operating losses in fact,one of those companies was.the commissioner expert also erred in telling the tax court that one of the public comparables had negative stockholder equity the only negative equity entry was.on,the commissioner expert conceded that some of the comparables provided infusion services,which are and thus capable of turning a profit,and that some comparables provided respiratory services,which are also fee based.the commissioner expert further conceded that other comparables that provided residential medical services,pediatric care,adult day care,and companion care services either were or may have been he did not know.the commissioner expert also admitted that many of the comparables were far less than.
a comparable must be substantially similar to the entity or asset that is at issue.van zelst comm r,cir estate of palmer comm r,cir.as noted,none of the publicly traded entities wilhoite chose were similar to.they were publicly traded.see dunn,at recognizing that public companies generally can not be compared with private companies.they had capital.they were profitable.they were not limited to offering basic,and unprofitable,therapies.most important,they did not depend on medicare for over percent of their revenues,were not limited to recovery of actual costs,and did not have a portion of their actual costs disallowed every year.for these publicly traded comparables,added revenue would logically create added value.for,the overwhelming dependence on medicare reimbursements meant that added revenue meant added unreimbursed costs,which in turn generated greater losses.the tax court recognized some of these differences,but the publicly traded entities could still be used as comparables as long as the amount of the multiple derived was adjusted.the tax court did not explain how it arrived at the amount of the adjustment or how that amount transformed fundamentally different financial entities into comparables.
using an adjusted version of the wilhoite invested capital method,the tax court concluded that the value of the assets the nonexempt entities received exceeded the value of the million in liabilities and debts they assumed by million.as the taxpayers point out,the tax court concluded that a willing buyer would assume million in liabilities and pay million to acquire the right to lose money on an ongoing basis.the tax court explained why it believed this apparently illogical conclusion made sense it found that had the potential to make a profit,which demonstrated that its assets had substantial fair market value.this finding was clearly erroneous.
the tax court based its finding that the entities had the potential to make a profit on the finding that if had not paid a bonus to its staff in,it would have reported nontaxable income of approximately million,more than enough to eliminate the accumulated deficit in net asset value.the commissioner concedes that this statement is simply error.the statement ignores the fact that under the medicare system that accounted for between and percent of revenues,there is no reimbursement unless there is an actual expense incurred.if had not paid the bonuses,the medicare reimbursements it received would have been reduced by an equal amount,leaving the same level of company losses.the tax court did not take into account this effect of the medicare reimbursement system on the entities,despite acknowledging it earlier in the opinion.the tax court also overlooked the reason for the bonuses and what they revealed about the entities finances.these bonuses were unpaid,deferred employee pay,rather than discretionary bonuses.the deferred wages for existing employees,along with deferred wages for newly hired employees,were mechanisms the taxpayers used to continue to operate despite their perennial problems,their lack of profitability,their increasing operating losses,and their increasing deficits.the commissioner acknowledged before the tax court that the salaries and bonuses were neither excessive nor unreasonable.moreover,the caracci family members withheld their own compensation in the same manner as compensation for the other employees.in short,these bonuses evidenced the unprofitable nature of the entities,not the potential for profitability,as the tax court erroneously stated.
the tax court also criticized the same section of the opinion that discussed its profit taking a large depreciation deduction.the tax court ignored the fact that a agency providing services to a predominately rural population dispersed over a geographically large area necessarily has a heavily used fleet of vehicles.the tax court suggestion that the taxpayers were improperly exploiting the depreciation ignored the fact that it represented a very real cost that could not be annually expensed because of the tax code specifications for the depreciable life of such personal property.see generally.indeed,stipulated facts in the record make it clear that far from exploiting the tax consequences of their corporate form,the caracci family had been unable to take advantage of the income tax exemption the agencies enjoyed before,because the agencies had consistently incurred net operating losses.
the tax court stated that the agencies had not profited from their business because of the entities previous status this statement further reflects a misunderstanding of business and the regulatory regime under which it operated.the exempt agencies did not profit because they were virtually entirely dependent on medicare reimbursements and the medicare reimbursement system prohibits,regardless of an agency tax status.as the tax court recognized elsewhere in its opinion,the entities continued to operate in the same a converting to nonexempt status.
the commissioner concedes that the tax court statement that the entities could have reported nontaxable income of million had it not declared a bonus in was wrong.yet the commissioner insists on this appeal that the error was harmless.the tax court opinion itself defeats this argument.the tax court reasoned from the mistaken assumption that the agencies could have generated positive net income by eliminating the employee bonus to the mistaken finding that the agencies had demonstrated a substantial fair market value.this mistaken statement was immediately followed by the tax court decision to use an method to value assets and to use profitable public companies as comparables to derive the mvic multiple as part of that metho
