this case requires us to consider whether the bia abused its discretion by denying ellya indradjaja indradjaja or petitioner motion to reopen proceedings in her immigration case.the bia rejected her evidentiary submissions because she had not submitted a sworn statement in support of her motion and because her expert witness had not provided copies of the sources on which he relied.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the bia acted arbitrarily and capriciously in attaching consequences to these previously unarticulated requirements in indradjaja case.accordingly,we grant indradjaja petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
fact overview 
ellya indradjaja is a citizen and native of indonesia.she is a devout chinese christian who spent many years in both indonesia and abroad furthering her religious education growing up in indonesia,she attended the christus romani church,and,after completing college in,she spent two years ministering in russia and australia.in the years that followed,she spent time in indonesia and abroad in pursuit of her education and her faith.of note,she earned a certificate in biblical and cross cultural studies at the whole nation christian college in england,earned a master of arts missions at the singapore bible college in singapore,and did missionary work in singapore and china.
during that time,however,indradjaja pursuit of her faith was troubled,in particular when she ministered to muslims in indonesia.after she a christian ministry in the year,she was the target of significant pressures and intimidations because of this ministry.app x.for instance,in march,a muslim family asked indradjaja and the ministry other to pray and bless the family house.while the women were praying,other muslims in the community threw rocks at the house.indradjaja did not call the police because,based on her prior experiences,she did not believe that the police would help her.she also experienced intimidation,including threats,which at times forced her to cut short worship services.because of her personal experiences and the violent attacks on christian ministries throughout indonesia,she feared for her safety.
in march,indradjaja came to the united states to visit a friend,who was sick and struggling with her faith,and was lawfully admitted to the united states as a visitor on a b visa.she saw that her christian friends were not afraid to proselytize in the united states and that she could do so without fear of the harassment and threats that she experienced when ministering in indonesia.in order to avoid returning to that situation,indradjaja filed an application for asylum on february.
asylum proceedings before the immigration court 
in response to indradjaja application for asylum,the department of homeland security dhs initiated deportation proceedings against her,charging her as removable under a b because she had remained in the united states for a time longer than permitted.app x.she appeared,as instructed,before the ij,acknowledged that she had overstayed her visa,and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,on the basis that she feared persecution on the basis of her religion and ethnicity.
in her hearing before the ij,indradjaja testified about the threats and harassment she had experienced as a result of being identifiable as an ethnic chinese and a practicing christian,as well as the attacks upon christian churches and worshipers throughout indonesia.she explained that she was scared to practice her faith and unable to look to the police for protection because,when she had gone to the police in the past,they would not help her.as further support,she submitted over articles demonstrating that,during the period between and,extremist groups forcibly closed and attacked numerous christian churches and intimidated and used violence against christians.the ij found indradjaja consistent and credible and sympathize d with the respondent desire to be able to practice her religion freely,but found that she had not establish ed past persecution within the meaning of the immigration act as opposed to discrimination.app x.the ij also found that the attacks against christian churches were episodic and not systemic and that,therefore,indradjaja had not established a fear of future persecution.
indradjaja timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.in june of,the bia affirmed,stating that the events indradjaja described appear to have constituted harassment and discrimination but the cumulative effect of these events did not rise to the level of persecution.id.at.the bia agreed with the ij that indradjaja ha d not demonstrated a reasonable possibility that she would be singled out individually for persecution upon her return to indonesia and that s he also ha d not established a systematic,pervasive or organized pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic chinese christians in indonesia based upon this record.id.at.indradjaja did not seek review of the bia decision.
motion to reopen 
in august of,indradjaja timely filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings in order to provide new and previously unavailable evidence of dramatically increased levels of violence and persecution against the chinese christians in indonesia.app x.the new evidence included an affidavit from an expert witness and a number of articles reporting on the increased threat to chinese christians in indonesia.
indradjaja motion relied heavily on an affidavit from jeffrey winters,a professor and expert on human rights in indonesia who has served as an expert on indonesian affairs in governmental and court proceedings.as his affidavit submitted in indradjaja case explains,his opinion rel ied upon his comprehensive general knowledge of the politics and society of indonesia,his review of political science materials,human rights reports,and media reports both in english and indonesian relating to recent events in indonesia,as well as information provided to him about indradjaja by her attorney,along with scores of research visits to indonesia involving intensive interviews with sources across the political and social spectrum.id.at.based on this information,he opined that c onditions for ethnic chinese indonesians remain threatening because the government does not provide protection and denies involvement in the riots,id.at e conomic and political conditions in indonesia are unstable,putting ethnic chinese persons and religious minorities at increasing risk of persecution,id.at and r adical islamic elements in indonesia are gaining power and influence,id.at.he further explained that h ardline islamists violently attack the minority ahmadiyah muslim section,id.at,there has been a sharp increase in hardline islamic threats against religious minorities since,id.at and noted that a major scholarly study in shows evidence of growing islamic fundamentalism and intolerance of minorities in indonesia,id.at.winters concluded that indradjaja is in danger of persecution on account of her chinese ethnicity,id.at,and that she faces a clear probability of future persecution because n o matter where she tried to relocate in indonesia,there is no place in the country where her ethnic chinese ancestry could be hidden,id.at.in support of this analysis,winters provided a list of the sources cited in his affidavit,along with the addresses for websites where some of those sources could be found.however,he did not include copies of the sources.
in further support of her motion,indradjaja submitted numerous reports and articles as evidence of the increased threat to chinese christians in indonesia.these included the international religious freedom report for indonesia issued by the department of state bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor a report by the setara institute titled where is our place of worship a thematic review of the violation of the freedom of regarding places of worship and the right to worship,january july and several shorter documents and articles relating to religious intolerance of christians in indonesia.the state department report,for example,observes that,t here were a number of reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation,belief,or practice,s ome muslim groups used violence and intimidation to close at least churches,and o nly a few perpetrators of these and past abuses have been prosecuted.app x.it also reports that,as a general matter,the indonesian government failed to prevent abuse and discrimination against religious groups by other private actors and at times failed to punish perpetrators of violence.id.the setara institution report explicitly finds that violence against christians was on the rise in indonesia,stating that s ince entering the year,attacks towards places of worship have escalated,especially towards the christians compared to the year before.id.at the other articles and reports contain similar descriptions of attacks,mob intimidation,arson,and other acts of hostility brutally target ing christian churches and worshipers in indonesia,reportedly by muslim fundamentalists or local authorities.id.at see generally id.at.
bia decision 
on march,a single member of the bia denied indradjaja motion to reopen,providing two independent bases for its decision.
first,the bia rejected indradjaja submission in toto because no affidavit or sworn statement by the respondent ha d been submitted.app x.the bia did not cite to an applicable rule or regulation,but explained 
in this motion,many claims are made about worsening conditions in indonesia since the respondent last hearing allegedly relevant to,and affecting,her current eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.however,no affidavit or sworn statement by the respondent has been submitted.thus,we can not be sure who is advancing the claims set forth in this motion.to the extent they are being made by counsel,it is well settled that statements by counsel do not constitute evidence.as such,the relevance of the submitted material concerning recent country conditions since the respondent last hearing has not been shown.
id.citations omitted.thus,having rejected indradjaja evidentiary submission documenting the worsening conditions in indonesia,the bia found that she had not carried her burden of showing changed country conditions and denied her request to reopen proceedings.id.
as an alternate basis for denying indradjaja motion,the bia held that e ven if this were not the case,it would still deny this reopening request because the evidence submitted would not have changed the disposition of indradjaja motion.id.the bia came to that conclusion based on its analysis of the winters affidavit and the other reports and articles submitted by indradjaja.
in doing so,the bia gave the winters affidavit little,if any,weight,reasoning that 
i n requesting reopening,heavy reliance is placed on the page affidavit by jeffrey winters,who discusses conditions in indonesia before and after the respondent last hearing,and cites multiple articles and reports to support his statements and conclusions.however,the primary source material cited and discussed by winters has not been furnished with the instant motion.thus,we are unable to independently assess his statements and conclusions,and their relevance to the respondent request for reopening.
id.citation omitted.
with respect to the reports and articles submitted by indradjaja,the bia stated 
although other articles are tendered reporting on the recent and continuing harassment and discrimination of,and violence directed at,christians including church burnings,evidence of similar types of incidents was introduced by the respondent at her removal hearing.the material does not establish significantly worsened conditions in indonesia pertinent to the respondent previously advanced persecution and torture claims,so as to warrant its further consideration in reopened proceedings.
id.at footnote and citations omitted.in a footnote,the bia observed that i ncluded in this material are articles reporting on the harassment,discrimination,and violence directed at ahmadiyya muslims,including attacks that resulted in deaths.id.at.the bia stated that i nasmuch as the respondent persecution and torture claims stem from her fear of mistreatment because she is ethnic chinese and christian not because she is ahmadiyya muslim,the relevance of these particular articles has not been demonstrated.id.
finally,the bia addressed indradjaja claim that the ij had erred by concluding that she did not suffer from past persecution.the bia observed that she had already appealed that decision,and t o the extent she was seeking reconsideration of the bia june,decision dismissing her appeal of the immigration judge decision,her motion to reconsider was untimely.id.at.furthermore,to the extent that indradjaja present ed new arguments challenging the immigration judge decision,a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings,but was not,will be denied.id.
this petition for review followed.
discussion 
on appeal,indradjaja primarily argues that the bia abused its discretion by denying her motion to reopen because she had not provided an affidavit or sworn statement and affording winters expert witness affidavit little,if any,weight because he did not submit copies of the materials on which he relied.id.at.as we explain below,we agree.since we find that the bia acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to consider the relevant evidence,we do not consider indradjaja remaining challenges to the bia decision.
applicable law 
an asylum applicant may move to reopen proceedings based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality.c ii.a motion to reopen proceedings must state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c.the bia will not grant such a motion unless it appears to the board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.id.
we review the decision to deny a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.qin wen zheng gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.an abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the board decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements that is to say,where the board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.ke zhen zhao dep t of justice,cir citations omitted.
b.the bia errors 
we first address indradjaja contention that the bia abused its discretion by rejecting her evidentiary submission because it was not accompanied by a sworn statement from her.she argues that the bia misinterpreted the law governing motions to reopen because no such requirement exists.as explained below,we agree.
the bia did not cite any rule or authority that requires motions to reopen to be accompanied by a sworn statement from the immigrant.instead,the bia concluded that,because no affidavit or sworn statement by indradjaja was submitted,the relevance of the submitted material concerning recent country conditions since the respondent hearing ha d not been shown.app x.it explained that,without a sworn statement,it would not consider the evidence because it c ould not be sure who is advancing the claims.id.in its view,this deficiency was not cured by the brief indradjaja attorney submitted along with the materials because statements by counsel do not constitute evidence.id.
defending the bia decision,the government argues that the bia correctly denied indradjaja motion because the relevant regulation requires that indradjaja submit an affidavit explaining how the newly proffered evidence relates to her.brief for the government.but the regulation requires only that a motion to reopen be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c emphasis added.it does not mandate that any affidavit be submitted,let alone require one specifically from the petitioner.
the government also maintains that the bia did not abuse
