jimmie buchanan worked in indiana coal strip mines for years,enduring the constant exposure to dust customary for that line of work.he now suffers from substantial problems.he filed two claims for benefits under the black lung benefits act.his first claim was denied.on his second claim,he was awarded benefits.rag american coal company rag petitions for review of the order of the benefits review board board,affirming the award.rag contends that res judicata bars his second claim.we affirm.
background 
in,jimmie buchanan filed an application for black lung benefits.he claimed that he had lung disease caused by inhalation of coal dust.he had worked in coal mines for years.he also smoked cigarettes for years,averaging about one pack per day until cutting back during his last year as a miner,quitting entirely in.in defending the claim,the employer contested that buchanan had pneumoconiosis,that he was totally disabled,and that his disability was due to pneumoconiosis 
on july,administrative law judge alj michael issued his decision and order,denying benefits.he concluded that the record established that buchanan stopped working because of his back condition and he was totally disabled due to his back injury.he also found that buchanan had a pulmonary impairment which precluded him from working.the alj determined that buchanan did not have pneumoconiosis,however.in so doing,he gave greater weight to the opinions of peter tuteur and frank taylor that buchanan emphysema and bronchitis were caused by cigarette smoking than to the opinions of dan combs and william houser that exposure to coal mine dust was a significant factor in buchanan lung impairment.alj found that e xposure to coal mine dust was neither a sufficient nor necessary cause of buchanan pulmonary disability and that pneumoconiosis is not a necessary cause of his disability.he concluded e ven if the claimant had never worked in surface coal mines,he would be disabled today because of emphysema and bronchitis,together with chronic back pain and somewhat limited range of motion.the alj thus determined that buchanan failed to establish that he was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.on july,the board affirmed the alj decision.buchanan took no further action on his first claim.
in august,buchanan filed a second claim for benefits.in defending the claim,rag argued that buchanan was not totally disabled by pneumoconiosis.on may,alj rudolf jansen issued his decision and order,awarding benefits.he considered the evidence developed after the board decision on buchanan first claim to determine whether buchanan had shown that his condition had substantially worsened so as to entitle him to benefits.this included ten additional with numerous interpretations,two of which were positive for pneumoconiosis five additional pulmonary function studies and four additional arterial blood gas studies.it also included a report of an examination of buchanan by internist reynoldo carandang from december,a consulting report and supplement by robert cohen,dated april,and november,respectively a june,examination and opinion by jeff selby progress notes from stephen shoemaker,buchanan family physician hospital records from several progress reports dated from to october,from houser,buchanan treating pulmonologist and consulting reports completed by gregory fino and tuteur,pulmonologists,joseph renn,a pulmonary specialist,and david hinkamp,in preventative medicine and occupational disease.both carandang and houser opined that buchanan suffered from a pulmonary disease that had arisen,in part,from his past coal dust exposure.in contrast,selby,fino,tuteur,and renn concluded that buchanan disabling pulmonary impairment was unrelated to his coal mine employment.
giving greater weight to the opinions of houser,carandang,and cohen and less weight to the opinions of renn,tuteur and fino,alj jansen found that buchanan had established the existence of pneumoconiosis,thus showing a material change in his condition.the alj assigned the greatest weight to houser opinion based on his specialty in pulmonology,his familiarity with buchanan pulmonary condition due to his treatment of buchanan since,and the recency of his examination and report.in addition,he explained that houser reports and cohen opinions were and.the alj weighed carandang opinion favorably,in part,because he had examined buchanan since the denial of his earlier claim,and the alj found the opinions of cohen,shoemaker,and hinkamp supportive of houser diagnosis and conclusions.
the reports and opinions of fino,tuteur,and renn were assigned less weight for two reasons.first,they relied on medical studies and literature which indicated that pneumoconiosis seldom arose in an obstructive disease and that in miners who were smokers,any obstructive disease resulted from only tobacco smoke,not coal dust exposure.the alj found that this view had been rejected by this court as contrary to the prevailing view of the medical community and substantial weight of the medical and scientific literature,citing freeman united coal mining summers,cir.the second reason for giving these consultants opinions less weight was that they were less familiar with buchanan pulmonary condition than houser.
alj jansen determined,based on shoemaker reports and opinions and houser and cohen opinions,that buchanan pulmonary condition had progressively and substantially worsened over the last four or five years.the alj relied,in part,on shoemaker notations of buchanan frequent,recent hospitalizations,which showed he had several acute exacerbations of his chronic pulmonary disease.alj jansen found that buchanan had established total disability due to pneumoconiosis and thus awarded him benefits commencing august.
rag petitioned the board for review,and the board affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.on july,alj jansen again issued an order awarding benefits.rag sought reconsideration.on reconsideration,alj jansen reiterated that alj had determined that the evidence failed to establish pneumoconiosis and that buchanan had demonstrated a material change in condition by showing that he had pneumoconiosis.alj jansen also found a material change in buchanan proof of total disability,indicating that buchanan respiratory impairment had worsened in recent years.rag appealed.the board affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded so the alj could reassess the medical opinions of fino and tuteur.
on august,alj jansen issued his decision and order on remand,again awarding benefits.the alj weighed the medical opinions,assigning less weight to the opinions of fino and tuteur because he found them not and in tension with the department of labors dol findings regarding coal dust exposure and obstructive lung disease.alj jansen found that buchanan had pneumoconiosis and had established a material change in conditions.the alj also found that buchanan demonstrated that he was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.rag appealed to the board,which affirmed.rag moved for reconsideration the motion was denied on january,and rag petitioned this court for review.
ii.discussion 
in challenging the award of benefits,rag makes three arguments.rag first contends that buchanan second claim is barred by res judicata.rag next challenges alj jansen finding that buchanan established a material change in conditions.and,third,rag suggests that the refusal to apply ordinary principles of finality denied it due process of law.we review questions of law de novo.midland coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir.we review the alj decision to determine if it is rational,supported by substantial evidence,and consistent with controlling law.consolidation coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir.in doing so,we accept the alj factual findings if supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.id.
buchanan may avoid the res judicata effect of the denial of his earlier claim,if he establishes that there has been a material change in conditions.c see also peabody coal spese,cir en banc by requiring denial of a second application unless there has been a material change in conditions,the regulation gives res judicata effect to the first decision.midland coal,at stating that traditional principles of res judicata do not bar a subsequent application for black lung benefits where a miner demonstrates a material change in at least one of the conditions of entitlement.to show a material change,the claimant can not merely present new evidence regarding his condition at the time of the earlier denial.id.at spese,at.rather,he must show that something capable of making a difference has changed since the record closed on the first application.spese,at.thus,i f the earlier denial listed both a failure to show pneumoconiosis and a failure to show total disability,the claimant can avoid automatic denial of his claim on res judicata grounds by showing a material change in either of those elements.id.at.accordingly,traditional principles of res judicata do not bar buchanan second claim,as long as he has demonstrated a material change in his condition.
that brings us to the next issue whether buchanan established a material change in his condition.alj jansen found that he did.rag challenges that finding.a claimant can establish a material change by establishing either that he did not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application.id.at quoting sahara coal office of workers comp.programs,cir see also midland coal,at.the alj finding of a material change in condition is a factual determination that we review only for substantial evidence.see midland coal,at.
alj jansen finding that buchanan showed a material change in his condition was supported by substantial evidence in the record.the alj found that buchanan proved that he had pneumoconiosis.he also found that buchanan pulmonary disease had progressively and substantially worsened since the denial of his first claim,such that he established total disability due to pneumoconiosis.
the finding of pneumoconiosis was based on the and medical opinions of houser,buchanan treating pulmonologist,carandang,board certified in internal medicine,and cohen,board certified pulmonary specialist.both carandang and houser,who examined buchanan since the denial of his first claim,opined that buchanan suffered from a pulmonary disease,including pneumoconiosis,that had arisen,in part,from his past coal dust exposure.specifically,in november,houser reviewed buchanan medical records going back to august,including office visits,hospitalizations,pulmonary function tests,and arterial blood gas studies.houser concluded that buchanan had a disabling respiratory impairment which included coal workers pneumoconiosis,category,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severe,chronic bronchitis,and emphysema.he also stated that buchanan chest radiograph showed category pneumoconiosis and that his pneumoconiosis was related to his coal mine employment.similarly,carandang believed that buchanan suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis and severe obstructive lung disease caused by his tobacco use and coal mine employment.he also believed that buchanan would be unable to work in coal mine employment because of his impaired lung function.and cohen,board certified in pulmonology,gave a consulting opinion in which he opined that buchanan suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis as well as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which resulted from both his coal dust exposure and cigarette smoking.in cohen judgment,buchanan did not have the pulmonary capacity to perform his last coal mine job.
both houser and shoemaker records support a finding that buchanan pulmonary disease progressively worsened since the denial of his first claim.in early,houser noted that buchanan respiratory condition was fairly stable and essentially unchanged,but in may,he also noted buchanan complaints of dyspnea at night.then,in january,houser noted that buchanan was having some exacerbation of respiratory symptoms,with increased cough and shortness of breath,plus some sputum production.on february,shoemaker admitted buchanan to the hospital for an a cute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopneumonia.buchanan was experiencing shortness of breath with wheezing and some crackles throughout his lungs.his lungs were tight and he had poor air exchange.buchanan was given steroids,oxygen,and aerosol treatments and was discharged one week later in an improved condition.in early may,houser indicated that buchanan was having problems with increasing dyspnea,that pulmonary function tests and a spirometry showed severe airway obstruction with no response to bronchodilator administration and that buchanan had decreased from to since november.the doctor recommended pulmonary rehabilitation,including an inpatient program.on may,shoemaker admitted buchanan to the hospital for shortness of breath and diagnosed him with pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.buchanan was again treated with steroids and breathing treatments.on may,buchanan was admitted to an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program.he was discharged on june,in an improved condition.later that month,houser observed that buchanan seemed to be doing fairly well and in october,noted that buchanan said he was feeling better and had improved since the rehab program.nonetheless,at that time,buchanan chest exam showed diminished breath sounds,a prolonged expiratory phase,and his oxygen saturation on room air was only.
houser and cohen opinions further support the conclusion that buchanan pulmonary condition had worsened.houser reviewed buchanan pulmonary function tests from,and,all of which showed severe airway obstruction.he also reviewed arterial blood gas studies from june,and indicated that they showed severe hypoxemia,with a of on exercise and oxygen saturation of,below the level which would qualify a person for home oxygen under medicare guidelines.according to houser,these values indicated that buchanan needed supplemental oxygen on exercise.cohen noted that arterial blood gas tests showed a worsening of buchanan lowered gas exchange with exercise and that those tests were stopped due to extreme dyspnea.he also indicated that buchanan developed hypoxemia with exercise which progressively worsened from december to june,when he described severe hypoxemia on exercise.
we note as well that in comparing buchanan pulmonary function test results from december to december,carandang noted a marked decrease in the dlco the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide.medlineplus,medical encyclopedia.gov medlineplus ency article.htm last visited july.he also observed a decline in buchanan arterial blood gas test results from december to december.and hinkamp agreed that t here is no doubt that buchanan gas exchange abnormalities worsened over the years.renn likewise noted that the arterial blood gas studies showed a worsening of buchanan condition from to august and december.he also indicated a decline in buchanan condition demonstrated by pulmonary function studies,from normal,showing a severe,significantly bronchoreversible obstructive ventilatory defect,and and showing a very severe,significantly bronchoreversible obstructive ventilatory defect.alj jansen did not specifically rely on these opinions in finding that buchanan pulmonary condition had progressively worsened.we mention them here only to show that the alj conclusion is supported by even more evidence than he actually cited.
furthermore,the record supports the finding that buchanan back condition,though once totally disabling,had improved to the point at which it was no longer the source of his total disability.subsequent to the denial of his first claim,buchanan underwent two surgeries on his back,after which his back condition improved.after the second surgery,houser indicated that most of buchanan physical limitations,except those related to sitting,were due primarily to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that there was no indication that his treadmill exercise p
