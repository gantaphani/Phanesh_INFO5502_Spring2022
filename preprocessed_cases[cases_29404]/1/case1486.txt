sickle cell disease scd,also known as sickle cell anemia,is a blood disorder that principally afflicts individuals of african and indian descent.the disease leaves its victims easily fatigued and often suffering from episodes of acute pain.scd is particularly insidious because it rarely produces the objective medical evidence that clinicians desire.in fact,
p atient s with scd are in an almost uniquely disadvantaged position from the point of view of pain management.the condition is life threatening at times,yet patients are healthy between sickling episodes.some individuals are affected by painful episodes much more than others,and pain is often the only or main symptom of an acute episode of illness.

appellee jeffery hines,an scd patient,applied for disability benefits based on his disease.the social security administration ssa denied his claim largely because hines claims of disabling pain were not supported by objective evidence.the district court reversed the ssa denial of benefits,and we affirm.given the unique characteristics of the disease at issue in this case,we hold that the ssa administrative law judge alj applied an improper standard to disregard the treating physician opinion that hines was fully disabled.the alj also improperly relied on a vocational expert opinion that did not consider all relevant evidence in the record.
section g of title of the united states code authorizes judicial review of the social security commissioner denial of social security benefits.mastro apfel,cir.under the social security act,a reviewing court must uphold the factual findings of the alj if they are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standard.id.alteration in original quoting craig chater,cir.although we review the commissioner factual findings only to establish that they are supported by substantial evidence,we also must assure that her ultimate conclusions are legally correct.myers califano,cir.
hines was employed for or years as a railroad crew leader until his scd became so severe that he could no longer work.he ceased work on april,upon advice from his treating physician,myung kil jeon.jeon has treated hines scd condition for approximately years.jeon determined that the chronic pain caused by hines scd is exacerbated by exertion and prevents hines from maintaining steady employment,and.in reports dated september,february,and july,jeon stated that hines was fully disabled by scd.
since leaving work in,hines has suffered from insomnia,has occasional blurred vision in his right eye,and experiences pain regularly.in addition to chronic pain,hines has periodic acute pain crises which require approximately one month of recovery time.the record indicates that hines was treated by jeon on september,and april,for acute sickle cell pain crises and on november,for generalized weakness,aching,and pain.
hines regularly experiences fatigue due to a combination of his scd and insomnia.the fatigue prevents him from performing many everyday tasks.for example,when hines attempts to mow his lawn,he is unable to complete the job in one effort and is forced to lie down.indeed,hines testified that his condition forces him to lie down and rest approximately half of every day,and he is able to attend church only two to three times per month.at the alj hearing,hines wife testified that he is not able to do much around the house,he is forgetful,he does not leave the house for trips or visiting friends,and a lot of time he have a lot of pains in his leg.this evidence was unrebutted.
hines disability insurance company referred him to rupa lallinger,a hematologist,for an evaluation of his scd.lallinger noted there was no objective evidence of major damage in the bones,although it is possible for early avascular necrosis not to show up on plain films,but be apparent in an mri.no sign of recurrent bony infarction to explain his frequent pain.lallinger then qualified his observation by stating that i t must be noted,however,that with pain from sickle cell disease there are no confirmatory laboratory or radiologic tests that will prove or disprove whether a patient is having pain.
disability is the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.the d etermination of eligibility for social security benefits involves a inquiry.walls barnhart,cir.this inquiry asks 
whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity the claimant has a medical impairment or combination of impairments that are severe the claimant medical impairment meets or exceeds the severity of one of the impairments listed in appendix i of part,subpart p the claimant can perform her past relevant work and the claimant can perform other specified types of work.

the alj found that hines satisfied steps one and two of the inquiry.at the third step of his inquiry,the alj concluded that hines scd did not meet or exceed the severity of the qualifying impairments recognized in an appendix to the regulations.the alj therefore sought to determine hines residual functional capacity rfc for employment.
rfc is a measurement of the most a claimant can do despite his limitations.see a.according to the social security administration,
rfc is an assessment of an individual ability to do sustained physical and mental activities in a work setting on a regular and continuing basis.a regular and continuing basis means hours a day,for days a week,or an equivalent work schedule.
social security regulation ssr emphasis added.rfc is to be determined by the alj only after he considers all relevant evidence of a claimant impairments and any related symptoms,pain.see a.
the alj concluded that hines had the rfc to perform a wide range of sedentary work with limitations to working in temperature extremes,working at a production rate,or performing more than simple,routine,repetitive tasks.in light of ssr,this conclusion implicitly contained a finding that hines physically is able to work an eight hour day.
having concluded that hines had the rfc to perform a sedentary job,the alj then evaluated hines case at the fifth step of the inquiry this step requires the commissioner to prove that a significant number of jobs exist which the claimant could perform,despite his impairments.
the alj found that the commissioner carried her burden of proving that hines could perform certain jobs in the national economy.in reaching this conclusion,the alj relied on the opinion of steven carpenter,a vocational expert who had never met hines.the vocational expert assumed that hines could work a full eight hour day.based on this assumption,the vocational expert opined that claimant could work as an order clerk,call out operator,and laundry pricing clerk.he testified that significant numbers of these jobs exist in the north carolina economy.
we begin by reviewing the alj finding that hines has the rfc to perform a wide range of sedentary work with limitations for a full eight hour work day.see ssr.in reaching this conclusion,the alj improperly refused to credit jeon medical opinion that his long term patient hines was totally disabled.the alj was obligated to evaluate and weigh medical opinions pursuant to the following list whether the physician has examined the applicant,the treatment relationship between the physician and the applicant,the supportability of the physician opinion,the consistency of the opinion with the record,and whether the physician is a specialist.johnson barnhart,cir citing.courts typically accord greater wei
