linda jones appeals a district court order that,as is relevant here,granted summary judgment against her on her claims that calvert group,terminated her in retaliation for filing an equal employment opportunity commission eeoc charge and because of her age,sex,and race.we vacate the judgment on the merits on each of these claims.regarding the age,sex,and race claims,we remand for dismissal of the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of jones failure to exhaust administrative remedies.with regard to the retaliation claim,we remand for further proceedings.
because this is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment to calvert,we review the facts in the light most favorable to jones.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
jones is an female who was years old when she filed her complaint on november.she was employed by calvert as a computer operator and technical analyst from until her termination.she performed her job successfully at all times.
on approximately may,jones filed a complaint of race,age,and sex discrimination with the maryland commission on human relations the first charge alleging that calvert had discriminated against her on the basis of her race,sex,and age when it selected a white male under the age of instead of her for a particular position for which she was qualified.the complaint was resolved in february by a written agreement,under which calvert was obligated to provide jones with certain training and assistance to enable her to qualify for future promotions.
shortly thereafter,jones received her first ever negative performance evaluation.she then filed a second formal discrimination charge the second charge claiming that,in retaliation for her filing the first charge,she had been denied mentoring opportunities,management had scrutinized her performance unduly,and she had received a negative performance review.she alleged,i believe i am being forced to work in a hostile environment and subjected to differential treatment in retaliation for filing the first charge.the second charge was before the maryland commission on human relations from july,until july.then,on august,the commission issued jones a letter.
calvert terminated jones on or about october,allegedly for not taking ownership of her work assignments.
on november,jones filed suit in federal district court alleging that she was terminated in violation of title vii because of her race and sex and in retaliation for engaging in protected title vii activity,and that she was terminated on the basis of her age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.the suit also alleged that jones termination constituted a breach of her employment contract with calvert.
calvert moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b.as is relevant here,calvert maintained that jones had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies for the title vii and adea claims.jones opposed the motion.converting the motion to one for summary judgment regarding the federal claims,see.b,the district court entered judgment against jones on the title vii and adea counts and dismissed her breach of contract claim for failure to state a claim 
title vii of the civil rights act of makes it an unlawful employment practice to discharge any individual because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a west.the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual age.a west.
before a plaintiff may file suit under title vii or the adea,he is required to file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.see f west title vii d west adea.title vii establishes two possible limitation periods for filing a discrimination charge with the eeoc.see e.the basic limitations period is days after the alleged unlawful employment practice.however,the limitations period is extended to days when state law proscribes the alleged employment practice and the charge has initially been filed with a state deferral agency.tinsley first union bank,cir.the same limitation periods apply regarding adea claims.see d.the period applies in this case.
the charge must be in writing and verified under oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury.see edelman lynchburg college,d.a charge is sufficient only if it is sufficiently precise to identify the parties,and to describe generally the action or practices complained of.chacko patuxent,cir quoting b.the scope of the plaintiff right to file a federal lawsuit is determined by the charge contents.see bryant bell atl,cir.only those discrimination claims stated in the initial charge,those reasonably related to the original complaint,and those developed by reasonable investigation of the original complaint may be maintained in a subsequent title vii lawsuit.evans techs.applications serv,cir.thus,a claim in formal litigation will generally be barred if the eeoc charge alleges discrimination on one basis,such as race,and the formal litigation claim alleges discrimination on a separate basis,such as sex.see bryant,at.
importantly,a failure by the plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies concerning a title vii claim deprives the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.see davis north carolina dep t of,cir holding that removal of title vii action was improper because plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction the same is true of claims made under the adea.see d vance whirlpool,cir holding that plaintiff failure to wait days after filing federal administrative charge before bringing suit in federal district court deprived district court of subject matter jurisdiction.
jones first contends that the district court erred in ruling that because the second charge did not allege discrimination on the basis of age,sex,or race,she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies for those claims.we disagree.
the second charge alleged that jones was being retaliated against because she had filed the first charge it did not allege that she was discriminated against based on her age,sex,or race.indeed,she checked only the retaliation box on her eeoc charge and left unchecked the boxes for age,sex,or race.the district court therefore properly determined that jones failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to those claims.see evans,at.
jones nevertheless maintains that even if she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies regarding these claims,the district court erred in entering judgment against her on the merits.on this point we agree with jones.because jones failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the claims,the only function remaining to the court wa s that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause s.steel citizens for a better env t,d.thus,the district court had no authority to award judgment on the merits.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d see also vance,at.accordingly,we vacate the judgment against jones on those claims and remand to the district court to dismiss them for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
jones next contends that the district court erred in ruling that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to the retaliation claim.we agree.
jones specifically argues that the district court ruling is at odds with our decision in nealon stone,cir.in nealon,a public sector title vii case,the plaintiff filed an eeoc charge alleging that the army had violated her rights under the equal pay act of and title vii,by paying her less than it paid a man who performed a similar job.after the eeoc made a finding of no reasonable cause,the plaintiff filed a complaint in federal court alleging equal pay act and title vii violations and alleging,for the first time,that she was retaliated against in violation of title vii for filing the earlier eeoc charge on appeal from the district court dismissal of the retaliation claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,we explained that our circuit had previously left open the question of whether a plaintiff asserting a title vii claim of retaliation for fi
