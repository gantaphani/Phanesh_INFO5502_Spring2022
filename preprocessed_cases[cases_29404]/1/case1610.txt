in this complex title vii class action against lufkin industries,lufkin,plaintiffs allege that lufkin practice of delegating subjective authority to its managers with respect to initial assignments and promotions disparately affected them.after a bench trial,the district court issued a judgment in favor of the employees.after sifting through numerous issues,we reach results that are unfortunately inconclusive of the litigation.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate and remand in part.
factual and procedural background 
lufkin,a large manufacturing corporation located in lufkin,texas,is divided into four production divisions foundry,trailer,oil field,and power transmission.the company employs approximately hourly and salaried workers,and the hourly workers have been unionized for many years.
only two of the representative plaintiffs in this class action filed eeoc complaints.sylvester mcclain mcclain,the named plaintiff,began working in lufkin trailer division in.in january,he complained to the eeoc that his supervisor,arden jinkins jinkins,had discriminated against him based on his race.among other things,mcclain complained that jinkins tried to have him demoted.buford thomas thomas,a lufkin employee since,filed his eeoc charge in february,a year after he was allegedly constructively discharged.thomas complained of being denied promotional and training opportunities because of his race while working in the power transmission and oil field divisions.the eeoc issued letters on both charges.
mcclain and thomas sued lufkin for employment discrimination in violation of title vii and.the plaintiffs asserted that systematic racial discrimination pervades lufkin initial job assignments,training,promotions,and compensation.the district court certified the plaintiffs claims as a class action involving current and former lufkin employees.the class was described as 
all black persons employed for any period of time by defendant lufkin industries on or after march,to date,whose compensation,remuneration,benefits,job assignments,promotional opportunities,career advancements and other terms and conditions of employment have been,may have been,or may become,adversely affected by defendant lufkin industries past or present systems of administering hiring,wages,salaries,job assignments,training,evaluations,promotions,demotions,terminations,layoffs,recalls,and rehires.
mcclain lufkin.the court,however,declined to certify a disparate treatment class.two claims went to trial discrimination against blacks in lufkin assignment of newly hired employees and racially discriminatory promotion practices that rested on largely subjective criteria carried out by a largely white supervisory corps.
protracted pretrial proceedings in this case included two class certification hearings,two interlocutory appeals to this court,and a mediation effort.when the case finally went to bench trial,the court strictly limited each party to twenty hours for the presentation of its case.ultimately,the district court found that lufkin practice of delegating subjective authority to its white managers with respect to initial assignments and promotions resulted in a disparate impact on black employees in violation of title vii.the court awarded the plaintiffs over million in back pay,as well as attorneys fees and injunctive relief.both parties appeal.
ii.discussion 
lufkin contends that the named plaintiffs failed to exhaust eeoc administrative remedies and lack standing to represent the class.lufkin also contends that the district court erred in finding that lufkin promotion practices are subjective and incapable of separation for analysis and that they had a statistically significant disparate impact on black employees.lufkin challenges the court calculation of the back pay award according to a formula.finally,lufkin asserts that the cumulative effect of various errors,including the limited presentation of evidence,requires us to vacate the judgment.
for their part,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in refusing to certify a disparate treatment class,in failing to award appropriate injunctive relief,and in reducing their attorneys fees.we turn first to lufkin contentions.
lufkin arguments 
failure to exhaust eeoc remedies 
as a threshold matter,lufkin argues that the district court should have dismissed the plaintiffs and promotion claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and for lack of standing to represent a broadly defined class.failure to exhaust is not a procedural gotcha issue.it is a mainstay of proper enforcement of title vii remedies.lufkin contends that mcclain and thomas complained to the eeoc about their individual disparate treatment by the company,but not about their hiring nor about any neutral employment practices on which a case depends.the scope of their administrative claims governs the scope of the class claims.vuyanich republic bank,cir evans pipe foundry,cir.consequently,lufkin asserts,the eeoc was never presented with class claims concerning lufkin hiring and promotional practices,and the administrative process was circumvented.
the district court ruled that plaintiffs had exhausted their administrative remedies via mcclain january letter to the eeoc.see b fellows universal,cir.the court also held that a contemporary administrative proceeding pertaining to lufkin by the office of federal contract compliance programs ofccp sufficiently fulfilled the purposes of exhaustion.this court reviews de novo the district court conclusion concerning exhaustion.see pacheco mineta,cir,cert.denied,d.
title vii requires employees to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.id.private sector employees must satisfy this requirement by filing an administrative charge with the eeoc.id.at.the charge enables the eeoc to investigate and,if appropriate,negotiate a resolution with an employer.only after administrative efforts terminate may the employee sue the employer in federal court.
courts should not condone lawsuits that exceed the scope of eeoc exhaustion,because doing so would thwart the administrative process and peremptorily substitute litigation for conciliation.nevertheless,competing policies underlie judicial interpretation of the exhaustion requirement.see id.at.on one hand,the scope of an eeoc charge should be liberally construed for litigation purposes because title vii was designed to protect the many who are unlettered and unschooled in the nuances of literary draftsmanship.sanchez standard brands,cir.on the other hand,the primary purpose of title vii is to trigger the investigatory and conciliatory procedures of the eeoc,in an attempt to achieve resolution of employment discrimination claims.pacheco,at.to reconcile these policies,this court construes an eeoc complaint broadly but in terms of the administrative eeoc investigation that can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.sanchez,at.we use a analysis of the administrative charge that looks beyond the four corners of the document to its substance.id.in sum,a title vii lawsuit may include allegations like or related to allegation s contained in the eeoc charge and growing out of such allegations during the pendency of the case before the commission.id.
among this court numerous rulings on exhaustion of eeoc claims,we find most relevant the recent pacheco opinion,which held that an employee failed to exhaust a claim because his eeoc charge alleged only disparate treatment and identified no neutral employment policy.at.although pacheco administrative charge complained that he had not been promoted because of racial discrimination,his subsequent lawsuit alleged both disparate treatment and disparate impact.id.at.this court affirmed the dismissal of the allegations because 
a investigation could not reasonably have been expected to grow out of pacheco administrative charge because of the following matters taken together it facially alleged disparate treatment it identified no neutral employment policy and it complained of past incidents of disparate treatment only.
in this case,both the district court and the plaintiffs rely principally on mcclain january letter to establish administrative exhaustion.like pacheco,mcclain specifically complained to the eeoc of disparate treatment and past incidents of discrimination against himself.his letter to the eeoc describes discriminatory treatment that i have been receiving for some time,and discriminatory acts against me by jinkins.mcclain alleged that jinkins,his supervisor,racially discriminated against him and tried to have him demoted or fired on false charges of unsatisfactory performance.
mcclain letter nowhere refers to any neutral employment policy of lufkin.yet,according to pacheco,the cornerstone of any eeo c investigation is a neutral employment policy.at.plaintiffs argue that a investigation could have grown out of mcclain letter because he alluded to a cultural problem that extended to all parts of lufkin business.a cultural problem,however,is a vague term that can not be understood as a neutral employment policy.see,id.at.compare marshall fed.express,a vague or circumscribed eeoc charge will not satisfy the exhaustion requirement for claims it does not fairly embrace,with gomes avco,cir investigation would reasonably have flowed from an eeoc complaint that referenced an track to promotion.mcclain letter not only failed to identify any neutral employment policy,but also said nothing about discriminatory hiring at lufkin.
this limited interpretation of mcclain letter is confirmed by the actual scope of the eeoc investigation,which is clearly pertinent to an exhaustion inquiry.see fine gaf chem,cir fellows,at.responding to the january letter,the eeoc sent mcclain a proposed formal charge of discrimination in august,in which the agency summarized his claim as follows 
i have been subjected to different terms and conditions of employment by being denied comparable training,access to supplies and equipment needed to do a satisfactory job given unsatisfactory evaluations.
the charge then repeats mcclain complaint of demotion.the plaintiffs also cite another of mcclain written statements to the eeoc,in which he suggests that other evidence could be disclosed to support his discrimination claim.in context,this sentence refers only to lufkin disparate treatment of mcclain alone.
the district court attempted to fortify its conclusion that exhaustion occurred by taking into account an investigation by the ofccp into similar claims to those now before the court.the court seemed to think that an investigation by another federal agency can exhaust claims that must be handled by the eeoc and that lufkin was effectively notified of its exposure to claims by responding to the ofccp investigation.the district court cited no authority in support of its exhaustion bootstrapping,and we are aware of none.further,no such title vii shortcut to exhaustion or notification exists.since,the caselaw has explained that the scope of the judicial complaint is limited to the scope of the eeoc investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.sanchez,at emphasis added see also pacheco,at t he plaintiff administrative charge will be read somewhat broadly,in a inquiry into what eeoc investigations it can reasonably be expected to trigger.emphasis added fellows,at.the district court erred by utilizing ofccp investigation as a basis for inferring eeoc administrative exhaustion.
although mcclain eeoc complaint and the ofccp investigation failed to exhaust the employees class claims,buford thomas eeoc complaint carries part of the requisite burden.thomas alleged to the eeoc that he was constructively discharged,denied promotional and training opportunities,and overloaded with work because of his race.he specifically stated that r espondent has similarly discriminated against other black african americans.thomas complaint,viewed in light of the recent pacheco decision,presents a close question of exhaustion directed at a discriminatory,albeit neutral,company policy authorizing subjective promotion decisions.we conclude,however,that exhaustion was sufficient.significantly,lufkin did not contend otherwise in the trial court 
lufkin,instead,forcefully urged that the class failed to exhaust claims concerning lufkin alleged discriminatory assignment of newly hired black employees to the foundry division.hourly work in the foundry division is hot and heavy to a far greater extent than in the company other production divisions.but neither thomas nor mcclain,each with twenty or more years at lufkin,had worked in the foundry division and neither man could or did complain to the eeoc about foundry hiring practices.we are persuaded that the eeoc would not reasonably have investigated discriminatory assignment of new foundry division employees based on either mcclain or thomas charge.eastland.valley,cir class representatives could not assert initial assignment claims because all had been hired years before evans pipe foundry,cir eeoc investigation limited to promotion and harassment.because of this deficiency,we must vacate the judgment awarding damages and injunctive relief against lufkin based on discriminatory initial assignments to the foundry division 
lufkin liability will next be examined in regard to the class claim.
failure to isolate a specific employment practice 
the district court identified lufkin subjective process in awarding promotions as the employment practice that caused a disparate impact on black employees.to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under a theory,a plaintiff must show an identifiable,facially neutral personnel policy or practice a disparate effect on members of a protected class and a causal connection between the two.watson fort worth bank trust,d.ordinarily,a plaintiff must demonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate impact.yet,title vii provides that if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that the elements of the employer decision making process are not capable of separation for analysis,the decision making process may be analyzed as one employment practice.k b i.
lufkin challenges two factual findings underlying the court liability determination that its process is subjective and that its process could not be separated for analysis into components that were objective and biased.we address each in turn.
subjective decision making 
lufkin argues that its promotion system is in fact overwhelmingly objective,and that the district court finding of subjective decision making lacks support.we review this finding for clear error.see kona tech.pac.transp,cir 
in watson,the supreme court defined subjective decision making as employment decisions based on the exercise of personal judgment or the application of inherently subjective criteria.at.the court indicated that a system which incorporates a mixture of subjective and objective criteria should generally be treated as subjective.id.at.however one might distinguish subjective from objective criteria,it is apparent that selection systems that combine both types would generally have to be considered subjective in nature.
at lufkin,promotions within the hourly ranks are putatively governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba between lufkin and three unions.under the cba,the company must post bid sheets for each new hourly opening.seniority is the main criterion for promotion.however,plaintiffs offered evidence that promotions are not rigidly awarded according to seniority.class members sylvester mcclain and florine thompson testified that they were personally bypassed for promotion in favor of a less senior white employee.plaintiffs presented additional evidence that approximately half of all promotions were not awarded to the most senior bidder.
moreover,the collective bargaining agreement cba contains an ability clause that allowed lufkin to fill positions on the basis of ability,regardless of seniority.the evidence indicates that ability determinations were not governed by objective standards.paul perez,lufkin vice president of human resources,agreed that the ability determination was subjective.mcclain testified that supervisors did not always truly evaluate ability when awarding promotions under the ability clause,but simply gave the position to the candidate they favored.billy webb,the union chief spokesman,testified that the union had taken issue with the ability provision in past contract negotiations because it did not think that the ability clause was always administered fairly.the cba also provides for a trial period following promotion.according to the testimony of one of its managers,lufkin has no written guidelines or formal tests for determining which employees pass this trial period.
plaintiffs also offered evidence that lufkin permitted its managers to apportion training opportunities subjectively,a process that disadvantaged black employees who sought promotions.perez testified that the cba does not govern employees daily work assignments,and he acknowledged that daily job assignments are not made on the basis of seniority.perez testified that there are no written policies determining who is to receive training,and lufkin does not track how such training is allocated among employees.in addition,mcclain testified that white employees were given more training in areas that were relevant to the jobs he sought.mcclain explained that when white managers and supervisors see a man they want to put on a particular job,they tap him for training after his shift,or for external training.according to mcclain,the employee who received the extra training would be the most qualified and would therefore receive the promotion once the job became available.
the district court also heard testimony that lufkin allegedly objective measures for determining which employees were eligible to bid,such as attendance and discipline records,are subject to variance and manipulation.lufkin has a computer program that tracks attendance,but both mcclain and thompson testified that the system was manipulable.if an employee was absent or tardy and the supervisor did not want the employee to lose credit,thompson stated that the supervisor could the employee or use the employee vacation days to skew the records.with respect to discipline records,steve reynolds,a lufkin supervisor,testified that there are no written criteria for determining when a rule violation should be written up.he stated that this decision is left to individual supervisors.
the evidence also supported that lufkin engaged in subjective decision making when awarding promotions in the salaried ranks.salaried positions are not governed by the cba,and company managers admitted that they were unaware of any guidelines,criteria,or documentation for the process of making promotions to salaried positions.rather,most promotions in the salaried ranks are awarded through an interview process 
in light of this evidence,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court erred in finding subjective decision making in lufkin promotion system.see united states gypsum.although lufkin offered some testimony during the bench trial that would tend to refute the court finding,it was within the province of the district court to accord this testimony less credibility than that of the class members and their experts.the reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under rule a if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.anderson city of bessemer city,d.accordingly,we can not say the court finding of subjective decision making in promotions amounted to clear error.
not capable of separation for analysis 
lufkin also challenges the district court finding that its promotion practices are not capable of separation for review.lufkin argues that if the court had isolated the objective factors in lufkin bidding practices and court could not have found a discriminatory impact.as explained above,title vii permits a plaintiff to demonstrate that the elements of the employer process are not capable of separation for analysis and thus that the process should be analyzed as one employment practice.k b i.this court has not addressed the precise conditions under which employment practices are not capable of separation for analysis.but where a promotion system uses tightly integrated and overlapping criteria,it may be difficult as a practical matter for plaintiffs to isolate the particular step responsible for the observed discrimination.see munoz orr,cir.some guidance is also provided by trial court decisions interpreting the provision.in stender lucky stores,the district court held 
where the system of promotion is pervaded by a lack of uniform criteria,criteria that are subjective as well as variable,discretionary placements and promotions,the failure to follow set procedures and the absence of written policies or justifications for promotional decisions,the court is not required to pinpoint particular aspects of the system that are unfavorable to the protected group.

there is no indication that the district court applied incorrect legal principles in determining that lufkin practices were incapable of separation.this finding of fact must be reviewed for clear error.see kona,at.lufkin lists various ways in which its employment practices were analytically separable,but the court express findings preclude separation according to those factors.
lufkin argues,for example,that the plaintiffs expert could have separated the challenged employment practices from its legitimate seniority system.the expert included in his analysis numerous promotions that contributed to the statistical shortfall in black promotions,even though these jobs were indisputably awarded to the most senior candidate.this argument ignores the district court finding that lufkin affords management considerable discretion in deciding whether to follow seniority in promotions.plaintiffs could not statistically analyze the actual practice they and discretionary application of the seniority excluding promotion based on seniority.seniority,the court found,was likely to have been irrelevant to the promotion.
lufkin also contends that the plaintiffs should have separated out instances in which candidates were properly denied promotions because of unsatisfactory attendance.this argument,too,runs afoul of the court finding that managers have substantial discretion in applying attendance rules.in such a system,a denial of promotion for poor attendance is not helpful to lufkin where promotions may also have been awarded following interpretation of employee attendance rules.
finally,lufkin contends that its paper bid sheets provided additional information that plaintiffs could have separated for analysis.to the contrary,the district court rejected the bid data,which lufkin prepared for purposes of this litigation,as unreliable and incomplete ample evidence supports this finding.
lufkin has not suggested any viable way,consistent with the court findings,in which the plaintiffs could have separated the promotion criteria for review nor has it shown the district court clearly erred in so finding.
statistically significant disparate impact in promotions 
lufkin maintains that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a statistically significant disparate impact against black employees in promotions.at trial,plaintiffs provided statistical evidence of discrimination through the report of their expert,richard drogin.after constructing hypothetical pools of employees who would be eligible for promotion,drogin found that during the class period,black employees received fewer hourly promotions and fewer salaried promotions than should have been expected given their representation in these pools.drogin determined that these differences were statistically significant at standard deviations for hourly promotions and at standard deviations for salaried promotions.in rebuttal,lufkin offered the statistical analysis of mary baker.baker conducted her calculations using bid data from lufkin paper bid sheets,and concluded that there was no statistically significant disparity in the promotion of blacks to hourly or salaried positions.faced with this battle of experts,the district judge credited the testimony of drogin over that of baker.
our role in reviewing this decision is limited.an appellate court owes great deference to the findings of the trial court with respect to duly admitted expert testimony.cleveland ex rel.cleveland united states,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to credit one expert over another.id.and we reverse a district court factual finding that an employment decision was the product of unlawful discrimination only if it is clearly erroneous.see bazemore friday,d anderson city of bessemer city,d.
with these standards in mind,we turn to lufkin specific contentions.first,lufkin argues that drogin analysis is legally insufficient because he did not use actual applicant lists and bid sheets to construct the availability pools consider potentially explanations for the promotions and factor in qualifications of potential applicants.lufkin is correct,of course,that actual applicant flow data are superior,and should be used if available.see anderson douglas lomason,cir.but as discussed above,the district court expressly found that the bid data were incomplete and unreliable,noting that more than half of the promotions were missing from the bid database which lufkin prepared in anticipation of this litigation.where actual data are unreliable,courts often permit parties to analyze potential applicant flow data.see,malave potter,cir berger iron workers reinforced rodmen local,hameed iron workers local,cir lewis bloomsburg mills,cir.the district court did not err in allowing plaintiffs to do so in this case.
lufkin argues that even if the bid sheets were unavailable,drogin regression analysis would still be insufficient because his hypothetical applicant pools do not take into account other minimum qualifications of applicants,such as education.however,in selecting an appropriate pool and performing regression analysis in title vii cases,the supreme court has taught that a plaintiff regression analysis need not include all measurable variables.see bazemore,at.i t is clear that a regression analysis that includes less than all measurable variables may serve to prove a plaintiff case.see also mozee am.commercial marine serv,cir.a plaintiff in a title vii suit need not prove discrimination with scientific certainty rather his or her burden is to prove discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.bazemore,at.we are satisfied that drogin regression analysis was sufficiently refined for plaintiffs to meet this burden.
finally,lufkin argues that a disparity in salaried promotions of only standard deviations does not support the district court finding of disparate impact.this court has rejected the contention that a disparity of two or three standard deviations is categorically insufficient to support an inference of adverse impact.see rendon,cir and lufkin has not persuasively explained why a standard deviation of this magnitude should be accorded reduced significance under the particular circumstances of this case.we therefore affirm the district court finding of a statistically significant disparate impact in promotions.
lufkin also challenges the award.the district court calculation of a back pay award is reviewed for clear error.shipes trinity,cir.
formula or individual hearings 
lufkin complains that the district court erred by using a formula to calculate the award rather than computing damages on an individual basis.the complexity of the case is the determining factor in what method the district court should utilize to formulate a award.pettway am.cast iron pipe,cir.whenever possible,back pay should be awarded individually and tailored to the actual victims of discrimination.united states steel,cir.if the class is small,the time period short,or the effect of the discrimination straightforward,individual determinations of each claimant position but for the discrimination are possible.pettway,at.if,however,the class is large,the promotion or hiring practices are ambiguous,or the illegal practices continued over an extended period of time,a approach to the measure of back pay may be necessary.see also shipes,at.
in this case,the district court concluded that the size of the class and the inherent uncertainty of the individual claims contraindicates the use of an individualized approach.we agree.we are not persuaded that the district court could easily make individualized inquiries for each of the more than plaintiffs in this case,as lufkin contends.further,as in pettway,there is no practical way to determine through individual hearings which jobs the class members would have bid on and obtained but for the discriminatory procedures lufkin had in place.see pettway,at.class members outnumber promotion vacancies jobs become available over time the vacancies involve different pay rates and a determination of who was entitled to a vacancy would have to be made by an evaluation of seniority and ability at that time.id.citing identical factors in approving the formula approach w here employees start at entry level jobs in a department and progress into a myriad of other positions and departments on the basis of seniority and ability over an extended period of time,exact reconstruction of each individual claimant work history,as if discrimination had not occurred,is not only imprecise but impractical.id.at.an individualized process of determining actual damages for each plaintiff in this case would result in the quagmire of hypothetical judgments that courts should avoid.id.at.accordingly,the district court neither abused its discretion nor clearly erred in adopting the approach.
specific methodology 
while lufkin levies various attacks on the district court methodology for determining the award,these need not all be considered.with the elimination of a finding of class discrimination in initial assignments to the foundry,the damage award must be vacated and remanded.
on remand,the district court will be dealing solely with damages attributable to approximately lost promotions in hourly pay grades and nine lost salaried employment promotions.the accepted way to apportion damages among a class of plaintiffs who outnumber the lost promotion spots is to compute the total additional wages attributable each year to each promotion and divide the value among the class members.see united states city of miami,cir dougherty barry,ginsburg,hameed iron workers local,cir.the district court should adapt this method with whatever modifications will both expediently and fairly apportion the lost wages among class members working in the multiple divisions of lufkin.
what the court may not do is return to drogin lost wages calculations given our disposition of this case.drogin estimated annual hourly wage disparities between black and white workers and black and workers and made a similar racial comparison for salaried workers.the conclusions in this section of his report were intended to demonstrate the systemic effects of racially discriminatory foundry assignments throughout workers careers.whether or not such conclusions would be supportable for both hiring and promotion claims,they do not pertain to the class claim that is now limited to lost promotions.drogin figures would come close to compensating each class member for the full value of lost promotions,where plainly each member had at best a possibility of progressing up the ladder.the district court is free to consider any additional evidence that the parties may offer on this issue.
limitation on the presentation of evidence and trial location 
lufkin argues that given the complexity of the issues involved in this case,the district court imposition of rigid time limits on the pres
