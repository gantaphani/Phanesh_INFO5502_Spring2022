the issue in this case is whether george perry,petitioner martha jane perry husband,died due to pneumoconiosis black lung disease.the administrative law judge,rejecting perry evidence,held that perry pneumoconiosis was not proven complicated and,therefore,a statute and regulation creating an irrebuttable presumption of causation did not apply.the benefits review board affirmed.perry questions the alj reasons for rejecting the opinions of the doctors who testified that perry had complicated pneumoconiosis that caused his death.the federal respondent,the director of the office of workers compensation programs,joins perry,at least so far as vacation and remand go,arguing specifically that the doctors testimony was sufficient to trigger the irrebuttable presumption of causation codified in and c.we grant the petition and remand for an award of benefits.
our summary of the medical evidence and the alj holding will benefit from a general understanding of the difference between simple and complicated pneumoconiosis.
in the explanation adopted by the alj,david rosenberg,one of mynu coals witnesses,summarized the difference as follows 
s imple coal workers pneumoconiosis is where you have micronodules that are discrete and that have not come together into a conglomerate mass.the micronodules,as a b reader,you categorize the various micronodules into different categories of p,q and r,and r would be up to millimeters in diameter.in simple cwp one can see that these micronodules are discrete and have not come together in a conglomerate mass.
with complicated cwp,what happens is that these individual micronodules fuse together and the body forms an immunologic reaction where tissue is destroyed within these conglomerate masses.one gets necrosis or destruction,liquefaction of tissue.one loses all structure,and it becomes a completely destroyed homogeneous mass of tissue within.and this is quite common in complicated cwp.and one sees anthracotic pigment that dispersed throughout this necrotic mass of tissue.
b asically the difference between simple and complicated disease is the absence of discrete micronodules in the complicated disease as the micronodules come together.
another of mynu coals experts,richard naeye,was of a slightly different view.he testified that complicated pneumoconiosis is not a fusion of simple nodules,but a different etiology.
in either case,it is agreed that the size of the mass and the extent of tissue destruction are considerations.this leads us to the supreme court description of the two types of pneumoconiosis,which,of course,we follow s pneumoconiosis is generally regarded by physicians as seldom productive of significant respiratory impairment whereas c omplicated pneumoconiosis,generally far more serious,involves progressive massive fibrosis and usually produces significant pulmonary impairment and marked respiratory disability,which may induce death by cardiac failure,and may contribute to other causes of death.usery turner elkhorn mining,d citing surgeon general report.some doctors in this.naeye and slightly this generalization,for example by testifying that simple pneumoconiosis can impair lung function,but they concurred that complicated pneumoconiosis has increased morbidity.
with this background,we turn to the facts.
george perry worked primarily as a bulldozer operator at a strip mine,and in a few other mining positions,for years.he was forced to retire in due to having failed a physical,which perry attributed to his pneumoconiosis.in addition to his mining work,perry smoked to packs of cigarettes per day for or years,though he stopped smoking at about the time he retired years ago.in,perry had a successful operation.at least one physician seeing perry for a surgical in august noted a history of coal workers pneumoconiosis,though the basis for this notation is unstated.
in late,in the months before he died,perry was taken to the hospital several times after experiencing trouble breathing.perry testified before the alj that her husband was constantly on oxygen.on january,perry was again taken by ambulance to the hospital for such breathing problems.there he received oxygen for his breathing problems,but he died a few days later,on january.the death certificate identifies acute cardiopulmonary renal failure as the immediate cause of his death and it lists coronary artery disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,and chronic renal failure as contributing causes.
perry filed a timely claim for survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act,et,and its implementing regulations,parts,and.following a proposed decision and award of benefits by the director,mynu coals objected and requested a hearing,which was granted.the record principally consists of the reports and deposition testimony of various doctors,described below.
after perry death,an autopsy was performed by paul mellen.mellen is board certified in the anatomic,clinical,and forensic branches of pathology he was at the time employed by the charleston area medical center and also served as a clinical professor of pathology at the university of west virginia.mellen testified that he had performed a hundred or so autopsies to evaluate for pneumoconiosis.mellen description of how he diagnosed complicated pneumoconiosis was consistent with its defining characteristics he looked for aggressive massive fibrosis or coal nodules,relying on whether a gross exam revealed anthracosis blackening,scarring,and on dissection,black nodules measuring at least two centimeter s in diameter.mellen acknowledged that anthracosis does not necessarily mean fibrosis,nor are pigmentation and size sufficient rather,the usual gross appearance and significant lung fibrosis are necessary.
mellen autopsy report concluded that perry suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis in both lungs,mild copd,and cancer in the right lung.the diagnosis of complicated pneumoconiosis rested on marked anthracosis with advanced associated scarring of both upper lobes.this was confirmed by a gross viewing as well as microscopic.the nodules were not.consistent with his report,mellen testimony suggested,though not in so many words,that perry death was caused by complicated pneumoconiosis.more specifically as to the diagnosis,mellen determined that a nodule in the right lung was a mixture of pneumoconiosis and cancer,and a nodule in the left lung was complicated pneumoconiosis,or as he otherwise characterized it,coal dust with fibrosis.mellen conclusions were based on his gross viewing of the lungs and confirmed by microscopic slides.this was the testimony in support of perry 
several doctors testified or issued reports contrary to mellen to the effect that pneumoconiosis did not cause perry death.since the claim of error in this case concerns the alj reasons for rejecting mellen conclusions,which did not rest on these doctors views,we briefly summarize this evidence.everett oesterling,and richard naeye opined that pneumoconiosis did not contribute to the decedent death,but that death was attributable respectively to arteriosclerosis and cancer.oesterling found moderately severe pneumoconiosis but determined that it did not impair perry pulmonary function.naeye opined that the silica crystals in perry least as reflected on the slides he not toxic and that there was insufficient black pigmentation and necrosis for a diagnosis of complicated pneumoconiosis.david rosenberg and morgan,both specialists and,also attributed death to a cause other than pneumoconiosis,variously pulmonary edema with coronary artery disease,renal failure,and cancer.morgan thought it significant that perry had worked most of his career,meaning that the dust he was exposed to would not have been coal dust 
the alj summarized this evidence and found mynu coals experts to be more credible than perper,though he ranked equally the various physicians.but,apparently owing to mellen status as the autopsy prosector,he treated and rejected mellen views on three grounds unrelated to mynu coals doctors that mellen statements with respect to the composition of the nodules and with respect to what size they would have been on an were equivocal mellen unfamiliarity with perry smoking history and mellen failure to identify pneumoconiosis as a cause of death.
perry appealed to the benefits review board,which affirmed the denial of benefits on the same grounds as did the alj.
we review the findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence,and the legal conclusions de novo.see island creek coal compton,cir.as,the alj must consider and weigh all the evidence presented.see at.and the alj must explain which evidence is relevant and why he credited the evidence he did.see sterling smokeless coal akers,cir.
in addition to these familiar standards,our decision is framed by the black lung benefits act implementing regulations.a pneumoconiosis death benefits claimant must prove that a decedent died as a result of the disease.see a this means that the claimant must establish that the decedent had coal workers pneumoconiosis as defined by the act,that the disease arose from coal mine employment,and that death was due to pneumoconiosis.see shuff cedar coal,cir.
as the alj observed,all the physicians in this case agreed that perry had some form of pneumoconiosis,so perry satisfied her burden of proof on the existence of the disease.the alj also held that perry pneumoconiosis was presumptively caused by his mine employment,a finding not challenged by mynu coals.accordingly,the first two elements of recovery are not at issue.
what is contested is the element of causation.by regulation,there are three ways to prove it.see c.the first two are if competent medical evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was the cause of the miner death,or pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner death or where the death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis.c emphasis added.these are essentially codifications of ordinary standards of proof,though the latter shifts the burden somewhat in that pneumoconiosis qualifies if it hastens the miner death.id.c.in light of the medical differences between the two forms of pneumoconiosis,which form afflicted perry is relevant to whether the disease was capable of causing,and whether it actually caused,his death under either method.
the third method,our main concern here,is the irrebuttable presumption of causation created by statute and regulation.see c and c see also coal,owcp,cir noting virtual identity between the statute and regulation.specifically,the presumption attaches if pneumoconiosis,
a when diagnosed by chest yields one or more large opacities greater than centimeter in diameter and would be classified in category a,b,or c in one of classification systems or 
b when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy,yields massive lesions in the lung or 
c when diagnosed by other means would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield the results described in paragraph a or b of this section had diagnosis been made as therein described 
thus,by statute or regulation,an opacity of sufficient,one centimeter if not,one that is massive becomes a proxy for the tissue mass characteristic of complicated pneumoconiosis.see coal,at referring to this as statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.
the alj failure to apply the presumption of causation on the basis of mellen testimony wrongly confused the presumption with the other methods of proving death due to complicated pneumoconiosis.the alj rejection of the presumption illustrates this conceptual error because i find that complicated pneumoconiosis was not established,criterion is not met.ja criterion refers to the presumption of complicated pneumoconiosis.this same mistake is repeated in the opinion of the board,as it affirms the alj finding that perry has not established the evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis.of course,the decision of the alj,as repeated by the board,is simply wrong.it does not address the necessary premises of the statutory presumption but only finds that since the conclusion was not otherwise proven,the presumption is not effective.the director of workers compensation has caught this error.he takes the position that the evidence in this case is sufficient to prove that opacities greater than cm in diameter would have been shown by had been made so that the presumption in c would apply.also,we note,without contradiction,that the prosector of the autopsy,mellen,described massive lesions in both lungs,another statutory ground for application of the presumption.specifically,mellen autopsy report contains a notation of multiple jet black nodules measuring up to cm in the upper part of the miner right lung.mellen further describes a similar nodule measuring cm in the upper left lung.mellen contrasts these findings with the observation that the lower portions of the miner lungs are densely anthracotic without mass lesions.emphasis added.these determinations by the prosector are relevant evidence which may only lead one to conclude that massive lesions were present in the upper part of the lungs sufficient to trigger the presumption under b of 
put simply,both the alj and the board have required the plaintiff to otherwise prove that the miner suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.and for that reason,they find that the statutory presumption would not apply.correctly what the plaintiff needed to prove were the premises of the presumption and,if proven,the statute provides the irrebuttable presumption of complicated pneumoconiosis.
furthermore,mellen testimony supports the irrebuttable presumption under a of on the basis of the size of the nodules found in the miner lungs.mellen testified that the fibrous masses were four and six centimeters wide,in the right and left lobe,respectively,and that they therefore would have been greater than one centimeter had they been.the alj basis for rejecting mellen testimony as equivocal was mellen statement that he was not percent sure of his conclusion.we disagree.read in context,mellen qualification was at most an acknowledgment that uncertainty is part of medicine.a refusal to express a diagnosis in categorical terms is candor,not equivocation,and we are of opinion that it enhances rather than undermines mellen credibility.in contrast,the other doctors adamancy that their opponents were incorrect in all or nearly all respects detracts from credibility.
more importantly,mellen was the only doctor to assess the size of the nodules in gross and under a microscope.even mynu coals doctors agreed that this gave him additional perspective they lacked.for instance,rosenberg acknowledged that conducting the autopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing disease.mellen also testified that the microscopic slides,which he created,on which the other doctors relied exclusively,and which were said to be of excellent technical quality,were too small to encompass a of the tissue and therefore were of limited utility.so,while naeye claimed that the slides did not support the gross diagnosis,which testimony the alj did not cite to reject mellen view,naeye had a partial picture,literally and figuratively.and while naeye wonder ed how accurately mellen measured the lesions,he did not opine about their measurement.for these reasons,mellen testimony about the size of the lesions had they been was uncontradicted 
mynu coals doctors maintained,however,that mellen not having perry entire medical history was an offsetting disadvantage.this testimony seems to be reflected in the alj statement that mellen opinion might not have been the same had he known about perry smoking history.this is surmise unsupported by the record.mellen stated that he had enough medical history to diagnose,and he confirmed rosenberg gold standard testimony by explaining that,between medical history or a gross viewing,the latter is better.moreover,mellen testified that he had identified the cancer,which was common in smokers,and that he did not attribute the cancer to exposure.
we also note that the alj justifications applied largely to the mass in the right lobe.indeed,the alj discussion of the mass in the left lobe consists of a description of mellen testimony as being that both masses could be comprised of coalescent smaller masses.this mischaract
