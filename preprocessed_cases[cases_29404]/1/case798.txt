damalis rosalina perez suriel de batista,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,petitions for review of a july,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia concluding that she is ineligible for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under d because the child she attempted to smuggle into the united states was not her spouse,parent,son,or daughter.d.the bia construction of the statutory term son to exclude a nephew is reasonable,notwithstanding the fact that the nephew is treated by his aunt as though he were her son.we therefore deny perez petition for review.
background 
damalis rosalina perez suriel de batista has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since september.
on january,perez returned to the united states after a trip to the dominican republic.with her was a child traveling under the name josé miguel fuentes.fuentes was in fact perez nephew,robinson rafael valdez perez.perez had paid the mother of the real josé miguel fuentes more than for the child passport,social security card,and birth certificate.after immigration inspectors at new york john kennedy airport ascertained robinson true identity,they returned him to the dominican republic and placed perez in removal proceedings as an inadmissable alien under a e.
perez applied before immigration judge ij william van wyke for a section d waiver,arguing that robinson is her son within the meaning of that statute.perez younger sister was years old when she gave birth to robinson in.the sister left home shortly thereafter.the baby remained with perez and her mother,who is robinson biological grandmother.when perez moved out of her mother home a year and a half later,she took robinson with her.perez raised robinson until she moved to the united states in.she left the boy in his grandmother care.perez continued to support the boy financially from the united states,and visited him in the dominican republic about once every seven months.robinson saw his biological mother sometimes,but has never lived with either of his natural parents.hr g,november,at.i loved him as if he was my son,perez testified at her november,hearing before the ij.hr g tr.at.
perez says that she decided to bring robinson to the united states because he was having difficulties at home.hr g tr.at.robinson grandmother did not make enough money to support him.perez feared that robinson would be unable to obtain an education in the dominican republic and that he did not receive adequate affection from his natural parents.perez testified that when she spoke to him on the phone,he cry a lot,and he would tell her that he missed her.hr g tr.at.
the ij concluded that perez was eligible for a waiver under section d,which provides 
d temporary admission of nonimmigrants 
the attorney general may,in his discretion for humanitarian purposes,to assure family unity,or when it is otherwise in the public interest,waive application of clause i of subsection a e,providing that a ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law is inadmissible,a e i,in the case of any alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of removal,and who is otherwise admissible to the united states as a returning resident,if the alien has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided only an individual who at the time of such action was the alien spouse,parent,son,or daughter and no other individual to enter the united states in violation of law.
because robinson is in his reality and perez reality,her son,the ij considered it within the attorney general discretion to grant a waiver.in the matter of damelis,no.immig.city,at.he then granted a waiver,reasoning that doing so served the provision stated humanitarian and public interest objectives,noting that perez had attempted to smuggle robinson for the purpose of family unification,the very purpose for which a waiver is permitted here.id.at.
the department of homeland security appealed to the bia.the bia,in a per curiam decision,vacated the portion of the ij decision that held perez eligible for the waiver.in re damalis rosalina perez suriel de batista,no.july.the bia recognized that unlike the term child,which is precisely defined by statute to mean a person under years of age who stands in a specified biological or adoptive relationship to the alien,the term son or daughter is not separately defined in section d or in the general definitional provisions in section of the act.id.but because elsewhere in the immigration and nationality act ina,one son or daughter must have once been the same person child and the term child is not susceptible to a functional reading,the bia reasoned that the word son,as used in section d,similarly is not susceptible to such a reading.
in her petition,perez argues that the words only,son,and no other person,do not exclude her relationship with robinson because her nephew was functionally her son and the section d waiver is available for a woman functioning as a mother who tries to smuggle into the united states a male child functioning as her son.
discussion 
standard of review 
when the bia issues an opinion,the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.chen gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review de novo the bia underlying conclusions of law,with the caveat that the bia interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the ina are owed substantial deference unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.mardones mcelroy,cir quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
although the ij granted perez application for a waiver of inadmissibility in exercise of the discretion vested in the attorney general under section d and delegated to the ij,the bia concluded that perez was not eligible for one.on this petition,we are thus asked to review the bia conclusions of law interpreting a section of the ina.analysis of the bia interpretation under chevron is therefore required.see singh gonzales,cir see also ins,d recognizing that the chevron framework applies when an agency arrives at an interpretation of an ambiguous statutory term through a process of adjudication.under the first part of the chevron analysis,if the statute clearly addresses a particular issue the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.singh,at quoting chevron,at.under the second part of the analysis,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue that was before the agency,the question for the reviewing court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,at.
ii.definition of son 
to prevail under the first prong of the chevron test,perez must demonstrate that the term son in d unambiguously includes robinson.this she can not do.if anything,the explicit limitation of the statute reach to a specifically enumerated list of qualifying relationships spouse,parent,son,or daughter and no other individual,d strongly supports the bia interpretation of son to exclude an other individual like a nephew.indeed,even though the statute does not explicitly define son,the language of the statute seems precise enough to require our denial of the petition.
even if section d were ambiguous in this regard,however,application of the second prong of chevron would require denial of the petition.it directs us to determine whether the bia construction of the statute is permissible.chevron,at.perez argues that the meaning of son must be determined with reference to the three broad purposes listed at the outset of section d.the language to which she refers reads the attorney general may,in his discretion for humanitarian purposes,to assure family unity,or when it is otherwise in the public interest,waive the otherwise applicable bar to admissibility.d.according to perez,the purpose of promoting family unity would be furthered by including her nephew within the meaning of the term son.
