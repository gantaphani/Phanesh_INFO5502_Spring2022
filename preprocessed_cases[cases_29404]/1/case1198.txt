opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal by mercy home health mhh from an order of the district court entered march,granting summary judgment in favor of the secretary of health and human services the secretary.mhh sought review in the district court of the secretary final decision denying certain medicare reimbursements for home office costs that mhh claimed pursuant to an alternative cost allocation method previously approved by the medicare fiscal intermediary.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm.
ii.factual and procedural history 
medicare reimbursement 
under title xvii of the social security act the medicare act,et,the secretary administers the medicare program through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms most medicare providers receive reimbursement through fiscal intermediaries intermediaries for services provided to medicare beneficiaries.intermediaries contract with the secretary to determine the amounts due and are bound by the secretary regulations and interpretive rules.see.
congress authorized the secretary to promulgate regulations establishing the method or methods to be used for determining reasonable costs.shalala guernsey mem l,d citing v a.the secretary implementing regulations define reasonable cost as including reimbursement of only necessary and proper costs for furnishing covered services related to beneficiary care.a.during the time period at issue,medicare reimbursed home health agencies based on their cost actually incurred,less any costs unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.v a.
prohibition on 
the medicare act requires the secretary regulations to take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services,and to ensure that medicare does not pay costs of patients,and that other insurance programs do not pay the costs of medicare patients.id.to prevent,the act further directs the secretary to provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.id.
record keeping requirements 
because the secretary must verify the provider actual costs to ensure proper payment,i t is hardly surprising that the reimbursement process begins with certain record keeping requirements.guernsey mem l,at.at.to this end,the medicare act provides that no such payments shall be made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due such provider for the cost period at issue.a.the implementing regulations further state that p roviders receiving payment on the basis of reimbursable cost must provide adequate cost data.a.according to the regulations,the data must be accurate and in sufficient detail to accomplish the purposes for which it was intended,and the data must be auditable.id.at c.
cost allocation 
the home office of a chain of health care providers is not a medicare provider and can not directly receive medicare reimbursement.see.nevertheless,inasmuch as home offices may perform certain centralized services for a provider subsidiary,medicare treats those support services as though obtained from the provider itself.c.the secretary interpretive rules,found in the provider reimbursement manual,cms pub.prm,address how a provider may obtain reimbursement for home office support functions.
to obtain reimbursement for home office support functions related to the care of medicare patients,the provider home office files a cost statement,which identifies the allowable home office costs and how they are allocated among each of its subsidiary companies also called components.see prm.first,the home office totals all of its own costs,including those that it incurred on behalf of its subsidiary companies,and deletes from that total all unallowable costs.see id.at a.second,the home office uses direct allocation to allocate as many of its costs as possible.direct allocation accounts for home office costs that are for the benefit of,or directly attributable to,its medicare subsidiary or its other subsidiaries.see id.at b.third,the home office must allocate as many of the remaining costs as possible on a functional basis.see id.at c.
after the home office allocates as many home office costs as possible to its subsidiaries by direct and functional allocation,a pool of allowable costs for general management or administrative services remains pooled costs.see id.at d.if the chain consists of companies providing health care services and other types of companies,all the companies share in the pooled home office costs in the same proportion that the total costs of each component excluding home office costs bear to the total costs of all components in the chain.id.at d b.thus,the default methodology for allocating pooled costs is a cost allocation methodology.
if a home office has higher costs for one of its providers,but performs few services for that company,the home office may use a more sophisticated alternative allocation method to allocate the pooled costs more precisely.see id.at d b.the prm specifies the procedure the home office should follow if it wants to use an alternative allocation method 
if evidence indicates that the use of a more sophisticated allocation basis would provide a more precise allocation of pooled home office costs to the chain components,such basis can be used in lieu of allocating on the basis of either inpatient days or total costs.however,intermediary approval must be obtained before any substitute basis can be used.the home office must make a written request with its justification to the intermediary responsible for auditing the home office cost for approval of the change 
where the intermediary approves the home office request,the change must be applied to the accounting period for which the request was made,and to all subsequent home office accounting periods,unless the intermediary approves a subsequent change for the home office.
cost reconciliation and review 
the medicare act requires payments to providers,at least monthly,based on estimated costs.see a.the act also requires the secretary to establish a process to reconcile estimated payments made with the actual amount due and requires that regulations create a reconciliation process.see id.at v a.
the provider initiates the cost reconciliation process by filing an annual cost report with the intermediary.see b.the intermediary audits the cost report,see id.at c,and issues a notice of program reimbursement npr,which informs the provider of the amount of reimbursement due for medicare services during that fiscal year,id.at.the intermediary then adjusts ongoing payments to account for overpayments or underpayments.see a.to further ensure that intermediaries correctly reimburse medicare providers,the secretary regulations allow intermediaries to reopen cost determinations within three years of the date of the npr.see a.intermediaries must reopen a determination if cms notifies them that an npr is inconsistent with applicable law,regulations,or cms general instructions.see id.at b i see also prm.
if the provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary determination and meets the amount in controversy requirement,the provider may appeal to the secretary provider reimbursement review board prrb.see a see also providing that intermediary determinations after reopening are subject to appeal.the prrb may hold a hearing and issue a decision that is subject to further review by the secretary delegate,the cms administrator.see f.the cms administrator may decline to review or may,affirm,reverse,modify or remand a prrb decision.see d,g.the final decision of the secretary issued by the prrb or the cms administrator,is subject to judicial review.see f.
factual background 
mhh is mercy home health services the home office only medicare provider subsidiary on july,the home office sent a letter to its fiscal intermediary,independence blue cross,requesting permission to use an alternative allocation method for the pooled home office costs of its various chain components.the letter stated,s ince the majority of our business is service oriented,the costs in the h ome o ffice should be largely allocated to those subsidiaries with high personnel costs,such as mhh.app.at.the home office claimed in a letter dated november,that there would be a distorted allocation to its durable medical equipment subsidiary under the default method due to that subsidiary high cost of goods sold.
on august,independence blue cross responded by letter requesting additional information,including a more detailed justification for the change.app.at.independence blue cross indicated that it would make a final determination after reviewing the additional information and noted that all methodologies that we approve are subject to verification during audit.id.at.in response the home office provided a more detailed description of its proposed alternative allocation method and referred independence blue cross to other data it previously had supplied in connection with quarterly reports.specifically,the home office explained that it believed an allocation of costs to all subsidiaries on a cost basis the default method would result in an inappropriately large allocation of home office costs to its durable medical equipment subsidiary on february,independence blue cross approved the request.
the home office used this alternative allocation method through fiscal year.on june,independence blue cross,without elaborating on the basis for its decision,notified the home office that as of january,it no longer would accept the home office alternative cost allocation method.in response,mhh unilaterally implemented a second alternative allocation method,effective january,but independence blue cross never approved this method.
in,independence blue cross voluntarily terminated its contract as a medicare fiscal intermediary by notice dated september,the successor intermediary reopened and adjusted mhh and the home office cost reports for fiscal year to substitute the default method for the first alternative method approved by independence blue cross.this adjustment decreased mhh allowable costs by.the successor intermediary similarly reopened and adjusted the cost reports for fiscal year,reducing medicare reimbursement by.the successor intermediary also adjusted all costs reports for based on the default method,thereby rejecting mhh second alternative allocation methodology,which mhh had adopted unilaterally.
procedural history 
decision of the prrb 
mhh separately appealed to the prrb from the successor intermediary adjustments to fiscal years and.after a consolidated hearing,the prrb reversed the disallowance for fiscal years but affirmed the disallowance arising out of mhh unapproved use of the second alternative allocation method during fiscal years.in reversing the disallowance for fiscal years,the prrb held that mhh reliance on the intermediary written instruction should be protected even if the successor intermediary subsequently changes its position.
decision of the secretary 
the parties sought review of the prrb decision by the acting deputy administrator administrator of the cms,who granted review and partially reversed by reinstating the successor intermediary adjustments to fiscal years the administrator concluded that the first alternative allocation method used in was similar to and based on the same rationale as the second alternative allocation method that the prrb examined and disapproved for use in.upon a review of the entire record,the administrator determined that mhh failed to demonstrate that the prior approved methodology for allocating home office costs is,in fact,a more accurate and sophisticated method.app.at.
notably,the administrator rejected mhh reliance argument 
the administrator does not agree that the methodology for the fys and can be allowed only on the basis that it was approved by the prior intermediary.this basis for such an allowance ignores the dictates of the medicare program set forth in v a of the act and elevates the prm prior approval provisions above the requirements of the statute.a general principle under medicare set forth at v a of the act is that to be reimbursable,the cost must be related to patient care and that medicare shall not pay for costs incurred by beneficiaries,and,that is,medicare prohibits of costs.moreover,the documentation requirements of the statute and the regulation places the burden of demonstrating that costs are to be paid by medicare on the provider.
app.at.the administrator reiterated that regardless of the prior approval which is subject to audit,the successor intermediary properly disallowed mhh cost allocation methodology because mhh failed to articulate a valid rationale supporting its methodology.app.at.above all,the administrator stressed that prior approval,or the lack thereof,can not negate the medicare cost principle prohibiting cost shifting.app.at.
decision of the district court 
mhh sought review of the secretary final decision in the district court.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court denied mhh motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary.the district court based its decision primarily on b,which follows the congressional directive of v a to provide for retroactive corrective adjustments of prior costs reports,even after a provider has submitted its fiscal and statistical reports.the court rejected mhh claim that it reasonably relied on the intermediary prior approval of its cost allocation methodology,and the court concluded that the administrator rejection of the alternative allocation methodology for fiscal years was supported by substantial evidence.on april,mhh timely filed its notice of appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to f,and we have jurisdiction under over mhh appeal.we can set aside the administrator decision only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence,is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or is otherwise not in accordance with law.a,e see also f providing that judicial review of reimbursement decisions shall be made under the administrative procedures act.because we apply the same standard of review as the district court,we will proceed de novo with respect to our review of the district court disposition.see mercy catholic med.ctr.thompson,cir see also robert wood johnson.hosp.thompson,cir.
the decision of the agency is entitled to deference as articulated in chevron natural resources defense council,d.see robert wood johnson,at.under chevron,we first must determine if congress has spoken directly to the question at issue,and if congress intent is clear,our inquiry ends as we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.at.if we decide that congress has not spoken directly to the issue and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we must ask whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.if we find that it is,we afford deference to that interpretation.id.if congress explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at.at.
it is well settled that a court must afford substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.thomas jefferson.hosp.shalala,d.this broad deference is particularly appropriate in contexts that involve a complex and highly technical regulatory program,such as medicare,which requires significant expertise and entail s the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also wisconsin of health and family serv.blumer,d.thus,a court does not have the task to decide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.thomas jefferson,at.at.instead,the agency interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.
iv.discussion 
mhh asserts that we do not owe deference to the administrator decision allowing
