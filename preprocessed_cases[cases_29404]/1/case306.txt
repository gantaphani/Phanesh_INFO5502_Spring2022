petitioner five star transportation,five star seeks judicial review of the decision of the national labor relations board nlrb finding that it engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of a of the national labor relations act act when it refused to hire,or even consider for hire,six school bus drivers who wrote critical letters and email messages to the belchertown school district district in an effort to dissuade it from granting five star a bus services contract for the through school terms.after a thorough review of the record,we reject five star claims and enforce the nlrb decision.
background 
we recount the facts as found by the nlrb.the belchertown,massachusetts,school district has a practice of contracting with private bus companies to provide transportation services for its students.such contracts usually last for three years and are secured through a competitive bidding process.the bus services contract was awarded to a company now known as first student,first student.upon assuming operations,first student recognized the united food and commercial workers union,local union as the bargaining representative for its drivers,and first student and the union entered into a series of agreements governing wages,work rules,and fringe benefits.
in early january of,nearing the expiration of the district contract with first student,the district began organizing the bid process for awarding the bus services contract.as a part of the bid specifications distributed to potential vendors,the district required that any new vendor give current drivers first consideration for employment.the union,daniel clifford,also wrote to all prospective bidders notifying them of the union representation of the belchertown school bus drivers,and stating the union desire to continue such representation regardless of which company won the contract.
at the january,bid opening meeting,five star submitted the lowest bid.thereafter,on january,clifford wrote to the district expressing his concern that five star bid was so lower than the it was questionable whether it would be able to maintain the drivers wage and benefit levels,and the safe and effective service,then provided by first student.clifford also requested that all bidders be required to offer employment to the incumbent vendor drivers at a level of wages and benefits no less than provided by the predecessor,and submitted a draft resolution for the school board on the matter.
that same day,clifford also faxed a letter to teresa lecrenski,the president of five star,requesting her guarantee that five star would voluntarily recognize the union as the drivers bargaining representative,would continue the drivers employment with full seniority,and would meet with the union to negotiate a successor agreement.the letter further stated 
if we do not hear back from you promptly on these issues,we will infer that you do not intend to cooperate in these reasonable demands on behalf of our members and if you are awarded the contract,we will exercise all of our legal options as aggressively as a labor union could be expected to protect the benefits of its members.
lecrenski did not respond to clifford letter.
on january,clifford held a meeting with a group of belchertown school bus drivers to discuss the implications of five star bid on the drivers wages,benefits,and work conditions.at the meeting,two former five star employees spoke about their negative experiences with five star,including job instability and untimely responses to bus breakdowns and mechanical problems.clifford also distributed newspaper articles documenting several safety incidents that had marred the company in.following the presentation,clifford urged the belchertown drivers to write to the district expressing their concerns,and provided them with the names and addresses of district officials,and a sample letter requesting that the district rebid the contract with the stipulation that all bidders commit to honoring the terms of the agreement.
between february and february,the district received fifteen letters from belchertown school bus drivers.these letters varied widely in content and tone,but most of them expressed the drivers concern that,in the event five star won the transportation contract,they be allowed to continue in their jobs at the wage and benefit levels,and in a safe working environment.the awarding of the contract was delayed while the district considered the issues raised by the letters,but on february,five star was officially awarded the school bus service contract for the through terms.
prior to securing the contract,lecrenski had been notified by the district of the existence of the letters and,at her request,she was granted copies of them.after five star was awarded the bus services contract,seventeen former first student drivers who were members of the union bargaining unit applied for a position at five star.of these,only six were hired.lecrenski admits that the sole reason the other eleven applicants were not hired or even considered was because they had written letters critical of five star.
on august,the union filed a charge against five star with the nlrb alleging that b y failing to hire former unionized belchertown bus drivers,the company ha d discriminated against them because of their protected and concerted activity.on march,the nlrb general counsel general counsel filed his complaint and notice of hearing against five star,and an evidentiary hearing lasting three days was held before an administrative law judge alj.on june,the alj issued his decision finding,inter alia,that five star had violated a of the act with regard to nine of the eleven drivers who were not hired or considered for hire based on their critical letters to the district.the other two drivers were found to have written letters that were not protected by the act.five star filed exceptions,and the general counsel partial exceptions,to the alj decision,and the case was raised to the nlrb.
a panel of the nlrb reviewed the alj findings and the parties exceptions and supporting briefs.it divided the eleven drivers into three categories those whose letters had failed to raise common concerns those whose letters primarily raised such concerns and those whose letters primarily disparaged five star.the nlrb concluded that five star had violated a only as to the six drivers belonging to the second group,because only those drivers actions were protected by the act.it ordered these drivers reinstated and granted back pay with interest the remaining drivers were properly denied employment.see five star,wl.five star promptly sought judicial review.

violation of a 
for over half a century it has been established that an employer may violate a of the national labor relations act through both its hiring and firing practices.see phelps dodge nlrb.to differentiate between discrimination in denying employment and in terminating it,would be a differentiation not only without substance but in defiance of that against which the prohibition of discrimination due to union affiliation is directed.see also nlrb horizons hotel,cir upholding the nlrb determination that the employer refusal to hire predecessor employees because of their union affiliation violated a of the act.five star argues,however,that its refusal to hire the six letter writers identified by the nlrb discriminatees does not qualify as an unfair labo
