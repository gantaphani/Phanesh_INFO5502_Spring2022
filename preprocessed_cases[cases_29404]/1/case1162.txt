this case comes to us on appeal from the district court judgment in favor of camille dejesus camille and cheryl faulk faulk,plaintiffs and appellees in this case.following a bench trial,the district court determined that the department of veterans affairs the va was liable on a theory of gross negligence for the shooting deaths of camille and faulk children by camille husband,alejandro dejesus,dejesus,just eighteen hours after he was released from a residential housing facility located on the va grounds.on appeal,the va argues that it had no statutory or duty to protect the children from dejesus.camille and faulk,claiming the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the va on their claims.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
the tragic factual background to this case centers around dejesus,an honorably discharged enlisted man.dejesus was married to camille,with whom he had three children,alex,age,candida age,and felicia age dejesus had a history of domestic violence that culminated in when camille obtained a temporary ex parte protection from abuse order requiring dejesus to stay away from his son alex,for one year,following an incident in which he allegedly struck alex,repeatedly.following the incident,dejesus was arrested and placed in jail.while in jail,he attempted to hang himself by his shoelaces.after he was released,dejesus had no home to which to return and began living on the street,occasionally visiting homeless shelters.
in september,dejesus voluntarily entered the va domiciliary program as an unemployed,homeless veteran with substance abuse problems.the domiciliary program is an inpatient program designed to help veterans with the process of moving from homelessness and unemployment to being active members of the work force.most patients in the domiciliary program spend approximately days in the program and then attempt to transition back into the community.it is considered the least restrictive means of inpatient treatment at the.
at the time he entered the domiciliary program,dejesus was initially evaluated by edward moon,a clinical psychologist working at the.moon evaluation found that dejesus had a history of domestic violence,and,while dejesus had denied depression,he admitted sadness and bordered on lability when speaking of his estranged family.in addition,dejesus indicated to moon that while he was not currently suffering from any homicidal or suicidal thoughts,he previously had thoughts about hurting others and previously attempted suicide.moon report also suggested that unemployment and homelessness were triggers for dejesus destructive outbursts.during his time at the va domiciliary program,dejesus reported to a case manager that he was concerned because he had killed a man when in vietnam and felt nothing while doing so.
based on this information,moon believed that dejesus had intermittent explosive disorder.according to trial testimony,i ntermittent explosive disorder is a disorder which involves some discrete incidents of either destruction or violence,those incidents are disproportionate to the stimulus,and those incidents do not occur or are not better explained by another diagnosis,such as antisocial personality disorder individuals suffering from intermittent explosive disorder are generally not violent between episodes,only occasionally exhibiting violence or impulsiveness at a low level.following violent episodes,those with the disorder often exhibit signs of calm and remorse.persons with intermittent explosive disorder repeatedly react to the same stimuli and display the same response in each violent episode.
following this preliminary evaluation by moon,dejesus saw a va psychiatrist,saul glasner,who confirmed moon initial diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder.glasner prescribed doses of mg of tegretol,an medication which has been successfully used to control intermittent explosive disorder.a second va psychiatrist,tirso vinueza,found that dejesus was suffering from mild depression and would be seen on an as needed basis.because vinueza was not informed that dejesus was on tegretol and did not read dejesus chart,he was unaware of glasner diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder.no medication was prescribed for the mild depression.there is no indication in the record that dejesus ever saw another psychiatrist during his stay at the domiciliary program.
after his psychiatric evaluation,dejesus was assigned a team that would head up his treatment at the domiciliary program,including psychotherapy and substance abuse counseling.although she was not dejesus original case manager also called his primary therapist,denise came to take over that position during his time at the domiciliary program,dejesus attended group therapy sessions headed by and underwent therapy at sessions.at no time during her management of dejesus case did familiarize herself with dejesus medical history or become aware that he had been diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder.in addition,despite the fact that was treating dejesus for substance abuse problems,she was never aware of what,if any,medications he was on.
after dejesus completed approximately months in the domiciliary program,recommended him for placement in landing zone ii transitional residence.is a program of the philadelphia veteran and education center,which serves as a transitional program for veterans who may live and work at for up to two years.is a privately run,organization that is funded by the va homeless grant and per diem program.it is located on the grounds of the va medical center at coatesville in a building owned by the.as part of its grant to,the va provides all medical and psychiatric services to residents,including emergency medical and psychiatric care.the va also provides police and fire services.staff members regularly consult with va case managers and mental health workers regarding the residents.
residents at are subject to a number of restrictions.while they may leave the residence,they are required to sign in and out and must provide an account of their whereabouts.residents may not keep alcohol in their rooms,which are subject to search by at any time if the facility deems such a search necessary.conducts weekly inspections of every resident room.
while at,dejesus participated in a voluntary aftercare program,during which time was available to him for continued therapy.at the time dejesus was admitted to,had permission to release to all personal information regarding dejesus that she had in her possession,including his medical and psychiatric history.despite this permission,never released any of this information to.in fact,on her recommendation form for,indicated that dejesus had no mental health issues or behavioral problems,despite the evidence in the va records that dejesus had intermittent explosive disorder and suffered from violent outbursts and suicidal ideations.
on november,dejesus contacted and informed her that he was engaged in court proceedings to seek partial custody of or,at least,visitation rights for his younger daughter,felicia.at that time,he indicated that his estranged wife would not allow him any contact with her,and that his prior abusive behavior had led his older children,alex,and candida,to avoid contact with him.on january,dejesus told that he was g etting quite frustrated with the court.despite a letter wrote to the family court,dejesus still had not gained custody over his daughter and,in addition,candida and his wife had seen him at a custody hearing but refused to speak to him.he expressed his gratitude to that he was in this facility to vent his feelings and maintain his sobriety.
on february,received a phone call from a man requesting to speak to camille.recognized dejesus voice and realized that he had mistakenly called her while trying to contact his estranged wife.her log entry following the conversation read 
phone rang around hours and the person on the other end asked for camille.responded saying they had the wrong number and then recognized the voice to be familiar.asked if it was dejesus and this veteran responded,yes.dejesus was trying to call media to contact his estranged wife and had some how called the do r learned that he had just been served his divorce papers and he was very distraught on the phone.talked briefly and asked him to see undersigned asap to process his feelings and talk.he said he would call back.
emphasis added.dejesus never called back and never undertook any.
on march,dejesus was working in the kitchen at,preparing breakfast with other residents.dejesus entered into a verbal confrontation with another resident,bill queen,over a dirty bucket of water.while residents versions of the events differed,all agreed that at some point during the altercation,dejesus picked up a knife,held it behind his back,and queen felt threatened.the knife incident only lasted a matter of minutes,and,while dejesus did not injure anyone,the knife had to be forcibly removed from his hands.
after the altercation,contacted and bruce newell,queen therapist,to discuss the situation.the va recommended that dejesus be discharged.while claimed it was under no obligation to follow the va recommendation regarding his dismissal from the program,it relied heavily on the va staff advice and would not have dismissed dejesus the va recommendation.dejesus was involuntarily discharged from the program for creating a physical threat with a weapon.after he was told that he would be discharged from,dejesus was quiet and said he would leave.before he left,dejesus met,said that he loved her,gave away a number of his personal possessions,and informed several people that he would be walking to maine or new hampshire.
at this time,expressed concern over dejesus mental and offered twice to take dejesus to seek a psychiatric evaluation.he declined both times.after dejesus declined to be seen,contacted stephen chambers and christopher ray,two va psychologists,to inquire as to whether she could require dejesus to seek counseling before he left.despite the existence of involuntary commitment procedures at the va,they both informed her that he could not be forced to be seen because he was an outpatient.however,when she asked them,she did not inform them that dejesus was giving away his possessions or inform them about his prior history of domestic abuse and suicidal ideations,often triggered by a change in job or home situation.had she informed him of that information,chambers believed he may have suggested she have dejesus involuntarily committed.
in her following the incident,wrote 
dejesus did quite understand or refused to understand the seriousness of picking up this knife to use as a weapon.he was offered twice during meeting to be escorted over to bldg to outpatient to have a stat psychiatric consult.dejesus did not want to utilize this offer of support and just said he would leave today after he gave a few of his items away to current residents.he stated he would be walking to new hampshire or maine.concern arose by undersign ed for him to be seen due to his past history of wanting to hurt others,particularly his estranged wife who recently served him divorce papers and has not allowed contact with youngest daughter for over a year.he is in a custody battle with wife.he has also in past had thoughts of hurting self.
emphasis added.at no point on march did dejesus make any specific threats against his wife or children.
following dejesus release from,the staff conducted a search of dejesus room and found that he had shredded much of his clothing,including a baseball cap that was of particular importance to him.despite the fact that this behavior is consistent with suicidal tendencies,no one who was called to consult thought to make use of pennsylvania involuntary commitment procedures or emergency psychiatric intervention under the va internal procedures.
dejesus left sometime on the afternoon of march.approximately eighteen hours later,on march,dejesus charged through the door of camille apartment and shot two of their children,alex,and felicia,and two neighbor children,aaron faulk and michael faulk.alex,felicia and aaron faulk died immediately.michael faulk died two days later in the hospital.after shooting the four children,dejesus turned the gun on himself.upon hearing about an incident involving a man killing his children and then himself on the news,immediately thought it was dejesus.
on january,camille and faulk instituted a suit against the united states,the va,the philadelphia veterans center,and under the federal tort claims act ftca individually and on behalf of the estates of their children for the march deaths.the complaint included claims for the va gross negligence in discharging or failing to treat dejesus when he was an imminent threat,failure to warn,wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the district court granted the va motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs claims on february,finding that a mental healthcare provider only has a duty to warn if a patient communicates a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily injury against a specifically identified or readily identifiable third party.following the conclusion of motions,the district court heard the remaining claims without a jury.
at trial,the plaintiffs presented an expert,robert lloyd goldstein,who testified that dejesus behavior leading up to the shootings was very consistent with someone suffering from intermittent explosive disorder.he stated that the phone call to indicated the beginning of a crisis.he further testified that the incident with the knife was a sign of decompensation or deterioration.dejesus diagnosis as having intermittent explosive disorder indicated his propensity to have explosive outbursts under the circumstances it was certainly something to pause and be concerned about.in situations like the one presented following the knife incident,goldstein stated that it is imperative to take into account a patient history when making treatment decisions.he believed that the va grossly failed in its duty in this regard as no one was familiar with dejesus full medical history when someone should have been.
goldstein also testified that,under the circumstances,dejesus should not have been released.his willingness to give away his personal belongings indicated a propensity for suicidal behavior.further,anyone familiar with dejesus tendency to have violent outbursts after facing frustration in his home or work life should have known that to expel him from was,in effect,to expel him from his job and to completely isolate him from his support system not long after he learned he would be getting divorced.goldstein stated that to do so would be to take someone who is already in crisis and seriously compound that crisis.the failure to share information,the failure to correctly recognize dejesus suicidal tendencies,and the failure to prevent dejesus release constituted gross negligence.
the va also presented an expert witness,brooke zitek,who testified regarding involuntary commitment procedures in pennsylvania.she testified that most patients who are involuntarily committed are suffering from much more severe psychotic episodes than dejesus.t he person is totally lacking in terms of their sic judgment and their sic insight into their sic illness.she did not believe that dejesus behavior during the knife incident created a clear and present danger as required by pennsylvania commitment procedures.other than the february phone call and the march knife incident,zitek did not believe that dejesus had exhibited any behavior that indicated a serious demeanor change.
on cross examination,zitek admitted that,of the factors typically considered in determining whether a psychiatric emergency existed,all of them applied to dejesus.dejesus also exhibited several signs indicating a tendency toward suicide.she also testified that ideally the therapist would have known dejesus diagnosis.however,zitek maintained her position that the va did not grossly deviate from the standard of care.in its final decision,the district court stated that it found goldstein credible while zitek testimony was equivocal and unconvincing.
following testimony,the district court found sufficient evidence to enter judgment against the va,finding it was grossly negligent in its determination that dejesus should be discharged from and in its failure to commit dejesus following the discharge.these violations of the appropriate standard of care proximately caused the shooting deaths of the four children.therefore,the district court awarded damages to camille and faulk individually and on behalf of the estates of their children for gross negligence and wrongful death.additionally,the district court found that camille had proven the necessary elements for negligent infliction of emotional distress and awarded her additional damages on that claim.
the district court had jurisdiction over this ftca claim pursuant to b.we exercise jurisdiction over this appeal from a final judgment of the district court pursuant to.we review the legal decisions of a district court conducting a bench trial de novo,but f indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous and due regard must be given to the trial court judgments as to the credibility of the witnesses.colliers lanard axilbund lloyds of london,cir citing.a.because the liability of the united states under the ftca is determined by the law of the state where the allegedly tortious act occurred,we will look to the state courts to determine how to resolve the underlying legal issues.if there is no applicable decision from the state highest court,we are charged with predicting how that court would resolve the issue,considering what that court has said in related areas the decisional law of the state intermediate courts federal cases interpreting state law and decisions from other jurisdictions that have discussed the issue.id.internal citations omitted.we must attribute significant weight to these lower state court decisions in the absence of any indication that the highest state court would rule otherwise.id.because the conduct in question took place in pennsylvania,its law properly governs this action.
the primary issue that we are presented with is whether the va had a duty under pennsylvania law to protect the third parties who were killed when dejesus was released from.because camille and faulk have the district court decision to grant the va summary judgment on their claims,we begin our analysis with the pennsylvania supreme court decision in emerich philadelphia center for human development.taking its cue from the california supreme court landmark decision in tarasoff regents of the university of california,cal d,the pennsylvania supreme court recognized that,while there is generally no duty to control the conduct of a third party,where the defendant stands in a special relationship to the victim or some other party,the victim deserves protection.emerich,at.therefore,the court held that when a mental health professional determines that her patient presents a serious danger of violence to another,that mental health professional has an affirmative duty to warn the intended victim.id.at.
however,recognizing that to read that duty too broadly would result in crippling an already profession,the pennsylvania supreme court carefully delineated its application.before a mental health provider has a duty to warn or otherwise protect a third party from a threat presented by a patient in her care,the threat must be a specific and immediate threat of serious harm,and the victim must be readily identifiable.id.at.
in their,camille and faulk make a novel argument regarding why the va had a duty to warn camille of her husband behavior.however,this is a clear case where emerich does not apply.camille and faulk agree that there was no specific threat of immediate harm made against camille or her children before dejesus left.rather,they argue that because wrote a letter to the family court attesting to dejesus improved mental health,the va then had a duty to inform any person who may have relied on that letter if dejesus mental health state changed.however,the outcome of court proceedings can affect numerous parties,and it would be very difficult to identify all persons who would have relied on letter.because of the pennsylvania supreme court narrow reading of claims,we do not believe that,given the opportunity,it would expand emerich to a situation that involves no specific threat of immediate harm against a readily identifiable victim 
as the district court did not base its judgment against the va on a claim,we next address whether camille and faulk appropriately recovered because the va owed a different duty to their children.in all tort cases,a duty may be imposed either through case development or through statute.emerson adult cmty.total,see serbin ziebart intern,cir looking to both statute and common law to determine existence of a duty.we therefore look to both kinds of duties to determine the scope of the va duty to the victims in the case before us.
while the pennsylvania supreme court has not specifically addressed the duty to protect third parties in situations other than failure to warn,the pennsylvania superior court has twice stated that there is no duty to protect third parties in situations like the one presented here.in ferrara,the parents of a girl who was sexually assaulted by a resident of a mental health facility brought suit against the operators of that facility.they alleged,inter alia,that the mental health facility was negligent in failing to seek a civil commitment of the resident,who had a long history of sexual misconduct.id.at.the court found that there was no general duty to control the conduct of a third party to protect another from harm unless there is a special relationship that imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person conduct or unless there is a special relation between the actor and the other id.at.no such duty existed as to the facility.further,the court declined to adopt section of the restatement,which imposes a duty to prevent a from doing harm on o ne who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled.restatement second torts.based on balancing policy considerations the court stated 
if we allow recovery against mental health and mental retardation providers for harm caused by patients except in the clearest circumstances,we would paralyze a sector of society that performs a valuable service to those in need of mental health care.thus,we decline to impose a duty of ordinary care under restatement second of torts section on providers of mental health and mental retardation services.
id.at see also heil brown,refusing to find duty where a police officer was struck by a vehicle driven by a patient receiving voluntary outpatient care from the defendant health institution.
we find this reasoning compelling and believe that,given the opportunity,the pennsylvania supreme court would adopt a similar approach it is unlikely that the pennsylvania supreme court would adopt a general duty to commit a patient or otherwise protect third parties from a mental health patient absent a special relationship.therefore,liability can not be based on a duty owed to the four victims in this case.
however,duties that give rise to claims sounding in tort are not found only in decisions.in,the pennsylvania legislature passed the mental health procedures act mhpa.the relevant portion reads 
in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence,a county administrator,a director of a facility,a physician,a peace officer or any other authorized person who participates in a decision that a person be examined or treated under this act,or that a person be discharged,or placed under partial hospitalization,outpatient care or leave of absence,or that the restraint upon such person be otherwise reduced,or a county administrator or other authorized person who denies an application for voluntary treatment or for involuntary emergency examination and treatment,shall not be civilly or criminally liable for such decision or for any of its consequences.
taking the converse of the statutory language,the pennsylvania supreme court has found an affirmative duty exists requiring that mental health institutions avoid gross negligence or willful misconduct in the treatment of mental health patients.sherk dauphin.in the landmark case on the mhpa,goryeb pennsylvania department of public welfare,the pennsylvania supreme court held that the act language,which limits liability,also expressly creates a duty 
when a commonwealth party participates in a decision that a person be examined,treated or discharged pursuant to the mental health procedures act,such a party shall not be civilly or criminally liable for such decision or for any of its consequences except in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence.conversely,and most importantly to the instant case,a commonwealth party participating in a decision to examine,treat or discharge a mentally ill patient within the purview of the mental health procedures act who commits willful misconduct or gross negligence can be liable for such decision.
id.at emphasis added.
the supreme court further explicated the scope of the duty created by the mhpa.the language in the mhpa states that no liability will be imposed for the decision itself or for any of its consequences.a.clearly,the words any of its consequences indicate the legislative recognition that discharging a severely mentally disabled person is a potential serious danger not only to the patient himself but to others.goryeb,at.therefore,whenever a plaintiff can prove that the hospital failed to meet its duty to refrain from gross negligence in decisions regarding treatment,discharge or commitment of a patient,the hospital is liable for injury to the person or property of third parties where such injury resulted from a hospital negligent failure to meet its responsibility.id.quoting vattimo lower bucks,see also sherk,at.
based on goryeb and sherk,the superior court in ferrara found that there was a duty created by the mental health and mental retardation act,an act similar in structure and purpose to the mhpa.ferrara,at.the court held that the guidance center,a organization that provided only guidance to the residents of group home,had a duty to refrain from gross negligence.id.at therefore,if is a facility covered by the mhpa,then the va had a duty to refrain from gross negligence in its treatment and discharge decisions regarding dejesus.
the first question that presents itself under the mhpa is whether and the other va parties involved in dejesus release from are subject to the mhpa.the va argues that,in this instance,they were not the mhpa applies to physicians or other authorized persons who participate in a decision to treat or examine a person under the act,or a decision regarding discharge.treatment is defined as diagnosis,evaluation,therapy,or rehabilitation needed to alleviate pain and distress and to facilitate the recovery of a person from mental illness and shall also include care and other services that supplement treatment and aid or promote such recovery.it is uncontraverted that treated dejesus.as his primary therapist,undertook therapy sessions with dejesus,provided him support,and helped him deal with his substance abuse problems.
further,both and chambers participated in the decision to discharge dejesus from.while the va has argued that it was,not the va,that ultimately decided to discharge dejesus,the district court found that the va and its employees were key players in all decisions made regarding dejesus,particularly in the decision to release dejesus from.we can reverse this determination only if it is clearly erroneous.miller phila.geriatric,cir.based on the fact that consulted the va staff extensively before making a decision to release dejesus and that the va provided all mental health care to residents,we find that the district court did not err in its determination that the va,and not,was primarily responsible for the decision to release dejesus.
however,determining that the va provided physicians and other authorized persons who participated in decisions regarding dejesus ultimate discharge does not bring it within the mhpa.rather,the va is only liable under the duty imposed by the mhpa if dejesus was a patient at an appropriate facility.the mhpa applies to involuntary treatment of mentally ill persons,whether inpatient or outpatient,and for all voluntary inpatient treatment of mentally ill persons.pennsylvania courts have held that the mhpa does not apply to voluntary outpatient treatment.emerich,at see also chartiers comm.mental health retardation center,of pub.welfare.
prior to trial,both parties stipulated to the fact that,when he was at,dejesus was receiving outpatient treatment from the.however,that stipulation is not dispositive.in the case before us,we are not examining the va decision to discharge dejesus from the voluntary,outpatient treatment he was receiving from and others at the.rather,we are examining the va decision to have release dejesus from the community in which he had been living for over a year.nothing in the mhpa requires that the physician or other authorized person actually work for the inpatient facility where the patient is located.rather,it requires that a physician or authorized person participates in a decision to treat or discharge the patient.therefore,if dejesus was an inpatient at,and the va participated in a decision to treat or discharge him,it may still be liable under the mhpa for improperly suggesting that discharge dejesus and then failing to commit him.
whether a community living facility like constitutes a facility that provides inpatient treatment is a question of first impression for this court and the pennsylvania courts.as in all cases that depend on statutory interpretation,we begin with the language of the statute.under the mhpa 
inpatient treatment shall include all treatment that requires full or residence in a facility.for the purposes of this act,a facility means any mental health establishment,hospital,clinic,institution,center,day care center,base service unit,community mental health center,or part thereof,that provides for the diagnosis,treatment,care or rehabilitation of mentally ill persons,whether as inpatients or outpatients.
generally,the terms of the mhpa have been broadly construed by pennsylvania courts for example,in allen montgomery hospital,the pennsylvania supreme court ruled that the limited liability provision of the mhpa extended to care given by a physician in a hospital for physical ailments plaguing a mentally ill patient.t he general assembly did not intend to limit treatment to that only directly related to a patient mental illness.instead,treatment is given a broader meaning in the mhpa to include medical care coincident to mental health care.id.at.the broad construction of the mhpa guides our interpretation of the inpatient requirement and leads us to believe that the pennsylvania supreme court would find that,under the specific facts of this case,was providing inpatient treatment to dejesus.
the district court found the following facts had rules by which its residents must abide to continue living there residents were prohibited from having alcohol in their rooms residents at were required to sign in and out of the facility oversaw residents finances to ensure residents were being fiscally responsible reserved the right to conduct room searches at any time and conducted actual searches on a weekly basis as an resident,dejesus took part in group therapy sessions and continued counseling in substance abuse as an resident,dejesus had mental health help available to him dejesus had continued access to his primary therapist.based on these specific facts,we conclude that dejesus was an inpatient within the meaning of the mhpa.
dejesus was not simply residing in an apartment subsidized by.rather,he was a resident at a facility that closely monitored nearly every aspect of his life his job,his daily movements,his finances,and his mental.even his ability to retain his place of residence rested on his continued willingness to abide by rules that limited his freedom and involved a substantial reduction in his personal privacy,in addition to providing dejesus with a place to live,provided him,through its contract with the va,with access to mental health care,continue
