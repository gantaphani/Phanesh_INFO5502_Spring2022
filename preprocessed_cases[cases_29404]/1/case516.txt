legal background 
a union must usually demonstrate majority support among an employer employees in order to enter a collective bargaining agreement with an employer.however,in the construction industry,the nature of the employment and the contractor need for predictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor makes such arrangements impractical.thus,c ollective bargaining agreements in the construction industry are commonly negotiated before the employees are hired because employers must be able to fix labor costs to make bids,and have a supply of skilled craftsmen ready for quick referral.timothy volk,prehire agreements in the construction industry,com.in response to this industry practice,congress passed section f of the national labor relations act in.f.this portion of the act provided that construction industry employers may recognize unions prospectively.id.specifically,section f provides 
it shall not be an unfair labor practice for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members because the majority status of such labor organization has not been established or such agreement requires as a condition of employment,membership in such labor organization 
as we explained in goodless ii,u nder section f,a construction industry employer may enter into a relationship with a union whereby the union bargains on behalf of the employer employees prior to a showing that the union has garnered the support of a majority of the employees.goodless ii,at.a section f relationship is known as a prerecognition agreement the employer does not formally recognize the union,but only agrees to bargain with it for a limited period of time.the union may obtain more permanent collective bargaining rights if it can convert the section f relationship into a section a relationship.section a provides for a traditional collective bargaining agreement,whereby 
r epresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes,shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,or other conditions of employment 
a.under section a,once a union has become the representative of a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit,the employer is required to bargain with the union as the employees bargaining representative.goodless ii,at.
unions are often eager to convert a section f relationship into a more permanent section a relationship.the precise requirements for converting a section f into a section a relationship have been delineated in many nlrb precedents 
the nlrb has held that section f status may change to section a status by virtue of either a election or as the result of the employer voluntary recognition of the union as the majority collective bargaining agent.voluntary recognition requires the union unequivocal demand for,and the employer unequivocal grant of,voluntary recognition as the employees collective bargaining representative based on the union contemporaneous showing of majority employee support.
id.citing james julian,nlrb.this case concerns a dispute over whether goodless voluntarily recognized local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers the union.
factual background 
the background facts of the case are essentially undisputed.they have been summarized in goodless ii,at,and are developed at length in the findings of fact appended to the nlrb administrative law judge original decision in the case.see goodless i,nlrb at.we review only their basic outline here.
goodless and the union established a section f relationship in,from which either goodless or the union could withdraw upon giving days notice.by,the economy in the region began to falter and goodless sought relief from certain provisions of the agreement in order to keep its business competitive.in june,goodless indicated to the union that any relationship between goodless and the union would expire as of june.
the next month,the union threatened to cut off target money to goodless if it failed to sign a letter of assent affirming its section f relationship the letter included the following language 
the employer agrees that if a majority of its employees authorize the local union to represent them in collective bargaining,the employer will recognize the local union as the nlra national labor relations act section a collective bargaining agent for all employees performing electrical construction work within the jurisdiction of the local union on all present and future jobsites.
leon goodless signed the letter on behalf of goodless on july.
almost a year later,goodless and the union discussed the possibility of extending goodless section f relationship with the union beyond the original june,termination date.when negotiations stalled,the union business agent,douglas bodman,held a meeting of all goodless employees.he encouraged them to sign authorization cards as evidence of their desire for continued representation,and all did so.the cards stated 
i authorize local union of the international brotherhood of electrical workers to represent me in collective bargaining with my present and future employers on all present and future jobsites within the jurisdiction of the union.this authorization is,binding and valid until such time as i submit a written revocation.
goodless ii,at.bodman presented the cards at goodless next meeting with union representatives on june.although leon goodless reacted angrily to the presentation of the cards,he later consented to a extension of bargaining with the union,agreeing to continue the f relationship from july,to december.
at the end of,goodless again indicated its desire to terminate its relationship with the union.the union responded via letter on december,claiming that the letter of assent signed on july,bound goodless to recognize the union as the exclusive bargaining agent if a majority of its employees authorized the union to represent them in collective bargaining.the union claimed to have demonstrated majority support at the june,meeting,and therefore alleged that goodless could neither repudiate its collective bargaining relationship with the union nor negotiate directly with its employees.
goodless ignored the letter and ceased recognizing the union for collective bargaining purposes as of january.contending that it had achieved section a status,the union complained to the nlrb that goodless had engaged in unfair labor practices
