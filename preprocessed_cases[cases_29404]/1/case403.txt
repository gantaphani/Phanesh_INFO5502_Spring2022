petitioner bertha toloza asks us to review the board of immigration appeals bia denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.after careful review,we affirm the decision of the bia and deny the petition for review.
background 
toloza is a native and citizen of colombia who entered the united states at miami,florida on july,as a with authorization to remain in the united states until january.her husband and son,both natives and citizens of colombia,had previously been admitted into the united states on tourist visas.all three overstayed.
on january,toloza filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.in her application for asylum,toloza alleged that in,she lived with her husband and daughter in the aranjuez ward in medellín,colombia according to toloza,some members of the escobar crime family sexually harassed her daughter,threatened to kill toloza if she reported them to the police,and forced her to hide weapons for them.in,toloza purchased a farm.she stated in her application that the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc,a guerilla group,took possession of the farm in to use as a military base.in,toloza and her family moved to the san cristóbal ward in medellín because of threats from the escobar crime family at this new location,toloza husband,who owned a repair shop,was allegedly forced to contribute money to the farc.in one instance,toloza claimed that the farc stopped her and her husband at a checkpoint and forced them to transport farc members in their truck.in,toloza purchased another farm where she allegedly offered assistance to victims of the civil war.
the asylum officer found that the alleged harm did not rise to the level of persecution on the basis of any of the statutory grounds and that toloza had failed to establish a fear of future persecution.the asylum officer referred the matter to an immigration judge ij.
on january,the immigration and naturalization service ins served notices to appear charging that toloza,her husband,and her son were subject to removal for overstaying their visas pursuant to section a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b.
on march,a hearing was held before an ij.at the hearing,toloza,her husband,and her son admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear,conceded removability,and asked for asylum,withholding of removal,relief under the cat,and voluntary departure in the alternative.toloza then testified in support of her application 
she testified that she had visited the united states on two previous occasions,in and,before requesting asylum.toloza stated that the farc threatened and persecuted her and her family because she was a member of the liberal party.she testified that the farc threatened her in march the march incident that the farc regularly extorted money from her husband,and that she was stopped at a farc checkpoint and forced to transport guerilla troops in.
on,toloza admitted that she had omitted the march incident from her application for asylum.when asked to explain this omission,toloza first intimated that she had forgotten about the incident,then stated that she had remembered the incident but did not include it in the application.toloza also stated that the only incident that she mentioned at the interview at the asylum office was the checkpoint incident maría mahia mahia,a friend of toloza from colombia,also testified for her.mahia stated that toloza had told her of the problems with the guerillas.however,mahia did not witness any of the harms alleged by toloza.
the ij found that toloza testimony was general,meager,weak,and superficial.more specifically,the ij found that the testimony about the march incident was not credible.the ij based his finding on the fact that toloza initially remembered neither the month when the event happened nor how many farc members threatened her,and that she did not include the march incident in her asylum application or mention it in her interview with the asylum officer.in the light of the fact that the march incident purportedly precipitated the toloza flight to the united states,the ij noted that toloza meager testimony was disingenuous at best.further,the ij found that the incident had no connection to her present situation because she visited the united states twice after the event occurred and each time she returned to her country,thus demonstrating that she did not fear persecution.the ij also concluded that the alleged harm experienced by toloza was caused by pervasive criminality in her country and not by persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.therefore the ij denied toloza claims for asylum,withholding for removal,and relief under cat.the ij also concluded that toloza was not eligible for voluntary departure,but that her husband and her son were.
toloza appealed the ij decision to the bia.on july,the bia rendered a decision affirming the order of the ij.toloza now petitions for review of this decision 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in reviewing bia decisions,we give substantial deference to its findings of fact,which include credibility determinations.nikijuluw gonzáles,cir bocova gonzáles,cir da silva ashcroft,cir.we will uphold the bia findings of fact if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the bia decision can be reversed only if the evidence presented by the asylum seeker is such as would compel a reasonable trier of fact to make a contrary determination.see also ins,cir.nonetheless,credibility findings resting on analysis of testimony rather than on demeanor may deserve less than usual deference.ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the bia rulings of law are reviewed under a de novo standard.da silva,at.
under the ina,the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security may grant asylum to a refugee.b a.the asylum applicant has the burden of proof to establish that she is a refugee.id.b b i.her testimony must be credible,persuasive,and refer to specific facts.id.b b ii.a refugee refers to any person who is unable or unwilling to return to her country of residence because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.by establishing past persecution,an applicant establishes a rebuttable presumption of a fear of persecution.b.we have previously held that persecution requires that the totality of a petitioner experiences add up to more than mere discomfiture,unpleasantness,harassment,or unfair treatment.nikijuluw,at.we analyze the adverse credibility determination,together with toloza claims of past persecution and a fear of persecution.
credibility 
in her brief,toloza does not challenge the adverse credibility determination.she has therefore waived any argument on this issue.see mediouni ins,cir.
past persecution 
the adverse credibility determination disposes of toloza claim of past persecution.see olujoke gonzáles,cir a fully supported adverse credibility determination,without more,can sustain a denial of asylum.b b.even assuming toloza was credible,she failed to establish past persecution for two reasons.
first,persecution is more than unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering.nelson ins,cir.even assuming that toloza was credible,none of the incidents described by toloza rises to the level of persecution.see id.at finding no persecution where the asylum applicant testified about three episodes of solitary confinement of less than hours,physical abuse,periodic surveillance,threatening phone calls,and occasional stops and searches.
second,persecution must be motivated by one of five statutory grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b b i.although toloza alleges that she is a member of the liberal party,encouraged her fellow citizens to vote for the democratic parties,and provided assistance t
