facts proceedings 
epd is a garbage collection and disposal company incorporated in texas with its principal place of business in el paso.the international union of operating engineers,local,afl cio the union was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for epd maintenance unit employees on,and for epd drivers unit employees on october.between these dates on october,the union sent an official notice to epd demanding that it bargain with the maintenance unit employees.
the first negotiating session occurred late in january.between that time and late november,the union and epd held fourteen bargaining sessions,each of which lasted for about five hours.it was difficult to schedule these sessions because the attorney for epd only had authority to speak on behalf of epd and not to enter into agreements without a management official present.
the parties first attempted to address the issues.as of august,four issues remained unresolved,no lockout,management rights,and dues check off.the union had proposed the dues check off clause in the first bargaining session held in january.in may,the union offered to accept the management rights clause if epd would accept the union dues check off clause.this offer was reiterated to epd by the union on may.epd rejected this offer without explanation and never submitted a written counterproposal to the union on this issue.
in september,the union informed epd that its members had voted unanimously to strike.the parties decided to change the focus of negotiations from the remaining issues to the economic proposals.early in october,after continuing to discuss the union economic proposals,the parties agreed that gene dupra,a management official for epd,would meet with the employees and ask prepared and approved questions about the employees concerns,epd performance,and the union.duprea told some employees that he would discuss the employees concerns with his supervisors.during the negotiations,epd made unilateral work policy changes.these included requiring an employee to supply a doctor note to use sick leave after a holiday,transferring an employee from one driver position to another,with a change in pay rate from hourly to incentive,and suspending its longevity bonus a watch after ten years of service for one employee.
at a meeting about a month later,epd stated its belief that sufficient progress had been made for it to present a last,best,and final offer at the next meeting.the union disagreed because both dues check off and remained to be settled.epd nevertheless presented its last,best,and final offer to the union in november.that offer consisted of articles,of which only had been mutually agreed on previously.the articles included management rights,holidays,sick leave,uniform,fringe benefits,no lockout,wage increase,and longevity bonuses.the management rights provision would grant epd discretion in setting workplace rules,as well as disciplining,discharging,subcontracting,and employees.a federal mediator delivered the union counter offer on several of the articles to epd,most of which epd refused to accommodate.
after that meeting,but on the same day,the union held a general meeting with the employees of the maintenance and drivers units.the union negotiator told the employees that epd was willing to budge on the union proposals.he then explained the difference between an economic strike and an unfair labor practices strike,and he stated that the union would be filing an unfair labor practices charge against epd.the union members then voted unanimously to begin a strike on november.
that meeting was held on november.at the next morning,epd held a mandatory meeting for the drivers no union representative was present.epd summarized its final offer for the maintenance unit and told the drivers that the proposed contract was for both units.epd then informed the drivers that if they joined the maintenance strike,they would be permanently replaced.prompted by a question from an employee,epd explained how to get rid of the union.epd then called a meeting with the maintenance unit for november,to inform those employees that any of them who struck would be permanently replaced.
the strike began at on november.a total of workers from one or the other units joined the picket line in front of epd facility.the next day,epd called the el paso police department to complain that the picketers were obstructing motorists vision and to request that the police send officers to the picketers location.epd began hiring replacement employees that day by the end of the week epd had replaced all striking workers.
early in december,the union made an unconditional offer to return to work.epd rejected the offer the next day and informed the union that it considered the strike to be an economic one,that all strikers were permanently replaced,and that no vacancies existed.epd did create a preferential hiring list of striking workers,onto which all but three of the striking workers signed.by the middle of may,however,only two striking workers had been offered five replacement mechanics had left epd.also,two welding positions came open in may,but these were not offered to any of the striking workers.and,even though epd discharged fifteen of its replacement drivers,it did not offer any of these positions to striking workers.the few strikers hired from the preferential hire list were treated as new hires they were required to fill out paperwork as if they were new hires,were offered lower wages,and were denied longevity bonuses,such as a certificate of appreciation and a check for for fifteen years of service.
in,fifty drivers signed a petition declaring that they no longer wished to be represented by the union.in december,epd received two more disavowal petitions,both from the maintenance unit,with signatures on each.prior to that month,one driver filed a decertification petition with the nlrb seeking to decertify the union as the bargaining representative of the drivers unit.
in march,epd granted its first wage increase in three years to the employees in the bargaining units.and drivers received a percent pay increase,and hourly replacement drivers received a percent increase.epd neither notified the union prior to granting these increases nor provided the union an opportunity to bargain over these increases.
in april,an administrative law judge alj issued a decision on six charges that had been filed by the union with the nlrb between november and march.the alj generally agreed with the union that epd had violated the act in many ways,including bad faith bargaining and dilatory negotiating practices.the alj ruled that the strike was an unfair labor practices strike and that the december disavowal petitions were tainted by epd unfair labor practices.a different alj heard testimony on three subsequent charges filed with the nlrb between november and march.
proceedings 
plaintiff appellee,cornele overstreet,the regional director of the nlrb,filed an administrative complaint against epd late in january.in it,he alleged that epd had engaged in unfair labor practices under the act in violation of a and at the end of april,overstreet filed another administrative complaint against epd,this one alleging unfair labor practices,including practices relating to the strike and the failure to reinstate strikers after the union terminated the strike in december.after epd responded to these two complaints,the alj issued a recommended decision and order in april,to which both parties filed exceptions.these matters are still pending before the nlrb.overstreet filed two other administrative complaints that year,one in february and the other in may.hearings on these complaints were held in august and are still pending before the nlrb.
in july,following issuance of an administrative complaint and pursuant to j of the act,overstreet filed the instant petition for injunctive relief in the district court.epd challenged the petition and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.after conducting a hearing,the district court denied epd motion to dismiss and granted overstreet temporary injunction,which required epd to offer the striking workers immediate reinstatement and ordered epd to recognize the union and resume bargaining.epd timely filed a notice of appeal.in december,this court denied a motion to stay the injunction.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court determinations of subject matter jurisdiction de novo when we review injunctive relief under j,we conduct a sequential inquiry whether the board,through its regional director,has reasonable cause to believe that unfair labor practices have occurred,and if they did,whether injunctive relief is just and proper.a district court need only decide that the nlrb theories of law and fact are neither insubstantial nor frivolous to rule that the board had reasonable cause we review the district court factual determinations for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo we review whether injunctive relief is just and proper under an abuse of discretion standard.
epd urges that we should employ the traditional equitable test for injunctive relief,or at least require a showing of irreparable harm,when we evaluate the propriety of injunctive relief under j we have said,however,that al though traditional rules of equity may not control the proper scope of j relief,some measure of equitable principles come sic into play.this is because s ection j is itself an extraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly and then only when the nlrb,in its discretion,is concerned that either a employer or an union has committed such unfair labor practices that any final order of the nlrb would be meaningless and the remedial purposes of the act will be frustrated without an injunction to preserve the status quo.
a requirement,such as proposed by epd,to make the nlrb show irreparable harm and likelihood of success for j relief would raise the factual threshold that the nlrb must reach nothing in pilot freight carriers,or in our case law,supports replacing the test we currently use with a hybrid that incorporates the traditional test for equitable relief.although the principles of equity inform an evaluation for j relief,the two part pilot freight carriers test remains the clear operative test for evaluating such relief 
subject matter jurisdiction 
epd contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under j to issue the injunction because the petition was neither considered nor authorized by the nlrb.alternatively,epd claims that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the nlrb has not had a quorum since january,as a result of which the general counsel had no authority to petition the court for an injunction under j.
section j of the act states that the board 
shall have power,upon issuance of a complaint as provided in subsection b of this section charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice,to petition any united states district court,within any district wherein the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or wherein such person resides or transacts business,for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.upon the filing of any such petition the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person,and thereupon shall have jurisdiction to grant to the board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper 
none questions that the nlrb has the power to request a j injunction.in this case,however,it was the general counsel,not the nlrb,who requested the injunction.the nlrb had delegated its j authority to the general counsel,effective december.the act creates the position of general counsel for the board and states that the general counsel shall have final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section of this title,and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the board,and shall have such other duties as the board may prescribe or as may be provided by law.
a general limitation on the ability of the board to delegate duties to the general counsel lies in the distinction between prosecutorial duties and adjudicatory functions.epd attempts to frame the board petition power under j,and the decision whether to pursue j relief,as an adjudicatory function.petition power under j is prosecutorial in nature,however,despite the fact that it includes the decision to seek an injunction.other courts have held that the nlrb may delegate only prosecutorial duties,and not adjudicatory functions,to the general counsel every court that has considered the question whether the board may delegate petition power to the general counsel under j has held that it may do so as the fourth circuit noted in muffley,seeking injunctive relief is prosecutorial because it is the district court,and not the general counsel,that ultimately grants or denies relief after adjudicating the petition the board may delegate its petition power under j to the general counsel,so the district court was within its jurisdiction to consider overstreet petition for an injunction in this case.
in its alternative contention,epd insists that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the board did not have the required quorum of members at all relevant times and was thus without the power to delegate.noting that b sets a quorum at three members of the board,and that the plain language of b mandates that a quorum of the board exists only when there are at least three sitting members,epd reasons that the general counsel delegated authority ceases during any periods that the board membership is fewer than three.to support this proposition,epd cites the circuit recent decision in laurel baye healthcare,nlrb wherein that court held that when the board membership drops to two,it loses its quorum and i n the context of a entity,a delegee authority therefore ceases the moment the vacancies or disqualifications on the board reduce the board membership below a quorum.
the supreme court,however,recently decided new process steel,nlrb which implicated this issue.the court held that when only two members of a delegee group remain,there is not a quorum and the group loses the authority delegated to it by the board despite similar holdings,the court explicitly declined to endorse the holding and reasoning of laurel baye instead,on the question whether a delegee who is not a member of the board may continue to function after the board membership dips below three,the court stated 
nor does failure to meet a quorum requirement necessarily establish that an entity power is suspended so that it can be exercised by no delegee.the requisite membership of an organization,and the number of members who must participate for it to take an action,are two separate albeit related characteristics our conclusion that the delegee group ceases to exist once there are no longer three board members to constitute the group does not cast doubt on the prior delegations of authority to nongroup members,such as the regional directors or the general counsel.the later implicates a separate question that our decision does not address 
in light of the court pronouncement in new process steel,we feel no compulsion to follow laurel baye.
when,on december,the
