this case requires us to consider whether temitope taju akinsade akinsade or petitioner record of conviction for embezzlement by a bank employee in violation of establishes that he actually and necessarily pleaded to committing an offense that involved fraud or deceit.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that it was error for the board of immigration appeals bia to have inferred from akinsade plea colloquy that he committed embezzlement with an intent to defraud.accordingly,we grant akinsade petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
fact overview 
akinsade is a noncitizen from nigeria,who was first admitted to the united states on july,at the age of seven,as a b nonimmigrant.in,as a teenager,akinsade was convicted of a nonviolent crime for which he has fully paid his debt.since his conviction,he has impressively turned his life around.on may,akinsade adjusted his status to become a lawful permanent resident.he received a bachelor of science degree in computer science and a masters of science degree,both from the university of maryland.he was awarded the prestigious national science foundation fellowship,and was chosen to participate in a leadership program at the general electric company ge.now,years after his criminal conviction,akinsade finds himself in deportation proceedings.in the exercise of its discretion,the federal government instituted deportation proceedings against akinsade because of the nonviolent crime that he committed nearly a decade before,notwithstanding his apparently unblemished record since.
b.the criminal conviction 
on march,the united states attorney for the district of maryland issued a criminal information charging akinsade with embezzlement by a bank employee in violation of the information read,in relevant part,that 
temitope akinsade being an agent and employee of chevy chase bank did knowingly embezzle,abstract,purloin and willfully misapply monies and funds intrusted to the custody and care of such bank in the approximate amount of.
on march,akinsade pled guilty to a single count in the information during akinsade plea colloquy,the honorable alexander williams,united states district judge for the district of maryland,explained to petitioner his rights and received a knowing and voluntary waiver.the district court further explained that by agreeing to plead guilty,akinsade could be sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and a fine of one million dollars.judge williams also warned akinsade that if he was not a citizen,he could be deported.finally,the government stated the facts it believed it could prove if the matter went to trial,including that 
on or about july,july,and july,akinsade agreed to and did process fraudulent checks presented by accomplices in the amounts of,and respectively.akinsade deposited some of the proceeds in a bank account of a friend and some to his own bank account 
t he fraudulent checks totaled o n or about july,in the state of maryland,akinsade,while an agent and employee of chevy chase bank,a bank the deposits of which were insured by the federal deposit insurance co r p o ration,did knowingly embezzle abstract from will sic misapplied monies and funds entrusted of custody and care of the bank in the approximate amount of.
id.akinsade then stood and told the court that he agreed that these facts were essentially what happened in this case.id.
on june,akinsade was sentenced to one month imprisonment,which he was permitted to serve in community confinement,plus three years of supervised release and a special assessment.petitioner paid restitution in full for his offense prior to sentencing.
post conviction,
after his conviction,akinsade entered the university of maryland and earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science.he then enrolled in graduate school at the university of maryland and was awarded a full fellowship from the national science foundation.he earned a master of science degree,graduating with a average.following graduate school,petitioner entered a leadership program at ge,and relocated to upstate new york,where he worked in the company global research center.
immigration proceedings 
nearly nine years after his conviction,on january,akinsade was arrested at his home in latham,new york,by united states immigration and customs enforcement ice officers and sent to immigration detention in batavia,new york.akinsade came to the attention of ice after he was stopped and subsequently arrested by the menands,ny,police for having an expired registration and suspended license.akinsade paid a fine and the case was closed.the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear,dated january,charging akinsade with removability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina,on the grounds that his conviction under constituted an offense involving fraud or deceit under ina a a iii,a a iii a a iii and a crime involving moral turpitude under ina a a,a a on february,dhs lodged an additional charge of removability under ina a a,a a alien who sought to procure a visa or admission to the united states by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact.
in proceedings before ij john reid,akinsade denied the charge of removability,moved for termination of proceedings,and,in the alternative,applied for cancellation of removal under ina a,a.the ij conducted multiple hearings between february and october.on october,the ij rejected the last two charges the ij also entered an oral decision sustaining the aggravated felony charge of removal under a a iii.in particular,the ij found that the information and also the plea colloquy make it clear that the respondent actions related to a fraud on the bank and not an injury.thus,the ij concluded that respondent conviction involv ed fraud or deceit,id.at,and that akinsade was therefore removable under a a iii.additionally,because the ground for akinsade removal was commission of an aggravated felony,the ij held that although petitioner had a very sympathetic case,id.at,he was ineligible for relief from removal.accordingly,the ij denied akinsade application for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to nigeria.
on december,akinsade appeal of the ij decision was timely filed.in his appeal to the bia,akinsade argued that the ij erred in finding that his conviction under was an offense involving fraud and deceit.akinsade maintained that the intent element of is divisible in nature,it can be satisfied by either an intent to injure or an intent to defraud,and that nothing in his record of conviction revealed the specific intent with which he had acted.thus,akinsade argued,his conviction can not be deemed an aggravated felony offense.
on february,a single member of the bia dismissed akinsade appeal in an unpublished opinion adopting the ij decision and noting that e ven if we were to accept the respondent argument that the statu t e in question is divisible in nature,the immigration judge properly relied upon the respondent conviction record to conclude that he was convicted of an aggravated felony.
e.the petition for review 
on february,petitioner,proceeding pro se,timely petitioned for review of the bia decision in this court.at that time,akinsade was detained in ice custody,as he had been throughout his removal proceedings before the ij and the bia.on april,the government filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction and opposing akinsade request for stay of removal.petitioner responded on april.
release from detention 
after nearly seventeen months in detention,akinsade was released on june.following his release,akinsade retained his current counsel,found a job with an information technology company in the washington,area,and married his longtime girlfriend.additionally,akinsade former dean at the university of maryland apparently contacted him to report that the national science foundation had offered him a fellowship to enter a program.on august,we denied the government motion to dismiss and referred akinsade motion for a stay of removal to this panel.
discussion 
on appeal,akinsade concedes that he was convicted of a crime that resulted in a loss of more than,and that a conviction under may constitute an aggravated felony in certain circumstances.instead,he argues only that the ij and the bia erred in concluding that dhs presented clear and convincing evidence of his removability under a a iii as a convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in ina a m i,a m i a m i.reply br.specifically,p etitioner disputes the government contention that the reviewable record of conviction establishes that he acted with intent to defraud the bank in which he was employed.id.at.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with akinsade and hold that his record of conviction does not support the bia conclusion that he was convicted of an aggravated felony.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
federal courts lack jurisdiction to consider a petition for review filed by an alien who is removable due to commission of an aggravated felony,but we retain jurisdiction to review whether an alien has,as a matter of law,committed such an aggravated felony.prus holder,cir per curiam.we review de novo whether a specific conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.pierre holder,cir.where,as here,the bia adopts the ij reasoning and offers additional commentary,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.wala mukasey,cir.however,we afford no deference to the bia where,as in this case,the challenged bia decision is unpublished.pierre,at.
ii.akinsade alleged aggravated felony 
with these principles in mind,we turn to whether akinsade conviction for embezzlement by a bank employee was an aggravated felony such that he was removable under a a iii and ineligible for relief from removal.
a.the categorical and modified categorical approach 
in general,the bia and this court have applied either a categorical or a modified categorical approach to determine whether a specific crime falls within a grounds for removability.wala,at.under the categorical approach,a reviewing court look s only to the elements of the offense of conviction and not to the factual circumstances of the crime.ming lam sui ins,cir.by contrast,where a statute is divisible,such that some categories of proscribed conduct render an alien removable and some do not,application of a modified categorical approach is appropriate.dulal whiteway dep t of homeland,cir,abrogated on other grounds by nijhawan holder,d see also wala,at vargas sarmiento dep t of justice,cir dickson ashcroft,cir where a criminal statute encompasses diverse classes of criminal acts some of which would categorically be grounds for removal and others of which would not we have held that such statutes can be considered divisible statutes.under the modified categorical approach,we may refer to the record of conviction to ascertain whether a petitioner conviction was under the branch of the statute that proscribes removable offenses.wala,at internal quotation marks omitted.this court has held that the record of conviction consists of materials including a charging document such as an indictment,a signed plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,a record of the sentence a plea colloquy transcript,and jury instructions.dulal whiteway,at holding that ij erred by relying on presentence report and restitution order to find that alien was convicted of fraud involving loss greater than but see nijhawan.at holding that an ij is not limited to considering the evidentiary materials permitted under the modified categorical approach when determining whether the loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least.
with respect to guilty pleas,under the modified categorical approach as applied to immigration proceedings,the bia may rely only upon facts to which a defendant necessarily pleaded in order to determine the type of conduct that represented the basis of an alien conviction.wala,at see dulal whiteway,at holding that the bia may only consider facts to which a defendant actually and necessarily pleaded in order to establish the elements of the offense,as indicated by a charging document,written plea agreement,or plea colloquy transcript emphasis added.t he necessarily pleaded language refers not just to whether a petitioner pled guilty to elements of the underlying offense,but also to whether by pleading guilty,he pled those facts necessary to establish that he violated a divisible statute in a manner that satisfies the grounds for removal.wala,at see also dickson,at in reviewing a conviction under a divisible statute,the categorical approach permits reference to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.a petitioner necessarily pleads to facts when,for example,he actually admits specific facts in his plea colloquy or comparable judicial record that establish he violated a divisible statute in a manner that satisfies the criteria of the pertinent removability statute.wala,at.if a statute requires no finding of the particular element at issue and there is no charging document that narrows the charge to those limits,the only certainty in a pleaded case of that finding lies in the defendant own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea.id.at internal quotation marks,brackets,and ellipses omitted citing shepard united states,d.
b.the bia error 
the ij accepted akinsade argument that he could have been convicted either for acting with the intent to defraud or to injure the bank,and if it was to injure the bank it would not fall within the fraud or deceit provision and,therefore,the respondent would not have been found to have been convicted of an aggravated felony under that section of the law.similarly,the bia assumed that the statu t e in question is divisible in nature.id.at.finally,the government agrees that the ij and bia were obligated to employ the traditional modified categorical approach when determining whether akinsade committed an aggravated felony.resp t br.pierre,at cir noting that under nijhawan,a approach is permitted when determining whether the monetary threshold in a m i has been met internal quotation marks omitted lanferman bia,cir per curiam holding that nijhawan does not change the list of documents that may be considered in the divisibility analysis,and we do not extend it to such a context.thus,for the purposes of this case we assume the statute is divisible and proceed under the modified categorical approach to examine whether akinsade record of conviction necessarily admits facts establishing that he committed an offense involving fraud or deceit more specifically,because the government conceded at oral argument that the intent to defraud rather than the intent to injure was required to sustain the removability charge,tr,the issue is whether akinsade record of conviction necessarily supports the result.we hold that it does not,and that the bia erred in deeming akinsade removable.
petitioner pleaded guilty to the information,which merely set forth the elements of the offense of embezzlement by bank employee under an offense that the government asserts can be committed with either an intent to injure or an intent to defraud.again,in light of this concession,we assume without deciding that the mens rea requirement of the embezzlement statute is in fact divisible,leaving that question open for another day.here,neither the information nor the judgment reveals the intent with which akinsade committed the offense.
likewise,the plea colloquy transcript does not resolve this issue.during the colloquy,akinsade accepted guilt for embezzlement.the record,however,is silent as to his intent at the time he perpetrated the offense.as evidence that akinsade acted with an intent to defraud,the government points to akinsade concession at his plea colloquy that what essentially happened in his case was that he process ed fraudulent checks presented by accomplices and that he knowingly embezzle d money from the bank.but neither of these statements equate to akinsade admitting that he knew the checks were fraudulent at the time he co
