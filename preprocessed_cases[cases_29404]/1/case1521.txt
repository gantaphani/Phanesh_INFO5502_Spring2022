linda freilich is a physician.harford memorial hospital decided to terminate freilich medical staff privileges after undertaking an extensive review of her application for reappointment.freilich then filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute granting immunity to peer review participants and the maryland physician credentialing statutes.in addition,freilich alleged violations of both the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act and made various other common law claims.freilich complaint is an attempt to have a federal court supervise what amounts to little more than a dispute over hospital policies and the expenditure of hospital resources.we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing her claims.freilich bd.of dirs.of upper chesapeake health,d.
linda freilich is a board certified internist and nephrologist who maintained unrestricted hospital privileges at defendant harford memorial hospital hmh,a private,hospital,from until april.during her tenure at hmh,freilich states she advocated the rights of her patients in order to improve their quality of care.specifically,freilich complained that the outsourcing of quality assurance and oversight services for dialysis patients led to an improper standard of care.
maryland state regulations require physicians to apply for reappointment every two years.see code of maryland regulations comar.during the reappointment process,each hospital must collect specific information about the physician applicant.the hospital then must analyze the physician pattern of performance based upon seven factors,including adherence to hospital bylaws,policies,and procedures and attitudes,cooperation,and ability to work with others.id.pursuant to comar regulations,hmh medical staff bylaws provide that hmh will consider in the reappointment process ethics and behavior in the hospital,cooperation with hospital personnel as it relates to patient care or the orderly operation of the hospital,and general demeanor and attitude with respect to the hospital,its patients and its personnel.
in july,freilich applied for reappointment to hmh.her application went through several layers of review,passing before the hmh credentials committee,the medical executive committee,and the appellate review committee.further,freilich received a hearing before the ad hoc hearing committee.although the different committees disagreed on whether to accept or reject freilich application,on april,hmh board of directors voted to deny freilich application and terminated her medical privileges.in a letter to freilich explaining the basis for its decision,the board quoted the ethics and behavior language in the hmh bylaws.
on december,freilich filed a,complaint against hmh and fourteen individuals who were involved in her peer review collectively the hospital defendants,the state of maryland,and the united states.the complaint alleged that hmh and its board of directors denied freilich application for reappointment because she did nothing more than advocate the rights of her patients.specifically,freilich alleged that the health care quality improvement act hcqia,et,which provides qualified immunity from damages to persons who participate in physician peer review,and the maryland statute and regulations governing physician credentialing,article e and comar e,are all unconstitutional.she also brought a claim under against the hospital defendants,contending that the termination of her staff privileges violated her constitutional rights.finally,freilich alleged violations of both the americans with disabilities act ada and the rehabilitation act ra.
in an extensive opinion,the district court dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and the state law claims without prejudice.freilich bd.of dir.of upper chesapeake health,d.freilich now appeals.we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,eastern shore,cir,and assume the facts as stated in the complaint are true.see jenkins medford,cir en banc.
freilich brings several constitutional challenges to the health care quality improvement act,et.the hcqia limits liability in damages for those who participate in professional peer review.for hcqia immunity to attach,however,the peer review action must comport with due process.more specifically,the professional review action must be taken in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded and in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts.the hcqia also sets forth detailed standards to ensure that a physician receives adequate notice and a hearing and exempts any claim alleging a civil rights violation or claims for declaratory or injunctive relief.id.
we first address freilich due process and equal protection challenges to the hcqia.freilich first alleges that the hcqia violates the fifth amendment because it authorizes and encourages the defendants to act irresponsibly in matters of credentialing,reappointment to the hospital staff,and wrongful denial of hospital privileges because the hcqia does not burden any fundamental right or draw distinctions based on any suspect criteria,it is subject only to rational basis review.rational basis review is a paradigm of judicial restraint,fcc beach communications,d,which prohibits us from sit ting as a to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.city of new orleans dukes,d per curiam.according a strong presumption of validity to the hcqia,we thus need only determine whether the hcqia is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.see beach communications,at.
the legitimacy of congress purpose in enacting the hcqia is beyond question.prior to enacting the hcqia,congress found that t he increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve the quality of medical care had become nationwide problems,especially in light of the ability of incompetent physicians to move from state to state without disclosure or discovery of the physician previous damaging or incompetent performance.the problem,however,could be remedied through effective professional peer review combined with a national reporting system that made information about adverse professional actions against physicians more widely available.however,congress also believed that t he threat of private money damage liability under federal laws,including treble damage liability under federal antitrust law,unreasonably discourage d physicians from participating in effective professional peer review.id.congress therefore enacted the hcqia in order to facilitate the frank exchange of information among professionals conducting peer review inquiries without the fear of reprisals in civil lawsuits.the statute attempts to balance the chilling effect of litigation on peer review with concerns for protecting physicians improperly subjected to disciplinary action.bryan james holmes regional med,cir.
freilich complaint lists seventeen alleged defects with the statute,such as permitting hearsay during the hearing proceedings and permitting the denial of privileges when there are no findings of incompetent behavior by the physician.apparently,she would like this court to rewrite the hcqia.opinions may differ on what is the most effective way to improve the quality of our nation health care system.however,we can not substitute our judgment,or that of freilich,for congress rationally based belief that the hcqia is an effective means to achieve its goal.see heller doe,d.
the hcqia adopts an objective reasonableness test.as noted earlier,the hcqia only applies if a peer review action is taken in the reasonable belief that the action was taken after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded the physician involved in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts and in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care.a,b.the standard,then,is one of objective reasonableness after looking at the totality of the circumstances.imperial suburban hospital,cir.
freilich alleges that the hcqia is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause.she contends that the hcqia reasonableness standard governing peer review immunity authorizes,encourages,and permits hmh to act with impunity because the hcqia does not specify what constitutes reasonable belief.
freilich vagueness challenge is an odd one.to begin with,the hcqia reasonableness standard does not even apply to freilich own conduct.rather,it is a standard that a peer review body must meet in order to obtain immunity for its actions.
and the hcqia objective reasonableness standard is a perfectly valid guide for peer review bodies.the reasonable belief standard embodies the discretion that health care professionals have traditionally exercised in determining whether or not their peers meet a requisite level of professional competence.see,doyle bowen,vacated on other grounds,cir.courts respect this discretion because a ny attempt to catalog every medical practice that would fall into the prohibited category would result in the sort of encyclopedic and unwieldy statute already rejected as unnecessary.id.at.see also,of am.physicians and surgeons weinberger,noting the difficult task of drafting a statute with sufficient specificity to give the physicians,practitioners and providers of health care service adequate notice of the new requirements of the law and at the same time to maintain enough flexibility to cover a variety of medical cases.
furthermore,reasonableness standards have been consistently upheld in the context of qualified immunity.see,trulock freeh,cir qualified immunity shields government officials from civil liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.in cases brought under,courts commonly apply an objective reasonableness standard to afford public officers sufficient latitude to properly perform discretionary functions.see,gooden howard county,cir en banc.we therefore hold that the hcqia reasonableness standard provides sufficient guidance to withstand a vagueness challenge.
freilich next alleges that the hcqia violates the tenth amendment of the united states constitution and article three of the maryland declaration of rights by invad ing subjects traditionally governed by state law,and by attempting to immunize conduct otherwise actionable under state law.
the tenth amendment provides that t he powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the states,are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people.const.amend.x.a tenth amendment inquiry consists of two parts.first we must determine whether congress has the constitutional power to enact the hcqia.united states johnson,cir citing new york united states,d.if we answer this inquiry in the affirmative,we then ask whether the means of regulation employed by congress impermissibly infringe upon state sovereignty.id.
congress has the power under the commerce clause to enact statutes governing physician peer review.hospitals are regularly engaged in interstate commerce,performing services for patients and generating revenues from sources.summit health,pinhas,d.and the supreme court has already held that because r eports concerning peer review proceedings are routinely distributed across state lines and affect doctors employment opportunities throughout the nation,there is no doubt concerning the power of congress to regulate a peer review process.id.at.
having found that congress has the power to enact the hcqia,we now ask whether the means employed infringe upon state sovereignty.johnson,at.we hold that they do not.the hcqia does not commandeer the state legislature or executive.it does not require the maryland legislature to enact any laws or regulations,and it does not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals.reno condon,d.the hcqia does not compel states to implement a federal regulatory program either.under the hcqia,health care providers are required to collect and report information to the state board of medical examiners.see a.the state board of medical examiners then forwards that information to a federal data bank.but more is required than the expenditure of time and effort on the part of state officials in order to offend the tenth amendment.see condon,at.any federal regulation demands compliance.that a state wishing to engage in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.south carolina baker,d.
all that the hcqia requires of states is the forwarding of information.and the hcqia specifically provides that nothing in this part shall be construed as changing the liabilities or immunities under law or as preempting or overriding any state law which provides incentives,immunities,or protection for those engaged in a professional review action that is in addition to or greater than that provided by this part.we thus agree with the district court conclusion that the hcqia does not require the state to do anything that the state itself has not already required,authorized,or provided by its own legislative command.freilich,d at.in sum,the hcqia does not come close to offending the tenth amendment.
we next turn to freilich claims against the hospital under titles ii and iii of the americans with disabilities act ada and under the rehabilitation act ra to the extent possible,we construe similar provisions in the two statutes consistently.see ennis ass of bus.and educ.radio,cir.freilich makes three claims,which we address in turn.
freilich brings her first ada claim on behalf of her dialysis patients.freilich alleges that hmh violated the ada and the ra by providing quality assurance and oversight for all hospital services provided by contractors except for dialysis services.see.quality assurance and oversight for dialysis services is provided by an outside contractor.we do not reach the merits of this claim,however,because freilich lacks standing to bring such a claim on behalf of her patients.
our standing inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warth seldin,d.even if a plaintiff satisfies article iii standing requirements,f ederal courts must hesitate before resolving a controversy,even one within their constitutional power to resolve,on the basis of the rights of third persons not parties to the litigation.singleton wulff,d.to overcome the prudential limitation on standing,a plaintiff must demonstrate an a close relationship between herself and the person whose right she seeks to assert and a hindrance to the third party ability to protect his or her own interests.powers ohio,d.
the district court held that even assuming the existence of the first two elements,freilich did not sufficiently allege a hindrance to her patients ability to protect their own interests.freilich,d at.here freilich fails to allege sufficient obstacles to the patients bringing suit themselves.the district court correctly pointed out that the dialysis patients and indigent patients on whose behalf freilich advocated are not constrained in bringing suit by any obstacles made known in the complaint.freilich,d at.in her submission to this court,freilich argues that dialysis patients are disabled and chronically ill,foreclosing them from presenting their own rights.but we can not simply assume that every disabled or chronically ill person is incapable of asserting his or her own claims.in fact,such persons are typical and frequent plaintiffs under both the ada and ra.faced,then,with no evidence that freilich dialysis patients are hindered from presenting their own claims,we adhere to the longstanding principle that third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights.singleton,at.
next,freilich assert
