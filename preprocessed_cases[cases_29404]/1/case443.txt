petitioner marie chahid hayek,a native and citizen of lebanon,seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia pretermitting her application for asylum as and denying her applications for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat because she did not meet her burden of proof.hayek argues that she is eligible for asylum based on the changed circumstances exception to the filing deadline and that she has provided credible testimony and corroborative evidence compelling a reasonable factfinder to conclude that she is entitled to withholding of removal and cat relief.because we lack jurisdiction to consider her argument about the timeliness of her asylum application,and because we reject the remainder of her arguments,we deny hayek petition for review.
on september,hayek entered the united states as a visitor,with authorization to remain for a temporary period not to exceed one month.eleven days after her arrival,she married her fiancé,a lebanese citizen who had arrived in the united states three years before and overstayed.they both remained illegally in the united states and later had two children,both of whom are united states citizens.in,hayek husband was deported to lebanon.
on february,the immigration and naturalization service ins served hayek with a notice to appear,charging her with being subject to removal for remaining in the united states without authorization,pursuant to a b.at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,hayek conceded removability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,cat relief,and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.we summarize the evidence that hayek provided in support of her claims and discuss the decisions of the ij and the bia.
evidence before the ij and bia 
in support of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief,hayek testified that she experienced a series of threats and physical attacks while she was involved with the lebanese forces,a christian military and political group opposed to the presence of syrian forces in lebanon.hayek,a maronite christian,joined the lebanese forces in and eventually became responsible for various administrative activities of the lebanese forces political party and student group.
the violent incidents began in early,when hayek was participating in a political demonstration for the lebanese forces party in lebanon.syrian and lebanese soldiers hit and kicked the demonstrators.hayek,who was standing near the front of the demonstration,was beaten with the soldiers rifles.two days later,four soldiers came to her house.hayek mother helped hayek leave the house through the back door,and hayek hid in a farmhouse in the mountains for several days.
approximately a month later in march,when hayek was out of hiding and visiting a sick relative,two armed men in civilian clothing stopped her as she was entering her car,calling her officer marie and telling her,you christians,your days are over.one of the men grabbed her by the neck and ripped up a picture of a saint that she had placed in the dashboard of the car.after the men left,hayek again went into hiding for a month and a half.
a few months later,when hayek was leaving a party at the local university with some friends,syrian men forced their vehicle off the road and pulled the passengers out of the car.one of the men,addressed by the others as corporal,grabbed hayek by the hair,forcibly kissed her,and attempted to rape her.hayek escaped and flagged down a passing car,fleeing to her sister house,where she received treatment from a doctor.
approximately four weeks later,syrian intelligence forces approached hayek and her siblings at a local store.the men questioned hayek brother about his identity.they did not recognize hayek but stated that they were looking for her.
two weeks later,hayek fled lebanon.using a visa that a friend in the united states helped her to obtain,hayek arrived in the united states in september.she stayed at the home of her sister,where her former member of the lebanese forces who had arrived in the united states three years also been staying.she married her fiancé approximately eleven days later.
when asked why she failed to apply for asylum upon her arrival or at any time prior to the removal proceedings,hayek explained,i was very scared because i know what going to happen to me if i went back there.hayek holds a college degree.when asked if she had any further contact with the lebanese forces,hayek stated that she ended her participation in their activities when she left the country.however,she explained that,in,she had called her uncle,a member of the lebanese forces with whom hayek had worked closely.he warned her not to come back because syrian intelligence forces had detained and tortured him and other lebanese forces members and still sought to question hayek.hayek did not submit an affidavit from this uncle confirming the conversation.hayek noted in her affidavit that the police had come to her home in lebanon to arrest her on three occasions in and.
along with her testimony,hayek submitted additional evidence in support of her claims.she presented two witnesses.fares hayek,hayek,testified that he knew hayek in lebanon and that they were both members of the lebanese forces.khalil hayek,hayek husband cousin,stated that he was a clerk who did paperwork for the lebanese forces and that he knew hayek when they were both members of the group.neither affiant testified to the attacks that hayek claimed to have suffered.
hayek also submitted written statements from various individuals in lebanon.archbishop bechara rahi,head of the maronite archbishopric in jbeil,lebanon,stated that hayek is a member of the lebanese forces party that she was forced to leave lebanon due to the political and security situation in that country and that the current situation in the country still prevents her from returning,but provided no specific facts.eli maroun zagib,a selectman of the town of amsheat,lebanon,stated that hayek is wanted by the police for her belonging to the party of the lebanese forces,but also provided no details.
perhaps the most helpful written statement was from antoine issa,who stated that he treated hayek for bruises caused by a physical attack in,but provided no details as to the attack or treatment.fouad malik,commander of the lebanese forces,stated that hayek was a member of the lebanese forces from until.this,as the government points out,is inconsistent with hayek own testimony that she was an active member until,when she said the persecution began.
hayek also submitted country conditions reports,including the state department and country reports on lebanon,the amnesty international annual report on lebanon,several human rights watch documents,and various reports and articles discussing syrian involvement in lebanon and the treatment of demonstrators and protestors.
b.the ij and bia decisions 
after a hearing on the merits,the ij pretermitted hayek request for asylum on the ground that it was untimely filed under a b,which states that an applicant for asylum should file an application within one year of his or her arrival in the united states.the ij concluded that no changed or extraordinary circumstances exist to justify an exception to the deadline.
the ij also denied hayek application for withholding of removal and cat protection.although he did not explicitly make a lack of credibility finding,the ij found that she had not,through her testimony,met her burden,and expressed doubts about the truthfulness of her testimony.the ij found that the petitioner marriage to her fiancé eleven days after they were reunited casts doubt upon the veracity of her story.he rejected her claim that she came to the united states to avoid persecution.he found it more likely that the respondent arranged to come to the united states to marry her fiancé.he also noted the fact that the petitioner had never previously applied for political asylum,stating that i n the ordinary case an individual would arrive in this country and within a year after their arrival would,if they were genuine,submit an application for asylum during a period of time when certain facts might be able to be substantiated.he found her explanation of her reasons for not applying for asylum that she was scared to go to the immigration service to be disingenuous at best.
the ij characterized hayek testimony as general and meager and said her testimony was more in the nature of a cliche.hayek had asserted that there were identified people who had firsthand knowledge of her persecution and were still in contact with her,but she had failed to provide corroborating statements from those individuals.as a result,the ij found her testimony about the events that took place some eleven years earlier unsubstantiated and unsupported.the ij did not comment specifically on the items of corroborative evidence that she had submitted or on her testimony that an uncle had warned her in not to return.he concluded that hayek had failed to provide him with the necessary evidence to establish whether the events she testified to had ever occurred,and that his sense of the matter was that these events did not occur.
the ij also noted that the documentary evidence went against her claim that she would be persecuted if she returned to lebanon,in two respects there was no evidence that syrian forces or lebanese forces were persecuting christians and there was no basis to think that events eleven years before would lead them to harm her.the ij concluded that it is not more likely than not that she would be persecuted if she returns to lebanon,and certainly it does not appear to be more likely than not that she would be tortured if she returns to that country.he did find hayek eligible for voluntary departure,noting that she has two united states citizen children and no criminal record.
hayek appealed the ij decision to the bia.in her appeal,she argued that the ij erred by not finding that the warning that hayek received from her uncle in was evidence of changed circumstances justifying the filing of her asylum application past the deadline.she also challenged the ij denial of her withholding of removal and cat claims based on the lack of corroborative evidence,arguing that she did provide supporting evidence of her claims the testimony of her relatives and the written statements and that her inability to obtain physical evidence should not be fatal to her application.in addition,hayek submitted the testimony of the leader of her church in the united states as new evidence indicating that her marriage was not planned,and therefore,she argued,not the reason for her arrival in the united states hayek also argued that the ij improperly concluded that the background documentary evidence of record does not reflect that syrian or lebanese forces are currently persecuting christians.
the bia issued a short opinion affirming and adopting the ij decision.the bia specifically stated that we agree that the respondent did not present reasons for failing to file her application for asylum within one year of arrival in the united states that rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances,nor did the respondent present evidence of changed circumstances that materially affects her eligibility for asylum.in responding to hayek argument that the ij failed to consider her corroborating evidence,the bia stated that the evidence to which she refers would not change the outcome in these proceedings.the bia also stated that the country conditions information also does not change the outcome here.the bia concluded that hayek did not demonstrate that she experienced past persecution or torture,or that she has a fear of future persecution in lebanon.she further has not shown that it is more likely than not that she would suffer future persecution or torture upon return to her homeland.
on appeal,hayek raises two main arguments.first,she argues that she has established changed circumstances justifying an exception to the asylum filing deadline.second,she argues that she met her burden of proof for her withholding of removal and cat claims.specifically,she challenges the ij failure to credit her testimony as establishing past persecution and argues that the ij erred in not considering her corroborative evidence.
in addressing these arguments,we review the decision of the bia directly,but w here the bia deferred to or adopted the ij reasons for denying the petitioner claims,we review those portions of the ij decision as part of the final decision of the bia.ashcroft,cir.we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider hayek argument about the timeliness of her asylum application,and our review of the record regarding hayek withholding of removal and cat relief claims does not compel us to reject the findings of the bia.
timeliness of hayek asylum application 
the government correctly argues that we have no jurisdiction to review the bia decision that hayek application for asylum was untimely and that the untimeliness was not excused.see a no court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a,describing the deadline for asylum applications and exceptions.
this conclusion is unchanged by section a of the real id act,which provides that n othing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.real id act of,a a iii,stat.codified at a d.in mehilli gonzales,cir,we explained that u nder the terms of this limited jurisdictional grant,discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,and bia findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are usually factual determinations.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we lack jurisdiction to consider this matter.
withholding of removal and cat claims 
we have jurisdiction over hayek claims for withholding of removal and cat relief.see sharari gonzales,cir.in assessing these claims,we will uphold the bia determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ashcroft,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.under the highly deferential substantial evidence standard,we must uphold the bia findings unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.gi kuan tai gonzales,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
an applicant for withholding of removal must show either that i he has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he may suffer future persecution,or ii it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon his return to his native land.da silva ashcroft,cir citing b.this is a more rigorous standard than the standard for asylum.an applicant for cat relief must bear the burden to prove,by objective evidence,that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he is deported.elien ashcroft,cir emphasis omitted citing c.under the standards for both withholding of removal and cat relief,t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.b,c.
hayek argues that some of the ij stated reasons for doubting her quick marriage to her fiancé and her failure to file a timely asylum misplaced.however,hayek testimony was general,meager,and often vague.she failed to testify in detail or corroborate her story.under the circumstances of this case,and given her admitted contact with sources who could have corroborated her story if it were true,the ij was justified in concluding that hayek failed to meet her burden of proof.
while hayek could have helped herself by producing specific corroborative testimony pertinent to the issues and supporting her claims,she did not do so.this case does not involve a question of whether corroborative evidence was unavailable to the petitioner.she is the one who said in her asylum application that her family had firsthand knowledge of the pers
