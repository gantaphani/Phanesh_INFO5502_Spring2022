this case has,since,endured an odyssey through administrative and judicial tribunals,during the course of which it has appeared before one form or four occasions.petitioner donald willy now petitions for review from the department of labor administrative review board arb dismissal of his retaliation claims against his former employers,coastal corporation and coastal states management collectively,coastal.although we grant his petition for review,we reject willy challenge to the constitutionality of the arb under the appointments clause of the united states constitution,we vacate the arb final decision and order,and we remand in part.
facts and proceedings 
factual history 
coastal hired willy as an environmental attorney in.coastal and its subsidiaries are in the petroleum business,including refining oil,marketing oil and gasoline,and transmitting natural gas by pipeline.after a series of events in,coastal fired willy.
the belcher environmental audit report 
in early,albin smith,president of belcher oil company a subsidiary of coastal,asked coastal legal department to perform an environmental audit of belcher facilities.after willy examined the reviews performed by fellow attorney troy webb and a regulatory analyst,george pardue,willy concluded in two preliminary draft reports collectively,the belcher report or the report that belcher was exposed to liability for violating several federal environmental statutes.
webb and other coastal employees disagreed with willy conclusions.unbeknownst to willy,webb sent a memorandum to smith,stating that belcher problems were less serious than willy drafts indicated.pardue conceded that willy conclusion that belcher was illegally polluting was factually accurate,but also told smith that the tone of willy report was inflammatory.at the end of march,willy supervisor,clinton fawcett,asked willy to revise the belcher report and to delete reference to some of belcher violations.willy refused,then discussed the matter with coastal general counsel,george brundrett,who agreed with fawcett assessment of the report.fawcett ultimately made the changes to the report himself.
willy testified that he began getting the cold shoulder from fawcett,brundrett,webb,and pardue after this incident.fawcett later left coastal legal department,and william dunker,a colleague of willy in the environmental legal department,became willy supervisor.dunker revisited the belcher report and discussed the incident with webb,who reiterated his opinion that the whole thing was overblown by willy.dunker told brundrett that the report was inflammatory and drew conclusions that i do like to draw,then told willy of his concerns.
corpus christi refinery 
in late or early,willy began performing legal work for the corpus christi refinery the refinery,another coastal subsidiary.early in june,at the request of the manager of the refinery,willy called the texas department of water resources tdwr about a closure bond for the refinery.
webb considered the refinery his domain.when he visited it in the summer of,he learned that the tdwr had informed willy that coastal might be sued because of the refinery financial problems.webb was upset that willy had not relayed this information to him and considered that willy was infringing on what webb regarded as his turf.
in september,dunker,who had learned from webb about the tdwr phone call,held a meeting in an effort to relieve the tension between webb and willy.dunker had prepared a letter of reprimand for willy,because webb had complained that willy had been saying negative things about him and backstabbing him.dunker decided not to deliver the letter to willy,however,because what dunker learned at the meeting did not satisfy him that willy had actually acted in the way that webb had reported.
at the meeting,which dunker secretly taped,willy denied having called the tdwr.dunker telephoned a refinery employee,expecting to confirm that willy had placed the call.the employee stated,however,that he did not recall telling webb and pardue that willy had called the tdwr that he could recall only that he heard that a tdwr employee,russell lewis,had said that there might be a lawsuit.the refinery employee did confirm that willy and webb had made disparaging remarks about each other.willy and dunker,and sometimes webb,then engaged in a lengthy exchange about the antagonism that willy experienced as a result of the belcher report.
soon after the meeting,dunker called lewis at the tdwr,and lewis confirmed that willy actually had contacted him.dunker decided to fire willy and obtained brundrett agreement.dunker first met with willy and again secretly taped their conversation.at this meeting,dunker called lewis and allowed willy to question him.after lewis confirmed that willy had spoken with him about financial assurances,dunker severely criticized willy breach of trust and asked him to resign.when willy refused,dunker orally fired him on the spot.an october written termination notice authored by brundrett states the primary purpose for this termination is the fact that you failed to report certain actions taken by you with respect to the corpus christi refinery environmental matters.when asked if you had taken such action,you unequivocably sic denied taking such action.
procedural history 
complaint to the department of labor 
in october,willy filed a complaint with the department of labor dol,alleging that coastal had violated the whistleblower provisions of several environmental statutes by firing him in retaliation for writing the belcher report.specifically,willy sued under the clean air act the water pollution control act the safe drinking water act the resource conservation and recovery act the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response,compensation environmental response,compensation and liability act collectively,the acts.
the wage and hour division whd of the dol investigated willy complaint and found in his favor.the whd ordered reinstatement and damages.
administrative law judge order of production 
coastal appealed the whd ruling and requested a hearing before a dol administrative law judge alj.willy sought extensive discovery,including introduction of the belcher report.coastal objected to the production of the report and other documents related to it based on the and privileges.willy filed a motion to compel production,which the alj granted.the alj relied on doe v.a in holding that the documents,although confidential,were admissible because willy could not effectively litigate his claim without access to the documents in question.coastal refused to comply,and the alj ordered willy to seek enforcement of its order of production in the district court.
alj recommendation of dismissal 
before willy could do so,however,the alj recommended that willy complaint be dismissed in light of our opinion in brown root,donovan the alj concluded that under the whistleblower provision of the energy reorganization act era,employee conduct which does not involve the employee contact or involvement with a competent organ of government is not protected.the alj found that the language of the era whistleblower provision was substantially identical to the language of those of the acts under which willy had sued and that willy actions were solely internal.thus,reasoned the alj,willy conduct was not protected.
secretary reversal of recommended dismissal 
on appeal to the dol secretary,willy argued that he was terminated in part because he contacted government environmental agencies.the secretary ultimately rejected the alj recommended dismissal,reasoning that,notwithstanding brown root,willy did not have an adequate opportunity to prove that he had contacted government agencies and that the belcher report constituted protected activity under the acts.the secretary also concluded that,contrary to coastal arguments,there was nothing in any of the statutes or their legislative histories to indicate that attorneys are excluded from statutory protection.the secretary further encouraged us to reconsider our holding in brown root in light of the tenth circuit more recent decision in kansas gas electric brock 
our refusal to intervene 
on remand,the alj again ordered willy to seek enforcement of the production order and resolution of coastal privilege claims in district court.willy instead petitioned us under the all writs act to resolve the discovery dispute.we declined review,reasoning that intervention at this time to resolve the discovery would interrupt the administrative process and that i ntervention at this time is unnecessary.
alj hearing on remand 
in a march hearing on remand before an alj,coastal continued to refuse to produce the belcher report,basing its refusal on the privilege.the alj nevertheless admitted two draft versions of the report that were in willy possession.based on these drafts,the alj found in favor of willy,reasoning that he was fired both because of coastal perception that he had lied about calling the tdwr and for having written the belcher report in the first place.applying a analysis,the alj concluded that the animus towards willy arising from the belcher report and willy subsequent lie about the phone call are inextricably mixed.under the circumstances,no finding can be made that donald willy would have been fired solely for lying about the phone call had he not engaged in protected activity.the alj declined to grant willy relief,however,because the judge concluded that willy had offered misleading testimony about his current employment status.
secretary review of alj rulings 
on automatic review,the secretary agreed with the alj recommended decision and order that coastal fired willy in part because he wrote the belcher report.the secretary also affirmed the alj holding that writing the belcher report constituted protected conduct,notwithstanding our decision in brown root.the secretary concluded that brown root applied to the era only and did not purport to interpret environmental whistleblower statutes the secretary relied on,inter alia,various rules of professional conduct and our opinion in doe in concluding that the belcher report was admissible evidence under both federal and texas law.the secretary affirmed the alj ruling and remanded the case to the alj to calculate back pay.
we denied coastal interlocutory petition for review of the secretary ruling in october,ten years to the month after willy original filing.the following july,the dol secretary denied reconsideration of his decision.the alj then issued a recommended decision and order on damages,fees and costs for in damages and in attorney fees and expenses.willy and coastal both appealed to the administrative review board arb,which by then had replaced the secretary in the process.
in february,the arb issued its final decision and dismissal order,which reversed the prior orders of the dol secretary and the alj on remand.the arb upheld the alj conclusion that federal law governed the issue of privilege,then determined that no exception to the privilege existed to admit the belcher report and other related documents.the arb also concluded that under texas privilege law,the result would prove the same.willy timely filed his notice of appeal.
willy parallel state court action 
concurrent with his administrative proceedings,willy pursued his claims against coastal in the state courts of texas.in,after the alj first recommendation of dismissal,willy filed a wrongful discharge claim in state court.in it he alleged that coastal wrongfully terminated him under the texas public policy exception to the doctrine,that it fired him for refusing to perform an illegal act coastal removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.the district court dismissed the case,reasoning that the texas canons of ethics and disciplinary rules precluded an attorney from bringing such a cause of action 
on appeal,we reversed and remanded the matter to the district court with instructions to remand to the state court because removal had been improper on remand to state court,a jury found in favor of willy and awarded him actual and punitive damages the texas court of appeals reversed,reasoning that although texas canons of ethics allow counsel to maintain a wrongful termination suit under the public policy exception,they prohibit the use of confidential client information to prove such a claim.the court held that,even under texas provision which allows lawyers to reveal confidences when necessary to defend themselves against an accusation of wrongful conduct,the belcher report was privileged and thus inadmissible.willy petitioned to the supreme court of texas for a writ of error,which that court denied in.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we must affirm the arb decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law factual findings are subject to substantial evidence review agency interpretations of our case law are reviewed de novo we also review willy constitutional appointments clause challenge de novo 
b.the appointments clause 
willy first contends that the creation of the arb violates the appointments clause of the constitution specifically,willy asserts that congress has not granted authority to the dol secretary to appoint arb members and to delegate his authority to them as inferior officers.willy contends that congress s generic delegation to the secretary of labor at contains no officer appointment authority,and there is no authority in any federal environmental statute to appoint inferior officers for purposes of hearing employee protection claims.he notes that nothing in the united states code titles that expressly authorizes the creation of other administrative boards explicitly authorizes the arb creation.willy maintains that congress never intended adjudication powers be by the dol secretary,to whom congress delegated authority,to a authority.willy therefore asks us to enforce the dol secretary order upholding his cause of action and to disregard any decision by the arb as it is not a legitimate subordinate of congress.
article ii states 
the president shall nominate,and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint all other officers of the united states,whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law.but the congress may,by law,vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they may think proper in the heads of departments.
in april,the dol secretary created the arb.the arb is composed of three members,each of whom is appointed by the secretary for terms of two years or less and is subject to removal by the secretary the arb acts for the secretary and issu es final agency decisions on questions of law and fact arising in review or on appeal in whistleblower cases 
we must first determine whether the arb members are principal or inferior officers for purposes of the appointments clause.willy bases his challenge on the assumption that an arb member is an inferior officer of the united states.willy asserts that arb members are inferior officers because they make final decisions for the department of labor the secretary does not contest that arb members are inferior officers,so,for purposes of this appeal,we assume that they are.
even though we recognize that no specific federal statute creates the arb,we hold that the secretary possesses the requisite congressional authority to appoint members to the arb to issue final agency decisions.as the secretary points out,other circuits have held that article ii does not require that a law specifically provide for the appointment of a particular inferior officer.to the contrary,the constitution affords congress substantial discretion to fashion appointments within the specified constraints.
the broad language employed by congress in the reorganization plan of and in vests the secretary with ample authority to create the arb,appoint its members,and delegate final authority to them.the reorganization plan states that t he secretary of labor may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer,or by any agency or employee,of the department of labor of any function of the secretary other courts have held that this provision explicitly authorizes a subdelegation of authority by the secretary of labor.further,section provides broad authority to the secretary to prescribe regulations for the government of his department and the distribution and performance of its business in the only case to address directly an challenge to the arb,the sixth circuit relied on this language to uphold the secretary delegation of authority to the arb we agree with the sixth circuit and conclude that these provisions imbue the secretary with the authority to create the arb,appoint its members,and delegate final authority to them.
to support his argument that the secretary appointment of arb members and delegation of final authority to the arb is violative of the appointments clause,willy principally relies on three cases,freytag commissioner ryder united states and edmond united states willy cites ryder and edmond for the general propositions that the appointments clause preserves the structural integrity of the constitution by preventing the diffusion of appointive power,and the clause is one of the most significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.we recognize that this is so but both ryder and edmond are otherwise inapposite.
in ryder,the court treated the de facto officer doctrine the petitioner there challenged the court of military appeals holding that even though the appointment of two civilian judges to the coast guard court of military review violated the appointments clause,the petitioner conviction was valid under the de facto officer doctrine the court held only that the court of military appeals erred in according de facto validity to the actions of the civilian judges of the coast guard court of military review and that the petitioner was entitled to review before a properly constituted court holding,as it did,on the basis of the de facto officer doctrine,ryder provides no support for willy arguments.
willy also cites edmond as support for his aforesaid general propositions,yet he expends little effort to explain edmond relevance here.in edmond,the court considered whether the secretary of transportation has the authority to appoint members of the coast guard court of criminal appeals cgcca,and whether the members of the cgcca are principal or inferior officers as we have earlier assumed for purposes of this appeal that the members of the arb are inferior officers,that question is not before us.further,although the edmond court held that a provided explicit authority to the secretary of transportation to appoint judges to the cgcca nothing in edmond requires such explicit language.accordingly,edmond too provides little or no support for willy arguments.
neither does freytag support willy.in freytag,the key issue was whether the chief judge of the united states tax court was the appropriate repository for the appointment of inferior officers power which,as noted above,is vested only in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of department.willy does not dispute that the dol secretary is the head of a department,nor could he do so the freytag issue is simply not present here.
finally,willy contends that even if the dol secretary possesses the legitimate authority to establish the arb,the secretary final decision is entitled to deference when a conflict exists between it and the arb.in other words,willy asserts that because the secretary is the head of the department,we should afford greater deference to his final time,in favor of to the arb final decision.willy cites martin occupational safety and health review commission to support his argument.willy argument is meritless.
in martin,the supreme court treated the issue to whom should a reviewing court defer when the secretary of labor and the occupational safety and health review commission furnish reasonable but conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous regulation promulgated by the secretary under the occupational safety and health act osha of the court observed that the dispute arose under the unusual regulatory structure established by the act.specifically,the court noted that the act granted enforcement and rulemaking authority to the secretary of labor and adjudicative authority to the commission the court then held that,as the act granted the secretary the authority to promulgate and to enforce national health and safety standards,courts should grant deference to the secretary,rather than the commission,interpretation 
that situation is not present here.there is no split authority under the whistleblower statutes.the relevant statutes expressly grant rulemaking,enforcement,and adjudicative authority to the secretary,so no potential for conflict exists.additionally,no conflicting interpretations of statutes promulgated by the secretary are at issue here.the difference between the secretary and the arb final decisions rests in their conflicting interpretations of federal common law state law.
we hold that the language of and of the reorganization plan of is broad enough to allow the secretary to create the arb,appoint its members,and delegate authority to it.we hold that the dol secretary appointment of arb members and delegation of authority to them do not violate the appointments clause of the constitution.
having resolved the threshold issue of the violation vel non of the appointments clause,we turn to the merits question of the scope of the privilege.willy insists that,in accordance with the dol secretary opinion,the belcher report is admissible despite the privilege 
relying on statutory exceptions to the privilege,supreme court standard d,the model code of professional responsibilities dr c,and our decision in doe v.a the secretary ruled that the belcher report was admissible despite coastal assertion of the privilege.in its february order,the arb reversed the secretary order,concluding that no exception applies to exempt the report from the privilege and that the dol secretary erred when he admitted it into evidence.the arb accordingly dismissed willy complaint because his action fails without the availability of the belcher report.the parties now dispute whether the dol secretary or the arb is correct 
the parties first contest whether federal or state law governs our analysis of the privilege.we have no difficulty in concluding that federal law applies here.questions of privilege that arise in the course of adjudication of federal rights are governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.as willy claims arise under federal are before us on federal question jurisdiction under federal common law of privilege governs our analysis.
the privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.the central purpose of the privilege is to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice.this purpose allows clients to make full disclosure to their attorneys of past wrongdoings to obtain the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice.
coastal assertion of the privilege with respect to the belcher report in response to willy attempt to maintain his personal cause of action against his former client creates a conflict with another fundamental policy the availability of a legal forum for the adjudication of rights.we have recognized that,w hile the boddie connecticut principle does not give any broad right of access to federal court,the courtroom door should not lightly be barred to a person who has a tenable legal claim.
accordingly,the recognized exceptions to the general rule that an attorney may not disclose his client confidences.willy advances three exceptions to the privilege under which the belcher report is admissible.he asserts first that the report is admissible under the breach of duty exception next,that coastal waived any privilege when it placed the belcher report at issue in the litigation and last,that the report is admissible under the exception.
breach of duty 
with respect to willy contention that the breach of duty exception applies,we conclude that the arb rejection of this exception is contrary to law.we therefore vacate and remand supreme court standard d states that no privilege exists a s to a communication relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to his client or by the client to the lawyer in addition,no privilege exists under rule b of the model rules of professional conduct in similar circumstances 
a lawyer may reveal information relating to representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client,to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved,or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer representation of the client 
the model code of professional responsibilities disciplinary rule c also provides the breach of duty exception to the general rule.
willy insists that the arb incorrectly read into the exception a requirement that privileged communications only be used defensively.relying on siedle putnam investments,the arb held that an attorney may use privileged documents only as a shield and never as a sword.in siedle,the defendant,putnam investments,putnam had employed the plaintiff siedle as counsel.the parties signed a mutual termination agreement,but siedle continued to maintain a retirement account with putnam.after it discovered that a clerical error had improperly credited to that account,putnam unilaterally deducted that amount from it.angry,siedle told his tale to pensions investments,a weekly trade magazine.putnam responded,unfavorably to siedle.
siedle sued in state court for breach of contract and various other claims.putnam removed the suit to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship,then moved for a temporary restraining order,a seal order,and a preliminary injunction to keep siedle from divulging information protected by the privilege.when the new york times learned of the suit,it intervened and urged the district court to lift the seal order.the district court granted the motion,and putnam appealed.
the first circuit rejected siedle claim that an attorney may use the exception to introduce privileged information offensively we believe that the exception is designed to function only as a shield,not as a sword.notwithstanding this broad pronouncement,however,the first circuit recognized the limited effect of its holding 
let us be perfectly clear.we do not hold that the materials which putnam claims are privileged necessarily must remain under permanent seal.as the record develops and additional facts are adduced,the district court may find that putnam claims of privilege are unsupported or that some applicable exception penetrates the privilege.until such time,however,we hold that putnam unrebutted prima facie showing that the privilege applies entitles it to protection 
the current dol secretary and the siedle as support for the proposition that the exception to the privilege may be used only as a shield,and not as a sword,an attorney may use privileged documents only as a defense against charges brought against him by his client.we recognize that siedle stands for only this narrow proposition.with all due respect to our sister circuit,however,we conclude that it and the arb have case law on which they rely.
the case law amply demonstrates the narrower proposition that the privilege only prohibits a party from simultaneously using confidential information as both a shield and a sword stated differently,the shield and sword analogy is conjunctive it does not stand broadly for the proposition that an attorney may never use confidential information offensively.that analogy is a product of our parallel reasoning behind the doctrine of implied waiver a party may not use privileged information both offensively and defensively at the same time in other words,when a party entitled to claim the privilege uses confidential information against his adversary the sword,he implicitly waives its use protectively the shield under that privilege.
in addition,the arb misinterpreted the holding of siedle and the law on which that holding relied.first,it is indisputable that the siedle court based its holding on massachusetts law,not federal law second,as noted above,the siedle court treated whether a seal order should remain in effect and was primarily concerned with the right of the,the have access to court records,not with the attorney use of the confidential information against his it must be remembered that the basis of the siedle appeal was the district court unsealing of the order brought about by motion of the new york times the siedle court neither explicitly nor implicitly held that the attorney could never use confidential information against his employer.it merely reversed the district court order that the seal should be lifted.
the other case on which the current dol secretary,coastal,and the arb relied are equally inapposite.kachmar sungard data systems,did not hold that,in a title vii suit,an can never use privileged information obtained during representation against the client.the plaintiff in kachmar,formerly counsel for sungard data systems,sungard,sued her employer for retaliation under title vii,alleging that she had been fired unlawfully after she alleged that sungard engaged in a pattern and practice of sex discrimination when the district court dismissed her suit,kachmar appealed.regarding the aspect of the issue raised by sungard,the third circuit stated 
we do not suggest that concerns about the disclosure of client confidences in suits by counsel are unfounded,but these concerns alone would not warrant dismissing a plaintiff case,especially where there are other means to prevent unwarranted disclosure of confidential information.
in balancing the needed protection of sensitive information with the counsel right to maintain the suit,the district court may use a number of equitable measures at its disposal designed to permit the attorney plaintiff to attempt to make the necessary proof while protecting from disclosure client confidences subject to the privilege.general dynamics superior court,cal th,d,at.en banc.among those referred to in general dynamics were t he use of sealing and protective orders,limited admissibility of evidence,orders restricting the use of testimony in successive proceedings,and,where appropriate,in camera proceedings.admittedly,this may entail more attention by a judicial officer than in most other title vii actions,but we are not prepared to say that the trial court,after assessing the sensitivity of the information offered at trial,would not be able to draft a procedure that permits vindicating kachmar rights while preserving the core values underlying the relationship 
the kachmar court did not hold that a could never use privileged information offensively,only that the district court must take precautions to safeguard such information by weighing the need to protect it against the attorney need to maintain his suit.we reject the arb conclusion that either siedle or kachmar stands for the overbroad proposition that the privilege is a per se bar to an attorney use of privileged information in a claim against his former client or employer.
doe v.a is our controlling precedent on the right of an attorney to maintain a suit against his former client or employer when the claim implicates communications allegedly protected by the privilege in it we held that 
a lawyer,however,does not forfeit his rights simply because to prove them he must utilize confidential information.nor does the client gain the right to cheat the lawyer by imparting confidences to him.
the sole interest a corporation can assert,other than defeating doe claim,is preservation of confidentiality for the secrets doe learned while in its employment.the corporation interest in confidentiality,however,can at least be partially protected by anonymity.there is no interest in allowing a corporation to conc
