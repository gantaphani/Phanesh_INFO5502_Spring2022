at a december prison disciplinary hearing,hubert earl teague,an inmate in the texas department of criminal justice,correctional institutions division was found guilty of having violated an and trading provision of the internal rules of prisoner conduct.as part of his punishment,teague forfeited thirty days of previously earned credit.teague subsequently filed a federal habeas corpus petition,alleging that the failed to afford him the requisite procedural due process.citing malchi and richards dretke the district court denied teague petition,concluding that the loss of thirty days of previously earned credit was de minimis,and thus insufficient to command due process protection.we conclude that the district court surprisingly,as we shall testing teague loss for whether it was de minimis and basing its ruling on a finding that it was.after visiting our dicta in malchi and richards,we conclude that no such de minimis floor is mandated by our precedent,so that no amount of previously earned credit is so insignificant that it may be taken away by the institution administratively without affording the inmate due process.stated differently,the must accord an inmate due process before depriving him of any previously earned credits,however slight there is no exception for an amount that might otherwise be deemed de minimis.we,therefore,vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
in,teague pleaded guilty to a theft offense in violation of texas state law and was sentenced to a prison term of years.in,teague was released on parole.
while on parole,teague committed seven additional state offenses six burglary offenses committed on october,december,december,january,january,and february,and one forgery offense committed on october.he pleaded guilty to five of the burglary offenses and the forgery offense,but he pleaded not guilty to the january,burglary offense.he was subsequently found guilty on that charge and sentenced to a year term of imprisonment.the incarceration term for each of the six offenses was less than years,and each was to run concurrently with the year term.additionally,his release on parole was revoked,and his original sentence was.
in december,a prison disciplinary hearing was convened against teague.he was charged with committing a code and trading it was alleged that another inmate,melvin jordan,had caused a check to be deposited into teague inmate trust account,in violation of the internal rules of conduct.
prior to the disciplinary hearing,teague was furnished written notice of the charges against him via a computer generated report.the offense description read,in part teague did make an unauthorized exchange to offender jordan by having offender jordan place a sum of dollars onto sic his trust fund account.a second,notice from the charging officer specified,in its offense description section,that teague did make an unauthorized commodity exchange with offender jordan by having offender jordan place a sum of onto sic his trust fund account.the notice also stated,in the additional information section,that offender teague did have offender jordan place a sum of onto sic his trust account 
during the hearing,the charging officer report,the transaction records of teague inmate account,the cashier check,and jordan admission that he deposited the money into teague account were offered into evidence.teague defense,however,was not that the event never occurred,but that he had no knowledge of or participation in jordan deposit no evidence was offered as to why jordan deposited the money into teague account or whether teague had any knowledge of or participation in jordan actions.
at the beginning of the hearing,the disciplinary officer made the following statement to ensure that teague understood the charge offender teague did make an unauthorized market exchange by having offender jordan place a sum of onto sic his trust fund accounts.offender teague,do you understand the charges teague responded,yes.
the disciplinary hearing officer found teague guilty and assessed the following penalties forfeiture of thirty days of previously earned credit a reduction in earning rate fifteen days solitary confinement days commissary and recreation restrictions reduction in custodial classification and forfeiture of the.
after the hearing,teague filed a grievance with the,appealing the disciplinary proceeding next,teague filed a grievance finally,after fruitlessly exhausting the internal grievance procedures,teague filed a petition in the district court,seeking a writ of habeas corpus.
in his habeas petition,teague asserted that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of guilt the prison officials failed to serve him timely with notice of the alleged violation the disciplinary hearing officer was not impartial the disciplinary hearing officer improperly denied his request to call witnesses the disciplinary hearing officer improperly denied his request to have the charging officer present at the hearing the disciplinary hearing officer stopped recording the hearing during teague presentation of the evidence and the improperly removed the from his inmate trust account.teague contended that,by these actions,he had been wrongfully deprived of his right to procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment.
after appointing counsel to represent teague,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on teague petition.the district court entered a written order in which it concluded that there was no evidence to support the disciplinary hearing officer guilty finding.the court denied the rest of teague claims.the district court decision on the insufficiency of the evidence was premised on the failure to offer any evidence that teague had jordan deposit the into teague trust account.in light of this lack of evidence,the district court concluded that the disciplinary hearing officer decision was clearly contrary to established federal requires some evidence to support the findings made in the disciplinary hearing and granted teague habeas petition.
in response,the filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the district court order.the cited our decisions in and and asserted that the forfeiture of thirty days of previously earned credit was so de minimis that it was insufficient to warrant due process protection.
understandably following the de minimis primrose path that we had laid down in malchi and richards dicta,the district court granted the motion to amend,agreeing that the loss of thirty days credit was de minimis and holding it to be insufficient to entitle teague to due process protection.in reaching its decision,the district court calculated that thirty days represented approximately of one percent of teague year sentence.the court conceded that it could not draw a bright line separating what does and does not constitute a de minimis amount of loss,but was relatively certain that less than of one percent of teague total sentence was de minimis in this case.at least by implication,the district court approached the question of de minimis on a relative or percentage basis,not on the basis of the absolute number of days lost.
teague timely filed a motion for a certificate of appealability coa.the district court granted the motion and certified the following issue for appeal whether,in this case,the forfeiture of days of credits pursuant to a prison disciplinary action was a de minimis loss and,as such,insufficient to trigger due process protections of the fourteenth amendment.
ii.law and analysis 
standard of review 
in addressing requests for habeas relief,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo identification of a liberty interest that is protected by the fourteenth amendment is a question of federal constitutional law and is reviewed de novo when due process is required,the standard in prison disciplinary hearings requires that there be some evidence to support the disciplinary decision whether there is some evidence is an issue of law that we review de novo we may affirm a district court decision on any basis established by the record 
protected liberty interest 
federal habeas relief can not be granted unless the petitioner alleges that he has been deprived of some right secured to him by the united states constitution or the laws of the united states.here,teague petition is premised on the claim that the texas mandatory supervision scheme provides him with a protected liberty interest in his previously earned credits,so that texas may not deprive him of such credits without first affording him the requisite due process.
obviously,the constitution itself does not expressly guarantee due process protection of credits attained by satisfactory behavior while in prison a state statutory scheme may,however,create a right to credits and when one does so and recognizes that revocation is an authorized sanction,an inmate interest in credit is accorded due process protection specifically,an inmate is entitled to the minimum procedures appropriate under the circumstances and required by the due process clause to ensure that the right is not arbitrarily abrogated thus,when a state inmate enjoys a constitutional expectancy to an early release from prison based on the accumulation of credits,he has a protected liberty interest and is entitled to due process before he may be deprived of such credits therefore,before we address whether teague thirty day loss is subject to an exception from the guarantee of due process because that loss was de minimis,we must first determine whether texas law affords teague a protected liberty interest.
in texas,there are two general ways in which an inmate may become eligible for early release first,an inmate may become eligible for parole second,he may become eligible for mandatory supervised release 
parole,which is not at issue here,is the discretionary and conditional release of an eligible inmate sentenced to the institutional division so that the inmate may serve the remainder of the inmate sentence under the supervision of the pardons and paroles division.we have held that there is no right or constitutional expectancy of early release on parole in texas,because parole is within the total and unfettered discretion of the state 
in contrast,mandatory supervision in texas is the release of an eligible inmate sentenced to the institutional division so that the inmate may serve the remainder of the inmate sentence not on parole but under the supervision of the pardons and paroles division.prior to september,when a texas prisoner actual time served plus his accrued credit equaled the term of imprisonment to which he had been sentenced,article,c of the texas code of criminal procedure specified that a prisoner who is not on parole shall be released to mandatory supervision.under this former scheme,the had no discretion in deciding when or if to release an inmate on mandatory supervision rather,an inmate had a mandatory right to early release based solely on simple arithmetic.
effective september,texas amended its scheme to allow a parole panel a modicum of discretion in determining whether an inmate otherwise eligible for release on mandatory supervision should nevertheless remain in custody under this,scheme,section a of the texas government code,like its predecessor statute,mandates that a parole panel shall order the release of an inmate who is not on parole to mandatory supervision when the actual calendar time served plus any accrued good conduct time equals the term to which the inmate was sentenced.a difference resulted,however,from the addition of section,which states that a n inmate may not be released to mandatory supervision if a parole panel determines that the inmate accrued good conduct time is not an accurate reflection of the inmate potential for rehabilitation and the inmate release would endanger the public.thus,unlike its purely predictive forerunner,texas,mandatory supervision scheme is mandatory in large part,but also discretionary in small part 
in madison parker,we were called on to decide whether texas,mandatory scheme of supervised release created a constitutional expectancy of early issue of first impression at the time we lacked significant information as to whether the petitioner was eligible for mandatory supervised release,however,and were thus unable to resolve the constitutional question until determinative facts could be established accordingly,we deferred decision on the issue and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings 
three years later,in malchi,we again faced the issue whether texas,mandatory supervised release scheme created a constitutional expectancy of early release the petitioner in malchi had been found guilty at a prison disciplinary hearing of possessing a box of stolen envelopes,as punishment for which his earning status for credit was reduced this reduction was calculated to delay the petitioner release by more than six months 
in malchi,we determined that the mandatory and predictive nature of the,scheme vested inmates with a constitutional expectancy of early release and a concomitant protected liberty interest albeit purely in dicta,we went on to temporize somewhat by offering that 
a texas prisoner does not necessarily have a constitutional expectancy of release on a particular date.for example,it is possible that a de minimis delay of a few days in a prisoner mandatory supervision release would not give rise to a constitutionally cognizable claim.in the present case,the evidence shows that the prison calculated that the subject disciplinary action delayed the petitioner release for more than six months as a result of the change of status we hold that such delay is more than de minimis 
the parties have assumed,without argument,that the,version applies here and,as such,that teague has a protected liberty interest under malchi,leaving only the de minimis question for our review.this assumption,however,is flawed.first,as teague was convicted of eight of which occurred prior to september,and seven of which occurred after september,is unclear whether and to what extent the former and present schemes apply.
essentially,then,what we must determine is whether the,addendum to texas mandatory supervision scheme,with its narrowly limited modicum of discretion,works to deprive all inmates of their constitutional expectancy of early release.we hold that it does not.therefore,we need not determine which scheme applies here,as we conclude that teague has a protected liberty interest under either version.
texas current mandatory supervision scheme is virtually identical to those at issue in greenholtz inmates of the nebraska penal correctional and board of pardons and,as such,warrants the same result.in greenholtz,the issue before the supreme court was whether a nebraska parole statute created a protected liberty interest like the present texas mandatory scheme of supervised release at issue here,the nebraska statute was discretionary in part and predictive in part,specifying that the state parole board shall order the release of an eligible inmate,unless one of four specific designated reasons was found to be present relying on the structure and language of nebraska parole statute,the court held that it created a presumption that parole release would be granted and thus a constitutional expectancy of early release,entitling inmates to due process protection 
likewise,the court in allen determined that a montana parole statute created a constitutional expectancy of early release the montana scheme provided that the state parole board shall release an eligible inmate on parole when it finds that there is a reasonable probability that the inmate may be released without detriment to himself or the community and that he is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a citizen comparing the montana statute to the nebraska statute in greenholtz,the court held that the montana statute created the same presumption of parole release and thus a constitutional expectancy of early release,necessarily entitling inmates to due process protection 
juxtaposing the structure and language of texas,mandatory supervision scheme with those at issue in greenholtz and allen leads
