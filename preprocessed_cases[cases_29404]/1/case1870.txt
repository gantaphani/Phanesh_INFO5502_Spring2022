john jolliff and steven daniels petition for review of the order of the national labor relations board board denying their claims arising under a of the national labor relations act act,codified at a.administrative law judge alj william kocol originally found in the employees favor,holding that the employees had been terminated for engaging in an a letter complaining about working was protected under the act.on review,the board held that the employees activities were stripped of the act protection because the letter contained a false statement made with actual malice.jolliff and daniels now petition for review.we grant their petition on the basis that the board decision was not supported by substantial evidence and remand the case to the board.
john jolliff,steven daniels,and emerson young were truck drivers for tnt logistics of north america,tnt at tnt division at east liberty,ohio,until their termination on august.young had worked as a driver since during his term of employment he received numerous awards for safe driving and professionalism.prior to his termination,young had never been disciplined.daniels had been a tnt employee since and jolliff since both of these drivers also had received safe driving and performance awards.
in january,young contacted the united auto workers uaw about organizing a union at tnt.uaw officials advised young to ready those workers who favored a union,but to wait until an organizing campaign at honda,one of tnt largest customers,became active.in may,dock workers complained to young about their working conditions and asked to go forward in the process of obtaining union representation.they also suggested sending a letter to tnt higher management describing the conditions with which they took issue.young testified that eighty to ninety employees,about of the workers,discussed sending the letter.because young had previously contacted the union,the group agreed to give him their grievances on paper and he would pick from that and put the letter together.jolliff and daniels were among the group of workers expressing complaints.because the workers were afraid of retaliation,the group decided not to sign the letter as individuals.
on august,young sent the letter to tnt corporate management in jacksonville,florida.he also sent a copy to honda.the letter,which contains certain grammatical,spelling,and formatting mistakes and irregularities,proceeds as follows 
this letter is being sent to protest the management managers at contracts.we hope that our management at our home office will get an idea of how we the dock workers and truck drivers at these contracts are being treated do something about it.
some of the things listed in this letter are just some of the many wrong things we feel are mistreatment discrimination against our work force here by managers robert wheeler and jeff basinger.
these are the poorest managers we have had in the history of these two contracts since our beginning in.
wheeler is hardly ever here to listen to our problems when we need advise sic on problem solving.he has lied to us on various occasions and we do not approve of this and many of his methods.we feel he should be a better leader and manager.
we have lost a lot of business under wheeler management.he has done some good things for us,but the loss of business and leadership looms big.
basinger came here with what appears to be his own personal gain for himself.he put up a wall to most the his contract.you do as i say or else.
well it may be else as most people or drivers do care for him.he believes he put tnt on the map here,well we know better.
we the dock workers drivers of are tired of being treated the way these managers are doing us.we want to have a good decent place to work and have a good relationship with our management here.
we have a list of some of the things that both managers have imposed on both dock workers and drivers and hope you will step in and help us to have harmony again.
we are given points for going to the doctors and or dentist even if we have a written excuse.we thought the company tnt wanted us to take care of our health.lots of workers are showing up sick then going home and getting points so they do get fired.drivers are driving sick tired and this is not safe or healthy.people are not taking care of or not given the time to see a dentist,this is totally uncalled for from managers.we bet you people do have this problem.
people are given points when they attend family funerals.this is about as low as any company can get.this is dirty period.any funeral outside of a family is another should or can get a point for that,but not inside your own family.
some drivers are being asked to fix their log books to make extra runs.these drivers are being asked by dispatchers and management to do these runs and either fix their log books or turn their heads on it.
john cox once said he would not go to jail for fixing log books for anyone.well cox pack your suitcase,it has and is presently being done at.
our present insurance is the worst we have ever had and we feel that tnt needs to make a change in that as soon as they is lousy.
these are just a few of the nasty things that are going on at these contracts.we hope tnt will make management changes at these contracts.
we the dock workers drivers feel this needs to happen and the point system modified for health,sickness,funerals.
we realize that there are some bad apples in every do punish good workers or their families,and do let these managers dictate their lives.tnt says they are family it.
we just held the drivers meeting on the new routes and this is what happened,to not one but several of the drivers.when drivers went to bid on our new runs.basinger told these drivers these runs were already taken and he had other runs for them.
one driver asked who took the run he wanted and basinger did not want to tell him who took it.but then asked again and basinger told him who got it and it turned out to be one of his friends from a previous contract.
basinger finally said he was entitled to take the route since he had seniority over his friend.
he in turn did get the route.
that is dirty of basinger to keep trying to put his friends buddies in our jobs.we will not stand for this crap and you can count on that 
one last thing on basinger,a driver accidentally bumped into him in the office basinger told the driver to excuse himself and physically shoved the driver and hurt his shoulder is having trouble with it.we all agreed that the driver should contact his attorney about this matter and take certain action against basinger.
no one should have to be treated like this.this man is going to get hurt if he shoves the wrong person and it will be no ones sic fault but his own if he gets hurt.
we are of the workers at these two contracts.we are together and have seeked sic outside help.we hope we can prevent bringing in or having to be represented by an outside organization.but we will have no choice if this treatment continues.
remove managers,wheeler basinger.it is not all about money,as it is working conditions such as no heat on the dock in the winters.you put up a new office in bet it is heated and cooled both.
we the dock workers and drivers hope you will step in and resolve this matter with the management problem at east liberty,ohio.
we are sending copies of this letter to the following parties 
dave kulik,
jeff hurley,v 
john cox,safety 
scott johnston,honda of america 
copies and information to television stations in columbus ohio to be aired at a later date if tnt headquarters does not resolve this situation.
because no employee wanted to sign individually,the letter indicated that it was sent from the dock workers and drivers at the east liberty facility.
on august,the district manager in charge of tnt honda operations,robert wheeler,called young into his office.wheeler asked young if he had any problems with management young replied affirmatively and discussed his concerns about the company recent route assignments and the disciplinary points assessed against employees.wheeler told young that there was nothing he could do about those issues because he had received the orders from corporate.
the next day,wheeler summoned jolliff to his office.kevin schafter,a supervisor,was also present.wheeler stated that a letter had been sent to corporate headquarters and to honda.wheeler proceeded to question jolliff about his involvement with the letter.jolliff denied that he had any information.wheeler also questioned him about his grievances against tnt.jolliff described some of the problems he was having with basinger.at the end of the meeting wheeler informed jolliff that he was being placed on suspension and that,if the investigation cleared jolliff,then he would be allowed to return to work.
later that same day,wheeler called young back into his office.this time,basinger and schafter were also present.the three managers questioned young about his involvement with the letter.wheeler told young that he had brought him into his office to fire him,but that he might be able to save young job and give him a short suspension instead if he cooperated.wheeler then asked him what sort of things the dock workers had been talking about.young gave a flippant response.wheeler also asked what good would a union do for young at this point in his life.when it became clear that young was not going to reveal any information,wheeler told him he could clean out his truck and that he was on extended suspension until further notice.
after young left,wheeler called daniels into his office.as with jolliff and young,wheeler questioned daniels about his involvement in writing and sending the letter.the meeting was less confrontational than the meeting with young,but the end result was the same.the managers suspended daniels until the completion of the investigation.
on august,young,jolliff,and daniels were fired.their termination letters read 
on august,our customer honda manufacturing north america received a letter signed by tnt logistics north america,drivers and dock workers,east liberty,oh.the letter stated that management was mistreating employees,harassing employees and threatened the customer honda that if they did not do something they would turn the matter over to the local news stations our customer is very sensitive to bad media coverage.the letter also directly threatened a contract manager quote this man is going to get hurt if he shoves the wrong person and it will be no ones fault but his own if he gets hurt.this letter violates tnt company policy violence.also,sending a threatening letter of this nature to our customer puts tnt reputation in a bad light and additionally could lead to a loss of business or failure to get new business and we can not tolerate that by any employee.
our company has an open door policy and for an employee to send a letter to our customer without contacting local management or corporate headquarters to work on their issues is inexcusable.this act can not and will not be tolerated by tnt north america.
we have it on reliable sources that you had a part in the writing and sending of this letter to our customer.this act jeopardized our entire operation and all employees livelihood at this location.
as of today august,we are terminating your employment with tnt logistics north america.
after their termination,young and jolliff filed charges of unfair labor practices on september,and november,respectively.on january,the board general counsel issued a formal complaint against tnt alleging that tnt violated a of the act by threatening an employee with discharge because of his union activities inviting an employee to resign because of the employee union activities creating the impression that it was engaging in surveillance of the protected concerted activity of its employees interrogating employees concerning their protected concerted activities interrogating an employee concerning his union activities and suspending and then terminating employees john jolliff,emerson young,and steven daniels because they engaged in protected concerted activity in the form of a letter that was sent to tnt corporate management and to a customer.
though jolliff and daniels were parties to the proceedings by virtue of having filed the underlying charges of unfair labor practices,they did not exercise their rights to retain counsel,call witnesses,introduce evidence,make oral arguments,or participate in the hearing other than as witnesses.on may,the general counsel presented its case against tnt in a evidentiary hearing before alj kocol.during the hearing,young,jolliff,and daniels testified on behalf of the general counsel complaint wheeler and basinger testified on behalf of tnt.
on july,the alj issued a decision and order,finding that tnt engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of a and of the act.
on august,tnt filed exceptions with the board,objecting to the alj decision that the letter constituted concerted activity protected by the act.the general counsel filed a brief urging the board to affirm the alj decision 
on july,more than three years after the alj issued his decision,the board handed down a decision and order reversing the alj and finding that the employees activity was not protected and,accordingly that the employees were discharged for cause.tnt logistics north america,nlrb,slip nlrb lexis at.therefore,under c of the act,c,the board could not uphold the reinstatement of the employees.
the board focused on the question of whether the letter lost protection because it contained maliciously false or disparaging statements.at issue was the statement concerning the logbooks 
some drivers are being asked to fix their log books to make extra runs.these drivers are being asked by dispatchers and management to do these runs and either fix their log books or turn their heads on it.john cox once said he would not go to jail for fixing log books for anyone.well cox pack your suitcase,it has and is presently being done at.
board chairman robert battista wrote the decision for the majority,which held that the employees was not protected on the grounds that the statement concerning the logbooks was maliciously false 
we find that the letter lost the protection of the act because the statements in the letter accusing the respondent of asking employees to fix the logbooks were maliciously false.the evidence supports a finding that the employees made this statement with knowledge of its falsity or at least reckless disregard for its truth.the employees letter affirmatively represents that management asked employees to fix logbooks,but employee jolliff admitted that management never made such a request,and there was no evidence whatsoever to contradict this explicit admission.
while the respondent changed the route times,this was hardly a request from management that employees fraudulently record their log book entries,as described by the employees in the letter.yet,the letter made this factual representation to respondent single largest customer.thus,the letter evinced,at the very least,a reckless disregard for the truth.further,jolliff earlier statement during a safety meeting that management should be disciplined suggests that the employees intended to effectuate their desire to discipline management by disseminating a damaging and false accusation to a vital customer,one likely to be sensitive to allegations of willful disregard of transportation regulations by its carrier.thus,contrary to our colleague,we find that this false accusation,in context,was more than mere exaggeration.
tnt logistics north america,nlrb,slip 
while the board recognized that only young drafted the letter,it held that inasmuch as the letter was unprotected,the concerted activity of young,daniels,and jolliff was unprotected.tnt logistics north america,nlrb,slip.
the board vacated the alj order to reinstate jolliff,young,and daniels,but affirmed the alj other findings and holdings and ordered tnt to cease and desist from interfering with employees union organizing activities.peter schaumber,the second board member,concurred in part,writing separately to note that he would have held that the letter lost protection not only because it was maliciously false but also because it was disparaging.the third board member,dennis walsh,dissented on the grounds that the statement concerning the logbooks was at most an exaggeration and hardly deliberately or recklessly false,tnt logistics north america,nlrb,slip.
following the board decision,jolliff and daniels petitioned this court for review of the decision.young did not appeal.tnt intervened in support of the board request to deny the petition for review.
we must uphold the board findings of fact when substantial evidence in the record supports its findings.e the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.see also nlrb lumber,cir we uphold the board findings of fact where substantial evidence in the record supports the board findings.citation omitted.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.
a reviewing court can not engage in de novo review of the record.vencare ancillary servs.nlrb,cir citing universal camera nlrb.nevertheless,it must consider the whole record and take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence.universal camera,at.t he evidence supporting a board conclusion may be less substantial when an examiner,such as an administrative law judge,has drawn conclusions different from the board than when the examiner has reached the same conclusion.litton microwave cooking prods,litton,nlrb,cir citing universal camera,at.the board is free to find facts and draw inferences different from those of the alj but the reviewing court has an obligation to examine more carefully the evidence in cases where a conflict exists.pease nlrb,cir citing larand leisurelies,nlrb,cir.when a case turns on witness credibility,we will not normally disturb the assessments of the board or an administrative law judge,who has observed the demeanor of the witnesses.litton microwave cooking,at quoting nlrb baja place,cir.
in addition to the obligation imposed by the existence of a conflict between the alj and board decisions,this court has a second obligation to make an independent review of the record when a case involves protected speech.the supreme court in letter carriers austin,d,wrote 
the court has often recognized that in cases involving free expression we have the obligation,not only to formulate principles capable of general application,but also to review the facts to insure that the speech involved is not protected under federal law.we must make an independent examination of the whole record so as to assure ourselves that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.
while this duty has been most often recognized in the context of claims that the expression involved was entitled to first amendment protection,the same obligation exists in cases involving speech claimed to be protected under the federal labor laws.
jolliff and daniels argue that the logbooks statement was mere hyperbole and not capable of carrying a defamatory meaning even if the statement were construed literally,the board did not have substantial evidence to conclude that it was made with actual malice and holding jolliff and daniels responsible for an allegedly false statement that they themselves did not make would have a chilling effect and would undermine the public policy promoting free and open debate in the context of labor disputes.we address the first two arguments and find that while the statement was capable of carrying a defamatory meaning,there was not substantial evidence of actual malice.because we reverse the board on this ground,we do not address jolliff and daniels argument.
prima facie protection for communications to third parties 
section a of the act provides it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in codified at.section in turn provides that 
employees shall have the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in a a.
the supreme court in eastex,nlrb,d,held that the mutual aid or protection clause of protects employees who seek to improve terms and conditions of employment or otherwise improve their lot as employees through channels outside the immediate relationship.id.at.the court acknowledged that to hold otherwise 
would leave employees open to retaliation for much legitimate activity that could improve their lot as employees.as this could frustrate the policy of the act to protect the right of workers to act together to better their working conditions,we do not think that congress could have intended the protection of to be as narrow as to exclude protection outside the context.
id.at.quoting nlrb washington aluminum,d.
our circuit has explicitly held that e mployees have the right to engage in concerted communications with third parties regarding legitimate employee concerns,such as terms and conditions of employment and grievances.compuware nlrb,cir,cert.denied,d.third parties can include the employer clients or customers.see also handicabs,nlrb,cir holding that a company policy violated the act by prohibiting employees from discussing employment conditions with the company clients.
loss of protection due to actual malice 
an employee appeal to a third party or a client only loses its protected status if the appeal does not relate to the labor practices of the employer or is maliciously false.compuware,at.in linn united plant guard workers,d,the supreme court emphasized congress intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management,noting that cases involving speech are to be considered against the background of a profound commitment to the principle that debate should be uninhibited,robust,and,and that it may well include vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks.id.at.quoting new york times sullivan,d.nevertheless,the court also recognized that protection should not be extended to deliberately or recklessly false statements 
t he most repulsive speech enjoys immunity provided it falls short of a deliberate or reckless untruth.but it must be emphasized that malicious libel enjoys no constitutional protection in any context.after all,the labor movement has grown up and must assume ordinary responsibilities.the malicious utterance of defamatory statements in any form can not be condoned,and unions should adopt procedures calculated to prevent such abuses.
in letter carriers,the court reaffirmed the standard to be applied in deciding whether falsity stripped a statement of the act protection 
the linn court explicitly adopted the standards of new york times sullivan,d,and the heart of the new york times test is the requirement that recovery can be permitted only if the defamatory publication was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.id.at.
letter carriers,at.
in addition to the actual malice standard of sullivan,other aspects of defamation law have been imported into the analysis of whether a statement is protected under the act.these include the distinction and the distinction 
moreover,expressions of opinion,though false,and couched in very strong language,are not to be treated as falsifications of facts.letter carriers,at.likewise,the use of hyperbole which would not be treated by a hearer or reader as intended to be literally believed is not actionable.id.this court has held highly offensive language protected by of the act,where it is clearly used in a rhetorical rather than a literal sense.nlrb container of america,cir per curiam.
davis united furniture workers,cir.
thus,there is a inquiry for determining whether the contested logbooks statement loses the act protection.first,the board must determine whether the logbooks statement was false within the context of defamation law,meaning that the statement was capable of a defamatory meaning as opposed to being pure opinion,hyperbole,or rhetorical exaggeration and that it was actually false.second,if the statement was false in the context of defamation law,then the board must ask whether it was made with actual malice.
in milkovich lorain journal,d,the supreme court declined to create a specific exception to defamation claims for statements of opinion.it reasoned that such an exception was unnecessary because the line of cases provides protection for statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.milkovich,at.quoting hustler magazine falwell,d.the court further affirmed that rhetorical hyperbole,a vigorous epithet and loose,figurative,or hyperbolic language merit protection.id.at.
capable of defamatory meaning 
whether a communication is capable of bearing a particular meaning is a question of law.clark american broadcasting,cir.in milkovich,the supreme court did not explicitly detail a test.rather,the court affirmed that a statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern which does not contain a provably false factual connotation will receive full constitutional protection and that statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts,are not actionable.milkovich,at.citing falwell,at.the court then relied on the general tenor of the context in which the statement was made in determining whether it was sort of loose,figurative,or hyperbolic language which would negate the impression that the writer was seriously maintaining that petitioner committed the crime of perjury.ibid.
our circuit has had few occasions to apply milkovich distinction between statements capable of a defamatory meaning and protected hyperbole.in compuware moody investors,we held that a credit rating,an opinion of a business financial health,did not communicate any provably false factual connotations,cir.in boladian umg recordings.cir,we held that the lyrics of a song speed dreamin,performed by famous funk musician,george clinton,did not convey an actual,objectively verifiable defamatory statement that could be proven.id.at.in parks laface records,cir,we considered the allegedly defamatory lyrics of another song,outkast rosa parks.we held that the song was plainly not about parks in any biographical sense of the term,and certainly does not make any factual statements about her.as there is no factual statement about her,parks can not show even the first element of a defamation claim.id.at.
in each of these cases,our inquiry into the distinction was abbreviated by the obvious nature of the statements at issue.given our limited consideration of milkovich,this circuit has not yet articulated a specific test for determining whether a statement is susceptible to defamatory interpretation.this case,however,necessitates a closer reading of milkovich because it hinges on this very issue.the first,second,fourth,and ninth circuits have been confronted with the question of how to apply milkovich and have identified factors that should be considered in making the distinction.
the ninth circuit has adopted a test,which examines whether the defendant used figurative or hyperbolic language that negates the impression that the defendant was asserting an objective fact whether the general tenor of the entire work negates that impression and whether the statement at issue is capable of being proved true or false.unelko rooney,cir.
the first circuit distilled from milkovich a similar set of factors,noting that while the case eschew ed the terminology,milkovich did not depart from the analysis that had been employed for some time by lower courts seeking to distinguish between actionable fact and nonactionable opinion.phantom touring,affiliated publications,cir.
the second circuit also considers content,verifiability,and context in determining whether a statement has a potentially defamatory meaning 
the content factor requires a court to examine the fair and natural meaning that ordinary persons of reasonable intelligence would ascribe to the statement.the verifiability factor focuses on whether the statement was one of objective fact or subjective more subjective the statement,the less likely it is to have a defamatory meaning.finally,courts must consider the impression created by the statement,as well as the general tenor of the expression.
lee bankers trust,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
finally,the fourth circuit examines the type of language used,the meaning of the statement in context,whether the statement is verifiable,and the broader social circumstances in which the statement was made.lapkoff wilks,cir.
examining our sister circuits interpretations of milkovich and the case itself,we discern at least four factors that a court should consider in determining whether a statement is protected hyperbole or is capable of carrying a defamatory meaning 
the common usage or meaning of the allegedly defamatory words themselves,whether they are commonly understood to be loose,figurative,or hyperbolic words 
the degree to which the statements are verifiable,whether the statement is objectively capable of proof or disproof 
the immediate context in which the statement occurs and 
the broader social context into which the statement fits.
applying these four factors,we hold that the logbooks statement was sufficiently factual to be capable of carrying a defamatory meaning.
a.the common usage or meaning of the allegedly defamatory words themselves 
jolliff testified at the hearing that the company had established new time standards for driving routes and that because the drivers performance bonuses were tied to completing routes within the allotted time,the new standards created pressure for the drivers either to drive illegally or to falsify the logs.while jolliff and daniels concede that tnt did not expressly instruct drivers to fix their logs,they argue that tnt impossible time allotments presented drivers,in their estimation,with an untenable choice either drive unsafely and be on time,or drive safely and fudge the records.br.of pet rs.under this theory,the use of the word asking,as opposed to condoning or pressuring,could be interpreted as hyperbole.the dissenting board member,walsh,reached this conclusion,writing,a t most the letter statement that management was asking employees to fix their logbooks was an exaggeration tnt logistics north america,nlrb,slip.nevertheless,this argument is not particularly convincing.
in cafeteria employees union angelos,the supreme court concluded that to use loose language or undefined slogans that are part of the conventional in our economic and political unfair or fascist is not to falsify facts.id.at.in san juan hotel,nlrb,the board found that a leaflet references to the trustee as a dictator and as robin hood were obvious rhetorical hyperbole.id.at.in great lakes steel,div.of steel nlrb,cir,a pamphlet described the details of a recent fatal accident of a fellow employee,then characterized the company ambulance policy as a murderous and urged the employees to unite and stop the murder for profit.id.at.the board found that the use of the word murder in this context was mere hyperbole.ibid.at issue in nlrb container of america,cir,was a newsletter that criticized the company grievance process.the notice alleged that management had treated employees in a disgraceful manner,called the general manager a slave driver,and stated that the general manager expected more footage from the chain gang with nothing in return.id.at.the alj held that the statements were protected rhetoric.the board adopted the alj recommended order and our circuit affirmed.id.at.
the words used in the cases discussed,dictator,murderer,slave driver,and chain words that would not be treated by a hearer or reader as intended to be literally believed.davis,at.the statement at issue in this case,however,is different.the common meaning of fix their log books and being asked by dispatchers and management to do these runs and either fix their log books or turn their heads on it does not suggest hyperbole.
furthermore,the letter implied that john cox,the safety manager for tnt,might be held legally accountable for the log fixing,john cox once said he would not go to jail for fixing log books for anyone.well cox pack your suitcase,it has and is presently being done at east liberty.this also suggests that the logbooks statement was meant to be taken literally.
b.the degree to which the statement is verifiable 
the claim about falsification of the logbooks was verifiable.indeed,the record reflects that tnt investigated those claims.this distinguishes the logbooks statement from the other examples of protected statements,such as the claim in container of america that the general manager expected more footage from the chain gang with nothing in return.verifiability suggests that the statement is capable of a defamatory meaning.
c.the context in which the statement occurs.
the statement was made in the context of a letter listing tnt employees complaints about company policy.this makes the letter different from leaflets,pamphlets,or organizing slogans meant to excite workers or rally their support for a union protest or organizing campaign.the letter closed with the statement,w e the dock workers and drivers hope you will step in and resolve this matter with the management problem at east liberty,ohio.it is clear that young was trying to communicate the employees specific concerns,as he understood them,in way that would encourage management to resolve the issues.thus,the context of the statement also suggests that the statement was meant to be taken literally.
d.the broader social context into which the statement fits.
federal law gives a union license to use intemperate,abusive,or insulting language without fear of restraint or penalty if it believes such rhetoric to be an effective means to make its point.letter carriers,at.this acceptance reflects a broad societal recognition that labor disputes are heated affairs that may abound with rough language and intemperate,even inaccurate,statements.
nevertheless,the letter was neither addressed to the general public nor to a fevered audience it was addressed to three named corporate officers at tnt and a single corporate officer at honda.society generally distinguishes between the kind of statements made in private or communications from those statements made in more public settings such as protests,strikes,or organizing campaigns.we recognize that speech occurring in the latter setting is more likely to be rhetorical and exaggerated,as its purpose is different from that of communication.given this social setting,a private or communication,it is more likely that the statements were intended to be taken literally as accurate statements of the drivers and dock workers complaints.
weighing the four factors above,we hold that the logbooks statement was sufficiently factual in nature to be capable of a defamatory meaning.
substantial evidence of actual falsity 
having decided that the logbooks statement was capable of carrying a defamatory meaning,the next step in our inquiry is whether the statement was actually false.on appeal,the board argues that jolliff and daniels largely concede that,taken literally,the statement in the letter was not true.br.of resp.though this concession was made in the context of jolliff and daniels argument that the logbooks statement was hyperbole,br.of pet rs,because jolliff and daniels do not contest this point,we proceed as if the logbooks statement was false.
however,we note that the underlying record is surprisingly thin on the matter.first,young did not testify as to the veracity of the statement.second,the witnesses for tnt did not testify as to the falsity of the statement 
at common law,defendants who rely upon the truth of the defamatory matter as a defense have the burden of proving that the statements were indeed true.restatement second of torts,cmt.applying this rule here,where tnt asserted that the statement was false,both the alj and the board should have found that the general counsel did not meet the burden of establishing the truth of the statement.thus,the statement should have been presumed to be false.unfortunately,neither the alj nor the board provided this sort of detailed analysis.instead,the alj skirted the issue,and the board outright concluded that the statement was false,as opposed to merely holding that the general counsel had not proved that the statement was true.
even though the board method of analyzing the question of the truth or falsity of the statement was faulty,the ultimate result,that truth had not been established as a defense,was correct.nevertheless,we highlight the thinness of the record on this matter to encourage future aljs and board members to be more precise in their fact finding and the application of the law thereto.
actual malice 
to make a statement with actual malice one must either have knowledge that the statement is false or have reckless disregard for whether or not the statement is false or not.sullivan,at.
all three employees,including young,testified that it was the idea of the group to draft a letter young was the person who was chosen to draft the letter and who actually drafted it and while jolliff and daniels provided input,they did not review the letter before young mailed it.it is also clear from young testimony,which the alj found credible,that he received input from other employees in drafting the letter,that not everything expressed in the letter came from young personal opinion or experience,and that not every item could be attributed to jolliff or daniels.
furthermore,in response to young being asked if knew or had reason to know that there were any false statements in the letter,he testified as follows 
to your knowledge,does that letter include any false statements 
any reckless statements 
any malicious statements 
to the best of your knowledge,is the information in there true and correct 
a.it sure is.
to the best of your belief 
on the basis of the testimony of young,daniels,and of whom the alj deemed to be credible alj concluded that the statements were not made with actual malice.the board,however,found otherwise.it based its conclusion almost exclusively on two portions of jolliff testimony.first,the board assigned significant weight to the fact that jolliff conceded that he personally had never been asked by the management to fix the logbooks.second,it relied on jolliff statement that he thought that management should be disciplined for losing business.in holding that the board decision was not supported by substantial evidence,we find four facts persuasive the board was removed from the witnesses and seemingly gave no weight to the alj assessment of credibility the board conflated falsity with knowledge of falsity jolliff testimony might have been relevant,but it was not as conclusive as the board decision suggests and the board misinterpreted jolliff statements regarding the discipline of management.
first,the board did not have the alj benefit of observing the witnesses demeanors.we will not normally disturb the credibility assessments of the board or the alj,who has observed the demeanor of the witnesses.nlrb cement transport,cir.in this case,the board and this court are equally removed from the evidentiary hearing.the alj,who credited the testimony of the employees,was the only with the benefit of direct observation.thus,his determination of the matter is persuasive.
