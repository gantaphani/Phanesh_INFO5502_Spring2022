advanced disposal services east,advanced petitions for review of an order of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board which held that advanced violated sections a and a of the national labor relations act nlra,by refus ing to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees.a.before this court,advanced not only challenges the merits of the nlrb determination but also argues that the nlrb regional director who facilitated the contested election lacked the authority to do so.advanced claims that because director dennis walsh was appointed at a time when the board lacked a valid quorum,his actions were ultra vires.see generally nlrb noel canning,d the nlrb for enforcement of its order.
precisely because the supreme court decision in noel canning was so rare and remarkable,bryan leitch,nlrb noel canning the separation of powers dialogue continues,cato,the litigation it has spawned raises novel questions that have yet to be addressed by this court.this case,in particular,requires us to consider several issues which,while not directly related to noel canning,arose only because the invalid recess appointments of several nlrb members created a situation in which the validity of hundreds of nlrb orders and other official actions were cast into doubt.see,ben james,noel canning ruling casts doubt on regional directors,june,pm.
specifically,we will consider three questions.first,did advanced forfeit its right to challenge director walsh authority by not raising the issue prior to the representation election second,did advanced execution of a stipulated election agreement constitute an accession to director walsh authority,preventing advanced from now challenging that authority third,if we conclude that director walsh originally lacked authority to oversee the election,were his and the board attempts to ratify their unauthorized conduct sufficient 
after considering the arguments put forward by both sides,we conclude that advanced did not lose the ability to challenge director walsh authority by failing to raise this issue during the representation proceeding,nor did the stipulated election agreement constitute an implied accession to director walsh authority.we also hold that director walsh and the board both properly ratified their previously unauthorized actions.
we must next address the merits of advanced petition for review.in doing so,we ask whether substantial evidence supported the board determination that certain allegedly disruptive conduct did not destroy the laboratory conditions of the election and render a free expression of choice of representation impossible.zeiglers refuse collectors,nlrb,cir.upon careful review of the record,we hold that substantial evidence supports the board determination and the hearing officer findings.we will therefore deny the petition for review and will grant the nlrb for enforcement.
procedural history 
on march,the teamsters local union filed a representation petition with director walsh seeking to represent a unit of workers at three of advanced facilities.the proposed unit consisted of approximately and regular drivers,helpers,and mechanics.the union and advanced entered into a stipulated election agreement on march.on april and,secret ballot elections were held at all three of advanced facilities,with sixty voters supporting unionization and opposing it advanced challenged the election outcome and was granted a hearing on may,before hearing officer devin grosh.on july,grosh issued his report,recommending that advanced objections be overruled.on december,a panel of the nlrb affirmed grosh report and overruled all of advanced additional objections to grosh report.
in order to preserve its right to appeal,advanced refused to bargain with the bargaining unit.am.fed of labor nlrb.united fed of coll.teachers,local miller,cir it has long been held that certification proceedings do not result in reviewable final orders.director walsh thus filed a complaint and notice of hearing on february,seeking to enforce the union certification and force the company to bargain.ultimately,a panel of the nlrb issued a decision and order on may,concluding that advanced had violated a by refusing to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees.a.advanced filed a petition for review on may,and the nlrb,seeking enforcement of its order 
ii.forfeiture 
we must determine whether advanced forfeited the right to challenge director walsh authority to conduct the election by failing to properly raise the issue before the board.the nlrb argues that if advanced had timely raised this issue,it could have correct ed the flaw before the election.the nlrb also cites precedent suggesting that belated challenges like this are untimely and thus are forfeited on appeal.
we disagree with the board conclusion that a belated attack on director walsh authority can be forfeited.even though this challenge was not properly preserved below we hold that a challenge like this one,which goes to the authority of the board to act,constitutes an extraordinary circumstance under e and can thus be raised for the first time on appeal.see noel canning nlrb,aff on other grounds,d.
turning to e we recognize that a court of appeals has no power,sua sponte,to find objectionable a portion of any nlrb order,if no objection was raised before the board and failure to object was not excused by any extraordinary circumstances.oldwick materials,nlrb,cir.this is so because e is a jurisdictional administrative exhaustion requirement designed to ensure that any issue raised on appeal was first presented to the board,absent extraordinary circumstances.see e oldwick materials,at application of section e is mandatory,not discretionary p etitioner failure to object or to urge extraordinary circumstances before both the board and this court requires foreclosure of any judicial consideration of objections in the enforcement proceeding.section e status as a jurisdictional limitation on our authority is nothing new.as the supreme court held in woelke romero framing,nlrb,if an issue was not raised during the proceedings before the board,judicial review is barred by e of the act,e,d.the court then explained that failure to satisfy e meant that the court of appeals lack ed jurisdiction to review objections that were not urged before the board.id.at emphasis added.because advanced did not raise its objection to director walsh authority at the proper time,we must decide whether its challenge constitutes an extraordinary circumstance under e.
in making this determination,we are cognizant of competing authority on this issue.in noel canning,the circuit noted that the objections before us concerning lack of a quorum raise questions that go to the very power of the board to act and implicate fundamental separation of powers concerns.at.thus,they are governed by the extraordinary circumstances exception to the e requirement and therefore are properly before us for review.id.in other words,the circuit held that a challenge which goes to the very power of the board to act is by definition an extraordinary circumstance.
the circuit has since this conclusion,holding in ssc mystic operating,llc nlrb,and uc health nlrb,that challenges to a regional director authority also implicate the very power of the board to act and thus constitute extraordinary circumstances.as the circuit made clear,b ecause this challenge and the argument that regional directors may not conduct elections while the board lacks a quorum are both premised on the board lack of authority to act,we believe both are properly before us no matter when they were first raised.ssc mystic,at.the factual similarities between advanced claim and both ssc mystic and uc health further support our conclusion.in both of the above cases,an employer challenged the ability of a regional director to conduct the election in question because,at the time of the election,the nlrb lacked a valid quorum as a result of the supreme court decision in noel canning.this was deemed a challenge that directly involves the question of whether the board lack of a quorum stripped the regional directors of power and thus can be raised on review even when not raised before the agency.uc health,at.
but the similarity does not stop there.in ssc mystic,the employer made one additional argument that had not been raised in uc health.first,the employer noted that even though the nlrb regional director was initially validly appointed,when the nlrb reorganized its regions in,his jurisdiction expanded to cover additional territory.this occurred at a time when the nlrb did not have a proper quorum.thus,mystic insists that because the board had no quorum in,it could not validly appoint kreisburg to his new post as the regional director of new region.ssc mystic,at.again,rebuffing the nlrb suggestion that this argument was waived,the circuit held that this challenge was premised on the board lack of authority to act and was thus properly before the court no matter when it was first raised.id.
in contrast to the cases just described,the eighth circuit in nlrb relco locomotives,held that the validity of the board composition is not an extraordinary circumstance under e.cir.before parsing out the differences between relco and ssc mystic,however,we note one similarity.the eighth circuit agrees that e constitutes an explicit jurisdictional exhaustion requirement and recognizes that absent satisfaction of e,courts are not permitted to entertain challenges not properly raised before the board.id.at.beyond this point of agreement,however,the eighth circuit parts ways with the circuit,concluding that a challenge to the board quorum requirement is not an extraordinary circumstance as defined by prior eighth circuit precedent.in particular,the court notes that its case law has identified only two situations that qualify as extraordinary circumstances under e.id.at.first,if the board decision is nakedly void under the statute and,second,if a new development of fact or law occurs after the board decision or was otherwise unavailable to the party at the original hearing.id.
applying this interpretation of extraordinary circumstances,the eighth circuit concluded that challenges to the composition of the nlrb fall into neither category.in addition,the court explained that a challenge to the legal composition of an agency should be characterized as an affirmative defense that can be waived if it is not timely raised.id.at.thus,the court decline d to disturb the board decision on the basis of relco appointments clause challenge.id.at.
having assessed both approaches,we consider the circuit analysis more persuasive for two reasons.first,a challenge to b goes to the authority of the board to act it is not a mere procedural technicality.this suggests that b is more than just an affirmative defense,as the eighth circuit determined.indeed,it strains credulity to conclude that a situation in which the board lacks a valid quorum yet still attempts to issue binding orders is not extraordinary.
second,and relatedly,we note that as a policy matter it would be passing strange for an ultra vires agency action to be insulated from judicial review.teamsters local union nlrb,cir if we were to conclude,as the eighth circuit presumably would,that advanced has forfeited its challenge,we would ultimately be overlooking and insulating from review the actions of an improperly constituted,board issuing ultra vires orders.in other words,we would be foreclosing a challenge to the board statutory authority because it was not raised before the board which does seem passing strange.see also bender williamsport area sch,d explaining that every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it quoting mitchell maurer.
we hold,therefore,that a challenge which goes to the composition of the nlrb,and thus implicates its authority to act,constitutes an extraordinary circumstance under e.we are thus satisfied that we have jurisdiction to entertain advanced challenge to the authority of director walsh and accordingly exercise our discretion to reach the question of whether the actions of the board and director walsh are proper despite director walsh invalid appointment.see bullock dressel,cir w e have the discretion to consider an issue that was waived where refusal to reach it would result in a miscarriage of justice or where the issue resolution is of public importance.we have such a situation here.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
iii.stipulated election agreement 
the board also claims that advanced affirmatively acceded to walsh authority by signing the stipulated election agreement,which the board describes as a binding contract.the agreement lays out the procedure,stating when and where the election will be held,where and for how long notice of the election will be posted,and who is eligible to vote.it also explains that the regional director in his discretion will decide what language s will be used on the ballot and the notice of election,and when and where to reschedule the election if it is postponed.
even assuming that the agreement binds both parties as the board alleges,nothing in it constitutes explicit acceptance of the agency authority to act.uc health,at.despite its claims to the contrary,the board can not point to any language in the agreement stating that advanced affirmatively acceded to walsh authority,as there is none.the only language in the agreement referencing the regional director relates to his duty to supervise the election and his discretionary authority to decide procedural issues not otherwise spelled out in the agreement.thus,as the circuit also concluded in uc health,advanced did not expressly give up its challenge to the authority of the regional director when it executed the stipulated election agreement it merely signed a form agreement providing that the board regulations would govern the election.see also ssc mystic,at same.accordingly,we hold that by signing the stipulated election agreement,advanced did not expressly abandon anything.uc health,at.
we also reject the board attempt to distinguish this case from uc health and ssc mystic.the board relies on the uncertainty surrounding the status of the board authority,explaining that the circuit specifically mentioned the fact that the quorum issue might have been obviated by the time of the election.we find this unpersuasive for two reasons.first,based on the language in uc health,which is cited in ssc mystic,it appears that this was not a key factor in the court decision,but merely an additional reason for rejecting the board claim.see id.at.second,even taking this argument at face value,there is no principled basis for distinguishing the two situations.as the circuit noted,
indeed,when uc health entered the stipulated election agreement,uc health could not have known with any certainty that the board had no quorum even without senate approval for the president appointments until the supreme court handed down its decision in noel canning fourteen months after the election.we will not hold uc health responsible for failing to see the future.
id.in just the same way,when advanced entered into the agreement on march,it had no way of knowing how the supreme court would rule in noel canning on june.finally,we note that the only authority the board relies on for the claim that a party is estopped from attacking the propriety of an election to which it has expressly agreed is its own,and that this authority itself is currently on review in the circuit.see manorcare of kingston,pa llc,nlrb,wl,petition for review filed,argued,we thus see no reason to defer to the board position in kingston.
iv.ratification 
having concluded that this belated challenge to director walsh authority is permissible,we turn to whether ratification by the board and director walsh was sufficient to cure the quorum violation which stripped the board,and by extension director walsh,of the authority to oversee the union election we conclude that both ratifications were sufficient.
on july,all five members of a properly constituted board confirm ed,adopt ed,and ratif ied nunc pro tunc all administrative,personnel,and procurement matters approved by the board or taken by or on behalf of the board from january,to august,inclusive.next,having considered the relevant supporting materials,the board,i n a further abundance of caution,chose to expressly authorize the selection of dennis walsh as regional director for region.this alleged ratification was followed closely by that of director walsh,who,on july,affirm ed and ratif ied any and all actions taken by me or on my behalf during that period,including all personnel and administrative decisions director walsh,however,did not go on to specifically address any of the particular decisions he made when acting ultra vires.
we must,therefore,decide whether this remedy adequately addressed the prejudice to advanced stemming from walsh unauthorized conduct.federal election comm legi tech.if so,dismissal is neither necessary nor appropriate.id.t he general rule is that the ratification of an act purported to be done for a principal by an agent is treated as effective at the time the act was done.in other words,the ratification relates back in time to the date of the act by the agent.in re supply,cir see also depenbrock cigna,cir same.
ratification of previously unauthorized agency action,however,presents a unique situation that has not been specifically dealt with by this court.unlike most instances of ratification,here the same party is both the principal and the agent,simply acting at different points in time.that fact alone distinguishes this case from most other ratification cases,but does not mean that we can not glean some insight into this situation from our prior precedent.indeed,we find that past precedent suggests there are three general requirements for ratification.first,the ratifier must,at the time of ratification,still have the authority to take the action to be ratified.second,the ratifier must have full knowledge of the decision to be ratified.third,the ratifier must make a detached and considered affirmation of the earlier decision.these last two requirements are intended to ensure that the ratifier does not blindly affirm the earlier decision without due consideration.these requirements,of course,must also be adapted to the unique situation we are confronted with here.
we turn to the first requirement,the continuing authority to act.in federal election commission nra political victory fund,the supreme court had to determine whether belated authorization by the solicitor general which would have permitted the federal election commission to file a petition for certiorari relates back to the date of the fec unauthorized filing so as to make it timely,d.ultimately,the supreme court held that ratification was not appropriate because the deadline by which the fec could seek certiorari had passed,preventing ratification.or to put it another way,it is essential that the party ratifying should be able not merely to do the act ratified at the time the act was done,but also at the time the ratification was made.id.this timing problem has since been read to require that the ratifier have the power to reconsider the earlier decision at the time of ratification.see doolin sec.sav.bank,office of thrift supervision,intercollegiate broad,copyright royalty.
the second requirement is that the ratifier must have knowledge of all the material facts relating to the decision they are making.bauman eschallier,cir no one can be held to have ratified the unauthorized act of an agent,unless he has knowledge of all the material facts.toebelman missouri kansas pipe line,cir ratification to be effective imports knowledge of all material facts on the part of those ratifying.this requirement is intended to protect the ratifier from unknowingly ratifying conduct of which he or she was unaware.villanueva brown,cir her act of signing the investment agreement clearly does not ratify an event which had not yet occurred.she can not ratify an action that she is not aware of.
finally,the ratifier must make a detached and considered judgment,not simply rubberstamp the earlier action.see doolin,at we have no doubt that the ratifier made a detached and considered judgment in deciding the merits.we also note,however,that evidence of this requirement can either come from acts of express ratification,standard roller bearing hess bright,cir,in which the ratifier conduct s an independent evaluation of the merits,intercollegiate,at,or can be implied from subsequent conduct,hess bright,at,such as when a later act is necessarily an affirmation of an earlier act,doolin,at.
all that being said,we are quick to note that as an equitable remedy,ratification has been applied flexibly and has often been adapted to deal with unique and unusual circumstances.we believe that doolin provides a good example both of this adaptability and how ratification can apply in the context of administrative agency action.in this case,the circuit had to determine whether the actions of the properly appointed director retsinas ratified the earlier filing of a notice of charges against doolin bank by the improperly appointed director fiechter.the court began its analysis by looking to nra political victory fund.id.at.in so doing,it noted that no statute of limitations would prevent retsinas from starting the administrative proceedings over again.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the timing problem posed in nra is not present here.id.
the court then went on to examine the specific evidence of ratification.it noted that while there was no express ratification,retsinas did not simply writ e a letter or memorandum adopting the actions of the earlier improperly appointed acting director.id.instead,he continued forward in the normal course of agency adjudication,pursuing the claims fiechter had initially made.id.retsinas thus ultimately issued a final written opinion and a cease and desist order against doolin bank.this,the court noted,was necessarily an affirmation of the validity of fiechter earlier conduct,and hence a ratification,even though retsinas did not formally invoke the term.id.the court thus concluded,w e have no doubt director retsinas made a detached and considered judgment in deciding the merits against the bank.id.
finally,we note one additional consideration that arises in the context of administrative agency ratification the presumption of regularity.this doctrine thus allows courts to presume that what appears regular is regular,the burden shifting to the attacker to show the contrary.butler principi,kamara att y of,cir agency action is entitled to a presumption of regularity,and it is the petitioner burden to show that the agency did not review the record when it considered the appeal.this presumption ensures that we give proper deference and respect to the official actions of an agency.applying the presumption in our case,the burden is on advanced to produce evidence that casts doubt on the agency claim that the board and director walsh properly ratified their earlier actions.
we thus turn to the two acts of ratification.first,regarding the board ratification,we begin by noting that advanced has not pointed to,nor could we find,any statute or regulation that would prevent the board from restarting the administrative actions in question at the time of ratification.thus,the timing problem posed in nra is not present here.doolin,at.we also note that the board easily satisfies the second and third ratification requirements.the board claims that it specifically considered the relevant supporting materials before reauthorizing the selection of walsh as regional director.the board also states that it confirm ed,adopt ed,and ratif ied nunc pro tunc all its earlier actions.advanced does not present any evidence suggesting otherwise.we can therefore presume that the board had full knowledge of,and appropriately reconsidered,its earlier appointment of director walsh.we thus conclude that the board properly ratified its selection of director walsh as a regional director.
we next look to director walsh ratification,which raises some additional concerns.first,however,we note that both the first and second requirements for ratification are satisfi
