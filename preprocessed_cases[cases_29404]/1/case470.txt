this case requires us to address what is meant by de novo judicial review under erisa of a denial of benefits when the erisa plan does not preserve discretion in the plan administrator.that raises concomitant questions of whether the claimant is entitled to trial in the district court and what,if any,evidence may be admitted that is not in the administrative record before the erisa administrative decision maker.our conclusion is that given the nature of the claimant challenge he did in fact establish his eligibility to benefits before the erisa decision claimant was not entitled to trial or to admit desired new evidence outside the administrative record or to discovery.having defined the standards,we apply them to the facts,and uphold the denial of benefits.
jacob orndorf worked as a perfusionist,a person who operates a machine,for jersey shore cardiac associates,jersey shore from january,until march.defendant paul revere life insurance company revere provides group disability insurance coverage to jersey shore this plan is an employee welfare benefit plan as defined by erisa.
in june,orndorf started receiving disability benefits for his drug dependency under the policy,these benefits would last only until june.in,orndorf first informed revere that he claimed a continuation of the disability payments beyond june of based on purported back problems.there was considerable exchange of medical information between orndorf and revere.revere determined that orndorf was not disabled due to pain from his back,neck,ankle or hypertension.on january,revere issued a final denial of benefits and informed orndorf that he had exhausted all of his appellate administrative remedies and that revere would review no further information the administrative record was closed.
in february of,orndorf filed suit against revere in federal district court pursuant to a b,alleging that revere unlawfully denied his claim for disability benefits due to physical limitations.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
the district court extensively reviewed the evidence in the administrative record,the duties of someone in orndorf occupation,orndorf first claim drug dependency and second claim back pain for disability,his treatment for back pain,his capacity to work,revere conclusion,and orndorf arguments on appeal.the court concluded that orndorf was not disabled due to back,neck,or ankle pain or hypertension under the terms of the plan orndorf claim collapsed under the weight of the record.the court granted summary judgment to revere on march.orndorf paul revere life ins.
a.the policy 
the revere disability policy at issue provides benefits in certain situations,including when an individual is totally disabled from performing the duties of his or her own occupation.total disability for the purposes of orndorf policy means 
that because of injury or sickness the employee can not perform the important duties of his own occupation and the employee is under the regular care of a doctor and the employee does not work at all.
the policy also defines revere obligation to pay benefits to the employee 
revere pay s monthly total disability benefits to an employee if he becomes totally disabled while insured due to injury or sickness.the employee must be under the care of a doctor while totally disabled during any continuous period of disability immediately following completion of the employee elimination period,but before the end of his benefit period,revere pay s the employee a monthly total disability benefit for each whole month in which he is totally disabled from his own occupation.if the employee works other than at his own job,he may qualify for monthly residual disability benefits.
orndorf first claim for disability 
in may of,orndorf submitted his first claim to revere for disability benefits for a drug related sickness,following hospitalization for a drug overdose.
revere evaluated orndorf records to determine whether he was totally disabled due to drug disability under the plan,and on august,revere informed orndorf that it had approved his claim under the other limitations provision of the policy and that his benefits period would expire on june,
although orndorf is no longer receiving payments for this disability,his drug and psychiatric illnesses continue to preclude him from returning to his job as a perfusionist one might ask why,if orndorf is disabled anyway from doing his job as a perfusionist,there is any issue about whether he is also disabled by his back condition.there are two answers.the first is that revere statement of reasons as to why it denied benefits is that the benefit period for the drug dependency disability had expired and the information provided did not support eligibility for disability under any other provision of the plan.revere is limited to the grounds of denial it articulates to the claimant.see glista unum life ins,cir.second,orndorf cites to a provision in the policy that provides for circumstances where an employee is disabled by more than one injury or sickness 
if a disability is caused by more than one injury or sickness,or from both,we will pay benefits as if the disability was caused by one injury or sickness we will pay the larger benefit.
revere has not disputed the applicability of this provision to orndorf case.
there is no real dispute that orndorf was paid the benefits owed for his first disability claim due to drug dependency the question is whether he was disabled within the meaning of the policy for his alleged back condition,his second claim for disability.
orndorf second claim for disability 
although orndorf says his history of back pain dates back to,orndorf first claimed disability on account of his back pain in june of,when a revere field representative met with orndorf at his home on an unannounced visit.during this visit,orndorf claimed that his chief disabling condition was his back and that therefore the disability payments should continue beyond june of.soon thereafter,revere obtained orndorf complete social security disability insurance appeal decision and his medical records.
in december of,the insurer issued its original decision on this second claim,and orndorf was told that his benefits were denied 
in the regular course of administering your claim,we conducted a review of all of your medical records.as a result of this review,it is our opinion that you are not precluded from performing the duties of your job or one similar in nature.
you alleged that you could not work due to chronic low back pain and advised your doctor on june,that your activities were limited and you remained indoors most of the time.however,on june,you reported you had been on a long bike ride.there seems to be some discrepancy between your related history and limitations and your actual level of activities and your performance.
we found no evidence of back problems or hypertensive care during the year.consequently,it is our opinion that your only disabling condition has been depression and substance abuse.therefore,your claim has been administered and paid under the other limitations provision of the policy.
in october of,on the first review of its denial,the insurer advised orndorf 
we have received your letter dated october,including a letter from gilbert.your entire claim file was sent to our medical department for review,the review included the following records medical review from bianchi,medical packet from you backdated,letter from rund dated,a functional capacity form completed by gilbert,ct lumbar spine dated and of spine and cervical dated.
at this time it is our opinion that in order to fully evaluate your physical limitations and restrictions we need additional objective information.this information should include reports of your last examination from the reported date of your illness and updated physical examinations.
on august,the insurer affirmed its denial of benefits on the basis that 
these records were reviewed by one of our physicians.this physician is in internal medicine.we have determined that based on orndorf medical records that there was no basis for hypertensive impairment,and no evidence of persistent impairment producing limitations or necessitating restrictions from orndorf maxillary sinusitis and cervical spine complaints.
thereafter,at ordnorf request,the insurer considered additional evidence and on january,reaffirmed its denial in a final review 
since additional information was submitted,orndorf file was forwarded to the medical department for review.according to the physician in internal medicine,he concludes the following 
a primary psychiatric impairment at the date of disability with persistence demonstrated through much of the claim period without adequate objective documentation of persistence to or beyond the determination letter 
b no objective basis for hypertensive impairment producing limitations or necessitating restrictions at or below a medium workload 
c degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with intermittent symptomatic exacerbations without evidence of continuous or persistent ongoing impairment through the life of the claim,at or about the determination letter,or subsequently 
d ankle pathology without objectively demonstrated standing or ambulatory impairment during the course of the claim beyond transiently associated with the sprain and specifically without evidence of continued or persistent impairment from the determination letter up to the rating examination 
e no objective evidence of continued or persistent impairment producing limitations necessitating restrictions from the claimant maxillary sinusitis and cervical spine complaints.
based on the information in the claim file,the denial of benefits in orndorf case is appropriate.
orndorf then filed suit in the district court.
on appeal,orndorf raises several challenges to the district court decision,arguing the district court erred by failing to use de novo review in ruling on the cross motions for summary judgment denying orndorf request for discovery and leave to submit additional evidence denying orndorf motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,in failing to find a material dispute of fact which would have defeated revere motion and not awarding orndorf interest,attorney fees,and costs.if orndorf is wrong about the first three claims,the fourth necessarily fails.
both parties agree that de novo review by the district court of a plan administrator decision to deny benefits under an erisa plan is proper under firestone bruch,d,where the plan does not grant discretion to the administrator the overarching question is what exactly is entailed in de novo review.
appellate standard of review 
we quickly put aside one issue about the scope of our appellate review.because the case was decided on summary judgment in the district court,the standard of review used by this court to review the district court decision is de novo.see fenton john hancock mut.life ins,cir.this includes our engaging in review of the legal question of the proper content of the district court de novo review of a plan administrator determination,as that term is used in firestone bruch,at.
the review utilized both by this court and the district court in this erisa case differs in one important aspect from the review in an ordinary summary judgment case.as we noted in liston unum.officer severance plan,cir,in an erisa case where review is based only on the administrative record before the plan administrator and is an ultimate conclusion as to disability to be drawn from the facts,summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue.id.at.this means the party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.id.when there is no dispute over plan interpretation,the use of summary judgment in this way is proper regardless of whether our review of the erisa decision maker decision is de novo or deferential 
content of de novo standard of review 
plaintiff argument as to the proper content of the district court de novo review is based on the second paragraph of firestone holding,set forth below 
as this case aptly demonstrates,the validity of a claim to benefits under an erisa plan is likely to turn on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.
consistent with established principles of trust law,we hold that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.
firestone,at.emphasis added.
firestone makes it clear that in such situations of dispute over the meaning of plan language,no deference is given to the administrator interpretation of the plan language.rather,the court interprets the plan de novo,and applies the normal rules for contract interpretation.see hughes boston mut.life ins,cir.in this case,there is no dispute about interpretation of the plan terms presented on appeal thus there is no occasion to consider the use of outside evidence to assist the court in interpreting plan language.there is also no dispute over what the plan documents are.fenton,at.but literally read,firestone de novo review language is broader,and also includes a conclusion to deny benefits based on a set of facts,such as revere conclusion here.
from firestone de novo review language,orndorf makes several arguments.
orndorf argues that the district court erred by giving deference to the administrator decision.the correct standard,he argues,is whether,upon a full review of the administrative record,the decision of the administrator was correct.we agree with this standard and disagree that the district court used any other standard.
orndorf next argues that if the administrative record shows any conflict in views among the doctors,then summary judgment must be denied.orndorf may be arguing that on review of an administrative record through summary judgment the court must relieve him of his burden of proving he is disabled because under summary judgment all inferences are drawn against the movant.we have already rejected this argument in liston,at,and we apply liston to de novo review,as noted above.alternatively,orndorf may be arguing that a court faced with an administrative record with conflicting medical opinions should then hold a trial with witnesses to resolve the disputes.he filed a motion to that effect,which was denied by the district court.the court was correct to deny the motion.trial is not warranted because the record shows one doctor diagnosis disagrees with another,and the fact that judicial review is de novo does not itself entitle a claimant to a trial or to put on new evidence 
some courts have stated that factual findings made by the administrative decision maker are reviewed de novo and have suggested that this warrants the introduction of new evidence to the trial court,perhaps in the form of an evidentiary hearing or a trial de novo.see luby teamsters health,welfare,pension trust funds,cir.where review is properly confined to the administrative record before the erisa plan administrator,as we explain below is the case here,there are no disputed issues of fact for the court to resolve.
review of the ultimate conclusion of whether the evidence supports the finding of a disability does not itself warrant introduction of new evidence about historical facts.see masella blue cross blue shield,cir.nor does it warrant calling as witnesses those persons whose opinions and diagnosis or expert testimony and reports are in the administrative record.rather,de novo review generally consists of the court independent weighing of the facts and opinions in that record to determine whether the claimant has met his burden of showing he is disabled within the meaning of the policy.while the court does not ignore facts in the record,see recupero new eng,cir,the court grants no deference to administrators opinions or conclusions based on these facts.
one guiding principle in conducting de novo review of this ultimate conclusion is that it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of proving he is disabled.see terry bayer,cir insured bears burden of making showing sufficient to establish a violation of erisa gre ins.group met.boston,cir.
record evidence 
orndorf also argues that the trial judge should have admitted evidence outside of the administrative record on the question of whether he was disabled.he argues the trial court erred 
in denying him leave to submit evidence of significant weight gain of pounds,medical records of his need for gastronomy for weight loss,records of his prescribed pain killers for pain reduction such as oxycodene and clonazepon,a mri showing disc change and nerve compromise,and a medical report from marc linson,an orthopedic spine specialist,who examined orndorf and his records and opined that he was disabled on january,the date of revere denial and at the time of the examination one year later.
not only do we reject orndorf claim that it was error for the court to exclude such medical evidence,but we hold it would have been error for the court to have admitted such evidence.
the decision to which judicial review is addressed is the final erisa administrative decision.it would offend interests in finality and exhaustion of administrative procedures required by erisa to shift the focus from that decision to a moving target by presenting record evidence going to the substance of the decision.liston,at.there is no claim orndorf was denied an opportunity to present evidence to the administrator.here,the plaintiff had ample time to collect records and had two administrative appeals reviews of his claims by revere.even if the new evidence directly concerned the question of his disability before the final administrative decision,it was inadmissible.
furthermore,the final administrative decision acts as a temporal cut off point.the claimant may not come to a court and ask it to consider medical evidence in an effort to reopen the administrative decision.the evidence orndorf sought to introduce is of this character.
as this court noted in liston,the focus of judicial review,under the arbitrary and capricious standard,is ordinarily on the record made before the administrator and at least some very good reason is needed to overcome that preference.id.liston did not resolve the question of whether the same rule applies when there is de novo review,but did note that even in de novo review cases it was 
at least doubtful that courts should be in any hurry to consider evidence or claims not presented to the plan administrator exhaustion of remedies principles point in this direction even if no deference were due to the administrator determination,assuming always that the plan empowered the administrator to make an initial decision.
id.citation omitted.
we hold that the liston rule about admissibility of evidence outside the administrative record applies even when the denial of benefits is subject to de novo review.whether evidence is admissible turns on the nature of the challenge to the decision the answer to the question is not likely to turn on whether the standard of judicial review is de novo or arbitrary and capricious.the focus of the review under de novo review is still the administrator decision and must ordinarily be based on the administrative record.
there may be times when it is appropriate for courts to hear new evidence.where the challenge is not to the merits of the decision to deny benefits,but to the procedure used to reach the decision,outside evidence may be of relevance.for example,evidence outside the administrative record might be relevant to a claim of personal bias by a plan administrator or of prejudicial procedural irregularity in the erisa administrative review procedure.see id.at.we need not catalogue the situations in which new evidence is admissible,other than to note it is more obviously relevant when the attack is on the process of decision making as being contrary to the statute than on the substance of the administrator decision.also,evidence may be relevant to explain a key item,such as the duties of the claimant position,if that was omitted from the administrative record.such explanatory extrinsic evidence was admitted by the district court in this case revere has not disputed this admission.
other courts have suggested various measures for evaluating the admissibility of such record evidence.see,quesinberry life ins.of,cir en banc.but we need only note,not decide the issue.the evidence here was inadmissible,inter alia,because the other evidence plaintiff advances is largely evidence collected after or evidence of his condition after revere final decision on january.
orndorf also argues the district court should have provided him with discovery to determine whether the revere claim staff and medical reviewers followed procedure and were properly educated,trained and qualified.
the district court invited orndorf to make a more specific showing of the pertinence of the request,but he did not.the court was correct to deny discovery.there was no serious claim of bias or procedural misconduct toward orndorf.as we said in liston,at least some very good reason is needed to overcome the strong presumption that the record on review is limited to the record before the administrator.liston,at.this is true as to discovery as well,regardless of whether the standard of review is de novo or deferential.
turning to review of the record,we summarize the evidence.
a.the duties and job requirements of a perfusionist 
in,in connection with his first disability claim,orndorf filed an occupational report with revere detailing the physical demands of his job.he noted that he frequently had to stoop and bend occasionally had to reach above his shoulder level continuously needed manual dexterity occasionally had to lift pounds never had to carry and had to both sit and stand for hours.he described his most important or essential function as operating a heart lung machine during open heart surgery,and he left blank the space for additional comments on physical requirements.revere does not dispute that orndorf own occupation was that of a perfusionist,and does not dispute his characterization of the physical requirements of his job.
an employability and earning capacity evaluation which was admitted into evidence by the district court describes the job of a perfusionist 
sets up and operates machine in hospital to take over functions of patient heart and lungs during surgery or respiratory failure.reviews patient medical history and chart,and consults with surgeon or physician to obtain patient information needed to set up machine and associated equipment.selects,assembles,sets up,and tests machine to ensure that machine and associated equipment function according to specifications.operates machine to regulate blood circulation and composition,to administer drugs and anesthetic agents,and to control body temperature during surgery or respiratory failure of patient.monitors and observes operation of machine and patient physiologic variables such as blood temperature,blood composition,and flow rate,and adjusts equipment to maintain normal body functions.cleans and adjusts parts of machine.
the report classifies the perfusionist job as medium work according to the department of labor,meaning that it involves exerting to pounds of force occasionally,to pounds of force frequently.the report notes that the job involves lifting filled blood lines and buckets of ice weighing up to pounds.the other physical demands include stooping,occasionally crouching,occasionally reaching,constantly handling,constantly fingering,constantly feeling,occasionally and talking,frequently.
evidence in the record of orndorf back,neck,and ankle pain and treatment 
orndorf first sought treatment for back pain in.while serving in the air force,he sought treatment in september of at the andrews air force base spine clinic and in july of,after injuring himself while jumping out of a moving car.taken in july of indicated that he had percent loss of disc space between in his spine.the next record of treatment for back problems was on october,approximately ten months after orndorf started as a perfusionist at jersey shore.at this visit,he complained of recent low back pain after he weight lifted pounds.
in december,orndorf had an mri of his lumbar spine.the radiologist report noted that t here is a central and left sided disc herniation at the level.there are degenerative disc changes of this disc with a decrease in the disc space height and some loss of signal intensity of the disc.the impression of the radiologist was central and left sided disc herniation with prominent degenerative changes at the level.no evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.
in january of,orndorf sought medical attention for low back pain.the treating physician noted that orndorf had a dvanced degenerative changes with small disc fragment at interval with secondary changes at the interval.he recommended strong rehabilitative program and a series of epidural injections.orndorf claims to have received a series of three epidurals at jersey shore medical center,although there are no medical records of these treatments.on march,orndorf went to a clinic complaining of chronic low back pain,which he claimed was aggravated from standing and walking.he was offered an orthopedic evaluation and a evaluation,both of which he declined he accepted a prescription for percocet.
from march,to april,orndorf again complained of back pain during his stay at the cooley dickson hospital psychiatric program,where he was hospitalized after a drug overdose.the discharge summary noted that during his hospitalization,orndorf complained of back pain,but this pain was found to be controllable with tylenol and stretching exercises.
there is no evidence that orndorf was treated for or experienced low back pain after his release from the hospital in april of to june of.
in june,orndorf was involved in a slow speed car accident and complained of low back strain.while a lumbosacral spine exam showed narrowing of the disc,possibly with associated spinal stenosis or disc herniation,the radiologist thought it very unlikely to be related to the car accident.
in september,orndorf was again treated for back pain,at the veterans administration va medical center complaining that he could not stand for more than half an hour.the impressions of the physician seeing orndorf included chronic low back pain and herniated discs between and.orndorf was referred to physical therapy and rehabilitation the recommended plan included weight reduction and use of a ten unit a portable physical therapy device for a period of four weeks.
orndorf then started a course of physical therapy and pain treatments.during the september,session,he reported that the ten unit worked great.on october,orndorf was treated with an epidural block.he reported he obtained months relief with past epidural blocks.on november,he again reported good results from the epidural block,and on december,his physician noted that his low back pain was stable.
there is no evidence that he was treated for or experienced low back pain from november to december,with the exception of a letter from a physician stating that orndorf was unable to perform a stress test because of low back pain.
on december,orndorf was treated again for complaints of low back pain.he was to receive an epidural block and have physical therapy for a few weeks.he went for physical therapy on december,and,but did not show up for his appointments on december,and.the treatment plan was terminated on december due to his failure to keep his appointments.
on january,orndorf saw an orthopedist.on the questionnaire form,he indicated that he had experienced back pain off and on since.he noted that he could not stand for a long time and that the pain was severe.however,he also indicated that pain medicines,arthritis medicines,physical therapy,heating pads,nerve stimulation,and cortisone injections all improved his back pain.the orthopedist form indicated that in general,orndorf appeared healthy,and that epidurals gave him months to a year comes back gradually.the orthopedist noted the good results of epidural injections.
on june,orndorf informed a revere field representative that his addiction and his disorder were well controlled.he noted that he was aware his benefits for this disability would end,but that his chief disabling condition was his back and that his claim for long term benefits would extend beyond the months.
on july,orndorf again visited a doctor with complaints of low back pain.the treatment included continuing physical therapy and referral to a pain clinic for an epidural block.orndorf reports that in the summer and fall of,he went to the va pain clinic for three epidurals.
from august to june,there is no record of orndorf being seen by a physician or receiving any treatment for low back pain.at the end of june,he once again went to a physician with a chief complaint of low back pain.richard norris noted that the most likely origin of the low back pain was an accident in.norris noted severe narrowing in disc space and disc herniation.the doctor observed that orndorf gait is minimally antalgic on the left.he has moderate restriction of range of motion of the lumbar spine.norris noted that orndorf had a severe discogenic disease at.
orndorf claims that in november of,his back pain caused him to fall down the stairs and that he was seen at the va clinic.there are no documents verifying this event.
on january,orndorf went to the va clinic after regular office hours with a complaint of back pain exacerbation from standing too long.the physical examination revealed that he had mild tenderness in the area,no fluctuance,no radiation,and normal gait.the examiner noted no evidence of back muscular spasms.the examiner offered motrin to the patient,which was refused.the examiner told orndorf that he could not schedule a ct scan and informed orndorf that due to the chronic nature of this problem,he should contact his primary care physician the next morning,who might better be able to serve him.the examiner noted that orndorf was upset when he could not receive narcotics after hours.
orndorf did schedule a ct scan with the va medical center,which was performed on march.the radiologist impressions from the scan were m oderate degenerative disc disease at causing mild central spinal stenosis.
in contrast to the extensive medical records of orndorf treatment for back problems,the record contains little evidence of orndorf neck or ankle problems.orndorf broke his ankle in while serving in the air force.in,he sprained the same ankle,but was physically impaired only briefly.a ct scan report of ordnorf ankle dated may,notes,marked narrowing of the talotibial joint degenerative changes with spurring and sclerosis involving the distal tibia,the medial and lateral malleolus and plantar clacaneal spurring.
as for his neck pain,orndorf suffered a cervical fracture in,and a cervical strain associated with an automobile accident in june.a report of an taken on orndorf neck on may,states cervical spondylosis at the level with mild encroachment of the intervertebral formina and loss of normal cerival curvature compatible with muscle spasm.
there is no additional evidence for treatment of back,neck,or ankle problems.
evidence in the record of orndorf physical limitations and capacity to work 
in may of,when orndorf submitted his first claim for disability,he did not report back pain or any other physical limitation that affected his ability to perform his job as a perfusionist.he noted that his only sickness was drug related,and in response to the question of how the disability has interfered with the performance of the job please describe sitting,standing and walking requirements and limitations,orndorf wrote only,judgment.the physician who completed the attending physician statement aps for the first claim also did not identify any physical limitations on orndorf capacity to work.
in his evaluation for vocational rehabilitation on june,orndorf reported that he had no physical disabilities,but did suffer from hypertension.also,in december of,orndorf told a revere claims department agent that he was interested in working and that he would do laborer work,but not forever.on march,orndorf was think ing about returning to work as a perfusionist,and in an april psychotherapy session he was struggling with work issues as he starts to cope with the idea of his insurance getting cut off eventually.
orndorf psychotherapy notes of june,reference his
