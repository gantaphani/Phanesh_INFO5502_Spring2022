this appeal involves a petition for the review of a final administrative decision by the national labor relations nlrb.in this case,the petitioner and,opw fueling components or company,appeals an order by the nlrb on december,which determined that the discharge of a former employee,logan cox,was in violation of sections a,and of the national labor relations act nlra or act.see a,and.
there are two corporations involved in this litigation.the first corporation,the,manufactures gas nozzles for use in service stations.the sister corporation,the opw engineered systems,manufactures and sells liquid handling equipment,such as truck and railcar loading arms.the employees of these two corporations are represented by the glass,molders,pottery plastic allied international union whose collective bargaining relationship with management dates back to the early.
logan cox had worked for the for years until his discharge from the company in november.during his employment,he was represented by the union and served as its union steward and as a bargaining committeeman.in his capacity as a bargaining committeeman,cox assisted the union in its negotiations with the company which resulted in the formation of a new collective bargaining agreement on september.he was also responsible for the filing and the processing of grievances,as well as participating in all of the third step stage grievance hearings.apart from one minor incident,an unauthorized absence from work violation in,for which he received a verbal warning,cox maintained a positive relationship with his employer.on september,less than two weeks after the parties new collective bargaining agreement became effective,cox,acting on behalf of the union,filed an unfair labor practice charge with the nlrb which accused the of unilaterally changing its practice and policy for compensating those employees who perform union business on company time.the matter was subsequently settled between the parties without any official action by the nlrb.
approximately three weeks later october,thomas ciepichal,the of operations,and david orewiler,its human resource director,met with cox and other union representatives,including raymond mann,the union bargaining committee chairperson,to discuss the recall status of fourteen employees who had been laid off or transferred in may.however,during these discussions with management at this meeting,mann and cox openly expressed their differences of opinion over the recall rights provision in the collective bargaining agreement.it was mann view that this recall provision should be interpreted so as to give priority to those employees who had been laid off in may over their fellow workers who had been transferred to the.on the other hand,cox took the position that the collective bargaining agreement required the company to give priority of recall to the fourteen employees on the basis of their rights of seniority.cox,with recognition that he and mann had a genuine disagreement over the interpretation of the recall provision in the collective bargaining agreement,advised orewiler,among other things,that it was imperative that the international union be given a reasonable amount of time in which to evaluate this issue.the company agreed.however,two days later october,and without waiting for a response from the international union,the announced that it would recall the laid off workers and,in turn,would not give recognition to the seniority rights of those employees who had been subject to its transfer directive in may.
believing that the company had broken its verbal commitment to wait for a reasonable period of time in which to receive an interpretation of the challenged provision from the international union and violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,cox and mann discussed the merit of filing a grievance against the.on october,the last day on which a timely grievance could be filed under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,mann authorized cox to file a grievance.armed with this authorization,cox,with the drafting assistance of a union steward,denny brock,prepared a grievance form that would challenge the company decision to disregard the existing seniority rights of those employees who had been laid off in may.
after brock had finished writing the text of the grievance,cox completed the balance of the form by identifying local as the grievant and listing other requisite information as a supplement to text,cox affixed the names and the signatures of two of the involuntarily transferred employees larry grace and kenny miller above the line marked aggrieved employee without seeking or acquiring their permission.he also signed his name over the line marked union official.edwin chaney,a union committeeman,acting upon cox request,signed the grievance as the second union official 
after completing the grievance form,cox gave it to his supervisor,who,in turn,placed it on the desk of her supervisor,ronnie tolliver.when tolliver arrived at work on the following morning october,he was surprised to see the signatures of grace and miller on the grievance form because it was basic shop knowledge that both of these workers were quite content at the.tolliver took the grievance form to orewiler who,in turn,contacted mary hedge,the human resource director.she,along with mann,talked to grace and miller,both of whom denied having given cox any authority to place their names on the grievance form.thereafter,mann recommended to cox that the names of these two workers be removed and replaced with local as the aggrieved employee.cox complied with his suggestion.
at a later time on the same day,cox asked orewiler assistant,melissa wolff,to accept this modified version of the grievance form as a replacement of the original document.she declined to do so and referred him to orewiler,to whom he sought to explain the situation cox,who had never denied having signed the names of grace and miller to the grievance form,was suspended pending an investigation by the company.on the same day,a member of the staff spoke with chaney,who denied having affixed the names of grace and miller to the grievance form.in a letter on november,the officially terminated cox,citing his alleged violation of the company code of conduct and plant rules relating to the falsification of records 
cox challenged his discharge,and,during the third step grievance meeting in orewiler commented that we need to settle this thing.but you have already made ropp mad with the little thing at the labor board.at.
during a meeting in the early part of january between management and the union about a matter that is unrelated to this controversy ciepichal proclaimed the union had already made ropp mad with its charges at the labor board.id.he also warned the union that if it did find some way of working together with the company there could be a possibility that more work would be moved out,and maybe the whole plant.id.
shortly thereafter,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company,alleging that the termination of cox was an act of retaliation for his filings of the september,unfair labor practice charge and the grievance form.the union also charged the with having threatened employees that if they continued filing charges with the nlrb,the company would not bring work back into the plant.at.administrative law judge john clark agreed with the union.the appealed.on december,the nlrb adopted his ruling,findings and conclusions of law on all grounds,finding that the had violated sections a,and of the nlra.an appeal by the company to this court followed.
in essence,the asserts that the findings of fact by the nlrb are not supported by substantial evidence,and the nlrb application of roadmaster nlrb,nlrb,enfd,cir,to this case is misplaced.we address each of these arguments in turn.
a.the board findings 
standard of review 
in its position as the petitioner in this litigation,the carries the burden of persuading this court that the findings of fact by the nlrb are not supported by substantial evidence.e the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.in interpreting this phrase,the supreme court has held that substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.universal camera nlrb.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
this court has given,and will continue to give,significant deference and weight to the findings of fact by the board and its application of the law to the facts.nlrb ohio masonic home,cir.moreover,we are not free to substitute our judgment for that of the board simply because we would have made a different decision had we heard the case de novo nlrb pipefitters union local,cir.other circuits have held that the board determination that an employee conduct remains protected under the act would be upheld so long as it is not illogical or arbitrary.see,roadmaster,at.nevertheless,as the supreme court declared in universal camera,t he board findings are entitled to respect but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a court of appeals clearly precludes the board decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.at.
therefore,we must decide whether there is substantial evidence to support the board findings that the conduct of cox under these circumstances is a protected activity under section of the act the terminated him on the basis of an improper motivation,animus and the union was threatened by the company during the january,meeting.
cox conduct is protected activity under section of the act 
section of the act provides a guarantee to employees that they have a right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.this act protects these rights by prohibiting employers from engaging in unfair labor practices.moreover,the act defines unfair labor practices,in relevant part,as discrimination in regard to any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization,id.a,and as a discharge or otherwise discriminat ion against an employee because he has filed charges,id.a.more generally,an unfair labor practice is any activity that interfere s with,restrain s,or coerce s employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section id.a.
filing a grievance is a protected activity under section of the act.see nlrb city disposal systems,d.naturally,this protection extends to a union steward or official who aids another employee in filing a grievance.roadmaster,at.however,i f an employee engages in indefensible or abusive conduct,his otherwise concerted activity will lose its protection under the act.id.therefore,as in roadmaster,the issue here is whether cox filing of grievance became unprotected concerted activity because he signed the names of other individuals on it.id.emphasis in original.
as noted in roadmaster,t he motive of an employee is relevant in determining whether he engaged in protected concerted activity.id.at.the facts surrounding roadmaster are nearly identical to the facts in the appeal before this court.the roadmaster court held that the union steward conduct did not constitute forgery and,therefore,was a protected concerted activity under the act because he acted in good faith and for legitimate reasons and did not have an intent to deceive his employer.
here,judge clark found,and the board affirmed,that cox was acting in good faith and for a legitimate reason,which was to preserve the union right to pursue what he believed was the correct interpretation of the recall provision in the agreement.at.cox good faith conduct was demonstrated by the absence of evidence that he would have profit ed or gain ed anything from deceiving the.id.furthermore,the administrative law judge determined,and the board also affirmed,that cox had no intent to deceive his employer.judge clark reasoned that 
no union official,especially not one as experienced as cox,could possibly think that such a blatant deception could achieve any objective.under the very best scenario the ruse would be discovered when the employees were told to return to their former positions,and the chance of the deception progressing that far is slight,if at all.management knew that the employees did not want to return to,and cox made it clear to orewiler that he would file a grievance if the recall was not corrected or if the union was not allowed time to obtain input from the international.if his intent was to deceive,it is doubtful that he would give advanced notice of the deception,nor is there evidence that anyone was either deceived or harmed by his action.
in nlrb aquatech,we held that the function of the board is to resolve questions of fact and credibility,and this court ordinarily will not disturb credibility evaluations of the board or an administrative law judge who has observed the witnesses demeanor,cir.therefore,in light of judge clark rationale as well as the limited standard of review of this court,we conclude that the findings of the board are supported by substantial evidence on the record as whole.
notwithstanding,the urges this court to find that the conduct of cox is not protected by the rationale of roadmaster because of his intent to deceive the company.foremost,the points out that 
cox did not attempt to consult with grace and miller,nor did he seek to obtain permission to sign their names,despite having sufficient time to do so the clear implication is that cox actively concealed his intentions from grace and miller because he,as did everyone else,knew that they were happy at opw es,and would never sign or consent to the grievance 
pet t br.at.however,three observations run counter to the argument.first and foremost,the company and the union knew that grace and miller were content with their work environment at the.thus,given the well known satisfaction of these two workers,it is doubtful that cox possessed a belief that he could deceive anyone at the into believing otherwise by signing their names on the grievance form.furthermore,there is no evidence that the signatures of these two employees were necessary in order for the union to challenge the company recall decision.hence,it seems unlikely that cox would have risked his credibility as a union official and a employee to deceive the company without any personal gain to him or the union.finally,notwithstanding the contention,cox did not have a sufficient amount of time in which to approach grace and miller for their signatures.under the circumstances of this case and according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,the union had a limited amount of time in which to file a grievance claim.while cox waited for a response from the international union,he was not given permission to file a grievance until the of october when mann gave him authority to do so.
next,the argues that cox intent to deceive is demonstrated by the fact that he signed the names of grace and miller in different styles and with different pens in an effort to induce the eventual reader of the grievance that it was genuinely prepared by each of them.pet t br.at.although the board did not specifically address this issue,the company argument must be rejected for same reasons that have been noted above namely,the facts in this case strongly suggest that it is extremely doubtful that cox intended to deceive the management.furthermore,even if we were of the opinion that these facts demonstrate cox intent to deceive,the view of this court would not warrant the disturbance of the nlrb otherwise.see universal camera,at.
nonetheless,the contends that the behavior of cox after his initial filing of the grievance form clearly demonstrates an intent by him to deceive.the company points to cox contact with orewiler assistant which,in its opinion,represents a blatant attempt to process the modified grievance and reacquire the forged one.pet t br.at.the board did not consider this fact to be significant enough to address it.as a postscript,the court n
