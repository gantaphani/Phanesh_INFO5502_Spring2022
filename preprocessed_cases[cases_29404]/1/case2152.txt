fourteen unrelated illinois businesses and fifteen aliens sued the employment and training administration of the department of labor dol and the bureau of citizenship and immigration services of the department of homeland security dhs,challenging a regulation promulgated by dol that effectively invalidated labor certifications that had been issued to the plaintiffs.following for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of dol and dhs.the plaintiffs appeal.we affirm.
under b a i and iii of the immigration and nationality act,congress has made available a number of visas for aliens who qualify as skilled or unskilled workers.b a i,iii.an employer seeking to hire such a worker may file a visa petition called a form petition for immigrant worker,a with dhs on the alien behalf.id.a f before a visa may be issued,however,the secretary of labor must have issued a labor certification in conformity with a a i.id.b c.that section provides as follows 
any alien who seeks to enter the united states for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor is inadmissible,unless the secretary of labor has determined and certified to the secretary of state and the attorney general that i there are not sufficient workers who are able,willing,qualified or equally qualified in the case of an alien described in clause ii and available at the time of application for a visa and admission to the united states and at the place where the alien is to perform such skilled or unskilled labor,and ii the employment of such alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the united states similarly employed.
id.a a i i ii.
based on that statute,dol has promulgated regulations pertaining to the labor certification process.previously,with one exception not relevant here,provided that approved labor certifications were valid indefinitely.id.a.following notice and comment rulemaking procedures however,was amended on may,with an effective date of july,to provide 
for certifications resulting from applications filed under this part and cfr part in effect prior to march,the following applies an approved permanent labor certification granted on or after july,expires if not filed in support of a form petition with the department of homeland security within calendar days of the date the department of labor granted the certification.an approved permanent labor certification granted before july,expires if not filed in support of a form petition with the department of homeland security within calendar days of july.
b.according to dol,one reason for the new regulation was to curb the growing black market in labor certifications,wherein indefinitely valid labor certifications were traded and sold to the highest bidder.another reason for creating a finite validity period for labor certifications was to more closely adhere to the command of a a i i that dol gauge the sufficiency of the supply of able,willing,qualified,and available workers at the time of the visa application.dol further explained that l abor market conditions are subject to rapid change,and it is consistent with dol mandate under a a i i to require a retest of the market after the passage of days.id.moreover,dol concluded that t he imposition of a validity period is a logical mechanism by which the department can ensure that the information upon which a determination was based remains legitimate.
between march and may,fourteen unaffiliated illinois businesses filed applications for labor certifications on behalf of fifteen potential alien employees.thirteen of the fifteen applications were approved before the amended b took effect on july,the other two applications were approved after that date after eight of the alien workers visa petitions were rejected by dhs because of expired labor certifications,the fourteen businesses and fifteen aliens filed suit against dol and dhs in the northern district of illinois.in their complaint,the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that dol promulgation of the amended b was beyond its authority or,alternatively,that retroactive application of the amended regulation is unlawful.the eight plaintiffs who had their visa petitions denied also sought a writ of mandamus against dhs to compel the agency to process their visa petitions.
following for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and denied the same for the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs appeal.
we review de novo the district court disposition of for summary judgment,while construing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.rickher home depot,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the plaintiffs first assert that dol amendment of to limit the validity of labor certifications was beyond the scope of its statutory authority dol responds that it was acting within its authority when it amended.the supreme court instructs that a lthough agency determinations within the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference,it is fundamental that an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.adams fruit,barrett,d quoting fed.comm seatrain lines,d.accordingly,this circuit reviews de novo an agency determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction.illinois steel supply sec y of labor,cir.we examine the text and purpose of a statute to determine whether a regulation falls within the scope of the authority the statute delegates.see am.hosp.ass schweiker.
under a a i,the secretary of labor must make two substantive determinations before issuing a labor certification there is an insufficient number of able,willing,qualified,and available workers hereinafter sufficient workers determination and employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly situated workers.of key importance here,when making the sufficient workers determination,the secretary must certify that the supply of such workers is insufficient at a specific point in time at the time of application for a visa and admission to the united states.a a i i.by declaring approved labor certifications indefinitely valid without any linkage to the filing of a visa petition,the earlier version of a did not apply the statutory provision that the sufficient workers determination be made at the time of application for a visa.section was amended so that a labor certification expires if not filed in support of a visa application within days of the certification approval.thus,dol implemented a a i i by imposing a time limit between the certification and the visa application.put another way,dol imposition of that time limitation on the validity of a labor certification ensures that the sufficient workers determination reflects the state of the labor market at the time the anticipated employee application for a visa and admission is made.assuming that dol possessed statutory authority to promulgate regulations pertaining to labor certifications,then the amended b is within the scope of dol authority because it complies with the explicit language from a a i i.
in addition,the amendment is consistent with one of the overarching purposes behind labor certifications protection of the domestic labor force from job competition.prod.tool,at.section b limits the validity of approved labor certifications if,within days of issuance,an approved certification is not filed in support of a petition for a visa and admission,it becomes void.thus,the amended b ensures that the snapshots of the labor market taken when labor certifications are approved are not stale appraisals of the labor market when the visa petitions are filed.this protects americans who are currently able,willing,qualified,and available to fill certain skilled and unskilled positions from having to compete with aliens who were issued labor certifications and are now applying for visas at a time when the domestic work force was insufficient to fill such positions.
