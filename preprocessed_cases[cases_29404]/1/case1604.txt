plaintiffs,a class of individuals who received rental assistance payments from the federal government after hurricanes katrina and rita,brought suit alleging various constitutional and statutory deficiencies in the process by which the rental assistance program is administered.in this interlocutory appeal,the federal emergency management agency challenges the district court entry of a preliminary injunction requiring the agency to make payments to class members until certain notice,hearing,and appeal procedures have been provided.for the following reasons,we vacate the challenged provisions of the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings.
in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita,the federal emergency management agency fema has provided awards of rental assistance to individuals displaced from their homes on account of either storm.these awards consist of payments that recipients are to use to rent alternate housing.fema practice has been to award rental assistance in a single payment designed to cover rent for three months.if a recipient is in need of assistance beyond this three month period,he may apply for additional awards,known as continued rent assistance,which are also made in three month allotments.this appeal concerns alleged due process violations in the process by which fema makes eligibility determinations for these additional awards.
fema provision of rental assistance is governed by the stafford act,et,and its implementing regulations.under section of the stafford act,an individual is eligible for rental assistance if he has been displaced from his home or his home has been rendered uninhabitable as a result of a major disaster.see b.fema implementing regulations establish additional eligibility criteria for individuals seeking an award of rental assistance or continued rent assistance.see 
when an individual first applies for assistance from fema after a disaster,the agency typically conducts an inspection of the applicant residence.in the aftermath of katrina and rita,though,fema waived this home inspection requirement for applicants with residences in the most severely damaged areas,and simply provided each eligible applicant from those areas with a rental assistance award of.in other areas that were accessible for inspection,eligible applicants received awards in amounts based on a fair market rent valuation.recipients were informed that the awards were intended to cover rent for three months,but that they could apply for additional awards in the future if necessary.
owing to the massive devastation caused by katrina and rita,many recipients of rental assistance could not return to their residences or otherwise find permanent housing within the three months covered by their initial awards,and indeed some remain unable to do so.accordingly,these individuals have found it necessary to apply for multiple awards of continued rent assistance.each time they seek an additional award,they must comply with certain requirements.pursuant to fema regulations,they must establish a realistic housing plan and submit documentation showing their efforts to obtain permanent housing,provide past rent receipts to show that they have exhausted funds previously received from fema,and submit documentation showing a continuing need for assistance.see id.fema refers to this as the recertification process.
in its actual practices,fema has at times simplified or relaxed the recertification requirements for victims of katrina and rita.during the first round of recertifications in late november,for example,fema required only a signed document stating that the applicant had used up his initial award and was in need of continued assistance.at other times,fema has required fuller documentation,including rent receipts.and on one occasion,fema waived the recertification requirements entirely and provided an award of continued rent assistance to every individual who had been deemed eligible during the previous recertification 
the four named plaintiffs received awards of rental assistance from fema after they were displaced from their homes by katrina,but were later found ineligible for continued rent assistance.on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals they filed this suit in the eastern district of louisiana,alleging that fema administers the rental assistance program in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner in violation of the due process clause,the administrative procedure act,and the stafford act.their complaint specifically charged that fema denies applications for continued rent assistance by issuing notices containing only confusing codes,instead of understandable explanations operates an unresponsive system that precludes effective challenges to fema decisionmaking before the loss of assistance and fails to publish eligibility standards.plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction.
before fema could answer the complaint,plaintiffs moved for class certification and for a preliminary injunction.the district court entertained oral argument on these motions,but did not conduct an evidentiary hearing.plaintiffs submitted a variety of materials to the court in support of their motions,including declarations from the named plaintiffs and other individuals describing their experiences with fema,as well as records of correspondence with fema.fema submitted a declaration explaining its administration of the rental assistance program.additionally,as part of its motion to alter or stay the preliminary injunction,fema submitted a second declaration and a number of sample letters,notices,and other documents relating to the rental assistance program.on the whole,it is not an exaggeration to say that the materials submitted by the parties,together with the pleadings,paint two very different pictures of fema administration of the rental assistance program.
on july,the district court granted class certification and issued a preliminary injunction as requested.the provisions of the preliminary injunction relevant to this appeal enjoin fema from 
terminating or discontinuing section assistance to any section class member without providing advance written notice of the reason s for the termination or discontinuance 
terminating or discontinuing section assistance prior to issuance of a written decision on the class member appeal 
failing to provide written notice to any section class member with an appeal pending that they may have their assistance reinstated upon request,until fema has provided them with adequate written notice of the reason s for termination,an opportunity for a hearing,and a decision on their appeal 
failing to reinstate section assistance to any section class member whose appeal is currently pending and who requests reinstatement,until such time as fema has provided adequate written notice of the reason s for termination,an opportunity for a hearing,and a written decision on their appeal 
in granting the preliminary injunction,the court found that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits of their due process claims the court rejected fema argument that plaintiffs lacked the property interest necessary to support a due process claim,and credited plaintiffs contention that fema existing procedures are inadequate.we reproduce here,in its entirety,the district court analysis on the question of whether plaintiffs could show a property interest.
fema also argue s that the plaintiffs have failed to state a due process claim because they do not possess a protectable property interest in continuing section benefits because,in the end,fema retains absolute discretion as to the initial receipt and termination of section benefits.citation to record omitted the plaintiffs have all been deemed eligible to receive section benefits.the court finds that the fact that the eligibility must be continuing does not deprive the plaintiffs of the property right incurred with their legitimate claim of entitlement to it.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.the court sees no relevant difference between the plaintiffs property rights to section benefits and those rights belonging to the plaintiffs in mathews eldridge,d social security disability benefits,goldberg kelly,d welfare,thompson washington,public housing and caulder durham housing authority,cir public housing.
because the question of whether plaintiffs can show a property interest turns in large part on the statutory and regulatory framework governing fema rental assistance program,we set out here the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions.section of the stafford act directly authorizes fema to provide rental assistance after a disaster.in pertinent part,it reads as follows 
the president may provide financial or other assistance under this section to individuals and households to respond to the housing needs of individuals and households who are displaced from their predisaster primary residences or whose predisaster primary residences are rendered uninhabitable as a result of damage caused by a major disaster.
the president shall determine appropriate types of housing assistance to be provided under this section based on considerations of cost effectiveness,convenience to the individuals and households,and such other factors as the president may consider appropriate.
the president may provide financial assistance to individuals or households to rent alternate housing accommodations,existing rental units,manufactured housing,recreational vehicles,or other readily fabricated dwellings.
no individual or household shall receive financial assistance greater than under this section with respect to a single major disaster.
internal subdivisions omitted.fema implementing regulations establish additional eligibility factors for the receipt of rental assistance,and contain a variety of provisions designed to ensure that fema does not provide assistance to individuals who can meet their needs through other means 
a conditions of eligibility.in general,fema may provide assistance to individuals and households who qualify for such assistance under section of the stafford act and this subpart.fema may only provide assistance 
when the individual or household has incurred a necessary expense or serious need in the state in which the disaster has been declared,without regard to their residency in that state 
in a situation where the applicant has insurance,when the individual or household files a claim with their insurance provider for all potentially applicable types of insurance coverage and the claim is denied 
when the applicant agrees to refund to fema or the state any portion of the assistance that the applicant receives or is eligible to receive as assistance from another source 
with respect to housing assistance,if the primary residence has been destroyed,is uninhabitable,or is inaccessible and 
with respect to housing assistance,if a renter primary residence is no longer available as a result of the disaster.
b conditions of ineligibility.we may not provide assistance under this subpart 
for housing assistance,to individuals or households who are displaced from other than their primary residence 
for housing assistance,to individuals or households who have adequate housing accommodations 
for housing assistance,to individuals or households who own a secondary or vacation residence within reasonable commuting distance to the disaster area,or who own available rental property that meets their temporary housing needs 
for housing assistance,to individuals or households who evacuated the residence in response to official warnings solely as a precautionary measure and who are able to return to the residence immediately after the incident 
to individuals or households who have adequate insurance coverage and where there is no indication that insurance proceeds will be significantly delayed,or who have refused assistance from insurance providers.
a separate regulation explains that recipients of one award of assistance may apply for additional awards,and creates criteria for the provision of continued rent assistance 
a fema expects all recipients of assistance under this subpart to obtain and occupy permanent housing at the earliest possible time.fema may provide continued housing assistance during the period of assistance,but not to exceed the maximum amount of assistance for the program,based on need,and generally only when adequate,alternate housing is not available or when the permanent housing plan has not been fulfilled through no fault of the applicant.
b additional criteria for continued assistance.
all applicants requesting continued rent assistance must establish a realistic permanent housing plan no later than the first certification for continued assistance.applicants will be required to provide documentation showing that they are making efforts to obtain permanent housing.
applicants requesting continued rent assistance must submit rent receipts to show that they have exhausted the fema rent funds,and provide documentation identifying the continuing need.
fema generally expects that renters will use their initial rental assistance to obtain permanent housing.however,we may certify them,during the period of assistance,for continued rent assistance when adequate,alternate housing is not available,or when they have not realized a permanent housing plan through no fault of their own.
fema may certify owners for continued rent assistance,during the period of assistance,when adequate,alternate housing is not available,or when they have not realized a permanent housing plan through no fault of their own.
id.finally,there is a limit on the time period for which fema may provide assistance 
period of assistance.fema may provide assistance under this subpart for a period not to exceed months from the date of declaration that a disaster has occurred.the associate director ad may extend this period if determines that due to extraordinary circumstances an extension would be in the public interest.

fema argues that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and thus have not satisfied the first element for a preliminary injunction.because the district court granted the injunction on the basis of its determination that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits of their due process claims,and did not consider plaintiffs other claims,only principles of due process are at issue here.
plaintiffs have alleged that fema administration of the rental assistance program violates the requirements of the fifth amendment due process clause.to prevail on a due process claim,plaintiffs must show that they possess a property interest that is protected by the due process clause,and fema procedures are constitutionally inadequate.see logan zimmerman brush,d.although this case has not yet progressed to trial,in their initial pleadings and declarations the plaintiffs have described an overly bureaucratic and frustratingly unresponsive agency that misapplies its own rules and standards,uses incomprehensible codes to inform applicants of its decisions on their requests for assistance,and fails to offer any meaningful review of those decisions on administrative appeal.to support a preliminary injunction,however,they must establish a likelihood of success on the merits.fema argues that plaintiffs have not met this requirement because they have not shown that they can establish a property interest in rental assistance benefits.
we agree that at this time plaintiffs have not made this required showing.standing alone,the statute and regulations governing the rental assistance program are not sufficient to create a property interest.the possibility remains that plaintiffs can establish a property interest based on fema policies and practices in implementing the statute and regulations to provide rental assistance.however,facts regarding these matters have not been sufficiently developed to allow us to decide this point.therefore,we must vacate the challenged portions of the injunction and return this case to the district court for further development.
property interest 
it has long been recognized that benefits distributed by the government are a form of property protected by the due process clause.see goldberg,at.however,not all government benefits programs create constitutionally recognized property interests.a property interest only arises when an entitlement to benefits exists.roth,at.as the supreme court has explained,to have a property interest in a government benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.
property interests are not created by the constitution itself.rather,they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source and that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.id.the mere existence of a governmental program or authority empowered to grant a particular type of benefit to one such as the plaintiff does not give the plaintiff a property right,protected by the due process clause,to receive the benefit,absent some legitimate claim of from statute,regulation,contract,or the the benefit.blackburn city of marshall,cir emphasis in original.
plaintiffs claim a property interest in continued rent assistance based on section of the stafford act and its implementing regulations.to determine whether statutes or regulations create a protected property interest,we must ask whether they place substantive limitations on official discretion.olim wakinekona,d.absent such limitations on fema discretion,section and the regulations can not create a property interest,as a benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.town of castle rock gonzales,d citing.dep t of corrections thompson,d.
according to plaintiffs,section and the regulations create an entitlement because they set out criteria that make an award of benefits mandatory and not discretionary for all eligible applicants.in determining whether statutes and regulations limit official discretion,the supreme court has explained that we are to look for explicitly mandatory language,specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations substantive predicates are present,a particular outcome must follow.thompson,at.unfortunately for plaintiffs,such mandatory language is wholly absent from section and the regulations.
as fema points out,section does not require that payments of rental assistance be offered after a disaster or that payments be made in any specific amounts when assistance is offered.instead,it contains only a permissive grant of authority to fema through the president to provide rental assistance.see c a i the president may provide financial assistance to individuals or households to rent alternate housing accommodations emphasis added.under the language of section,an individual has no right to receive rental assistance,even if assistance is being offered and he meets the eligibility criteria.
similarly,fema implementing regulations are written in entirely permissive terms.the regulations state only that fema may provide assistance to individuals and households who qualify for such assistance,and that fema may provide continued housing assistance.a a emphases added.like section itself,the regulations nowhere provide that an individual has a right to receive assistance if he meets the eligibility criteria.there is simply no indication that the regulations constrain fema discretion to the point that it is bound to provide assistance to all eligible individuals.
thus,although section and the regulations set out eligibility criteria for the receipt of continued rent assistance,they contain no explicitly mandatory language that entitles an individual to receive benefits if he satisfies that criteria.because no specific directives limit fema discretion by compelling it to provide assistance upon a showing of eligibility,these provisions do not give rise to a property interest.
still,plaintiffs assert a property interest based on the fact that they have previously received awards of rental assistance from fema.citing goldberg kelly and mathews eldridge,plaintiffs argue that once an individual eligibility has been established under a benefits program threshold criteria,that individual acquires a property interest in continued payment of benefits.
in goldberg,the plaintiffs were welfare recipients who received weekly or monthly payments.at.when these individuals brought suit alleging that termination of their benefits without prior notice and a hearing constituted a violation of due process,the supreme court found a statutorily created property interest in the continued receipt of those benefits.id.at.likewise,in mathews,the court held that recipients of monthly social security disability payments possessed a property interest in continued receipt of their benefits.at.in both cases,then,individuals had entitlements in recurring payments made at regular intervals,such that the stream of payments could not be terminated without due process.according to plaintiffs,the key factor in goldberg and mathews was that a legitimate expectation in receiving benefits and,thus,in receiving continuing benefits had been established by meeting the threshold criteria for the benefits receipt.plaintiffs argue that because they were all deemed eligible to receive rental assistance at one they liken to the goldberg and mathews plaintiffs meeting the threshold criteria for their respective similarly have a legitimate expectation of receiving continued rent assistance.
the district court was apparently sympathetic to this argument.in the proceedings below,fema argued that plaintiffs claim to a property interest failed because it retained discretion in distributing rental assistance.in response,the district court stated that t he plaintiffs have all been deemed eligible to receive section benefits,and that it saw no relevant difference between the plaintiffs property rights to section benefits and those rights belonging to the plaintiffs in goldberg and mathews as we explain,though,there are relevant differences between the claims to benefits held by the individuals in those cases and plaintiffs in the instant case.ultimately,plaintiffs prior receipt of rental assistance can only give rise to a property interest in continuing benefits if the rental assistance program is one in which,upon an initial showing of eligibility,recipients become entitled to a stream of payments.
neither goldberg nor mathews explains in much detail why the plaintiffs in those cases possessed property interests in the continued receipt of benefits in goldberg,however,the court stated that the welfare benefits were a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them,at,and the court subsequently made clear in roth that property interests arise from independent sources of law,such as statutes or regulations,that support a legitimate claim of entitlement to benefits,at.in other words,the welfare and disability recipients in goldberg and mathews,respectively,only had a property interest in continuing benefits because independent sources governing the programs entitled them to recurring payments upon an initial showing of eligibility thus,while we agree that some benefits programs may give rise to a property interest in a stream of benefits,plaintiffs still must demonstrate that the rental assistance program at issue in this case is in fact such a program.to do so,they must identify some source that entitles them to receive recurring rental assistance payments upon an initial showing of eligibility.
we think it clear that the language of section and the regulations provides no such entitlement.as discussed above,section and the regulations do not mandate the payment of a single award of continued rent assistance to eligible individuals,much less a continuing stream of payments.that plaintiffs have previously been found eligible for awards of rental assistance or continued rent assistance is of no matter.by definition,every applicant for continued rent assistance will be an individual who has previously been found eligible for a rental assistance award.the fact remains that nothing in the regulations compels fema to provide benefits on a continuing basis,as is required to create such an entitlement 
this conclusion is buttressed by a comparison to the social security disability statute,which does create an entitlement to continuing benefits.that statute explicitly states that 
e very individual who is under a disability shall be entitled to a disability insurance benefit for each month beginning with the first month in which he becomes so entitled to such insurance benefits and ending with the month in which he dies,the month in which he attains retirement age at which point the benefits are converted to retirement benefits,or the termination month.
a.the statute then provides that benefits may only be terminated upon a showing that the disability has ceased or that the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity,in a process in which the agency bears the burden of supplying substantial evidence that a reason for termination exists.id.f see waters barnhart,cir.
the mandatory language found in the social security disability statute makes it clear that an individual who satisfies the eligibility criteria has a legitimate expectation of receiving continuing benefits.by the terms of the statute,an eligible individual shall be entitled to receive monthly payments until he dies,his benefits are converted to retirement benefits,or the agency proves that he no longer meets the eligibility requirements.it is equally clear,in contrast,that the rental assistance program established by section and the regulations creates no such entitlement to continuing benefits upon an initial showing of eligibility.fema rental assistance program simply does not work in the same way that the disability program does.upon demonstrating eligibility for rental assistance,an individual can point to nothing in section or the regulations that entitles him to receive recurring payments until he is proved to no longer be eligible rather,if he hopes to receive even a single additional award,the burden is on him to apply for recertification and meet the regulatory requirements.in this context,it is unsurprising that no termination provision analogous to the one in the disability statute can be found in section or the regulations,as such a provision would only be necessary if there were a stream of benefits to terminate.
plaintiffs nonetheless argue that a separate section of the stafford act,which sets forth congressional findings and declarations,shows that fema will provide continued rent assistance to individuals for as long as they remain eligible.this section states that 
i t is the intent of the congress,by this chapter,to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the federal government to state and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such disasters by providing federal assistance programs for both public and private losses sustained in disasters.
b emphasis added.plaintiffs argue that fema must carry out this intent by providing assistance on a continuing basis for as long as needs exist.but this argument reads too much into what is essentially a hortatory statement of purpose for the entire stafford act.section contains no mandatory language compelling fema to provide continuing payments of rental assistance to all eligible applicants on an ongoing basis.it simply registers a general intent on the part of congress.without more,this provision can not support a statutory entitlement to a stream of continued rent assistance payments when the specific statute and regulations that implement the rental assistance program contain no such directive and leave the questions of what type of assistance to provide and how and when to provide it to fema discretion 
thus far,we have determined that the language of the relevant statutes and regulations,standing alone,does not support plaintiffs claim to a property interest.however,we can not yet conclude that a property interest is entirely foreclosed,for it is also possible for a legitimate claim of entitlement to arise from rules or understandings created by an agency policies or practices,even in the absence of explicitly mandatory statutory or regulatory language.see perry sinderman,d.it may be the case that fema policies in administering the rental assistance program require it to make awards of continued rent assistance to all eligible applicants if so,the agency may have sufficiently narrowed its discretion in the distribution of benefits to create a legitimate claim of entitlement in applicants.see washington legal clinic for the homeless barry,i n certain circumstances property rights may arise from administrative rules or understandings.mahone addicks util.dist.of harris county,cir suggesting that a property interest may be created in the absence of mandatory statutory language when an agency narrows its discretion by custom or implementation of regulations.
plaintiffs also argue that fema practices in administering the rental assistance program reinforce the continuing nature of section assistance,and therefore support a property interest in continued receipt of benefits.they contend,for example,that by providing notice of changes in the recertification criteria because it wished to protect recipients against gaps in assistance,fema created the basis for a reasonable expectation of continued assistance.however,some of the notices and letters from fema that are contained in the record feature disclaimers and warnings that would seem to dispel any notion that individuals are entitled to additional awards of continued assistance solely on account of having previously been found eligible for an award.one letter states that a dditional assistance may be awarded in month increments,but cautions applicants that they must provide additional documentation and rent receipts.another warns in bold that you will not be eligible for continued housing assistance beyond may,if you do not supply all of the above listed items.
in the end,we are somewhat limited in our review by the fact that the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing or otherwise make any findings on these matters before granting the preliminary injunction.the record does contain various declarations from the named plaintiffs and other individuals who have been involved with the rental assistance program,as well as correspondence and other documents relating to fema administration of the program.however,in many respects these sources provide conflicting accounts of how the rental assistance program is administered.whether fema,by its policies and practices,has created a property interest in continued rent assistance is a question,and,given the limited factual development below,one we can not answer.this court is simply not in a position to decide such matters for the first time on appeal.as things currently stand,then,plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of successfully showing the property interest needed to support their due process claim,and we must conclude that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.
adequate process 
although our conclusion above controls the outcome of this appeal,we write here to briefly call attention to some arguments and observation
