the appellant,petra salinas carranza,petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia holding that she is ineligible to apply for relief from deportation based on former c of the immigration and nationality act.carranza claims that she deferred her application for c relief in order to establish a stronger record of rehabilitation,in reliance on the continued availability of c relief.because the bia erred in finding her ineligible to apply for c relief without allowing her the opportunity to demonstrate that her actual,subjective reliance on the prior state of the law caused her to delay her application,we grant the petition for review,vacate the bia order,and remand.
carranza is a native and citizen of mexico.she became a lawful permanent resident of the united states on august.on august,after a trial by jury,carranza was convicted in louisiana state court of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute.she claims she did not immediately apply for c discretionary relief after her conviction because she intended to apply during her deportation proceedings,at which time she would be able to show a more extensive record of rehabilitation and community ties.in,congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,which repealed c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c.
in,a notice to appear was issued,charging carranza with removability on the basis of her conviction for the drug offense.the ins further charged carranza as removable for having been convicted of a substance abuse offense.during a hearing on january,an immigration judge ij found that carranza conviction remained in effect for immigration purposes and sustained both charges of removal.at that hearing,carranza sought a waiver of deportation under former c of the ina.the ins conceded her eligibility for c relief and a date was set for the merits hearing.
on april,the date of the merits hearing,the ins challenged carranza eligibility for c relief because she had declined a plea agreement and had elected to be tried by a jury.carranza attorney asked for a continuance to prepare to respond on that issue.the ij denied the request and,apparently without hearing arguments on carranza eligibility,ordered her removed carranza appealed to the bia.on march,the bia issued an order remanding to the ij for the sole purpose of preparing a written decision.
on january,in compliance with this directive,the ij issued a written order formalizing the earlier findings on august,the bia dismissed carranza appeal,holding that the third circuit case,ponnapula ashcroft,cir,that she cited in support of her argument for eligibility was not applicable to cases arising within the fifth circuit jurisdiction and that carranza had cited no binding precedent supporting a motion to remand.the bia further noted that recently enacted regulations limit c relief to aliens who were convicted by plea agreement.carranza timely petitioned for review.
on appeal,carranza again argues that she should be eligible to apply for c relief,despite the enactment of the and effective death penalty act aedpa and iirira.we have jurisdiction to review this matter under of the ina,as amended by the real id act of.under the amended act,this court may review constitutional questions and questions of law.
this court reviews the bia conclusions of law de novo,although it defers to the bia reasonable interpretation of immigration regulations.see ashcroft,cir.no deference is owed to the bia conclusions of law regarding the retroactive availability of c relief.moore,cir.
under c of the ina,the attorney general had broad discretion to admit excludable aliens.ins cyr,d.as deportable offenses have historically been defined broadly,the class of aliens whose continued residence in this country has depended on their eligibility for c relief is extremely large,and a substantial percentage of their applications for c relief have been granted.id.at.between and,congress enacted three statutes,reduc ing the size of the class of aliens eligible for such discretionary relief.id.at.in,congress eliminated the possibility of c relief for anyone convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.id.on april,congress adopted d of aedpa,which identified a broad set of offenses for which convictions would preclude such relief.id.later that same year,congress passed iirira,which inter alia,repealed c and replaced it with a new section that gives the attorney general the authority to cancel removal for a narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens id.at.this class does not include anyone previously convicted of an aggravated felony.id.in short,after aedpa and iirira,carranza,who had been eligible for such relief,was now excluded from the class.
in,however,the supreme court decided ins cyr,in which it considered whether an alien who pled guilty to an aggravated felony prior to the repeal of c was still eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation notwithstanding the change in the applicable law.applying the test laid out in landgraf usi film products,d,the court first determined that congress had not clearly expressed the intent to have iirira b apply retroactively.the court then considered the second step of landgraf retroactivity analysis to determine whether depriving removable aliens of consideration for c relief produces an impermissible retroactive effect for aliens who were convicted pursuant to a plea agreement at a time when their plea would not have rendered them ineligible for c relief.cyr,at.
applying a commonsense,functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment,id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,the court found that the elimination of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court reasoned that as plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government,to deprive the defendant of their continued eligibility for c relief after the government had received the benefit of the plea bargain,would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.at.quoting landgraf,at.finding that aliens likely relied upon the significant likelihood of receiving c relief in choosing to forgo their right to trial,the court concluded that eliminating such relief has an obvious and severe retroactive effect.id.at.consequently,it held that cyr was entitled to apply for relief under the statute in effect at the time of his plea agreement.
cyr,however,addressed iirira retroactive effect only in regard to aliens who pled guilty prior to the elimination of c relief.in moore,this court considered whether a legal permanent resident who had been convicted after a jury trial was eligible for c relief under cyr,and we concluded that he was not,cir.in reaching this holding,the court adopted the reasoning laid out by the second circuit in rankine reno,cir.the rankine court stated that 
aliens who chose to go to trial are in a different position with respect to iirira than aliens like cyr who chose to plead guilty first,none of these petitioners detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued eligibility for c relief second,the petitioners have pointed to no conduct on their part that reflects an intention to preserve their eligibility for relief under c by going to trial.if they had pled guilty,petitioners would have participated in the quid pro quo relationship,in which a greater expectation of relief is provided in exchange for foregoing a trial,that gave rise to the reliance interest emphasized by the supreme court in cyr.as the court made clear,it was that reliance,and the consequent change of immigration status,that produced the impermissible retroactive effect of iirira.here petitioners neither did anything nor surrendered any rights that would give rise to a comparable reliance interest.
at quoting rankine,at internal citation omitted.applying this reasoning,we concluded that the application of iirira repeal of c to does not create an impermissible retroactive effect.id.
after,this circuit requires an applicant who alleges continued eligibility for c relief to demonstrate actual,subjective reliance on the state of the law to be eligible for relief from its retroactive application.the applicant must show that he detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued eligibility for c relief or that he actively engaged in conduct that reflect ed an intention to preserve his eligibility for relief under c id.quoting rankine,at.because the reliance demonstrated must be actual,the determination of retroactive effect is made as to the individual applicant,not as to a group of applicants.see id.t he application of iirira repeal of c to does not create an impermissible retroactive effect.emphasis added.
carranza argues that iirira is impermissibly retroactive with respect to her case because she acted in reliance on the continuing availability of c when she made the decision to defer her application for relief in order to establish a history of rehabilitation 
at oral argument,the government for the first time suggested that carranza failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to this argument.judicial review of a final removal order is available only if the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right.darwich gonzales,wl at cir,unpublished per curiam citing d.an alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the on direct appeal or in a motion to.wang ashcroft,cir.
contrary to the government assertion,however,carranza appears to have raised this argument,although in a less developed form,before the bia.in her appeal to the bia,carranza argued that the logic of cyr was not limited to cases in which an alien had pled guilty,but could also apply in situations in which an alien had proceeded to trial.because this brief was filed prior to this court decision in,carranza focused on the broader argument that the decision to go to trial itself could create the reliance interest necessary to create an impermissible retroactive effect.in support of this argument,she quoted language from the third circuit opinion in ponnapula,holding that 
with respect to an alien who reasonably could have relied on the potential availability of c relief,application of the landgraf principles shows that iirira section b has an impermissible retroactive effect.moreover,on this record,where the petitioner demonstrated clear and actual reliance on the former statutory scheme in making the decision to go to trial,there is a fortiori an impermissible retroactive effect.
at.on this basis,carranza argued to the bia that her case should be remanded to to give her the opportunity to demonstrate reliance,if required,and thereafter to seek c relief.
carranza did attempt,before the bia,to argue that an impermissible retroactive effect is triggered by a showing of reliance and that she should be permitted to present evidence as to her actual reliance before the ij.although carranza theory of reliance was modified after the panel holding in,the bia clearly had the opportunity to address her claim that actual reliance by an alien on the continued availability of c relief triggered an impermissible retroactive effect after cyr.the bia declined to address this argument in any fashion,finding itself bound by the limits of a and by the absence of precedential authority from our court.we therefore hold that the issue carranza presents on this appeal has been adequately exhausted before the bia,and that we therefore have jurisdiction to consider her appeal.we now turn to consider the question whether carranza has made a showing that the statute is impermissibly retroactive with respect to her.
in support of her argument that her decision to defer application for c relief provides a basis for showing actual reliance,carranza cites restrepo mcelroy,cir,a second circuit case decided after rankine,in which the court held that an applicant decision to postpone applying for c relief to create a longer record of rehabilitation and community ties may create a sufficient reliance interest to create an impermissible retroactive effect of the statute 
restrepo argued that he had given up something of value the opportunity to apply for c relief immediately after his conviction in reliance on his ability to apply for c relief at a later time.id.at.in considering a c application,an immigration judge must weigh the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf.id.at quoting lovell ins,cir.favorable considerations include the duration of the alien residence in the country,his history of employment,the existence of property or business ties,evidence of service to the community,and proof of genuine rehabilitation if the alien has a criminal record.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.given the relevant factors,the second circuit concluded that an alien convicted of a deportable crime would be motivated to wait as long as possible to file a c application in the hope that he could build a better case of that shows longer residence in the united states,deeper community ties,and,perhaps most significantly,stronger proof of rehabilitation.id.of course,the decision to postpone the application would be contingent on the applicant belief that c relief would remain available later.id.
analogizing to cyr,the restrepo court concluded that 
j ust like the aliens in cyr,who sacrificed something of right to a jury trial,at which they could obtain an outright the expectation that their guilty pleas would leave them eligible for c relief,an alien like restrepo also sacrificed shot of obtaining c relief by immediately order to increase his chances of obtaining such relief later on.such an alien conformed his or her conduct according to the availability of relief,and therefore had settled expectations that would be severely upset were the aedpa to be applied retroactively.
id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court remanded the case to the district to determine whether restrepo could claim the benefit of his argument.id.at.
the government argues that restrepo is not representative of the law of the second circuit,citing rankine and thom ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that an alien convicted by jury trial is ineligible for c relief.although the government is correct that under rankine and,an applicant can not demonstrate eligibility for c relief merely on the basis that he or she chose to go to trial,rankine does not foreclose the applicant from presenting other arguments in support of his or her claim for detrimental reliance.the restrepo panel itself devoted considerable space to distinguishing rankine,explaining that 
as in cyr,aliens like petitioner incurred a heightened expectation of prospective relief flowing from their choice to forgo building a stronger record and filing at a later date.furthermore,while aliens who elected a jury trial can not plausibly claim they would have acted any differently if they had known about aedpa,it is certainly plausible that aliens who decided to forgo affirmatively filing a c application would have acted differently if they had foreseen the aedpa enactment.many might well have chosen affirmatively to file the weaker,but still valid,application.to the extent that aliens like petitioner detrimentally adopted their positions in reliance of sic their expectation of continued eligibility for c relief,the factors considered in rankine appear to weigh against proscribing such relief retroactively.
restrepo,at.contrary to the government position,restrepo was not merely an aberration.the thom court,while holding that the decision to contest criminal charges at trial does not give rise to reasonable reliance,also noted that thom did not claim any other basis for such a reliance or expectation citing restrepo,before holding that iirira and the aedpa could be a
