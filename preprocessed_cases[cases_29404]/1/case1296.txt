at issue is a maryland program to subsidize the participation of a new power plant in the federal wholesale energy market.appellees are energy firms that compete with this new plant in interstate commerce.they contend that the maryland scheme is preempted under the federal power act authorizing provisions,which grant exclusive authority over interstate rates to the federal energy regulatory commission.the district court agreed.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
for much of the century,the energy market was dominated by vertically integrated firms that produced,transmitted,and delivered power to customers.new york ferc,ppl energyplus,llc nazarian,d,opinion below.these firms were subject to extensive local regulation,though state power in this respect was limited by the strictures of the dormant commerce clause.see pub.utils.comm attleboro steam.
the federal power act fpa,passed in,was designed in part to fill the regulatory gap created by the dormant commerce clause and cover the field of interstate electricity sales.it vests the federal energy regulatory commission ferc with authority over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.b.federal regulation has become increasingly prominent as the energy market has shifted away from local monopolies to a system of interstate competition.see new york,at.
rather than ensuring the reasonableness of interstate transactions by directly setting rates,ferc has chosen instead to achieve its regulatory aims indirectly by protecting the integrity of the interstate energy markets.bd.of pub.utils.ferc,cir.to this end,ferc has authorized the creation of regional transmission organizations to oversee certain multistate markets.pjm interconnection,llc pjm,superintended by ferc,administers a large regional market that as relevant here includes maryland and the district of columbia.
pjm operates both energy and capacity markets.the energy market is essentially a market that enables pjm to buy and sell electricity to distributors for delivery within the next hour or hours.
the capacity market is a market,which gives buyers the option to purchase electricity in the future.in the capacity market,pjm sets a quota based on how much capacity it predicts will be needed three years hence and then relies on a reliability pricing model rpm to determine the appropriate price per unit.auction participants bid to sell capacity for a single year,three years in the future.pjm stacks the bids from lowest to highest and,starting at the bottom,accepts bids until it has acquired sufficient capacity to satisfy its quota.
the bid that pjm must accept to meet this quota establishes the price.every generator who bids at or below this level clears the market and is paid the clearing price,regardless of the price at which it actually bid.existing generators are permitted to bid at zero as pricetakers,meaning they agree to sell at whatever the clearing price turns out to be.
both the capacity and energy markets are designed to efficiently allocate supply and demand,a function which has the collateral benefit of incentivizing the construction of new power plants when necessary.clearing prices occasionally differ based on geographical subdivisions designed by ferc to stimulate new construction by signaling that certain regions are prone to supply shortages.such price signals are not the sole mechanism for incentivizing generation,however.pjm new entry price adjustment nepa guarantees certain new producers a fixed price for three years to support the new entrant until sufficient load growth,increased demand would be expected to do so.pjm interconnection,llc,ferc,at.
in,ferc instituted a requirement the minimum offer price rule,or mopr that new generators in certain circumstances bid at or above a specified price,fixed according to the agency estimation of a generic energy project cost.this rule was designed to prevent the manipulation of clearing prices through the exercise of buyer market power.the mopr originally exempted certain generators,however,and permitted them to bid at zero.
following a complaint lodged by several competitors,ferc eliminated the exemption for plants.the new rule required such plants to bid initially at the minimum price unless they could demonstrate that their actual costs were lower than this default price.ferc held that this adjustment was necessary to protect the integrity of its markets against bids by subsidized plants that might artificially suppress clearing prices.see pjm interconnection,llc,ferc,at.
as these features suggest,the federal markets are the product of a scheme that attempts to achieve a variety of different aims.ferc rules encourage the construction of new plants and sustain existing ones.they seek to preclude state distortion of wholesale prices while preserving general state authority over generation sources.they satisfy demand and ensure sufficient supply.in short,the federal scheme is carefully calibrated to protect a host of competing interests.it represents a comprehensive program of regulation that is quite sensitive to external tampering.
in,maryland decided to abandon the vertical integration model and throw in its lot with the federal interstate markets.deregulation was accomplished by the electric customer choice and competition act,pub.utils,et,which divested utilities of their generation resources,effectively compelling maryland energy firms to participate in the federal wholesale markets.see ppl energyplus,llc,d at.the state believed that these markets would ultimately produce more efficient and service than traditional monopolies,thus providing state residents the benefit of lower prices.see in the matter of baltimore gas and electric company proposal,order,at.pub.serv.comm n,may.maryland decision to participate in the federal scheme and enjoy its benefits was necessarily accompanied by a relinquishment of the regulatory autonomy the state had formerly enjoyed with respect to traditional utility monopolies.
maryland soon became concerned,though,that the rpm was failing to adequately incentivize new generation.ppl energyplus,llc,d at.to solve this perceived problem,the maryland public service commission mpsc solicited proposals for the construction of a new power plant.the plant was to be located in the swmaac zone,an area comprising part of maryland and all of,which the state believed was at heightened risk for reliability problems.in order to attract offers,the mpsc offered the successful bidder a fixed,revenue stream secured by contracts for differences cfds that the state would compel one or more of its local electric distribution companies edcs to enter.maryland plan was ultimately formalized in the generation order,issued by mpsc in.
commercial power ventures maryland,llc cpv submitted the winning bid and was awarded the promised cfds.the cfds required cpv to build a plant and sell its energy and capacity on the federal interstate wholesale markets.if cpv successfully cleared the market,it would be eligible for payments from the edcs amounting to the difference between cpv revenue requirements per unit of energy and capacity sold set forth in its winning bid and its actual sales receipts.these costs would in turn be passed on to the edcs retail ratepayers.if cpv receipts exceeded its approved revenue requirements,it would be obligated to pay the difference to the edcs.the cfds did not require cpv to actually sell any energy or capacity to the edcs.
are existing power plants in competition with cpv who allege that the generation order is unconstitutional and has resulted in the suppression of pjm prices,a reduction in their revenue from the pjm market,and a distortion of the price signals that market participants rely on in determining whether to construct new capacity.after a bench trial,the district court found the generation order field preempted.it reasoned that the cfd payments had the effect of setting the ultimate price that cpv receives for its sales in the pjm auction,thus intruding on ferc exclusive authority to set interstate wholesale rates.it did not reach appellees conflict preemption claim and rejected their dormant commerce clause claim.this appeal followed.
plaintiffs argue that the generation order and the resulting cfds are preempted by federal law under the supremacy clause.const.art.vi,cl.they ground this contention in two alternative theories field preemption and conflict preemption.we address each in turn 
preemption of all varieties is ultimately a question of congressional intent.nw.cent.pipeline state.comm n.here,the district court found the generation order invalid under the doctrine of field preemption,which applies when congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation,leaving no room for the states to supplement federal law.id.actual conflict between a challenged state enactment and relevant federal law is unnecessary to a finding of field preemption instead,it is the mere fact of intrusion that offends the supremacy clause.see natural gas state.comm n.if congress evidences an intent to occupy a given field,any state law falling within that field is.silkwood kerr mcgee.
statutory text and structure provide the most reliable guideposts in this inquiry.see medtronic,lohr,congress intent,of course,primarily is discerned from the language of the statute and the statutory framework surrounding it.internal quotation marks omitted.the fpa declaration of policy states 
it is declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest,and that federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary in the public interest,such federal regulation,however,to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the states.

the breadth of this grant of authority is confirmed by the fpa similarly capacious substantive and remedial provisions.for example,a states that 
all rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable,and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.
a wealth of case law confirms ferc exclusive power to regulate wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce,including the justness and reasonableness of the rates charged.the fpa long has been recognized as a comprehensive scheme of federal regulation of all wholesales of energy in interstate commerce,schneidewind anr pipeline,internal quotation marks omitted,and ferc jurisdiction over interstate wholesale rates is exclusive,appalachian power.pub.serv.comm n,cir see also new england power new hampshire,in this area,if ferc has jurisdiction over a subject,the states can not have jurisdiction over the same subject.power light mississippi ex rel.moore,scalia,concurring in the judgment.
indeed,the supreme court has expressly rejected the proposition that the scope of ferc jurisdiction is to be determined by a analysis of the impact of state regulation upon the national interest.nantahala power light thornburg,quoting fpc cal.edison,internal quotation marks omitted.instead,congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained,between state and federal jurisdiction this was done in the fpa by making ferc jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the states.id.quoting cal.edison,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the federal scheme thus leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate wholesales of energy,or for state regulations which would indirectly achieve the same result.natural gas,at citation omitted.even where state regulation operates within its own field,it may not intrude indirectly on areas of exclusive federal authority.pub.utils.comm ferc,internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,states are barred from relying on mere formal distinctions in an attempt to evade preemption and regulate matters within ferc exclusive jurisdiction.schneidewind,at.
applying these principles,we conclude that the generation order is field preempted because it functionally sets the rate that cpv receives for its sales in the pjm auction.
the cfd payments,which are conditioned on cpv clearing the federal market,plainly qualify as compensation for interstate sales at wholesale,not simply for cpv construction of a plant.furthermore,the order ensures through a system of rebates and subsidies calculated on the basis of the pjm market rate that cpv receives a fixed sum for every unit of capacity and energy that it clears up to a certain ceiling.the scheme thus effectively supplants the rate generated by the auction with an alternative rate preferred by the state.see appalachian power,at holding that the agreement at issue did not set a rate per se,but that it nevertheless sufficiently resemble d a filed rate to come within the realm of exclusive federal jurisdiction.the order thus compromises the integrity of the federal scheme and intrudes on ferc jurisdiction.
maryland and cpv argue that the generation order does not actually set a rate because it does not directly affect the terms of any transaction in the federal market.relevantly,appellants contend,the order does not fix the rate that pjm pays to cpv for its sales in the auction instead,it merely fixes the rate that cpv receives for such sales.on the basis of this asymmetry,appellants contend that the cfd payments represent a separate subsidy implemented entirely outside the federal market.
we can not accept this argument.the case of mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore,is illustrative.there,ferc ordered a utility to purchase a specified percentage of a particular generator output.id.at.the utility petitioned mississippi to approve an increase in its retail rates to cover the costs imposed by the order,but the state insisted that it retained the authority to determine whether the purchases were prudent before acceding to the request.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,ruling that the state was required to treat the utility payments as reasonably incurred operating expenses for the purpose of setting the utility retail rates.id.at see also nantahala power light,rejecting a similar state effort to bar a utility from passing wholesale rates through to consumers.mississippi prudence review was preempted because it denied full effect to the rates set by ferc,even though it did not seek to tamper with the actual terms of an interstate transaction.
as the district court recognized,see ppl energyplus,llc,d at,the principles articulated in mississippi power light apply with equal force to this dispute.if states are required to give full effect to wholesale rates on the demand side of the equation,it stands to reason that they are also required to do so on the supply side.here,the contract price guaranteed by the generation order supersedes the pjm rates that cpv would otherwise established through a market mechanism.the order ensures that cpv receives a fixed price for every unit of energy and capacity it sells in the pjm auction,regardless of the market price.the fact that it does not formally upset the terms of a federal transaction is no defense,since the functional results are precisely the same.as in the cases,maryland has eroded the effect of the ferc determination and undermined ferc exclusive jurisdiction.appalachian power,at.
our conclusion that the generation order seeks to regulate a field that the fpa has occupied also is supported by the imminent possibility of collision between the state and federal regimes.schneidewind,at.while the potential for collision between the two schemes is discussed in detail in part d,a high probability of conflic
