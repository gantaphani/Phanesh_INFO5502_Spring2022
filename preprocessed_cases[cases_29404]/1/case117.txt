maine medical center maine medical challenges a district court ruling upholding the decision of the secretary for the department of health and human services hhs denying maine medical claim for partial federal reimbursement of bad debt for two fiscal years.maine med.ctr.sebelius,cv jaw,wl,at.a bad debt is an amount considered uncollectible arising from covered medical services that may be eligible for federal reimbursement under certain conditions.the bad debt at issue arose from services that maine medical provided to patients during fiscal years and.the secretary had required a particular form of proof,a remittance advice ra,which maine medical had not acquired from maine medicaid program,mainecare.the parties dispute both the difficulty of obtaining such proof and the adequacy of the alternative documentation the hospital offered.
two legal issues are presented on appeal.the first concerns the appropriate level of deference to afford the decision of the secretary as to the adequacy of maine medical proof in this case.the second concerns whether,under the appropriate standard,the secretary decision denying reimbursement was arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,otherwise contrary to the law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.see visiting nurse ass gregoria auffant,thompson,cir citing.
after careful consideration of the record,we affirm the secretary decision.it is not arbitrary and capricious for the secretary to demand that maine medical provide documentation from the state,including documentation confirming the identity of beneficiaries and qualified medicare beneficiaries,the amount that is the state to pay,and the state refusal to pay.nor is it arbitrary and capricious,on the facts of this case,to deny maine medical reimbursement claims that were unsupported by such documentation.the consequence of this decision is that maine medical may need to absorb roughly million of bad debt it will not receive reimbursement from the secretary unless it succeeds in obtaining the ras.whether maine medical has any recourse against the state of maine is not before us.
maine medical,a hospital in portland,maine,provides medical services to both medicare and medicaid recipients.some of these patients are,that is,indigent patients who are covered by both medicare,a federal health insurance program,and the medicaid insurance program,mainecare medicare and mainecare share responsibility for paying the crossover claims for services provided to these patients,with medicare the primary payer and mainecare the secondary payer responsible for covering coinsurance and copayments.
any amount remaining that is both unpaid by mainecare and for which mainecare is not liable is generally considered a bad debt,an amount considered to be uncollectible for covered services.b,e,h see provider reimbursement manual prm.medicare partially reimburses bad debt,from and patients alike,provided that reimbursement claims are adequately documented and are supported by evidence demonstrating that the medical provider made reasonable collection efforts but that the amount is actually uncollectible.e stating regulatory requirements for allowable bad debt see also id.a h governing reimbursement of bad debt.
collection process 
hhs has long interpreted reasonable collection efforts to require billing those responsible for payment.see,cmty.hosp.of the monterey peninsula thompson monterey,cir discussing the policy history and enforcement see also prm,explaining the requisite collection efforts where patients are also eligible for medicaid,the secretary has historically required medical providers to submit proof that it billed the relevant medicaid program but was denied payment.see monterey,at.this proof usually takes the form of an ra issued by the medicaid program,reflecting the patient eligibility,and payment or nonpayment.see,prm ii l assuming that satisfaction of the billing requirement will be demonstrated through ras.these two requirements which we denominate the billing requirement and the ra requirement try to ensure that the claimed amounts are in fact bad debt not covered by the relevant medicaid program.
some version of this policy has generally been enforced from to,however,the secretary manual permitted providers to substantiate crossover bad debt by submitting alternative documentation i n lieu of billing.see prm ii l.in march,the ninth circuit held that this waiver of the billing requirement marked a change in bad debt reimbursement policy,violating the congressional moratorium on such changes,and so could not be enforced.see monterey,at.in response,the secretary removed the offending language from the prm,effective october.see change request at.it is not clear that the secretary ever permitted broad use of this alternative document billing provision.compare transcript of proceedings at,maine med,prrb,t his intermediary never followed the instructions t hey always required medicaid ras,and monterey,at suggesting not,with cove assocs.joint venture sebelius,d,providing an example of a case where alternative documentation had been permitted.regardless,the secretary provided a grace period,issuing a memorandum instructing the intermediaries that process claims to hold harmless providers who had relied on the provision in settling claims before january.see jsm.that memorandum,known as jsm,articulated both the billing requirement and the ra requirement.see id.i n those instances where the state owes none or only a portion,the unpaid liability for the bad debt is not reimbursable until the provider bills the state,and the state refuses payment with a state remittance advice.maine medical did not rely on this grace period for the alternative documentation.
maine process 
the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms,acting on behalf of the secretary,processes crossover claims from maine pursuant to a trading partner agreement with mainecare.see grossmont hosp.sebelius,d,citing.under the agreement,medical providers like maine medical submit crossover claims to an intermediary,a contractor that processes the claims for cms.the intermediary pays the medicare portion as primary payer,and identifies and aggregates crossover claims,which it submits,bills to mainecare on a weekly basis.ordinarily,mainecare then processes these billed claims,issuing ras that confirm receipt of the billed claims and identify mainecare obligations for each claim.providers use these ras to substantiate their bad debt reimbursement claims for amounts exceeding mainecare obligations.
for fy and fy,the cost years at issue,maine medical submitted its crossover claims to the intermediary.the intermediary then submitted these claims to mainecare,pursuant to the trading partner agreement but from november,to august,mainecare failed to process these crossover claims and to issue ras for them due to an anomaly of unknown origin in mainecare claim management system mmis.maine med,wl at.maine medical does not appear to have sought the missing ras from mainecare or taken other steps to rectify the problem during this period of over twenty months.
the mmis program continued to encounter technical difficulties,and by the end of was unable to process any claims for anyone.in november,the maine hospital association,of which maine medical is a member,urged the maine department of health and human services maine dhhs to adopt regulations requiring the issuance of ras within sixty days after the close of the hospital fiscal year.but maine dhhs denied the request as outside the scope of the rulemaking because it concerned reports that d id not affect medicaid reimbursement.mmis was taken offline in january,and replaced by a new system,mecms.the new system still encountered difficulties,which maine is working to resolve 
despite these problems,maine medical does not appear to have taken any individual action to acquire the missing ras until early,three years after the problem began in november and over a year after the relevant cost years concluded in september.at that time,maine medical cpa,roland mercier,request ed assistance from mainecare for th e discrepancy in crossover processing for maine medical.according to mercier,mainecare response suggested that between the uncertainty of the cause and ongoing difficulties with the mecms,it was apparent that this older problem could not be remediated sic with the new environment.instead,mercier sought and received permission from mainecare officials to work with the muskie institute,a agency that assists mainecare with certain functions and has mainecare eligibility data,to develop alternative documentation.
mercier submitted the bad debt logs and alternative documentation to the intermediary in july.but the cms central office rejected mercier alternative methodology for compiling crossover bad debts,citing the congressional moratorium on cms bad debt policy.when informing mercier of this decision,the intermediary lamented that i t is unfortunate that mercier did not present his methodology to our office prior to us being in the field for maine medical audit,so that an earlier decision could have been obtained from cms and communicated to maine medical.
mercier again pressed the intermediary in early,and the intermediary again iterated its position that ras would be required and that bad debt reimbursement claims for fy and fy would be rejected without them.it added that mercier claim that the state can not produce these ras contradicts what state representatives had told them.the intermediary then denied maine medical reimbursement claims for crossover bad debt from fy and fy,totaling,because the bad debt reimbursement claims were not substantiated by the requisite ras denying payment.
a week later,on march,mercier finally contacted mainecare to request the missing ras for fy and fy.but mainecare declined to issue them.the claims had never been processed in mainecare system,and so mainecare could not at this point verify that the claims were ever received as claimed by the medicare intermediary.similarly,because the claims were never processed,an ra was never issued and in addition,obviously can not now be generated two to four years after the fact.i n an effort to resolve the issue between maine medical and medicare auditors,the director of maine dhhs emphasized that he was completely confident in the analysis of the muskie institute and believe d it to be the best available solution to this problem.in suggesting this solution,maine dhhs did not deny or otherwise specify mainecare liability for the claims,or confirm that,had they been processed,mainecare would have denied them completely.
the muskie institute had used mainecare eligibility data to verify mainecare eligibility for patients on crossover listings from fy and fy.but the alternative documentation produced omitted two important types of information ordinarily present on ras.first,the alternative documentation failed to distinguish between crossover claims for qualified medicare beneficiaries qmb and crossover claims for medicare beneficiaries second,the documentation did not include a analysis of mainecare obligations because the muskie institute assumed that mainecare payment would have been under a mainecare regulation eliminating payment for all crossover claims that had been in effect during the relevant period but the parties vigorously dispute whether mainecare would have,or lawfully could have,denied all reimbursement for maine medical fy and fy crossover claims.in particular,the secretary argues that states can not escape at least some liability for qmb crossover claims.see a e i requiring state plans to provide for medicare for qmbs see also prm stating that amounts the state is statutorily obligated to pay are not allowable as bad debts.yet the alternative documentation did not identify any of these qmb crossover claims,or calculate the extent of the resulting obligation.
procedural history 
despite these shortcomings,maine medical used this alternative documentation to appeal the intermediary decision denying reimbursement to the medicare provider reimbursement review board prrb.the prrb ruled in favor of maine medical,finding that there is not an absolute requirement to bill state medicaid programs and obtain a medicaid ra before claiming crossover bad debt.the prrb reasoned that neither the regulation e nor the relevant manual provisions prm,and contain a billing requirement,but rather require only that a provider make reasonable collection efforts and apply sound business judgment to determine that the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed.the prrb relied in part on another manual provision,prm ii l,which expressly permitted alternative documentation in lieu of billing and which was in effect during the relevant cost years.it accorded jsm articulation of the ra requirement little weight because it neither set policy,nor convey ed new instructions or clarification of existing requirements to intermediaries.
the cms administrator,on the secretary behalf,reversed,reasoning that the prrb had been incorrect to discount jsm,because it restated hhs longstanding policy including the ra requirement.the decision then proceeded to make what we interpret to be two findings.
first,it appeared to have applied a per se ra requirement regardless of circumstances,finding that the failure to produce the medicaid ras represents a failure on the part of maine medical to meet the necessary criteria for medicare payment the secretary also said r egardless of any omissions by the state to provide the medicaid ras,maine medical was required to bill for and produce the ra before including crossover bad debt claims on its cost reports.
second,it found that maine medical attempt to provide alternative documentation did not demonstrate,in any event,that the regulatory requirements of e had been met.the alternative documentation assumed that mainecare liability would have been zero.but this was based on chapter iii,section from the maine medicaid manual that purported to eliminate payments for crossover claims.the difficulty is that section p of the social security act imposes on states for qualified medicare beneficiaries.see liability by capping medicaid rates below medicare rates,it may not decline payment altogether the administrator explained why this makes obtaining a determination from the state necessary 
t he state maintains the most current and accurate information to determine if the beneficiary is dually eligible at the time of service,and the state liability for any unpaid deductible and coinsurance amounts through the state issuance of a ra after being billed by the provider.regardless of a state pronouncements,only through billing and receiving a state medicaid ra can a provider demonstrate that a state is or is not liable for any portion thereof.
because the state is required to process the bills or claims,providers may not a medicare bad debt as worthless without first billing and receiving the ra from the state,even in cases where the provider has calculated that the state has no liability.as the administrator explained,this is consistent with the regulation in f governing the timing of when a bad debt can be claimed consistent with the general medicare documentation requirements.section f provides that amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are to be charged off as bad debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be worthless.that is,a provider may not claim a bad debt until the account has been deemed worthless,and,because the state has the final word on whether it will pay,a provider can not deem an account crossover claims worthless until it has affirmatively been denied payment from the state 
the district court affirmed,according substantial deference to what it characterized as the secretary interpretation through the prm and policy of her own regulations.maine med,wl at.the district court upheld the application of a rule,as it was appropriate to keep the burden on the potential recipient rather than on the federal government to demonstrate it does not owe reimbursement.id.at.
our review of the district court judgment on the record is de novo,applying the same standards to the secretary final action that the district court was bound to apply.doe leavitt,cir.we may reverse and set aside agency actions,findings,or conclusions only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or unsupported by substantial evidence.visiting nurse,at quoting.in so doing,we are not wed to the district court reasoning and may affirm on any ground made manifest by the record,see doe,at,but we are limited to the rationale advanced by the agency in the administrative proceeding,citizens awareness network,united states,cir citing sec chenery.
the parties agree on these standards,but dispute the appropriate level of deference to accord this application of the secretary policy,and the ra requirement in particular.
the first question,one of the appropriate deferential framework,depends on the characterization of the secretary decision.maine medical disputes in this appeal the district court characterization of the secretary decision as applying the secretary direct interpretation of the relevant regulations.maine medical insists instead that the ra requirement interprets the interpretative rules articulated in the prm that themselves interpret the regulations.maine medical now also argues that the ra requirement interprets jsm,a memorandum that itself interprets the prm,adding a further layer of interpretation.maine medical argues that because the decision is appropriately characterized as the latter,considerably less deference is owed otherwise agencies would be able to insulate themselves from judicial review by promulgating vague regulations and vague interpretations of those regulations.see,elgin nursing rehab.ctr.dep t of health human,cir holding that agency interpretation of its manual interpreting its published interpretative regulation was not entitled to deference,citing concerns about ensuring fair notice and preventing agencies from insulating themselves against review.
whatever its merits,this argument has been waived.maine medical not only failed to raise this theory before the district court,but itself characterized the challenged ra requirement as the secretary interpretation of her own regulations.pl.mot.admin.at,maine med.ctr.sebelius,cv jaw,wl,ecf emphasis added.see rockwood skf usa,cir a rguments not raised in the district court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we proceed to treat the secretary decision as applying an interpretation of the regulations in 
similarly,maine medical waived any argument that skidmore deference applies under our precedent in visiting nurse ass gregoria auffant,thompson,cir,rather than seminole rock substantial deference.in arguing before the district court,maine medical only cited cases applying seminole rock substantial deference and exceptions thereto,like thomas jefferson university shalala,d.as a result,we apply the substantial deference framework to the whole of the secretary decision.
accordingly,we afford substantial deference to the application of the policy unless it is a plainly erroneous interpretation or inconsistent with the regulation language.south shore,thompson,cir quoting thomas jefferson,at.on its face,the policy is neither a plainly erroneous interpretation nor inconsistent with the regulations.neither portion of the policy,the billing requirement and the ra requirement,contradicts the four c riteria for allowable bad debt under e that the debt is related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts,that the provider made reasonable collection efforts,that the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless,and that s ound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.e see also,monterey,at grossmont,d at.rather,the billing requirement is a natural interpretation of these regulations,and the ra requirement provides a standardized way to document that it has been met,grossmont,d at t he secretary reasonably believes that permitting individual states to rely on their own protocols for bad debt reimbursement whether with respect to billing or supporting documentation could wreak administrative havoc on the medicare system.indeed,the secretary is authorized by statute to require a provider to furnish such information as the secretary may request.a.
while we find that a general ra requirement appears entitled to deference subject to one concern,below,we agree with maine medical that a per se ra requirement would not be.the secretary has made exceptions and accepted alternative documentation from the state where circumstances warranted the exception.see grossmont,d at.a per se ra requirement is also inconsistent with the regulatory language that requires reasonable collection efforts and the exercise of s ound business judgment to determine that there is no likelihood of future recovery.e emphasis added see also cove,d at recognizing the possibility that a provider might be denied medicaid ras despite reasonable collection efforts.and the prm ii l demonstrates that ras are not the sine qua non of proof.but while the enforcement of a per se ra requirement would not be entitled to deference,it is not inconsistent with the regulations to require a particular type of documentation,except under certain circumstances,to demonstrate that the billing requirement has been met.grossmont,d at.
that said,there may be another hurdle less readily overcome while in our view the billing requirement and a general ra requirement which is not a per se rule but admits limited exceptions are consistent with the statute and regulations,see a e,the secretary has not consistently adhered to this interpretation.see south shore,at citing good samaritan hosp.shalala,d ins cardoza fonseca,d i f,over time,an agency interprets a regulation erratically,that inconsistency may warrant a court in declining to defer to the agency in a particular situation.during the cost years in question,the prm ii l expressly waived the billing requirement and,with it,the ra requirement.see prm ii l repealed september.in lieu of billing,the secretary would accept alternative documentation of 
medicaid eligibility at the time services were rendered via valid medicaid eligibility number,and 
that would have occurred if the crossover claim had actually been filed with medicaid.
id.the payment calculation would then be audited based on the state medicaid plan in effect on the date that services were furnished.id.maine medical argues that this inconsistency entails that the secretary decision denying alternative documentation it previously would have found adequate is entitled to less deference,even within the substantial deference framework applicable to agency interpretations of their own regulations.south shore,at citing good samaritan,at.
the extent to which inconsistency in interpretation undermines seminole rock deference remains uncertain,but it is in this circuit that agencies are afforded a substantial measure of freedom to refine,reformulate,and even reverse their precedents in the light of new insights and changed circumstances.see south shore,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted stephenson pogoriler,seminole rock domain,geo,collecting cases discussing ambiguity in the doctrine regarding the significance of inconsistency.the repeal of this provision occurred under unusual circumstances the ninth circuit found that the prm ii l itself marked a change in the secretary policy away from the policy we are now asked to affirm.see monterey,at.but congress had imposed a moratorium on changes in policies.see id.at noting that the secretary lacked authority to effect a change.following this decision,the secretary reinstated the pre language of prm ii l,repealing the billing waiver.see jsm.this suggests that the secretary did not alter her policy without reason 
the concerns that such a radical shift in policy might create are also not evident here.maine medical concedes that it did not rely on prm ii l when responding to the lack of ras.cove,d at remanding for determination of whether plaintiffs were justified in relying on cms prior failure to enforce the policy emphasis added.and maine medical also does not suggest that
