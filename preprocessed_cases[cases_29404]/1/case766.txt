petitioner alejandro linares huarcaya,a native and citizen of peru,seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia upholding the denial of his application for adjustment of status.in re huarcaya,no.a,wl.we affirm the bia decision and deny review of the petition.
background 
in,congress amended i to allow aliens who entered the united states without inspection and met certain specifications to adjust their status upon the payment of a penalty fee.initially,to be eligible for adjustment under i,aliens were required to prove that they had a visa petition or labor certification filed on their behalf on or before january.in,however,congress temporarily extended that deadline to april,stat.codified as amended at.
the united states department of justice promulgated regulations to govern who can be grandfathered under i.see.in addition to meeting the deadline,an alien must show that the relevant labor or petition filed on her behalf was approvable when filed.a.according to the regulations,approvable when filed 
means that,as of the date of the filing of the qualifying immigrant visa petition under section of the act or qualifying application for labor certification,the qualifying petition or application was properly filed,meritorious in fact,and frivolous being defined herein as patently without substance.this determination will be made based on the circumstances that existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was filed.a visa petition that was properly filed on or before april,and was approvable when filed,but was later withdrawn,denied,or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen after the time of filing,will preserve the alien beneficiary grandfathered status if the alien is otherwise eligible to file an application for adjustment of status under section i of the act.
a emphasis added.therefore,to be eligible for adjustment,an alien must show that the relevant petition was properly filed meritorious in fact and.
turning to the case at hand,the record reflects that while huarcaya was living in peru,he rented an apartment from a family that had a daughter named ruth.although huarcaya fathered several children by two different women in peru,he testified that he dated ruth in peru for approximately eight years.in,ruth left peru for the united states and became a legal permanent resident.huarcaya came to the united states without inspection in,purportedly to join her.they were married on march,and within a month,ruth filed an visa petition for huarcaya.
the marriage was,and ruth and huarcaya were divorced on march.ruth was denied on march.shortly after his divorce was finalized,huarcaya married his second wife,lucy,an american citizen.lucy also filed an on his behalf.unlike ruth,lucy was approved,and huarcaya filed an to seek adjustment of status.the united states citizenship and immigration services cis denied the application.in its denial letter,the cis explained that at the time of huarcaya interview,the cis had requested evidence concerning the bona fide nature of huarcaya marriage to ruth and in response,huarcaya only submitted photos.further,noting the approximate duration of his marriage to ruth,the cis concluded that huarcaya failed to meet his burden of proving that ruth petition was approvable when filed.
after an immigration hearing in which he sought review of the cis determination,and during which huarcaya and ruth testified,the immigration judge ij found that huarcaya had not met the burden of proof to show that ruth application for huarcaya was approvable when filed,and ordered him removed.
between the time the ij rendered his decision in april,and huarcaya case was decided by the bia,the bia considered the meaning of a as a matter of first impression.in re riero.riero presented a similar fact alien divorced his first wife,who had filed a petition for him before the date.the question then became whether his first wife petition was approvable when filed such that riero could be grandfathered under i.
in riero,the bia found that in order for a visa petition to be approvable when filed in this context,there must be a showing that the marriage on which it is based was bona fide.id.it is not enough to show merely that a marriage existed,the bia elaborated.rather,in order to be meritorious in fact,the visa petition must be based on a genuine marriage in which the parties intended to share a life as husband and wife,not a marriage of convenience designed solely to confer an immigration benefit on one of the parties.id.this interpretation is confirmed by the explanation of the approvable when filed standard in the federal register,which provides as an example that a visa petition is not approvable when filed if it is fraudulent or if the named beneficiary did not have,at the time of the filing,the appropriate family relationship or employment relationship that would support the issuance of an immigrant visa.id.at.according to the bia,i n the marriage context,a fraudulent visa petition would include one where the marriage was not entered into in good faith.id.at.determining that riero first marriage did not meet this standard,the bia affirmed.
in the case before us,the bia affirmed the ij decision,citing riero.in re huarcaya,no.a,wl.the bia adopted the ij conclusion that there was no documentary evidence to support huarcaya claim that his first marriage was bona fide at the time of inception.id.although it may be true that the respondent and his former wife had few joint documents or finances because they lived with the mother in the mother house,the bia wrote,the respondent former wife lacked key information about the respondent,his children left behind in peru,and the respondent financial commitment to these children id.further,there were also inconsistencies between their testimonies including what type of employment the respondent had in peru,and how old the former wife was when she met the respondent.id.the bia denied relief and this petition for review followed.
discussion 
on appeal,huarcaya raises two claims.first,he argues that the bia construction of i is not entitled to deference.second,he argues that the term meritorious in fact is unconstitutionally vague.
administrative law claim 
huarcaya claim under chevron is that a is invalid.see chevron,natural resources def.council,d.specifically,huarcaya argues that the bia interpretation of the requires that the petition be both meritorious in fact and to be approvable when filed renders impermissibly redundant.under huarcaya analysis of the regulation,the only permissible interpretation of meritorious in fact and is not,as the bia asserts,that the alien show that the petition was based on a bona fide marriage rather,he argues that the petition must only establish a prima facie case for eligibility.only this reading,huarcaya contends,would give content to both the terms and meritorious in fact,as opposed to rendering the term completely superfluous.the government,in response,argues that this argument simply identifies an ambiguity in the terms and does not undermine the reasonableness of the bia interpretation of the regulation.
we first must determine whether and what kind of deference applies to huarcaya claim.huarcaya argues that chevron applies.chevron contemplates a inquiry.at step one,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and unambiguously expressed its intent.id.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we must move to the second step and determine whether the agency construction is reasonable.id.at.if the interpretation is reasonable,we must accept it.id.at.
because the statute does not speak directly to this question,we can proceed to step two.leaving aside for the moment the particular language of the regulation,the bia view articulated in riero,requiring a bona fide marriage,is a permissible interpretation of the requirements of i.this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutory framework congress constructed.to be admissible to the united states on the basis of marriage to a united states citizen,an applicant must establish that the qualifying marriage was not entered into for
