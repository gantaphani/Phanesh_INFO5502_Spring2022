herman henry and ambessa hagos berhe each petition for review of board of immigration appeals decisions ordering their removal.we have written a single opinion dealing with those separate petitions because they both question whether a state misdemeanor drug offense can constitute an aggravated felony for the purposes of the immigration and nationality act ina.see a.petitioners face removal from the united states on the basis of their respective state misdemeanor convictions for possession of a controlled substance.the board denied their applications for discretionary relief from removal on account of their aggravated felony convictions.the petitioners argue,inter alia,that their respective state convictions should not be considered aggravated felonies because massachusetts,the convicting authority in both cases,classified the crimes as misdemeanors.
we reject the petitioners contentions that we may only look to state law in such cases and reaffirm that a state misdemeanor drug offense can amount to an aggravated felony if that offense would have been a felony had it been charged under the federal drug laws.because henry with intent to have been a felony had it been charged under federal law,we deny his petition.the record of berhe state conviction,however,reveals that he was convicted merely for simple possession,a misdemeanor under federal law.for that reason,among others,we vacate the board order and remand berhe case for further proceedings.
we begin our discussion by outlining the relevant procedural and factual background of the respective petitions.
henry petition 
henry is a jamaican national who was admitted to the united states as a permanent resident in.in,he pleaded guilty in massachusetts state court to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of.laws ch,a,a misdemeanor under massachusetts law.two years later,henry traveled abroad and was denied upon his return to the united states.the department of homeland security dhs charged henry with being removable because of his drug conviction.see ina a a i ii,a a i ii declaring inadmissible any alien convicted of violating a law relating to a controlled substance ina a c,a c i declaring inadmissible any alien the attorney general knows or has reason to believe is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance.
at a hearing before an immigration judge,henry admitted the factual allegations charged by dhs and conceded removability on the ground that he had violated a law relating to controlled substances.he denied,however,that he was removable as an illicit trafficker in controlled substances.he also filed an application for cancellation of removal,arguing that his removal would result in exceptional hardship to his family living in the united states,who were all either citizens or lawful permanent residents.see ina a,a.the immigration judge found henry removable as charged.although the judge deemed henry eligible for cancellation of removal,she denied henry application as a matter of discretion.both henry and dhs appealed to the board.
dhs challenged the immigration judge legal conclusion that henry was eligible for cancellation of removal.according to dhs,henry was ineligible for such relief because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.see id.providing the attorney general with discretion to cancel the removal of any alien who has not been convicted of any aggravated felony id.a b defining aggravated felony.
the board sustained dhs appeal.it observed that,under this court precedent,a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony if it is punishable under one of the federal drug enforcement statutes,including the controlled substances act csa,and is a felony.see amaral ins,cir.the board found that possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is punishable under the csa by a maximum of five years imprisonment,see a,b d,and would be classified as a felony under federal law,see a any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is a felony.because henry massachusetts offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law,the board concluded that it was an aggravated felony under a b.the board therefore found henry ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to jamaica.
berhe petition 
berhe was born in in a city in ethiopia,which is now a part of eritrea.his birth mother gave him up for adoption during the ethiopian civil war and his adoptive parents thereafter took him to sudan.four years later,in,he and his adoptive parents were admitted to the united states as refugees.in,berhe status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident.since his admission to the united states,berhe has never returned to eritrea.nor has he had any contact with any surviving family members there.
in,berhe was convicted in a massachusetts municipal court for simple possession of crack cocaine under.laws ch,and for assault and battery of a police officer,and was sentenced to six months probation.in,he pleaded guilty to simple possession of crack cocaine in massachusetts state district court,and received a suspended sentence.in prosecuting the offense,the commonwealth of massachusetts did not charge berhe with a prior conviction because it did not seek a sentence enhancement.see.laws ch,providing that if the government seeks enhanced penalties because of a prior conviction,the defendant shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense.both the conviction and the conviction were misdemeanors under massachusetts law.see.laws ch,a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison is a felony.all other crimes are misdemeanors.
in,dhs initiated removal proceedings against berhe,charging that he was removable because of his conviction for simple possession of crack cocaine.see ina a b i,a b i providing that any alien convicted of violating a law relating to a controlled substance is deportable.berhe conceded removability,but submitted applications seeking cancellation of removal,asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.berhe asylum application asserted that he would be persecuted on account of his religion were he returned to eritrea.
dhs subsequently filed a supplemental charge of removability contending that berhe conviction was for an aggravated felony,see id.a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable.dhs argued that because berhe had a prior drug conviction,his misdemeanor simple possession conviction was an aggravated felony under the ina.see id.a b.as a result,dhs argued,berhe was statutorily ineligible for the discretionary relief of asylum or cancellation of removal.see id.b a ii,b b i,a.dhs also argued that an aggravated felony is presumptively a particularly serious crime,which rendered berhe ineligible for withholding of removal.see id.b b ii.
following a hearing,an immigration judge found berhe removable on the basis of the original controlled substance charge,but not on the aggravated felony charge.the judge concluded that,because berhe conviction was classified by massachusetts law as a misdemeanor,it could not be considered an aggravated felony.the judge therefore evaluated berhe claims for relief and granted him asylum,withholding of removal,and cancellation of removal,but denied relief under the cat.dhs appealed to the board and berhe filed a from the denial of his cat claim.
the board sustained dhs appeal.the board stated that it would apply the first circuit approach for determining whether the state conviction is an aggravated felony.the board found that berhe offense was punishable under federal law as a felony because his prior drug possession offense converted his subsequent possession conviction into a felony.because berhe had been convicted of an aggravated felony,the board found him ineligible for asylum or cancellation of removal and therefore did not reach the merits of those claims.the board also reversed the immigration judge grant of withholding of removal on the ground that berhe had not shown a clear probability of persecution on account of any protected ground,and dismissed berhe as untimely.the board ordered berhe removed to eritrea.
henry and berhe separately challenge the board interpretation of aggravated felony.they contend that the board erred by treating their state misdemeanor convictions as aggravated felonies under the ina.berhe additionally challenges the board determination overturning the immigration judge decision granting him withholding of removal and contends that the board refusal to consider his cat claim as untimely was erroneous as a matter of law.we begin with their common challenge to the definition of aggravated felony.
aggravated felony 
because this issue concerns the interpretation of statutory provisions,a and c,our review is de novo.enwonwu gonzales,cir.although we ordinarily accord deference to the board reasonable interpretation of a silent or ambiguous provision of the ina,and the board choice of methodology for resolving a given issue arising under the ina may be regarded as an interpretation,we do not accord such deference in an aggravated felony case because,as we describe below,see infra at,the bia has taken a passive stance with regard to the interpretation of a.conteh gonzales,cir.
the ina establishes a comprehensive list of offenses that qualify as aggravated felonies.see a providing subcategories of aggravated felony offenses,many of which to other provisions.included in this list is illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title whether in violation of state or federal law.id.a b emphasis added.drug trafficking crime,in turn,means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et,the controlled substances import and export act et,or the maritime drug law enforcement act et.c emphasis added.
the board has interpreted a b to provide two paths for arriving at an aggravated felony finding.the first route is based on the illicit trafficking in a controlled substance language,and is not relevant to these cases.see gerbier holmes,cir noting that under the illicit trafficking route the state offense must be a felony under the law of the convicting sovereign and must contain a trafficking element.the second route is premised on the language drug trafficking crime as defined in c.the board concluded in matter of davis,i n,wl bia,that in terms of the drug trafficking crime route,any state drug offense,whether classified as a felony or misdemeanor in that state,is an aggravated felony if the same conduct would have been punishable as a felony if charged under one of the three federal statutes enumerated in c.id.at see also gerbier,at.this methodology is sometimes referred to as the hypothetical federal felony approach.see gerbier,at.
the board later clarified that the term any felony in c refers to the definition of felony in a,which provides catchall classifications for crimes codified in title.in re,i n,bia a classifying any offense that is not specifically classified in the substantive section defining the offense.under that provision,a felony is any offense where the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year.a.thus,the board ruled that a state drug offense could constitute an aggravated felony,in terms of the drug trafficking crime route,only if it is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the three federal drug statutes enumerated in c.in re,i n at.in other words,under the board strict hypothetical federal felony approach,the phrase drug trafficking crime meant any conviction punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the federal drug laws.
this approach has received mixed reviews from the circuit courts.in the civil immigration context,several circuits have adopted the board hypothetical federal felony approach,achim,cir united states,cir ashcroft,cir gerbier,at aguirre ins,cir.under this approach,the underlying state classification of the offense is irrelevant.the circuits that have adopted this approach emphasize that focusing solely on federal law properly accounts for the need to apply the nation immigration laws uniformly,and that an approach that allows the vagaries of state law to influence the determination would defeat this purpose.see,achim,at gerbier,at.
at least two circuits have taken a more flexible approach.these circuits hold that a state conviction constitutes an aggravated felony if it is punishable under one of the federal drug enforcement statutes,and is a hypothetical federal felony or is a felony under the law of the convicting state,lopez gonzales,cir,cert.granted,d united states,cir.this dual approach derives from circuit decisions interpreting the meaning of aggravated felony in the criminal sentencing context 
in light of the split in circuit authority,the board retreated from strictly applying the hypothetical federal felony approach in all cases,in favor of applying the approach of the circuit in which the case before it originated.see in re,i n,wl bia.in those circuits that have not definitively ruled on the issue,the board follows the position taken by the majority of the circuits in criminal sentencing dual approach.id.
in the present cases,the board interpreted our precedent as applying the dual approach.accordingly,the board found that the petitioners state drug offenses would constitute drug trafficking crimes if they were punishable under one of the three statutes enumerated in c,and punishable as a felony under either federal or state law.see amaral ins,cir finding that petitioner had been convicted of an aggravated felony because his state drug offense would be a felony under federal law united states,cir finding that the defendant was an aggravated felon because his state offense was a felony under state law and it violated the csa.the board found amaral to control in both cases.
in amaral,the board found that the petitioner was an aggravated felon,and therefore deportable and ineligible for discretionary relief,because of three state court convictions for possession of cocaine.see at.on review,we did not resolve the merits of the board decision because we lacked jurisdiction.id.at.our jurisdictional ruling,however,required us to consider whether the petitioner was an aggravated felon under the ina.id.at noting that if the petitioner was an aggravated felon,his petition for review was untimely in that case,as here,the question was whether any of the petitioner state offenses was a felony under c.because of c to the csa,we consulted the csa definition of felony as any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.id.at quoting.although we noted that the petitioner offenses were felonies under state law,we undertook a federal analysis of the petitioner crimes.see id.at.we concluded that,although a simple possession offense is ordinarily a misdemeanor under the csa,see a,one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.amaral,at.thus,we ruled that,under a literal application of a and a,the subsequent possession conviction amounted to a felony under federal law.id.
applying amaral,the board found that henry massachusetts conviction,possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,is punishable under the csa by a maximum of five years imprisonment,see a,b d,and is therefore a felony under federal law,see a.the board found that berhe conviction for simple possession,although ordinarily punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law,would be converted to a felony because of his previous possession conviction.see amaral,at a.thus,the board concluded that both henry and berhe had been convicted for drug trafficking crimes as defined in c.
petitioners argue that,because their respective state drug offenses were not classified as felonies by the convicting authority,they should not be considered aggravated felonies they contend that our holding in mandates that the law of the prosecuting jurisdiction controls for purposes of determining whether an offense is a felony or misdemeanor.they point out that in,we found that a state felony conviction was a felony for purposes of c notwithstanding that it would have been a misdemeanor under federal law.see,at.thus,the petitioners argue,we discarded the approach in amaral which they characterize as dicta in favor of an approach that looks to the prosecuting jurisdiction to determine the classification of an offense.they contend that the word applicable in definition of felony requires us to consult the law actually applied by the convicting authority.
the petitioners misread our precedent.first,amaral ruling was not dicta.in amaral,we were required to determine whether the petitioner had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in the ina,and in doing so,we employed a method that looked to the offense hypothetical status under federal law.see id.at.though we might have grounded our decision on the state classification of the offense,we did not do so.see id.united states johnson,cir en banc noting that when a federal appellate court confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case,and resolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion,that ruling becomes the law of the circuit,regardless of whether doing so is necessary in some strict logical sense moreover,subsequent rulings of this court have followed the amaral approach.less than two years after amaral,we applied precisely the same analysis in a sentencing case.see united states forbes,cir.we found that the defendant first state conviction for possession of a controlled substance would have converted his second state possession conviction into a felony under federal law.see id.citing a a.although,as in amaral,the underlying offenses were also felonies under state law,our application of the aggravated felony enhancement was predicated on our finding that the state offense was punishable as a felony under federal law.see id.forbes also suggests that a felony classification under either federal or state law will suffice to meet c any felony requirement.see see also united states cuevas,cir holding that the defendant state drug offense undoubtedly qualifies as a felony because it is punishable as a felony under federal law.
second,did not overrule or undermine amaral.the defendant in appealed the district court application of the aggravated felon sentence enhancement.see at citing b.although we recognized that the definition of aggravated felony in was essentially the same as the definition in the ina,we declined to adopt the board precedent which,at the time,applied the strict hypothetical federal felony approach.see id.at.we noted that the board rationale was based significantly on policy concerns relating to the consequences flowing from a deportation decision or a decision on an application for asylum,without regard to any of the policies that inform the meaning of aggravated felony in the context of the statutory prior offense enhancement or its implementation in the sentencing guidelines,at.viewing amaral as enduring precedent,we were also careful to distinguish it based on the differing contexts.id.at.
more importantly,however,we noted that our approach in was entirely consistent with amaral and forbes.see id.we observed that our cases interpreted the phrase drug trafficking crime in c to encompass two separate elements that the offense be punishable under the controlled substances act or one of the other two statutes identified and that the offense be a felony.id.at citing forbes,at amaral at.we further observed that c definition of drug trafficking crime,by its terms includes any felony that is criminalized under the csa.id.thus,we found that the definition does not limit its application to offenses that would be classified as felonies under federal law.id.emphasis supplied.moreover,we stressed that the csa definition of felony provided further support for the idea that a felony designation under either federal or state law would be sufficient.see id.t he csa itself defines a felony as any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.quoting.it is clear we read applicable to mean,not the law actually applied,but,consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word,the law capable of being applied.collegiate dictionary ed.thus,we held that a state drug conviction may constitute an aggravated felony if it was classified as a felony under state law even if it would have been a misdemeanor under federal law,but we did not suggest that a state offense could constitute an aggravated felony only if it was classified as a felony under state law.see,at.
accordingly,we conclude that the board was correct to employ the hypothetical federal felony methodology outlined in amaral.for the purposes of determining whether a state drug offense is an aggravated felony under the ina,our circuit precedent permits an analysis that considers whether the underlying offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law.as discussed above,we are not alone.while there is disagreement concerning whether it is permissible to consult state law in making the aggravated felony determination,as far as we can tell,all the circuits to have considered the issue agree that a state drug offense that would be punishable as a felony under the csa is a drug trafficking crime under c.see supra at.to our knowledge,no circuit has endorsed the approach urged that the underlying offense be a felony under state law.
henry case 
applying amaral hypothetical federal felony approach,the board determination that henry is an aggravated felon is clearly correct.henry state conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,which would be punishable under the csa by a maximum of five years imprisonment,see a,b d,is a felony under federal law,see a.the board therefore properly determined that henry is ineligible for cancellation of removal.see a.we next consider berhe alternative arguments.
berhe arguments 
sufficiency of the evidence supporting the aggravated felony finding 
berhe argues that,even applying the hypothetical federal felony approach,his state drug possession conviction is not a felony under federal law because the conviction was neither charged nor proven during the proceeding.he notes that under federal and massachusetts law,a defendant must be charged with a prior conviction before the government can seek a sentencing enhancement.see.laws ch,see also prou united states,cir holding that federal courts lack authority to impose the statutory enhancement where the government has not complied with the strictly enforced charging procedures.berhe acknowledges that both the state and the federal government had it brought charges against him could have sought a sentence enhancement which,if successful,would have resulted in a felony conviction under federal law.but,because he was not so charged,and instead pleaded guilty only to simple possession of a controlled substance which is only a misdemeanor under federal law because it is punishable by no more than one year in prison,see a,the government failed to establish that he was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony.
we agree.because berhe conviction is not a part of the record of the conviction,the government did not establish that berhe was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony.as recently articulated,this circuit applies a modified categorical approach for determining whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.conteh gonzales,cir.under this approach,the government bears the burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence derived solely from the record of the prior proceeding,that i the alien was convicted of a crime and ii that crime involved every element of one of the offenses enumerated in a.id.at.when the statute on which the underlying conviction rests necessarily involves all of the elements enumerated in one of the ina definitions of aggravated felony,proof of the fact of conviction suffices to discharge the government burden.id.where,however,the underlying statute sweeps more broadly,encompasses crimes that are not necessarily aggravated felonies under the ina,the government must demonstrate,by reference only to facts that can be mined from the record of conviction,that the putative predi
