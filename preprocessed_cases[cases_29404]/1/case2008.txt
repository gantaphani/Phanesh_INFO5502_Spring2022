petitioner svitlana denko denko appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board to affirm without opinion the immigration judge ij order of removal against denko and its decision to deny denko motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal.denko makes two arguments on appeal.first,denko argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the ij not to reopen removal proceedings when denko introduced evidence that her failure to attend her second hearing resulted from her attorney ineffective assistance of counsel and not from any decision on denko part to abandon her request for asylum.second,denko argues that the regulation permitting the board summarily to affirm without opinion the ij decision,a,violates established administrative law because it is inconsistent with other provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina and violates the due process clause of the united states constitution because it fails to produce a separate bia decision for the court of appeals to review.we affirm the judgment of the ij and uphold a rule as both constitutional and consistent with precedent.
background 
denko came to this country as a lawful nonimmigrant visitor on april,from her native homeland in ukraine.her authorization permitted her to stay for no longer than six months.denko remained in this country well past her authorization,and it was not until march,nearly five years after denko first entered,that she filed an affirmative request for asylum based on religious persecution.denko is jewish and claims that,while living in ukraine,she was persecuted by local ukrainian nationalists.denko states that she attempted to secure protection from local government agencies in ukraine but that none would assist her.she cites as specific examples of persecution,the following large fines were fraudulently imposed on her business by local officials,she was harassed and received threats of violence from local police,and she was victimized and beaten by members of the ukrainian self defense,a military unit of the ukrainian national army.
after denko request for asylum,the ins served denko on january,with a notice to appear nta to show cause as to why she did not leave the united states on or before her permission expired.the nta ordered denko to appear before the ij on october,and,according to the ins,included a warning which stated if you fail to attend the hearing at the time and place designated in this notice,or any date and time later directed by the immigration court,a removal order may be made by the immigration judge in your absence,and you may be arrested and detained by the ins.appellee br.at.
at this october initial hearing,denko was represented by her attorney,nicoleta wojnar wojnar.denko admitted to the factual allegations against her and that she was removable pursuant to the ina.during this hearing,the ij advised denko of the consequences of her failure to appear at the scheduled second hearing set for april.in addition,the order issued on october contained a written warning that denko must appear on april,
failure to appear at your hearing except for exceptional circumstances may result in one or more of the following actions you may be taken into custody by the immigration and naturalization service and held for further action,or your hearing may be held in your absence under section b of the immigration and nationality act.an order of removal will be entered against you if the immigration and naturalization service established by clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence that a you or your attorney has been provided this notice and b you are removable.
joint appendix at not.of hr g in removal proceedings.another reminder came almost four months before the second hearing,when denko received a letter from wojnar stating 
if you would like we could request a motion to the judge so you do not have to be present on april,in which case i will be there representing you 
please let our office know if this is something you would like to consider and although we have the right to request it from the judge,the judge does not necessarily have to grant it.however,for your convenience we will attempt to do so if you so desire.
at it is the wording of this letter that forms the basis for denko assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel.
denko,noting that english is not her native language,argues that she interpreted wojnar letter to mean that denko presence was not required at the hearing.moreover,denko claims that wojnar informed her that wojnar would seek a motion to waive appearance.as a result of wojnar letter,denko failed to attend her second hearing on april.consequently,the hearing was conducted in absentia pursuant to b a of the ina.because a waiver of denko personal appearance was never requested,the ij ordered denko removed to ukraine.the ij concluded that no special circumstances were present to justify denko absence from the hearing.
on june,after retaining new counsel,denko moved to reopen her removal proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel denko claimed in her accompanying affidavit that she misunderstood the mixed signals contained in wojnar letter.additionally,denko argued that wojnar never informed her of denko required presence and never sought the waiver that wojnar agreed to seek in the letter.as evidence of wojnar ineffectiveness,denko pointed out that the ina requires the alien presence at the hearing except in a few special circumstances,none of which was present in denko case.on august,the ij denied denko motion.the judge reasoned that 
apart from wojnar letter the respondent has not offered any additional evidence to indicate that there was an agreement to submit a motion to waive appearance nor has the respondent indicated anything further in her affidavit to support the existence of the agreement.a plain reading of the letter indicates that respondent prior counsel was merely extending an offer to file the motion.it does not rise to the level of an agreement without evidence to indicate that the offer was accepted.there was no evidence of a letter,telephone call,or any other form of communication that would indicate the respondent accepted the offer and had a reasonable expectation that it would be filed.
at decision or.of.additionally,the ij noted that even if wojnar agreed to file the motion and then failed to perform,denko had a duty to follow up because wojnar letter made clear that the ij had discretion to grant or deny the motion.the ij thus held that the in absentia order of removal was proper.
denko timely filed a notice of appeal to the board on august.denko argued that the ij decision was an abuse of discretion because it relied on wojnar ambiguous letter to show that denko was aware of the consequences of her failure to appear.according to denko,because english is not her native tongue and because wojnar confusing letter negated the ij prior warnings,the motion to reopen should have been granted because denko failure to appear was the result of wojnar ineffectiveness as counsel.on june,the board,using the newly enacted streamlining procedures,affirmed the ij order without issuing an opinion.denko now seeks review in this court,where she challenges the bia affirmance of the ij order of removal and the bia use of the procedure.
ii.analysis 
denial of the motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal 
denko asserts that the ij abused her discretion when she denied denko motion to reopen the order of removal.denko argued in that motion,and argues here on appeal,that wojnar assistance was ineffective because wojnar failed to make clear denko responsibility for appearing at the second hearing on april.in denko estimation,the ij abused her discretion when she failed to give adequate weight to denko affidavit and supporting evidence that denko was misinformed and would have reacted differently had she been given the proper information.
the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider a removal order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.ins doherty,d.an abuse of discretion can be shown when the ij or board offers no rational explanation,inexplicably depart s from established policies,or rest s on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.balani ins,cir.when the bia adopts the reasoning of the ij,we review the ij decision to determine whether the bia abused its discretion.kegode ashcroft,wl,at.cir.april,unpublished.when the bia issues an order pursuant to a,affirming the result of the ij decision but not necessarily adopting the ij reasoning,the only rational explanation is that of the ij thus here we review the ij decision for an abuse of discretion,as is discussed more fully in part.infra.
an in absentia order issued pursuant to b of the ina can be rescinded if the alien can show that she failed to appear because she was in custody and her failure to appear was not her fault she never received notice of the proceedings or she had other exceptional circumstances.b iii.see also b c.in denko case,because she was not in custody and most certainly received multiple forms of notice,the order can be rescinded only if the motion to reopen shows that there were exceptional circumstances causing her failure to appear.b c i.section e describes exceptional circumstances as matters beyond the control of the alien,including serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse,child,or parent of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances.e.an ij considers the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that exceptional circumstances exist.see in re,wl bia see also conf,at,reprinted in,noting that the conferees expect that in determining whether an alien failure to appear was justifiable the attorney general will look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the alien could not reasonably have been expected to appear.thus,the question that we must address is whether it was an abuse of discretion for the ij to determine that denko claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were insufficient to constitute an exceptional circumstance.
because a deportation proceeding is a purely civil action,ins,d,an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is reviewed under the due process clause of the fifth amendment rather than under the sixth amendment.fifth amendment guarantees of due process extend to aliens in deportation proceedings,entitling them to a full and fair hearing.ins,cir.ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding will rise to the level of a violation under the fifth amendment only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.ins,cir quotation omitted see also taniguchi schultz,cir to show ineffective assistance of counsel,a party must demonstrate that the actions of attorney resulted in prejudice to the party.a party must prove prejudice by alleging facts that permit the court to infer that competent counsel would have acted otherwise.citations omitted.the alien will succeed if he meets his burden of showing more than mere ineffective assistance of counsel,but assistance which is so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause,at quotation omitted see also,at the alien carries the burden of establishing that ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him or denied him fundamental fairness in order to prove that he has suffered a denial of due process.
the ij determined that denko did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because wojnar letter could not be interpreted to form an agreement that wojnar would request a waiver of denko appearance.at best,wojnar letter to denko could be interpreted as extending an offer to file a waiver motion.according to the ij,denko offered no other evidence of an agreement between herself and wojnar.moreover,the ij noted that even assuming that the letter could be interpreted to constitute an agreement,the letter clearly stated that the ij had discretion to grant or refuse any request,and thus denko should have followed up with wojnar to determine the status of her required attendance at the hearing.the ij noted that at the initial scheduling hearing,denko was warned of the consequences of her failure to appear at any future scheduling hearing both verbally and in writing.
the ij determination that wojnar actions were insufficient to constitute an exceptional circumstance explaining denko absence,and thus did not violate denko rights,was not an abuse of discretion.the ij provided a rational explanation for her conclusions that denko had sufficient notice of the consequences for failure to attend her hearing and that the allegations against wojnar were insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.balani,at.in addition,denko was not entitled to relief on her alleged claim because she failed to show how her liberty interest was violated,at.denko is unable to show the necessary prejudice or fundamental unfairness because she can not establish that but for wojnar legal advice,she would have been entitled to continue residing in the united states.id.at noting that t he failure to be granted discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.in fact,denko merely asserts that if she had not relied on wojnar allegedly confusing letter,she would have appeared at her scheduled hearing and an order in abstentia would not have been entered against her.while this may very well be accurate,this is not equivalent to a showing that if denko attended the hearing she would have been granted the asylum she sought.the lack of fundamental unfairness becomes even more clear when we consider that denko neither contests the illegal nature of her presence in the nor her deportability.in addition,denko failed to allege any facts that tend to show that a competent lawyer would have behaved differently than wojnar.see taniguchi,at noting that prejudice can be established through facts tending to show that a competent lawyer would have acted differently.
denko suggestion that because her affidavit states that she was confused by wojnar letter the ij was obligated to find that denko suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is not compelling.wojnar letter reiterated that denko hearing was scheduled for april,and provided denko an opportunity to seek to avoid her required attendance at the hearing.however,the language used in the letter clearly indicated that a motion to waive appearance could be filed at denko request,and denko presented no evidence of any such request made to wojnar.although denko argues that her language barrier prohibited her from understanding the precise language in the letter,she makes no argument that she did not understand the ij verbal and written warnings at the initial hearing.moreover,it was denko responsibility to understand the contents of a letter which,under a plain reading,only can be interpreted as an offer to file a motion with the immigration court.because denko failed to heed the prior warnings regarding attendance and neglected to confirm her own understanding of wojnar letter,we can not conclude that denko suffered fundamental unfairness.
in sum,while denko has shown that her failure to appear at her hearing precipitated the in absentia order against her,denko has failed to meet her burden to show fundamental unfairness or prejudice arising from wojnar conduct.see,at,at.because denko failed to establish an exceptional circumstance through a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel,the ij did not abuse her discretion in denying denko motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal,and the bia did not abuse its discretion in affirming the ij conclusions.
on appeal to the board,denko challenged the ij denial of her motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal based on denko sfailure to establish exceptional circumstances.the board,using the procedure also referred to as the streamlining procedure,agreed with the ij result.now on appeal,denko challenges the streamlining procedure compliance with the requirements of due process and established precedent.denko makes two broad arguments for striking down a first,denko asserts that a violates congressional intent embodied in the ina,because congress intended to enact greater procedural protections in administrative hearings for aliens.according to denko,the scheme was designed so that aliens would have two de novo reviews of their claims within the administrative system,one with the ij and another with the bia.in denko estimation,a license to members of the board to issue summary affirmances without opinions renders de novo review by the bia impossible.denko also asserts that a contradicts other ina provisions which permit appeals only from final orders.denko argues that because the bia did not independently render a decision,there is no final agency order for this court to review.
second,denko asserts a due process clause violation in that the regulation allows the bia to issue a summary affirmance without also issuing a separate opinion.according to denko,because the bia does not issue its own opinion,denko has a diminished opportunity to receive a full and fair judicial review of the final agency order.appellant br.at.denko argues that the supreme court has noted that in order for a court to review an agency action,the action must be clearly stated because i t will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.sec chenery.denko cites a ninth circuit case for the proposition that where the board fails to offer a reasoned explanation,the reviewing court must set aside the board decision.see tukhowinich ins,cir.the main problem with the summary affirmance process,according to denko,is that the basis for the board affirmance is concealed from our review by the explicit command of the regulation.denko asserts that this concealment makes the procedure violate due process 
it is well established that the fifth amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.reno flores,d.as an initial matter,aliens who have entered the united states,both lawfully and unlawfully,can not be expelled without the government following established procedures consistent with the requirements of due process.shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.we review de novo claims of violations in deportation proceedings,at.when the board adopts the decision of the ij in lieu of issuing its own opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency decision.alaelua ins,cir.
at the time denko appealed to the board,the board general policy was to sit in panels to review ij decisions on appeal under a,adopted by the department of justice doj in,a single board member is authorized to issue a decision affirming an ij decision without stating the basis for such affirmance.this affirmance implies that the ij decided the case correctly,any errors committed by the ij were immaterial or harmless,and either the issue is squarely controlled by precedent and does not involve a novel factual issue or the factual and legal issues raised on appeal are too insubstantial to warrant a review.a.if an appeal from a decision of the ij meets the regulation criteria,the board issues an order containing the following statement the board affirms,without opinion,the result of the decision below.the decision below is,therefore,the final agency determination.id.at a iii.if an appeal does not meet the criteria contained in a,a panel of the bia must review the petition.id.at a iv.
section a specifically indicates that a summary affirmance does not necessarily imply approval of all of the reasoning of the affirmed decision.id.at a iii.in the comments to the proposed rule,the doj identified the impetus behind permitting a summary affirmance by a single board member 
to operate effectively in an environment where over appeals and motions are filed yearly,the board must have discretion over the methods by which it handles its cases.the process of screening,assigning,tracking,drafting,revising,and circulating cases is extremely time consuming.even in routine cases in which all panel members agree that the result reached below was correct,disagreements concerning the rationale or style of a draft decision can require significant time to resolve.the department has determined that the board resources are better spent on cases where there is a reasonable possibility of reversible error in the result reached below.
executive office for immigration review board of immigration appeals streamlining,fed.reg,hereinafter streamlining to remedy the problems resulting from the dramatic increase in appeals,the attorney general sought to implement a new streamlined appellate review system because in a significant number of appeals and motions filed with the board,a single appellate adjudicator can reliably determine that the result reached by the adjudicator below is correct and should not be changed on appeal.id.at.by expressly prohibiting the single board member from including his or her own explanation or reasons within the order,the regulation further alleviates the burden on the board.
in response to denko first that a is inconsistent with administrative note that the cases she cites stand for the proposition that the bia has the power to conduct reviews de novo,not that it is required to do so.see abdulai ashcroft,cir because an alien facing removal may appeal to the bia as of right,and because the bia has the power to conduct a de novo review of ij decisions,there is no final order until the bia acts.castillo ins,cir the bia has the power to conduct a de novo review of the record,to make its own findings,and to determine independently the sufficiency of the evidence.while deliberate action from the bia may be necessary,denko suggestion that a summary affirmance without opinion is not a final order is directly contradicted by the terms of the regulation which indicate that the ij opinion becomes the final agency determination subject to review.a iii the board affirms,without opinion,the results of the decision below.the decision below is,therefore,the final agency determination.
courts have consistently allowed the ij decision to become the final agency determination subject to review when the board has adopted the ij findings or has deferred to the ij decision.see guentchev ins,cir to adopt someone else reasoned explanation is to give reasons.abdulai,at chen ins,cir.the third circuit in abdulai noted that there are occasions where as a matter of logic the courts of appeals are reviewing effectively the ijs decisions,such as when the bia affirms on the basis of the ij opinion.abdulai,at.moreover,tukhowinich expressly states that the bia has the authority to rely on an ij opinion that provides the required reasoning.see tukhowinich,at.all of these decisions,however,require that the bia give the ij findings individualized consideration.see,chen,at.when the bia does not perform its duty to review the record and assess the ij conclusions,the bia abuses its own discretion.tukhowinich,at.thus,we must address denko argument that the summary affirmance procedure enables bia members to give less than full consideration to the ij decisions they review.the first circuit previously has addressed this argument and concluded that a challenge to the summary affirmance procedure can not stand when the only evidence that the summary affirmance procedure causes the bia to disregard its review responsibilities is the nature of the procedure itself combined with statistics indicating that thorough review would be difficult.see albathani ins,cir.we agree that a petitioner must show more.here,denko has provided no evidence that the board failed to give denko case proper review.see id.at we are not willing,however,in the absence of evidence of systemic violation by the bia of its regulations to infer that the required review is not taking place.see also mendoza att y,cir that a order was entered is no evidence that the bia member did not review the facts of petitioner case.we will not assume such a complete in the system in the absence of tangible evidence to support such a conclusion.
moreover,denko argument that the summary affirmance without opinion permit
