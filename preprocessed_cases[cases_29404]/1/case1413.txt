fatoumata kourouma,a citizen of guinea,appeals the denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture by the board of immigration appeals bia.we hold that the bia decision denying kourouma asylum application on the basis of an adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence,and that kourouma has established past persecution in the form of female genital mutilation.
fatoumata kourouma is a native and citizen of guinea who entered the united states on july.at the time of her removal hearing,kourouma was years old.she is of the malinke mandingo tribe from the town of yomou,guinea.kourouma attended both primary and secondary school in yomou and her entire family continues to reside there.at the time of her hearing,kourouma stated she was working in the united states at a nursing home.
kourouma testified she decided to come to the united states because,after her marriage to a man her father had given her to,her husband threatened to have her circumcised anew because she had only been partially circumcised before.kourouma testified that she was circumcised partially,meaning that she had not undergone infibulation,at age seven in she has only a vague recollection of the procedure where she was taken with a group of girls of similar age to have the circumcision done.she testified that she has some lingering problems from the circumcision.kourouma four sisters are also circumcised.
after her husband demanded that she be recircumcised,kourouma left yomou in and fled to conakry,the capital of guinea,along with her daughter.there,she lived with a friend of her mother.kourouma departed conakry when she heard that her husband and her father were looking for her.she believes that were she to return to guinea,her father and husband would sanction her and have her recircumcised.
kourouma entered the united states via new york jfk airport using the malian passport of a woman named diane mawa.she received the passport from her mother friend in conakry she was also given an identification card in the name of diane mawa,and she presented a copy of it at the hearing as well.that card,unlike the passport,bore her picture not that of diane.she testified that once she was in the united states,a friend,mamadou bobo sow,picked her up at the airport,a fact reflected in his affidavit presented to the immigration court.
on march,approximately eight months after her arrival,kourouma applied for asylum in the united states.she testified that she applied and submitted her affidavit with the help of her first attorney by giving him the original version of her statement in french,and then he had it translated to be part of her asylum application.on december,the department of justice served kourouma with a notice to appear alleging removability on two counts being admitted as a and staying in the united states for a longer time than permitted.on july,the department of homeland security referred the case to an immigration judge.on september,the department of justice charged kourouma with two additional counts of removability being admitted to the united states at an unknown time and unknown place,and remaining in the united states beyond the time authorized.in the course of a series of removal hearings,kourouma,through counsel,conceded that she was removable under counts one,two,and four but denied count three.
kourouma first hearing before the immigration judge was on april.after the initial hearing,there was a series of continuances because kourouma changed counsel.however,at the time of her final evidentiary hearing,kourouma was pro se,and the immigration judge declined to continue the case in order to allow her to secure representation.in the course of her evidentiary hearing on april,kourouma presented the facts as described above,along with several exhibits including copies of her entry documents and mamadou bobo sow affidavit she also introduced a copy of her guinean passport and her birth certificate to confirm her identity.as background material,kourouma introduced two country reports on guinea from the united states state department which include sections on the prevalence and type of female genital mutilation practiced in guinea.the state department guinea report on female genital mutilation or female genital cutting stated that in,of all women living in all of guinea had experienced some form of circumcision.to support her testimony regarding her past circumcision,kourouma presented two doctor letters to the court.the first,dated may,from carlos covarrubias,describes a full physical examination of kourouma.in it,covarrubias,when discussing kourouma gynecological exam,stated that she has scattered linear scarring approximately cm on upper extremity.at the request of the immigration judge,kourouma provided another doctor note to state succinctly whether she had been circumcised or not.to this end,she provided a verification of circumcision from oluremi ilupeju,from an examination on september.ilupeju note stated that he had conducted a gynecological examination on kourouma and found that she had been circumcised.
during the government,kourouma was questioned concerning an application for asylum made by another alien which bore strikingly similar language to the affidavit offered by kourouma to support her application.the wording that appeared identically in both affidavits concerned facts of kourouma past circumcision and her fear of returning to guinea.kourouma could not explain the similarities in the affidavits beyond stating that she provided her statement to her lawyer in french and he had it translated.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the immigration judge issued her decision,concluding that kourouma was not credible and denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture on the basis of the adverse credibility finding.the judge first found that kourouma application for asylum was untimely because she could not determine with sufficient certainty the date when kourouma entered the country.the judge additionally found that even if considered a timely application,kourouma had not met her burden to demonstrate eligibility for refugee status because the judge found her to not be credible.the judge was particularly concerned that kourouma was unable to offer sufficient proof that she was who she claimed to be given that she produced evidence at the hearing which identified her both as kourouma and as mawa.the judge chose not to credit the guinean passport or birth certificate kourouma offered as proof of her identity because,in her opinion,they were not sufficiently authenticated or connected specifically to the petitioner.the judge was also concerned with the similarity of kourouma affidavit and the previously submitted application,explaining,the documents speak for themselves.immigration judge order.the judge was also concerned with the lack of evidence as to whether kourouma had been circumcised in the past,the omission of any mention of a fear of future circumcision in her asylum application,and the improbability that if her husband wanted her circumcised again that he would not have done so in the five years they were married and living together.finally,the judge also found that even if kourouma had been partially circumcised,that circumcision did not amount to past persecution.accordingly,the immigration judge denied kourouma application.
kourouma appealed the decision to the bia.the bia dismissed her appeal on july,finding kourouma failed to meet her burden to provide testimony that was believable and sufficiently detailed to provide a coherent,plausible account of her fear of returning to guinea.in particular,the bia cited the implausibility of kourouma husband not seeking to have her circumcised during their five years of marriage,the lack of any mention of future circumcision in her application for asylum,and the striking similarity between kourouma affidavit and that of a prior applicant.the bia also shared the immigration judge concern about the lack of corroborating evidence concerning kourouma marriage and her date of entry into the united states importantly,however,the bia did settle the issue of kourouma identity when,in summarizing the facts,it stated without qualification that she is a citizen of guinea.therefore kourouma appeal was dismissed with a renewal of the privilege of voluntary departure.this petition followed.
when the bia and the immigration judge both issue decisions in a case,we review both decisions upon appeal.camara ashcroft,cir.this court reviews those decisions under the substantial evidence standard,affirming the bia unless evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find eligibility for asylum.ins,d tarvand ins,cir citing figeroa ins,cir.in other words,we will uphold the final order of removal of the bia unless it is manifestly contrary to law.gonzales,cir quoting b c.in conducting its review of the case,the bia may defer to the immigration judge who had a chance to see the testimony,rusu ins,cir,and facts found by the bia are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find to the contrary.dankam gonzales,cir quoting b b.a credibility determination by the bia is considered a factual determination.camara,at citing figeroa,at.
applying this standard to the case before us,we hold that the immigration judge and bia decisions finding kourouma incredible and denying her asylum application was not supported by substantial evidence.indeed,kourouma has established that she suffered past persecution and has the presumption of a fear of future persecution.
an alien applying for asylum has the burden to prove that either he or she has suffered past persecution or he or she has a fear of future persecution.a b.an alien fear of future persecution has both objective and subjective components he or she must prove a subjective fear that a reasonable person in like circumstances would share.chen ins,cir.to carry his or her burden to prove eligibility for asylum,an alien must present candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.li gonzales,cir quoting chen,at.thus,the petitioner bears the burden to provide both candid,credible and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution as well as specific,concrete facts that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.chen,at.where an alien establishes past persecution,it is presumed that he or she has a fear of persecution which the government must rebut.b.
in this case,the immigration judge denied kourouma application,and the bia affirmed the denial,not on the merits of whether she had demonstrated past persecution,but rather because her testimony and supporting documentary evidence were not credible.kourouma argues upon appeal that she has met her burden to provide clear,believable,and convincing testimony on the basis of her grounds for asylum.more specifically,she argues that she offered sufficient corroboration such that her testimony should have been considered credible,especially given the resolution of the issue of her identity.the government argues to the contrary that the immigration judge adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence and should be affirmed because there were multiple other reasons besides the issue of her identity that led to the denial of her application.
in making an adverse credibility determination,the court must state specific cogent reasons for why it finds the testimony incredible,although it need not give extensive reasoning on why each piece of the applicant testimony was rejected.tewabe gonzales,cir.the same standard applies to documentary evidence,as the immigration judge can not reject documentary evidence without specific,cogent reasons why the documents are not credible.see zahedi ins,cir.in determining credibility,the immigration judge,and consequently the bia,must take into account both the petitioner testimony and his or her corroborating evidence,whether documentary or testimonial,in re,bia,and thus may not deny asylum merely on the basis of incredible testimony without considering any corroborating evidence.see camara,at.this circuit requires that the evidence offered as corroborating evidence be objective in order for it to be considered by the immigration judge and bia.see,at explaining the type of corroborating evidence in records and government objective evidence while the evidence offered by from not.importantly,the strict rules of evidence do not apply to immigration hearings,though they may guide an immigration judge in determining admissibility.anim mukasey,cir citing alexandrov gonzales,cir.
reviewing both the bia and the immigration judge decisions in this case,we find the denial of kourouma application for lack of credibility was not supported by substantial evidence.first,the main reason for the immigration judge denial of kourouma application was that her identity could not be confirmed so that the immigration judge could consider the merits of her case.the bia,however,differed with the immigration judge on the issue of kourouma identity.the first page of the bia decision states,the respondent is a native and citizen of guinea.bia order.the bia further did not mention any of the other questions about her passports or identity had so troubled the immigration judge.thus,this court in reviewing the appellate record accepts the bia finding of kourouma identity as supported by substantial evidence.
the finding that kourouma was who she stated she was in her hearing before the immigration judge bolsters her credibility overall as it relates to her testimony.the fact that her identity could not be confirmed was the basis upon which the immigration judge found the rest of her documentary evidence incredible including her passports,arrival documentation,and birth certificate.with that evidence now established as credible,it certainly supports her other contentions,in particular the usefulness of the state department country report for guinea.in the course of the hearing,the immigration judge did acknowledge that she had received into evidence both the state department country report on guinea and the state department report on female genital mutilation in guinea,yet she did not explicitly mention or consider either in her credibility determination.the bia did not mention whether it had received or considered the country reports.while country reports are not conclusive evidence that the petitioner in particular had been circumcised,they are important background evidence that the immigration judge and bia should consider when evaluating both credibility and the merits of the case.see gomis holder,cir discussing and applying the facts contained in the country report presented by the petitioner as evidence of the conditions she would face if she returned to senegal.because the bia established that kourouma was indeed a citizen of guinea,the country report she submitted about conditions there should have been considered.
looking to the country report itself,its contents corroborate kourouma testimony.the june state department report entitled guinea report of female genital mutilation fgm and female genital cutting fgc noted that in guinea,of women of all tribes and geographical locations had undergone female genital mutilation.additionally,the report states that in middle guinea,the location of the town of yomou,dalaba,the average age of circumcision is between ages four and eight.id.thus,while the report alone can not be conclusive evidence that kourouma herself had undergone female genital mutilation,it certainly supports her contention that at age seven she was circumcised.
the immigration judge was similarly cavalier about the reliability of the two doctors notes that kourouma presented with her claim.while the first was less than clear as to where the scarring noted was located,kourouma second letter entitled verification of circumcision from oluremi ilupeju was quite clear,stating a thorough gynecological examination revealed that this patient had been circumcised.the immigration judge declined to consider the second letter on the basis that the letter was not notarized.however,as stated abov
