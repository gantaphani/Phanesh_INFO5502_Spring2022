this case raises two questions of new york state law that are unsettled and of importance to the relationship between the state administrative agencies and its courts,as well as to the functioning of new york labor law.it asks,first,whether a court should give deference not only to an agency substantive interpretation of a statute arising from an unrelated proceeding but also to its decision to enforce that interpretation only prospectively.and it asks,second,whether contracts committing parties to pay prevailing wages pursuant to section of the new york labor law nyll need to specify when the scope of the statute coverage is unclear to the parties what particular work the prevailing wages will be paid for.at oral argument,the appellees stated that certification would be useful and appropriate.we agree,and we certify two questions to the new york court of appeals.see a.
background 
this case was brought by workers who installed,maintained,repaired,tested,and inspected fire alarm and suppression systems in public and private buildings in new york for simplexgrinnell lp simplex.they claimed that,since at least february of,simplex did not pay them prevailing wages for their labor on public works in violation of nyll section.
though the case was initially brought in new york state court in,it was removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,where the parties consented to the jurisdiction of magistrate judge steven gold.among other things,the plaintiffs brought breach of contract claims based on simplex failure to pay prevailing wages.
because the plaintiffs had chosen to bring a breach of contract suit in court,rather than in an article proceeding before the department of labor dol,see,that agency had no formal role in the proceeding.however,while the litigation was ongoing,simplex turned to the dol and,on its own,asked for clarification.the plaintiffs were not privy to these communications between simplex and the dol.
as part of these communications,simplex provided the dol with matrices reflecting its views of what work was covered by the statute and therefore entitled to the payment of prevailing wages,and what work was not.in the matrices provided by simplex,testing and inspection work was not listed as covered.the dol posted the matrices on its website.
subsequently,however,of the dol,patricia smith,ordered the matrices removed,and decided to issue an opinion letter on the matter.in that letter,the dol concluded that testing and inspection work was covered work under section of the nyll and hence entitled to payment of the prevailing wage.joint app x at.the dol reached this conclusion because,inter alia,testing and inspection work was a form of maintenance work a category that is covered under the statute.id.at.the opinion letter noted that both new york state and simplex own documents had treated testing and inspection work as within the category of maintenance work.id.at.
but the dol also stated that there had been much confusion as to whether it had earlier interpreted testing and inspection work as being covered and,for this reason,decided to enforce its decision prospectively only.id.at.the opinion letter,issued on december,went into effect on the following day january.id.
after the dol issued its opinion letter to simplex,the parties completed discovery in the eastern district and filed for summary judgment.simplex relied on the dol opinion letter in its motion.
the district court granted simplex motion to dismiss the plaintiff claims relating to testing and inspection work.ramos simplexgrinnell lp,d,the court focused principally on the dol opinion letter,and ruled that deference was due both to the conclusion reached in the letter that testing and inspection work was to be paid prevailing wages and to its decision to enforce that conclusion prospectively only.id.at.that is,the district court held that the plaintiffs testing and inspection claims for the period of the litigation could not proceed since the agency,in its own enforcement subsequent to its december,ruling,was requiring that prevailing wages only be paid prospectively.the district court reached this result because t here was nothing irrational or unreasonable about the commissioner decision to classify testing and inspection work as covered but to require that prevailing wages be paid only prospectively.id.
the district court also held that,under the circumstances,the plaintiffs breach of contract claim could not be brought for the testing and inspection work.id.at.here,its reasoning was more complicated.the court stated that when it allowed the plaintiffs claims to proceed on their and inspection work,see footnote,it had reasoned that since simplex had contracted to pay a prevailing wage for such covered work,the plaintiffs could bring a breach of contract claim for unpaid prevailing wages for such work.id.at.the district based this conclusion on the notion that it is typically understood by parties such as simplex,when they take on public works projects,that they need to pay the prevailing wages mandated by law and the fact that some of simplex contracts did,in fact,contain provisions binding it to pay the prevailing wage.id.at.
while the district court found that simplex had generally agreed to pay prevailing wages in entering into its contracts,it nonetheless held that in light of the uncertainty at the time surrounding testing and inspection work,simplex could not have had reason to believe it would be required to pay prevailing wages for testing and inspection work it contracted to perform.id.at.thus,absent a provision in a particular contract explicitly requiring that testing and inspection work be covered,there was no basis for concluding that simplex had agreed to pay prevailing wages for such work.id.the district court reasoning therefore appeared to be that a general agreement to pay the wages required by the statute applied only to work that was clearly understood by the parties to be covered by the statute at the time the contract was made and not to work subsequently held to be covered.
the plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment against them on the testing and inspection claims.we review that grant de novo.see mullins city of new york,cir.
discussion 
under new york law,the requirement that workers engaged in public works should be paid at prevailing wages reaches back at least to,when article,section of the state constitution was passed.the amendment stated that no worker engaged in the performance of any public work,shall be paid less than the rate of wages prevailing in the same trade or occupation in the locality within the state where such public work is to be situated,erected or used.const.art.
the portion of the nyll at issue here section is,as the district court put it,a codification of that amendment.ramos,d at.section has not changed in any significant way over the course of this litigation,and states that every public works contract must provide that all laborers employed by the contract will be paid prevailing wages.lab.law a.it also furnishes administrative mechanisms to enforce this requirement.id.e.additionally,the new york court of appeals has held that workers may bring common law breach of contract suits as the intended beneficiaries of such public works contracts.see fata healy.
the plaintiffs here pursued the latter course.to prevail in their suit,they need to show,first,that they are laborers,workmen,or mechanics within the meaning of nyll section,a proposition which is not disputed here.see erie county indus.dev.agency roberts,fourth dep t,aff.second,they must show that theirs was covered work that is,work entitled to prevailing wages under the statute.see id.
though the plaintiffs brought their claim to a court rather than to an agency,simplex,during the course of the litigation,turned separately to the dol.the dol,in its december,opinion letter,answered the two very same questions posed above.the dol ruled that simplex employees were workers within the meaning of the statute,and testing and inspection were maintenance functions,which have long been held to be covered by
