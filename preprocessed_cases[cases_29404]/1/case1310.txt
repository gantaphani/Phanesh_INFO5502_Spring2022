in connection with a project to widen dominion boulevard route in the city of chesapeake,virginia,the city took the property of clear sky car wash llc,consisting of a square foot parcel of land on which clear sky operated a car wash.following unsuccessful negotiations with clear sky to purchase the property,the city initiated a quick take proceeding to take the property,pursuant to virginia code and,filing a certificate of take in state court and depositing million with the court as its proffered just compensation.under this procedure,the city was able to take title to the property immediately,leaving the resolution of any dispute over the property valuation to be resolved in condemnation proceedings.
although the state proceedings were pending,clear sky and its principals commenced this action to challenge the city conduct in arriving at its million valuation which clear sky contends was too low in negotiating with clear sky which clear sky alleges was conducted in bad faith and in initiating the quick take proceeding prematurely.it claims that the city conduct violated the mandatory real property acquisition policies set forth in,which are made applicable to state agencies when,as here,federal funds are involved,see id.
on the defendants motions to dismiss,the district court concluded that did not create enforceable rights and dismissed the complaint.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in november,the chesapeake city council passed a resolution approving a project of the virginia department of transportation vdot to widen a portion of dominion boulevard route and to replace the bridge that passes over the southern branch of the elizabeth river.the project was to be funded by the city,the vdot,and the department of transportation usdot and was to be managed by the city.
the project required that various parcels of land be acquired,including the parcel owned by clear sky.the city hired two separate appraisers to determine the value of clear sky parcel,and each appraisal relied on a basis of valuation,without considering comparative values of other pad sites in august,the city transmitted copies of both appraisals to clear sky and stated that it was accepting the appraisal that valued clear sky property at million,the lower of the two.
between august and january,clear sky and the city discussed at length clear sky objections to the city appraisal.according to clear sky,some of the city agents eventually acknowledged problems with the appraisal,agreeing,for example,that its depreciation calculation was incorrect.nonetheless,on january,the city formally offered clear sky the million amount as just compensation for clear sky property,and clear sky rejected the offer.
the city thereafter initiated a quick take proceeding,as authorized by the virginia code,filing a certificate of take in the circuit court for the city of chesapeake on march,and depositing million with the court.clear sky unsuccessfully attempted to remove that proceeding to federal court,see city of chesapeake clear sky car wash llc,wl,and simultaneously commenced this action,naming as defendants the city,several of its employees and agents,the vdot,and the usdot.the complaint alleged that the defendants violated clear sky rights under the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of ura,in pursuing the acquisition of its property.
more particularly,the complaint alleged that in preparing for its taking of clear sky property,the city obtained two appraisals,both of which undervalue d the land by at least million by failing to take into account the value of comparable pad sites.it alleged that the city then used those appraisals to conduct negotiations with clear sky in bad faith,failing to timely provide information in response to clear sky questions and providing information that was largely incomplete and not all truthful.it also alleged that even though the city recognized that the appraisal on which it had chosen to rely included errors in its depreciation calculation and failed to use comparable properties outside the area,the city never addressed these problems and instead stuck with its original appraisal of million.finally,the complaint alleged that the city inappropriately declin ed to discuss settlement,opting instead to file a certificate of take,which prematurely effected a quick take of clear sky property under virginia law.based on the city appraisals,negotiations,and quick take procedures,clear sky alleged that the city,its agents,and its partners violated clear sky rights under and.
relying on these allegations,the complaint set forth six causes of action.count i alleged that the defendants failed to act in compliance with and subject to the mandates of the ura in a number of ways,including by obtaining and using inappropriate appraisals conducting negotiations in bad faith failing to deposit a sufficiently large sum for the taking in court filing their quick take proceeding prematurely and improperly attempting to obtain entry on and possession of the property.count ii alleged that the defendants conduct violated clear sky rights under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.count iii alleged that the conduct violated clear sky rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.count iv alleged that the defendants violated and in denying clear sky its interests in the proper application of the ura.count v alleged a virginia common law claim for breach of contract.and count vi alleged a virginia common law claim for equitable estoppel.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief and demanded damages in a sum not less than million.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,and the district court granted the motions,dismissing the complaint with a memorandum opinion dated december.see clear sky car wash,llc city of chesapeake,d.the court held first that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over count i because it rested on alleged violations of the ura land acquisition policies,as set forth in subchapter iii of the act.citing gonzaga university doe,d,it found that subchapter iii did not create a federal right of action for landowners.to the extent that clear sky might have also been claiming a right to relocation assistance under subchapter ii of the ura,the court likewise concluded that that subchapter created no right of action.in addition,the court noted as to subchapter ii that clear sky had failed to allege that it made even one application for relocation assistance payments and had similarly allege d no facts concerning advisory relocation assistance.clear sky car wash,d at.it thus concluded that although it would generally have jurisdiction to review relocation assistance determinations under the administrative procedure act apa,clear sky had failed to allege a final agency action sufficient to trigger such jurisdiction.id.at based on its conclusion that the ura did not confer privately enforceable rights,the court dismissed counts ii,iii,and iv for failure to state a claim.finally,with respect to counts v and vi,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to a inasmuch as it had dismissed all the federal claims.
from the district court judgment,clear sky filed this appeal,challenging the court ruling that the ura did not create a private right of action and that neither nor the apa provided it with avenues for relief under the ura.
clear sky notes on appeal that the ura requires federal agencies that are acquiring real property to take certain steps to assure consistent treatment for owners and to promote public confidence in federal land acquisition practices,listing ten specific policies that must be followed.because its property was taken in connection with a project funded in part by the united states,clear sky states correctly that made applicable to the city and the vdot as a condition of federal funding.therefore,because these policies were mandated by federal law and imposed on state agencies,clear sky claims that it was entitled to enforce compliance with those policie
