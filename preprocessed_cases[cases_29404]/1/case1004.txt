opinion of the court 
haddrick byrd,a prisoner at sci frackville,filed a pro se complaint under in the middle district of pennsylvania alleging that various pennsylvania department of corrections doc employees violated his eighth amendment rights and were negligent under state law.byrd appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to doc employees stanishefski,jack robinson,and spencer,and the district court refusal to reconsider its order granting a motion to dismiss for doc employees robert shannon and dorina varner.instead of paying a docketing fee on appeal,byrd filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis ifp.for the reasons set forth below,we will deny byrd request to proceed ifp.
at all times material to this appeal,byrd was an inmate at sci frackville.byrd pro se complaint of august,named the following defendants robert shannon,the superintendent of sci frackville stanishefski,the corrections health care administrator at sci frackville jack robinson,the supervising nurse at sci frackville spencer,a nurse at sci frackville and dorina varner,the chief grievance officer for the doc.byrd specifically alleges that these doc employees showed deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by failing to provide him with prescription eye drops for his glaucoma,thus depriving him of his eighth amendment rights and committing negligence under state law.
byrd proceeded ifp in the district court after his application to do so was granted on september.the district court,on february,granted defendants motion to dismiss in part,dismissing shannon and varner.on february,the district court granted the remaining defendants motion for summary judgment.
on april,byrd filed a motion to proceed ifp on appeal.that same day,the clerk office notified byrd that he had three strikes under g and had to file a motion showing that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury in order to be eligible for ifp status.byrd three potential strikes included two cases that were clearly dismissed for failure to state a claim byrd parris,cv,and byrd city of philadelphia,cv.the other potential strike,byrd gillis,cir.july,was an appeal that was dismissed by this court under e b because it was without merit.in response to the notification by the clerk office,byrd did not file a motion alleging imminent danger instead,he submitted a response on april,arguing that the clerk office made a mistake in determining that he had three strikes.byrd noted that,although he brought two prior actions that were dismissed for failure to state a claim,he did not proceed ifp in those actions.
in the january,order appointing amicus curiae,this court instructed amicus to address whether dismissals of actions and appeals can count as strikes under g,or whether only ifp actions and appeals can count as strikes.the court also stated that a micus counsel may wish to address the relevance,if any,of the fact that section e and section g use similar phrasing that varies slightly from the language of.b.
on february,amicus requested to expand the scope of its appointment.specifically,amicus sought leave to address whether this court dismissal of one of byrd previous cases,byrd gillis,ca.cir.july,constituted a strike.on march,this court granted in part and denied in part amicus motion to expand the scope of its representation.the court permitted amicus to argue,with respect to byrd gillis,that when an action is dismissed for a reason that is unclear,that dismissal does not count as a strike.
we have jurisdiction of this matter as an appeal of a final decision in the district court.the district court did not address whether byrd eligibility for ifp status was foreclosed by the three strikes provision of g.we now address this issue as a matter of first impression 
in order to determine byrd ifp eligibility,we must decide whether strikes under g can be accrued in actions or appeals where the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee,or whether strikes can only be accrued in ifp actions or appeals.section g,enacted as a part of the prison litigation reform act of plra,states 
in no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has,on or more prior occasions,while incarcerated or detained in any facility,brought an action or appeal in a court of the united states that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,malicious,or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.
three of our sister courts of appeals have held that strikes may be accrued in actions or appeals regardless of whether the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee or is proceeding ifp.see burghart corr.of,fed.app x,cir hyland clinton,fed.app x,cir duvall miller,cir.no court of appeals has held that strikes may only be accrued in ifp actions or appeals 
this situation presents an issue of statutory interpretation.our task is to give effect to the will of congress,and where congress will has been expressed in language that has a reasonably plain meaning,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.negonsott samuels,d see also caraco pharm,novo nordisk,d we begin where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.if the language of the statute has a reasonably plain meaning,then our sole function is to enforce the statute language.united states ron pair,d.
in determining whether the language of a particular statutory provision has a plain meaning,the language shall be considered in the context of the entire statute.robinson shell oil,d stating that statutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole see also abdul akbar mckelvie,cir en banc interpreting one particular section of the plra,g,in the context of the plra as a whole.the plain meaning of statutory language is not conclusive only when the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters.ron pair,at.
statutory purpose and legislative history may be referenced only if the statutory language is without a plain meaning,if the statutory language is ambiguous.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir.statutory language is ambiguous only where it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.id.quoting passenger atchinson topeka santa fe ry,d.
here,the statutory language has a reasonably plain meaning an action or appeal is not limited to an ifp action or appeal rather,it refers to both ifp and actions or appeals.the three strikes provision,g,does not make an explicit exception for previous actions or appeals where the prisoner was not granted ifp status.see burghart,fed.app x at plaintiff argues that congress did not intend g to apply to prisoners who had not filed their earlier cases ifp.however,g makes no distinction.hyland,fed.app x at section g does not distinguish between prior in forma pauperis actions and prior actions in which the fee was paid.duvall,at section g does not say,brought an action or appeal in forma pauperis,or brought an action or appeal under this section.
we acknowledge that this court,in santana united states,found the phrase civil actions in another part of the plra to lack a plain meaning,cir interpreting b and holding that the filing fee requirements of the plra with regard to civil actions did not apply to ifp habeas corpus petitions and appeals.this court analysis in santana,however,focused on the unique nature of habeas corpus actions.id.at.in contrast to habeas corpus actions,standard actions are not,in effect,hybrid actions whose nature is not adequately captured by the phrase civil action.id.thus,santana does not compel a conclusion that the phrase an action or appeal in g lacks a plain meaning.
the same can be said for grayson mayview state hospital,wherein this court stated that e b,which uses language that closely tracks the three strikes provision of g,is limited to ifp actions or appeals,cir although the language of e does not expressly limit the provision reach to in forma pauperis claims,we believe congress intended it to be so limited.we do not find grayson to be controlling.first,the finding in grayson that e applies only to ifp actions or appeals is dicta it was not necessary to the court holding,which was that the district court was required to grant leave to amend before dismissing a pro se inmate action for failure to state a claim.id.at.second,the grayson court based its finding in part on the fact that any alternative interpretation of e b would render similar provisions of the plra superfluous.id.at citing benson o brian,cir i f all actions,whether pursued in forma pauperis or not,are to be screened by the district court pursuant to e,the specific prisoner complaint screening provision,would be rendered largely superfluous.in contrast to e b,if g were interpreted to encompass actions and appeals,no other provision of the plra,including,would be rendered superfluous.
finally,we acknowledge amicus argument that the language difference between g and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure is instructive as to the meaning of an action or appeal.section g,just like the ifp specific provision,e b,which was the focus of grayson,refers to an action that fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,while rule b refers to an action that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.amicus argues that this contrast between may and can indicates that congress used may in g as a signal to reference e dismissals,which occur only in ifp actions and appeals,as opposed to rule b dismissals,which occur in both ifp and actions.although this argument is of some persuasive effect,it does not render the phrase an action or appeal to be without a plain meaning.the bottom line remains that congress could have easily differentiated between ifp and actions or appeals in the language of g,but it did not.it is more rational to suppose that if congress intended to make an exception for cases in g,then it would have explicitly done so,rather than merely using the word may instead of can.
thus,strikes may be accrued in actions or appeals regardless of whether the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee or is proceeding ifp,and byrd previous actions,which were dismissed for failure to state a claim,count as strikes for purposes of g.because this literal application of the statute will not likely increase the incidence of frivolous suits from prisoners,it will not produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters.ron pair,at.
amicus,in support of byrd,argues that even if actions and appeals can count as strikes,byrd has only two strikes,rather than three,because this court dismissal of byrd appeal in byrd gillis,ca.cir.july,under e b does not constitute a strike.we disagree.
in byrd gillis,byrd brought suit in the middle district of pennsylvania against prison officials in their individual and official capacities for failing to investigate a false misconduct report against him.cv,slip op.at.as a result of the misconduct report,byrd was placed in the restrictive housing unit for days.id.at.byrd alleged that he was subjected to the denial of due process,equal protection under the law,denial of religious practices,retaliation,malfeasance,and misfeasance.id.at.the magistrate granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and concluded that,except for byrd due process claim regarding his misconduct hearing,byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.id.at.in regard to byrd due process claim,the magistrate judge held that byrd placement in the restricted housing unit did not implicate a protected liberty interest under sandin conner,d.id.at.additionally,in regard to byrd official capacity claims,the magistrate judge concluded that the prison officials were immune from suit.id.at.byrd state law claims were held to be barred under the eleventh amendment.id.
on appeal,this court held that the magistrate judge properly granted summary judgment.byrd gillis,ca,slip op.at cir.july.the court explicitly agreed that byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,that the alleged conduct did not implicate a protected liberty interest,and that the eleventh amendment barred byrd state law claims id.at.the court ultimately dismissed the entire appeal under e b because it was without merit.id.at.
section e b provides 
t he court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that the action or appeal i is frivolous or malicious ii fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted or iii seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.
the consideration of whether a dismissal under e b should count as a strike under g sometimes requires an examination of the e b dismissal.this is because e b includes a ground for dismissal defendant immunity from suit that does not qualify as a strike under g,which involves dismissals for actions or appeals that are frivolous,malicious,or fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
we decline to adopt a categorical rule that courts,in dismissing actions and appeals under e b,must precisely indicate that the action or appeal is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted in order for the dismissal to count as a strike under g.instead,we adopt a position similar to that of the court of appeals for the tenth circuit and clarify that when a court dismisses an action or appeal under e b,without more specificity,our determination of whether the dismissal constitutes a strike is not formalistic or mechanical rather,we must consider the nature of the dismissal and whether the dismissal fits within the language of g.hafed fed.bureau of prisons,cir 
our dissenting colleague emphasizes that strikes should not accrue for mixed dismissals,those dismissals that are based in part on a g ground,and in part on other grounds.we agree.in applying this,approach,we consider the nature of the e b dismissal and determine whether the entire dismissal fits within the language of g.see tolbert stevenson,cir section g requires that a prisoner entire action or appeal be dismissed on enumerated grounds in order to count as a strike.
in byrd gillis,in addition to affirming that byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to identify a protected liberty interest,the court agreed with the magistrate judge conclusion that the eleventh amendment barred byrd state law claims.the court,however,did not indicate that it was relying on e b iii concerning immunity to dismiss any part of the appeal.instead,in dismissing the appeal in its entirety,the court stated generally that it was relying on e b because the appeal was without merit.consequently,we must determine whether the dismissal of the appeal under e b because it was without merit fits within the language of g.
in making this determination,we reiterate that a dismissal under e b occurs because the action or appeal is frivolous or malicious fails to state a claim or seeks monetary damages from a defendant who is immune from suit.with regard to an appeal of summary judgment,such as in byrd gillis,the reason for a dismissal under e b is necessarily limited to either the appeal frivolous or malicious nature or the defendant immunity from suit.for the following reasons,we believe that the court dismissal of byrd appeal under e b because it was without merit is appropriately viewed as a dismissal for frivolousness,rather than as a dismissal for suing an immune defendant.
first,the court dismissed the entire appeal as being without merit,and a dismissal based on the appeal frivolous nature addresses the entire appeal,whereas a dismissal based on the defendants immunity addresses only some of byrd claims namely,his state law claims and his claims against the defendants in their official capacities.second,the phrase without merit and similar variations are often associated with the word frivolous in the context of.see deutsch united states,cir finding that a prisoner claim based on an indisputably merit less legal theory may be dismissed as frivolous under emphasis added.this is true in other areas of our jurisprudence as well.for
