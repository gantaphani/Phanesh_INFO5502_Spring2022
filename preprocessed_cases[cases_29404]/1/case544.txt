for nearly a decade,the county of westchester the county or westchester has been engaged in litigation with the united states department of housing and urban development hud or the government over whether the county has adequately analyzed in its applications for hud funds impediments to fair housing within the county jurisdictions 
to receive grants from hud,an applying jurisdiction,like the county,must submit an annual action plan detailing how the jurisdiction will use the grants along with the action plan,the county must certify that it will affirmatively further fair housing affh under hud regulations,this means that the county must conduct an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction an analysis of impediments,or ai and promise to take appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis.
in this appeal,the county challenges final administrative determinations by hud to withhold funds allocated to the county under the community planning and development formula grant programs cpd funds for fiscal years fy,and the county principal argument is that the conditions that hud placed on the allocation of these cpd funds violated the administrative procedure act,apa,and two other statutory provisions and that generally prohibit hud intrusion into local public policy in short,the county asserts that hud repeated rejection of the county ais turned on a factor the substance of local zoning policies that hud was not permitted to consider.
on july,the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge granted motion for summary judgment,holding that hud decision was not arbitrary or capricious and that and did not relieve the county of its obligation to make accurate certifications and to produce adequate ais in order to obtain cpd funds.as to these certifications,the district court concluded that hud acted within its authority in determining that the county ais had failed to assess the impediments to fair housing choice caused by local zoning ordinances or to identify actions the county would take to overcome these impediments.accordingly,the district court held that hud was justified in its conclusion that the county plan would not affirmatively further fair housing,as required by hud regulations and the fair housing act fha 
because we agree that hud withholding of cpd funds did not violate federal law,we affirm the district court judgment of july,we also vacate in part the temporary injunction issued pendente lite by a motions panel of this court on may.hud is authorized to reallocate the county fy funds forthwith.as to the county fy funds,however,hud is directed to delay reallocating those funds until after the county exhausts its right to seek further review of this decision.
background 
in order to understand the current dispute between the county and hud,it is necessary to review the last decade of litigation against the county 
i.the litigation and consent decree 
in april,the anti discrimination center of metro new york the relator filed a qui tam lawsuit alleging that the county violated the false claims by submitting false certifications to hud from to in order to obtain approximately million in housing grants.under the relevant statutes and regulations,the county,as a recipient of hud funds,was required to certify to hud that it would affirmatively further fair housing.the relator alleged that the county certifications were false within the meaning of the false claims act because the county failed to analyze impediments to fair housing or to develop strategies to overcome these impediments,despite certifying to hud that it had done so.
during pretrial proceedings,the district court entered several rulings in favor of the relator.on july,it denied the county motion to dismiss,holding that relator had stated a claim that the county violated the false claims act by falsely certifying that it considered race when evaluating fair housing impediments and corrective actions on february,the district court held that the county certifications to hud were false within the meaning of the false claims act,but it denied the relator motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the county knowledge that the certifications were false was a disputed issue of fact for trial 
on august,the government intervened in the action in place of the relator and,on the same day,presented the district court with a consent decree that all parties including the county agreed to enter 
by settling the case and agreeing to the consent decree,the county avoided the risk of paying treble damages of more than million.instead,the decree obligated the county to pay million to the united states of which million would be credited to the county account with hud and to take numerous steps to further fair housing.most relevant here,the county agreed to spend million of its own funds in addition to the million in its hud account to build units of affordable housing over the following seven years the county was required to 
use all available means as appropriate to achieve the building of the units,including,but not limited to,developing financial or other incentives for other entities to take steps to promote those objectives,and conditioning or withholding the provision of county funds on actions that promote those objectives 
the consent decree anticipated that the county would build these units by leveraging the funds that it is expending pursuant to the consent decree with supplemental funds.moreover,
i n the event that a municipality does not take actions needed to promote the building of the units,or undertakes actions that hinder those objectives,the county shall use all available means as appropriate to address such action or inaction,including,but not limited to,pursuing legal action 
additionally,the consent decree required the county to complete,within days,an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice ai deemed acceptable by hud.the decree specifically required that the ai 
b identify and analyze,inter alia 
i the impediments to fair housing within its jurisdiction,including impediments based on race or municipal resistance to the development of affordable housing and 
ii the appropriate actions the county will take to address and overcome the effects of those impediments 
the county also agreed to promote,through the county executive,legislation to ban discrimination in housing.such legislation prohibits landlords from refusing to rent to a tenant because that tenant income comes from social security benefits or from state or federal public assistance programs,such as section.
finally,the consent decree provided for the appointment of a monitor to oversee compliance,to recommended additional actions needed to ensure compliance,and to assess whether the county has taken all possible actions to meet its obligations including promoting inclusionary and other appropriate zoning by municipalities by offering incentives,and,if necessary,taking legal action.the appointment of the monitor was to last for so long as the county obligations under the consent decree remain unsatisfied.the consent decree also created a dispute resolution process whereby the parties could submit grievances for the monitor to resolve 
ii.litigation 
the august consent decree settled all false claims act charges stemming from the county applications for hud funding from to.since,however,the county has continued to apply for cpd funds.the present dispute concerns hud rejection of the county decree applications for funding.specifically,this litigation concerns hud decision to withhold the county cpd funds for fy,and 
the county first challenged hud withholding of its cpd funds for fy.as noted above,the consent decree required the county to make efforts to ban discrimination.in,the county board of legislators debated a bill to meet this obligation.the county executive at the time,andrew spano,sent letters to advocacy organizations expressing support for the pending bill,and to the leadership of the county board of legislators encouraging them to pass the bill.although the board failed to pass the legislation in,an identical bill was reintroduced in.on june,the board passed a slightly modified version of the bill,but,on june,the newly elected county executive,robert astorino,vetoed it.
under the consent decree,the county revised ai was due on december.after hud granted several of the county extension requests,the county submitted a revised ai on july.on december,hud rejected the revised ai in a letter to the county,in which hud described actions the county could take to make its ai acceptable,including identifying the steps it would take to ban discrimination and to overcome exclusionary zoning practices.in april,having not received a revised ai,hud notified the county that it intended to reject the county fy certification that the county would affirmatively further fair housing.
on july,the county submitted another revised ai,which hud also rejected.by letter dated july,hud rejected the county proposed ai because it did not incorporate the corrective actions that hud had earlier specified,including promotion of legislation or plans to overcome exclusionary zoning practices.hud therefore rejected the county ai and disapproved its fy action plan as substantially incomplete.accordingly,hud officially notified the county that it intended to withhold the funds allocated to the county for fy.
hud withholding of fy funds prompted the referral of two issues to the monitor.on november,the monitor found that the county breached its obligation to promote legislation and the county was required to analyze the effect of zoning ordinances in its ai on december,the county objected to the monitor findings and sought review from magistrate judge gabriel gorenstein.
on march,magistrate judge gorenstein sustained the county objection to the monitor report in part,concluding that the county executive veto of the legislation did not constitute a breach of the consent decree specifically,he held that the county executive obligation to promote the legislation did not obligate the county executive to sign the bill once the board of legislators passed it.
however,magistrate judge gorenstein overruled the county other objections.specifically,the county had challenged the monitor conclusion that the county was required to specify a strategy to overcome exclusionary zoning practices,and to identify the types of zoning practices that would,if not remedied by the municipality,prompt the county to pursue legal action.with respect to these objections,magistrate judge gorenstein ruled in favor of hud,concluding that the county was required to analyze the effect of zoning laws in its ai.accordingly,magistrate judge gorenstein held that the monitor and hud could require the county to explain how it intended to persuade its municipalities to remove exclusionary zoning practices,and what steps it would take if a municipality refused.the county did not appeal this aspect of the magistrate judge ruling 
the united states did,however,appeal his ruling concerning legislation.on may,the district court reversed this aspect of the ruling,agreeing with the monitor that the county executive veto of the legislation was a breach of the consent decree 
on april,we affirmed the may,order of the district court holding that the district court had jurisdiction over enforcement and interpretation of the consent decree the county breached its duty under the consent decree to promote legislation through its county executive the consent decree continued to bind successive elected county officials the unmistakability doctrine did not apply to interpretation of the consent decree the consent decree did not strip the county of any essential attribute of sovereignty and the consent decree did not violate the constitution guarantee clause 
iii.the litigation 
as noted above,the monitor report in november found that the county was required to analyze the effect of zoning ordinances in its ai specifically,the monitor concluded that 
t he county should,at a minimum,assess the impact of each of the following zoning practices or explain why the analysis of the listed practices would not be helpful to understanding the impact of the zoning ordinances taken as a whole 
restrictions that limit or prohibit multifamily housing development 
limitations on the size of a development 
limitations directed at section or other affordable housing,including limitations on such developments in a municipality 
restrictions that directly or indirectly limit the number of bedrooms in a unit 
restrictions on lot size or other density requirements that encourage housing or restrict multifamily housing and 
limitations on townhouse development 
after the monitor issued his report in november and while litigation before the district court and this court was pending the county submitted a series of zoning analyses to hud,all of which were rejected.specifically,hud informed the county that,in its view,the county submissions contained flawed data analysis,failed to address whether zoning practices were exclusionary under state and federal law,and lacked adequate strategies for bringing about changes to problematic zoning practices in some of the county municipalities.
on march,hud notified the county that it intended to reallocate the million it had withheld in fy funds because the congressional appropriation for these funds was set to expire on september,hud gave the county until april,to submit an acceptable ai and action plan to address exclusionary zoning.
one day before this deadline,the county submitted a revised ai and filed suit against hud in federal court,asserting that hud denial of the county cpd funds for fy was a violation of the apa and as relief,the county requested that the court enjoin hud reallocation of the county fy grant funds declare that hud rejection of its fy ai and action plan violated the apa and and order hud to approve the county fy submission for cpd funds 
on august,judge cote granted hud motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.as to the apa claims,the district court ruled that hud rejection of the county submissions was an act committed to agency discretion by law,see a,and thus not subject to judicial review the district court also concluded that the county failed to state a claim under 
on february,we affirmed the dismissal as moot of claims relating to funds that had been reallocated to other jurisdictions,but vacated the district court dismissal of claims relating to funds exclusively under the home program that had not yet been reallocated we concluded that the district court erred in dismissing the county apa claims as to these funds,because the statutes governing hud administration of the home program provided meaningful standards against which to judge hud exercise of discretion and,thus,hud actions were not committed to agency discretion by law and could be reviewed by the courts.accordingly,we affirmed the district court order of dismissal insofar as it dismissed as moot claims for funds that had been reallocated to other jurisdictions,vacated the order insofar as it dismissed claims for the remaining in home funds that had not been reallocated,and remanded the cause to the district court for further proceedings.
iv.the monitor zoning analysis 
while proceedings concerning the fy funds were pending,the monitor prepared two reports on the impact of zoning laws in westchester county 
the first of these reports,filed on september,analyzed the zoning codes of the municipalities in the county under state and federal law applying berenson town of new castle,and huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir,aff in part.the berenson standard considers whether zoning practices are exclusionary based on socioeconomic status the federal huntington standard considers whether facially neutral zoning laws have a discriminatory impact on racial and ethnic minorities 
in its various ais submitted to hud,the county concluded that there was no evidence of exclusionary zoning in any of the eligible municipalities in westchester county hud concluded that these ais were inadequate for various reasons,including that they used inaccurate data,conducted flawed analysis concerning whether zoning laws within the county were exclusionary,and failed to propose strategies for overcoming exclusionary zoning laws in certain municipalities.
the purpose of the monitor report was to assess whether the county was correct that none of its eligible communities had exclusionary zoning laws,or whether hud was correct that the county analysis was flawed,inaccurate,and incomplete.the monitor concluded 
out of municipalities provide opportunities to develop affordable housing and four of these municipalities have zoning codes that provide sufficient opportunities for affordable housing to meet regional need and are exemplary in terms of their efforts to provide opportunities for affordable housing.seven municipalities,however,have restrictions on multifamily housing and other sources of affordable housing that would meet the definition of exclusionary under the berenson line of cases.additionally,some municipalities,whether likely to be deemed exclusionary under berenson or not,have evidence that limitations on multifamily zoning might have a disparate impact on certain minority groups,suggesting that they might be deemed exclusionary under huntington.therefore,the county conclusion that exclusionary zoning does not exist anywhere in westchester is not supported by its own data 
the seven municipalities that the monitor concluded had zoning ordinances that limited affordable housing or made the development of affordable housing practically infeasible were croton on hudson,harrison,lewisboro,mamaroneck,ossining,pelham manor,and pound ridge after the report was issued,however,each of these municipalities met with the monitor,and three of them mamaroneck,ossining,and pound ridge were removed from the list.as the monitor later explained,mamaroneck adopted the model zoning ordinance,expanded the allowance of multifamily housing,and approved the construction of ten affordable housing units.ossining and pound ridge also made considerable progress in reforming their zoning codes to expand opportunities for the development of affordable housing.
on september,the monitor issued another report the report had mostly analyzed whether the jurisdiction zoning codes were socioeconomically exclusionary under berenson.the report focused on whether the jurisdiction zoning codes had a discriminatory impact on racial and ethnic minorities under huntington.the monitor concluded 
of the eligible municipalities,municipalities neither perpetuated racial and ethnic clustering by restricting multifamily or affordable housing to districts with a disproportionately large minority population nor disparately impacted the countywide minority household population by restricting the development of housing that minority residents disproportionately use in violation of the huntington standard.
prima facie evidence of huntington violations did exist,however,with respect to six municipalities.the evidence shows that these municipalities either restricted multi or housing development to districts with disproportionately high minority household populations or restricted the development of housing types disproportionately used by minorities.the next step for these municipalities is to present evidence that,despite the impact on minority residents,their zoning ordinances were furthering a legitimate,substantial governmental interest and no alternative would achieve that interest with less discriminatory effect.the m onitor looks forward to engaging with these six municipalities in the future.
the six municipalities that the monitor concluded had zoning codes that were presumptively exclusionary under huntington were harrison,larchmont,lewisboro,north castle,pelham manor,and rye brook 
on october,the government sent a letter to the monitor with a copy sent to the county which stated that the county adoption of the monitor and reports would satisfy its obligation to submit an acceptable ai specifically,the government stated that the submission of these reports would satisfy the county obligation to identify zoning ordinances that act as impediments to fair housing,as required by the consent decree,b and b,c.a,and by hud fair housing planning guide.
the county declined to adopt the monitor reports or to incorporate any of the findings of the reports into its own future ais.
v.this case 
on february,hud advised the county that its failure to receive a grant for fy had resulted in the termination of its qualification as a community development block grant cdbg urban county and home participating jurisdiction,and that until it requalified,it was ineligible to receive cpd funds this termination also affected the remainder of the county fy and fy funds under the cdbg and home programs,and hud advised the county that it would proceed to reallocate these funds as well the county total allocation for fy and fy was approximately million.
on may,the county informed hud that it would not be seeking requalification under the cpd programs for the fy to fy period.see wl at.
on march,the county filed its second lawsuit,which primarily sought to enjoin the reallocation of fy and fy cpd funds the case was deemed related to the litigation and assigned to judge cote.
on march,hud informed the county that its fy and fy cpd funds could be obligated to other jurisdictions as early as april,that same day,the county filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent hud from disbursing the county cpd funds for fy and fy to other jurisdictions on march,the district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction from the bench,concluding that the county had failed to establish irreparable harm or likelihood of success on the merits.the district court ordered an expedited schedule for the underlying merits litigation,whereby the parties would submit their for summary judgment by may.
on march,the county appealed the district court denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction.on april,the county filed a motion with this court for an injunction pending appeal and for a temporary restraining order tro.on april,this court granted the county request for a tro pending resolution of its motion on may,a motions panel of this court granted the county motion and enjoined hud from obligating the fy or fy funds at issue during the pendency of the county appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction 
on july,while the county appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction was pending,the district court resolved the case on the merits,granting hud motion for summary judgment and dismissing the county complaints in their entirety because both sides agreed that this final judgment mooted the county appeal,we dismissed that appeal,but left in place an injunction pending resolution of the appeal from the district court july,final judgment this appeal then followed.
discussion 
the broader dispute between the county and hud implicates many questions.beyond prohibiting direct discrimination based on race or other protected categories,what must a jurisdiction do to affirmatively further fair housing what is the difference,if any,between furthering fair housing and furthering affordable housing how much control may hud exert over local policies,which,in its view,impede the creation of fair or affordable housing and if conflicts of this sort between hud and local governments are to be avoided,is the simplest solution to avoid applying for federal funds in the first place 
this appeal,however,presents a much narrower question may hud reject a jurisdiction application for funding because it determines that the jurisdiction analysis of impediments fails to adequately consider the potential exclusionary impact of the jurisdiction zoning laws because the answer to this narrow question is yes,we affirm the district court judgment.
in the sections that follow,we first describe the relevant statutory requirements and then analyze the county challenge to hud action under the apa and and 
statutory framework 
the county challenges hud withholding of community planning and development formula grant program cpd funds distributed under three different programs the community development block grant cdbg program,the emergency solutions grant esg program,and the home investment partnerships program home.the authorizing statutes for these three programs incorporate the fair housing act by reference.
the cdbg program was established under the housing and development act of to promote the development of viable urban communities,by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities,principally for persons of low and moderate income.jurisdictions applying for cdbg grants must certify to the satisfaction of the secretary that they meet six criteria as relevant here,applicants must certify that the grant will be conducted and administered in conformity with the civil rights act of and the fair housing act,and that the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.
the esg program was initially authorized as the emergency shelter grants program by the stewart mckinney homeless assistance act of,but was modified to its current form by the homeless emergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act of the principal purpose of the program is to provide funds for programs to assist the homeless,with special emphasis on elderly persons,handicapped persons,families with children,native americans,and veterans.although the esg program does not have any independent certification requirements,a grantee may only receive esg funds if it also receives funds under the cdbg program accordingly,eligibility for esg also turns on certifying that a grantee will affirmatively further fair housing.
finally,funding under the home program is allocated under the cranston gonzalez national affordable housing act of the objective of home grants is to improve housing opportunities for all residents of the united states,particularly members of disadvantaged minorities,on a nondiscriminatory basis.like cdbg and esg applicants,home applicants must certify that the jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing.
each of these grant programs requires an applying jurisdiction to submit to hud a comprehensive housing affordability strategy in accordance with section b lists twenty components of a housing strategy,two of which are relevant here.first,b requires grantees to 
explain whether the cost of housing or the incentives to develop,maintain,or improve affordable housing in the jurisdiction are affected by public policies,particularly by policies of the jurisdiction,including tax policies affecting land and other property,land use controls,zoning ordinances,building codes,fees and charges,growth limits,and policies that affect the return on residential investment,and describe the jurisdiction strategy to remove or ameliorate negative effects,if any,of such policies 
second,grantees must certify that the jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing.
the requirement to affirmatively further fair housing is identical under home and cdbg and,by extension,esg the certification that a jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing is a written assertion,based on supporting evidence,that will be deemed to be accurate unless the secretary determines otherwise after inspecting the evidence and providing due notice and opportunity for comment.by regulation,the mandate to affirmatively further fair housing requires the grantee to conduct an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction,take appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis,and maintain records reflecting the analysis and actions in this regard.moreover,grantees under all three programs must recertify each year that they are fulfilling their obligation to affirmatively further fair housing.
ii.hud action did not violate federal law 
in this case,hud determined that the ais submitted by the county in support of its applications for fy,and funds were inadequate,because they failed to accurately analyze impediments to fair housing,including certain zoning laws.accordingly,hud rejected the county certification that it would affirmatively further fair housing,and withheld the county funds under all three programs 
the county asserts that hud decision to withhold these funds violated the apa and two other statutory provisions and.we address each claim in turn 
under the apa,a reviewing court must uphold agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.under this deferential standard of review,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.the scope of review under this standard is narrow because a court must be reluctant to reverse results supported by a weight of considered and carefully articulated expert opinion.an agency decision will thus only be set aside if it 
has relied on factors which congress had not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise 
the relevant agency action here was hud decision to reject the county ais for fy,and,and to withhold the cpd funds allocated to the county for all three years.before when the qui tam action was filed hud had for decades approved the county applications for cpd funds without any objection.however,once the district court ruled,in connection with the qui tam case,that hud submissions were false as a matter of law,the county unexpectedly faced the prospect of severe financial penalties more than million.the county executive at the time chose to settle the case and to sign the consent decree.
but nothing in that consent decree purports to give hud authority to impose conditions on the county future cpd grant applications beyond those governing all applicants under the relevant statutes and regulations.rather,as discussed at notes to,ante,and accompanying text,the consent decree largely involves a promise to construct new affordable housing units and a series of promises peripheral to that goal.the county also promised to submit an adequate ai within days of the consent decree,and failure to do so could,therefore,constitute both a breach of the consent decree and grounds for rejection of its future cpd grant applications.but many of the promises the county made in the consent decree,such as the promise to promote legislation,are independent of the requirements for cpd grant eligibility.to the extent hud has identified the county failure to satisfy these independent requirements to support its rejection of county grant applications hud may well have overstepped the bounds of its statutory authority.
that said,we need not definitively decide whether,or to what degree,hud may have overstepped statutory grounds in denying county grant applications,because hud has consistently explained that its primary justification for such rejections has been that the county ais contained inadequate analysis and reached conclusions that no municipality zoning laws are exclusionary under state or federal law unsupported by the record.
we are obliged under the apa to uphold agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.and we agree with the district court that hud decision to reject the ais associated with the county applications for fy,and funds did not rise to such a level.because exclusionary zoning can violate the fha and because hud is required to further the policies of that statute it was reasonable for hud to require the county to include in its ai an analysis of its municipalities zoning laws.moreover,in concluding that the county zoning analysis was flawed and incomplete,hud reasonably relied on detailed reports from the monitor,which examined the relevant laws and analyzed the empirical data,and which refuted the county conclusion that no municipality had ordinances that were exclusionary under state or federal law.whenever hud rejected an ai submitted by the county,it provided a written explanation grounded in the evidentiary record,and it gave the county multiple opportunities to make changes and to resubmit a revised ai we therefore conclude that hud decision to withhold and then reallocate the county cpd funds was neither arbitrary nor capricious within the meaning of the apa.
accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment insofar as it dismissed the claim that hud action violated the apa.
sections and 
the county arguments under and fare no better.these two provisions generally preclude hud from requiring a jurisdiction to change its local policies including its zoning laws in order to qualify for cpd funding.according to the county,hud decision to withhold the cpd funds at issue was a thinly veiled attempt to induce the county to force its municipalities to change their zoning laws.specifically,the county claims that two demands by hud were improper that the county change the conclusions in its ais concerning the exclusionary impact of municipal zoning laws and that its ais identify the steps the county would take to ensure its municipalities changed any exclusionary zoning laws.
under c,hud may only disapprove of the housing strategy of an applying jurisdiction if it concludes that 
a the housing strategy is inconsistent with the purposes of the act,or 
b the information described in subsection b of this section has not been provided in a substantially complete manner.for the purpose of the preceding sentence,the adoption or continuation of a public policy identified pursuant to subsection b of this section shall not be a basis for the secretary disapproval of a housing strategy 
the paragraph,b,requires grantees housing strategies to explain how certain factors,including zoning ordinances,affect the cost of housing or the incentives to develop,maintain,or improve affordable housing in the jurisdiction.
section c thus provides that the continuation or adoption of local zoning ordinances may not form the basis for hud disapproval of a jurisdiction housing strategy.section similarly prohibits hud from denying funds based on the adoption,continuation,or discontinuation by a jurisdiction of any public policy,regulation,or law that is adopted,continued,or discontinued in accordance with the jurisdiction duly established authority,and not in violation of any federal law.
the county is therefore correct that hud may not under either or condition funding on changes to local policies,including zoning laws.but that is not what hud did here.hud did not at any point tell the county that its cpd funds would only be released if certain municipalities in the county changed their zoning laws.instead,hud required the county to assess and analyze whether certain zoning laws in the jurisdiction impeded fair housing and,if so,to identify a plan to overcome the effects of such impediments.as the supreme court recently stated,challenges to zoning laws and other housing restrictions that function unfairly to exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without any sufficient justification reside at the heartland of fair housing liability.no federal law requires hud to accept a jurisdiction ai,particularly if hud concludes that the analysis on which the ai is based is unreliable or methodologically unsound.rather,the statute requires that a jurisdiction certification to hud be accurate and based on supporting evidence,and hud is permitted to reject a housing strategy as substantially incomplete if it decides that the ai and the associated certification are flawed or inaccurate 
here,hud rejected the county ai because the county reached the same boilerplate conclusion for every municipality namely,that the local zoning laws did not have a disparate impact on minorities and did not pose an impediment to affirmatively furthering fair housing with respect to race.hud determined that this repetitive conclusion for each municipality was not supported by the available data and did not reflect an adequate disparate impact analysis,because,
a s the county itself acknowledges,restrictive practices exist in these municipalities that have the effect of limiting the availability of affordable housing.such limitations may in fact have an exclusionary effect based on race,national origin,or familial status,which the data supports.the county refusal to acknowledge any connection between zoning restrictions that affect the availability and location of affordable housing and fair housing protections directly challenges the court rulings on the matter and the consent decree itself.hud therefore can not accept the county zoning submission.thus,the county ai remains unacceptable 
as hud made clear in this letter,the basis for its rejection of the county ai was not that the county municipalities failed to change their zoning laws.it was that hud determined based on its own review of the laws and the data,as well as the monitor reports that the county zoning analysis was flawed,inaccurate,and incomplete.because hud did not deny cpd funds to the county based on the adoption,continuation or discontinuation of a zoning ordinance by any municipality,it did not violate either or 
once a jurisdiction requests cpd funds,hud may require the jurisdiction to analyze how the zoning laws of its municipalities may impede the overall effort to affirmatively further fair housing.to the extent that the analysis identifies such laws as impediments to fair housing,hud may also require that the jurisdiction develop a strategy to overcome the effects of those impediments.had the county undertaken an adequate analysis of impediments to fair housing that identified certain zoning ordinances as problematic,the county may well have been able to design a strategy to overcome the negative effects of those ordinances short of seeking full repeal,though we need not decide the point here.in any event,it is well settled that congress may further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.and if a party objects to a condition on the receipt of federal funding,its recourse is to decline the funds.as the supreme court stated in a different context,the receipt of federal funds is a consensual matter the grantee weighs the benefits and burdens before accepting the funds and agreeing to comply with the conditions attached to their receipt.
here,congress has charged hud with using its grant programs to eradicate practices such as exclusionary zoning that are contrary to the advancement of what its governing statutes and regulations define as fair housing.as a condition for the distribution of millions of dollars in cpd funds,hud required the county to analyze whether the zoning laws in some of its municipalities were exclusionary and,if so,to develop a plan to encourage these municipalities to change their laws.when the county did not comply to hud satisfaction,hud withheld the county funding.we agree with the district court that this decision did not violate either or.
in urging otherwise,the county argues that hud was required to approve its ai because it was substantially complete.under c,hud must approve an otherwise acceptable housing strategy within days of receipt so long as it is substantially complete.however,hud has the authority to disapprove a plan or a portion of a plan if it is substantially incomplete,and an example of such a plan is one for which a certification is rejected by hud as inaccurate,after hud has inspected the evidence and provided due notice and opportunity to the jurisdiction for comment.because we agree with the district court that hud had sufficient grounds to conclude that the county housing strategy was substantially incomplete,we reject the county claim that hud violated c in this regard.
nor are we persuaded by the county argument that the four special assurances hud requested from the county in its august,and july,letters violated or while these requested promises did include commitments to adopt the monitor conclusions that certain municipalities had exclusionary zoning ordinances,and to seek removal of those ordinances,including through litigation if necessary,the county refusal to satisfy the special assurances was not the basis for hud withholding of cpd funds.rather,hud had already denied the county grant applications based on the inadequate analysis discussed above and was facing imminent deadlines to reallocate the funds at issue before the relevant appropriations expired.thus,to assist the county in meeting application requirements before these hard deadlines,hud stated that if the county agreed to the special assurances,hud would approve the county application.we do not understand hud to have required the special assurances as a necessary condition of obtaining cpd funds.rather,hud offered the special assurances as a possible avenue by which the county could satisfy the grant requirements.thus,because hud does not appear to have conditioned the county cpd funds on the county agreement to the special assurances,we conclude that hud did not violate or by proposing them.we need not address the counterfactual question of whether hud would have violated those statutory provisions if it had conditioned the county cpd funds on these assurances.
accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment insofar as it dismissed the county claim that hud action violated and.
conclusion 
this case resolves a narrow question may hud require a jurisdiction that applies for cpd funding to analyze whether local zoning laws will impede the jurisdiction mandate to affirmatively further fair housing because hud may impose such a requirement on jurisdictions that apply for cpd funds,and because the decision to withhold westchester county cpd funds in this case was not arbitrary or capricious,we conclude that hud action complied with federal law.
it bears emphasizing that this decision does not mean that any of westchester county municipalities violated the fair housing act or engaged in discrimination on the basis of race.we merely conclude that hud decision in the context of providing federal funds to require the county to redo its zoning analysis and to develop strategies to overcome impediments to fair housing did not violate federal law.in short,there has been no finding,at any point,that westchester actually engaged in housing discrimination.
as a consequence of this decision,hud is authorized to reallocate westchester cpd funds for fy and,eventually,for fy,and to continue withholding the roughly in funds remaining for fy.as noted above,the county has indicated that it will no longer seek cpd funds for fy to fy.in response to an order we issued on august,the government stated that the county decision not to apply for future funds does not affect any continuing obligations under the consent decree,including the requirement that the county submit an ai deemed acceptable by hud we leave for future litigation the question of how hud can enforce the consent decree against the county,now that the county no longer plans to seek additional federal funds.we also leave it to the district court in a future case to consider what steps the county can or must take to end further supervision over its housing policies,pursuant to this consent decree.in so doing,the district court should be mindful of the teaching of the supreme court that courts should apply a flexible standard to deciding whether a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of a consent decree,as well as our recent observation in another context that a t some point in time this litigation has to be ended.
in sum,we affirm the district court judgment of july,and vacate in part the temporary injunction issued pendente lite by a motions panel of this court on may.
hud is authorized to reallocate the county fy funds forthwith.as to the county fy funds,however,hud is directed to delay reallocating those funds until after the county exhausts its right to seek further review of this decision.

see.hud has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing cpd grant application requirements.see affirmatively furthering fair housing.july,to be codified at c.pts.but as those amendments do not apply to the dispute here at issue,all citations to the relevant regulations refer to the versions in effect prior to the amendments.

the county first lawsuit,cty.of westchester dep t of hous.urban,civ.dlc filed,addressed only fy cpd funds.the county second lawsuit,cty.of westchester dep t of hous.urban,civ dlc filed,addressed fy,and cpd funds.the two lawsuits were consolidated on april,and resolved by the district court in the same final judgment,which is the subject of this appeal.see wl,at.because the fy funds were already reallocated to other jurisdictions,the county claims as to these funds are moot.see id.at.
the county also stated claims under the fifth amendment to the constitution,but it has not pursued them on appeal.

due to the pending expiration of some of these funds,this appeal was resolved on an expedited basis.as noted above,the county seeks review of hud decision to withhold cpd funds for fy,and.the fy funds have already been reallocated to other jurisdictions.see note,congressional appropriation for the fy funds expired on september.see department of defense and full year continuing appropriations act,div.b,title i,stat,carrying forward previous appropriations bill limitation that cpd funds are available to be allocated for two years after the designated fiscal year.these funds,therefore,may not be reallocated to other jurisdictions,but they remain available to the county until september.see a,a cty.of westchester dep t of hous.urban,cir explaining that after an appropriation expires,unallocated funds remain in an expired account,where they will retain their fiscal year identity for that appropriation for an additional five fiscal years quoting gov t accountability office,principles of federal appropriations law gao redbook,ed ellipsis in original.accordingly,because some of the fy funds remain available to satisfy obligations to the county,the pending dispute over these funds is not moot.see note,post noting that a total of remains from the county fy allocation.the congressional appropriation for the fy funds expires on september.see consolidated and further continuing appropriations act,div.f,title i,stat.until then,hud is able to reallocate the funds,which,according to hud,total approximately million.we have therefore sought to resolve this case expeditiously,in order to give hud the flexibility if it prevailed to reallocate the fy funds to other,the congressional appropriation for the fy funds expires on september.see consolidated appropriations act,div.l,title,stat.therefore,if hud wishes to reallocate these funds also totaling approximately million it must do so before that date.as noted above and below,hud is directed not to reallocate the fy funds until the county exhausts its right to seek further review of this decision.
the federal government contentious relationship with westchester county goes back several decades.in december,the united states filed suit against the city of yonkers which is located in westchester county as well as the yonkers community development agency cda and the yonkers board of education board,alleging that they intentionally selected subsidized housing sites in a manner that perpetuated residential racial segregation,which,in turn,caused and perpetuated school segregation.in june,after the yonkers branch of the naacp and one named plaintiff intervened on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,the case was certified as a class action.a month liability trial was held before judge leonard sand of the southern district of new york in and.witnesses testified over the course of trial days,and the court received into evidence the depositions of additional witnesses and thousands of november,judge sand found the city and cda liable for housing segregation and the city and board liable for school segregation.see united states yonkers bd.of.following a series of remedial hearings,the district court ordered the city to undertake several actions,including providing sites for units of public housing in areas,and reallocating federal housing grants towards fostering the development of low and housing.the defendants appealed the judgment,and in,our court concluded that the district court properly applied the appropriate legal principles,that its findings of fact were not clearly erroneous,and that its remedial orders were within the proper bounds of discretion.see united states yonkers bd.of,cir.accordingly,we affirmed the district court judgment in all july,the district court approved a settlement agreement that ended its supervision over implementing these remedial orders.see civ.lbs,dkt.july.

the unmistakability doctrine is a rule of contract construction that provides that in a contract with a sovereign government,an ambiguous term of a grant or contract will not be construed as a conveyance or surrender of sovereign power.united states winstar.we held that the unmistakability doctrine of contract construction did not apply to the interpretation of the consent decree,because the decree unambiguously required the county to encourage passage of the legislation,which necessarily precluded the county executive veto of a bill passed by county board.at.because the county expressly agreed to take specific action related to this legislation,the county was not incidentally disabled from undertaking any sovereign acts.id.
the guarantee clause,const.art.iv,states that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government.we held that the county claim under the guarantee clause was a nonjusticiable political question and,even if it was not,that the county failed to present any evidence that it was deprived of a republican form of government.see at.
