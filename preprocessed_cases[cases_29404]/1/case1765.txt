an agency is not entitled to deference simply because it is an agency.it is true that agencies are more specialized than courts are.but for courts to defer to them,agencies must do more than announce the fact of their comparative advantage they must actually use it.and that means,among many other things,that the agency must than relevant statutory and regulatory criteria.
kurt meister,a michigan attorney appearing pro se,argues that the united states forest service disregarded the relevant criteria here.specifically,he claims that the service failed to comply with several of its own regulations and one federal statute in developing its management plan for the national forests in northern michigan.for the most part,we agree with him and to that extent we reverse the district court entry of judgment in the service favor and remand the case so that the service may comply with those requirements forthwith.
this case concerns the service management of recreational activities in the national forests the forests or forest.the forests occupy about acres on each side of the northern of michigan lower peninsula.in the east,the huron national forest ranges between and miles long from north to south,and stretches miles wide from west to east,reaching the shores of lake huron.in the west,the manistee national forest is about miles long and miles wide,reaching lake michigan near manistee.the forests serve a variety of interests,including recreation,timber harvesting,and wildlife habitat.they lie within a drive of million residents of michigan,and draw visitors from beyond the state.although technically separate,the forests have been managed as a single unit since.
every national forest is subject to a land and resource management plan.a.the national forest management act requires each forest plan to be revised every fifteen years,id.f,but in practice the interval often stretches to twenty.developing a plan is a formidable process the service must develop its management plans in conjunction with coordinated planning by a interdisciplinary team,extensive public participation and comment,and related efforts of other federal agencies,state and local governments,and indian tribes.sierra club marita,cir citing.the service own regulations prescribe in great detail the procedures the service must follow in developing a forest plan.those regulations make clear,as the service itself states in this appeal,that the service must balance competing uses of the forests.see a,b e.we cite the version of the regulations throughout,which is what the service used in developing the plan.under the national environmental policy act,the service must also discuss a range of alternative plans and assess the environmental impact of the alternative that it proposes to adopt.c i,iii.
once the development process is complete,a proposed final plan and final environmental impact statement are sent to the regional forester,who directs one of four national forest regions,for review.marita,at.if the regional forester approves the plan and the impact statement,he issues both documents along with a record of decision explaining his reasoning.the approved plan and impact statement may be appealed to the chief of the forest service,whose ruling becomes a final administrative decision if the secretary of agriculture chooses not to review it.d.
the service issued a management plan for the forests in.in,the service published a notice of intent to revise the plan.the service thereafter held public meetings and solicited public comments as to how to revise the plan.in,the service published a draft environmental impact statement that described three alternative plans and designated a preferred one.after receiving additional public comments for three months,the service prepared a final plan the plan and a final environmental impact statement for the forests.in a record of decision dated march,the responsible regional forester approved both documents.see.
meister commented on the plan throughout its development.those comments reveal fluency with the language of the relevant statutes and regulations and they explained in considerable detail why meister thought the service was not meeting its obligations under the law.his principal comment was that,in developing the plan,the service had disregarded certain processes prescribed in its own regulations,so as to favor gun hunters and snowmobile users over other example,hikers and use the forests for quiet,solitary activities.he also commented that the service should close more areas of the forests to motorized activity than the service seemed likely to close in the plan.it appears that the service disagreed with all of meister comments.
meister thereafter appealed the plan administratively.the service chief issued a decision that upheld the plan in all but one respect the service was prohibited from expanding snowmobiling to all open,unplowed roads in the forests.the secretary of agriculture declined to review the reviewing officer decision.
meister then filed suit in the district court,challenging the plan under the administrative procedures act.see.he and the service each filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted the service motion,holding in general terms that the service had complied with the applicable regulations.the district court denied meister motion.
this appeal followed.
the service does not argue before us that meister lacks standing to assert his claims.but standing and ripeness have proved uncertain in cases like this one.see,ohio forestry ass n,sierra club.so we pause to address those issues here.
standing has three elements.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.second,the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.id.internal alterations omitted.third,it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.
the supreme court has held that environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,internal quotation marks omitted.here,meister alleges that he uses the forests and that the service failures to follow certain procedures in developing the plan have resulted in more widespread gun hunting and snowmobile usage than there would be had the service complied with the procedures.consequently,meister contends,the service failures have substantially diminishe d plaintiff walking,hiking,mountain biking,kayaking,cross country skiing,and snowshoeing experiences in the forests.per friends of the earth,that contention states an injury in fact.
there remains the question of ripeness.the doctrine seeks avoidance of premature adjudication and,in cases involving challenges to agency action,ripeness depends on whether the administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.ohio forestry,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in ohio forestry,the sierra club sought to challenge provisions of a plan that designated certain areas as open to logging.the supreme court did not question that the aesthetic harm alleged by the club would amount to an injury in fact.but the court observed that the plan itself does not give anyone a legal right to cut trees,nor does it abolish anyone legal authority to object to trees being cut.id.at.to the contrary,additional agency,issuance of a required before anyone could engage in the logging that the sierra club said would harm its interests.thus,the court held,the plan had not yet inflict ed significant practical harm upon the interests that the sierra club advance id.hence the case was not ripe.
meister case is different.unlike logging,the activities about which meister hunting and snowmobile not require further action by the service before they can occur.to the contrary,they have in fact occurred ever since the plan issuance,with the resultant harms that meister now alleges.thus,the plan itself has harmed him in concrete ways.his claims are ripe.
we turn next to our standard of review.as an initial matter,we do not defer to the district court decision,but instead review the administrative decision as if we were the first reviewing court.schuck frank,cir.our review of the agency decision is governed by the administrative procedure act.the apa relevant section provides in relevant part 
the reviewing court shall 
hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or 
d without observance of procedure required by law.
meister claims arise in part under d,since he contends that the service failed to follow certain procedures in implementing the plan.under that subsection we review agency action de novo.coalition for gov t procurement fed.prison,cir.but even in cases arising under d,our review as a practical matter is often more deferential than that.the reason is that the question whether a certain procedure is required in a particular circumstance,or whether a certain methodology satisfies the procedure,is often left to the agency discretion.see,save our cumberland mountains kempthorne,cir stating that we review an agency decision that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared,under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard hughes river watershed conservancy johnson,cir a gencies are entitled to select their own methodology as long as that methodology is reasonable.so even in cases arising under d,the standard frequently governs.
meister claims also arise to some extent under a,since he contends that certain aspects of the plan were arbitrary.as a general matter,agency action is arbitrary or capricious if 
the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

applying these standards,we turn to the merits of meister claims.
it is an elemental principle of administrative law that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations.wilson comm r of soc,cir.meister claims that the forest service violated three of its own procedural regulations in developing the plan.
meister first claims that the forest service failed to comply with a of its regulations when it developed the plan.that subsection provides 
a forest planning shall identify 
the recreational preferences of user groups and the settings needed to provide quality recreation opportunities.
the parties disagree about what this provision means.the forest service reads recreational preferences to mean activities,so that this regulation requires essentially,a analysis.gov t br.at.under this interpretation,the service must estimate the demand for various activities in the,camping,skiing,and then assess the quantity of forest lands needed to meet the demand for each activity.
meister disagrees,arguing that a different provision,b,requires a analysis.it does,but of a type not relevant,for developed recreational facilities.under meister interpretation,the identification required by subsection a would lay the foundation for a analysis,rather than constitute the analysis itself.specifically,he reads recreational preferences of user groups to mean not the users preferred activities themselves,but rather what those users seek to obtain from those activities as,for example,skiers desire a quiet recreation experience.meister reply at.so in meister view,the service must determine the kinds of physical settings in which various users would prefer to engage in their activities,rather than merely the settings in which those activities can occur.thus,for example,the service should determine that skiers,for a variety of reasons,do not want their trails located in close proximity to snowmobile trails.meister ultimate concern seems to be that the service interpretation allows it to consider subjectively unsatisfactory settings,rather than the users preferred ones,in determining whether an adequate supply of forest lands exists for a particular activity.
we defer to an agency plausible interpretation of its own regulation.auer robbins.recreational preferences,as used in a,can just as easily be read to mean the activities that users prefer,as it can the physical settings in which they prefer to do them.and though not as easily,settings needed can be read to mean the quantity of lands necessary to support an activity.so the service interpretation of this subsection lies within its discretion and thus the subsection does require essentially a analysis.but the question remains supply of what the regulation provides a straightforward answer the supply of lands needed to provide quality recreation opportunities.a emphasis added.it is not enough,therefore,for the service merely to identify the supply of lands on which an activity can occur.it must instead identify the supply of lands on which participants in that activity are afforded a quality recreation opportunit so meister has a point after all.
with this interpretation in hand,we consider the substance of meister claim.he has two complaints.first,he says the service failed to identify the settings needed to provide quality recreation opportunities for hikers,backpackers,and skiers.meister br.at.the service responds that a methodology it calls the recreation opportunity spectrum ros accomplishes that identification for those activities and many more.the ros classifies forest lands into seven types,depending on their degree of development.the classifications are primitive,semiprimitive nonmotorized,semiprimitive motorized,roaded natural,rural,and urban.ros users guide at.the ros contains a detailed description of each classification.
the service is entitled to use its own methodology,unless it is irrational.marita,at see also california watt.the ros easily passes that test it is not an irrational,but a thoughtful methodology for matching settings and activities,among other planning purposes.suffice it to say that we agree with the service on this point.
but meister other complaint is more problematic.he contends that,as a part of its analysis,the service significantly overestimated snowmobile use and underestimated ski activity in the forests.the issue begins with the fact that the service methodology for measuring the intensity of different activities in the national visitor use monitoring nvum that no visitors to the forests reported snowmobiling or skiing as the primary purpose of their visit in the year.recreational supply and demand analysis demand analysis at.b ased upon discussions with daniel stynes,professor,michigan state university,however,and the professional judgment of the staff and management,the service adjusted its estimate of annual snowmobile visits from zero to for the year and to for the year.final environmental impact statement march final statement at,demand analysis at.but the service made no parallel adjustment for visitors,notwithstanding its recognition that demand for this activity is projected to increase approximately percent over the next years,a rate faster than the rate of population growth.demand analysis at.the estimates of visitors,for the years to,were left at zero.
meister says this treatment of the numbers amounts to everything imaginable short of making up the data about snowmobile use.meister br.at.the service responds that it documented its methodology in the demand analysis and that c ommunications with the michigan state researcher and internal discussions about his opinions were also in the administrative record.gov t br.at.
the whole episode debases the coinage of agency deference.we begin with the discussions with stynes.so far as the record is concerned,the discussions are in fact nothing more than an single email exchange comprising several pages.the exchange is.stynes himself says at the outset that i not ready to present formal estimates for a peer review and the exchange actually focuses almost entirely on stynes belief that the total number of annual visits as opposed to just snowmobile visits to the forests should be adjusted from million the number suggested by the nvum to million.a forest service social scientist,donald english,expressed serious concerns about that proposed adjustment,stating that i reiterate that i think it would require a fair bit of work to justify using some other visitation estimate other than the nvum estimate.so far as we can tell,no further work was service official said simply to choose either number,j ust make sure it something defensible and the service chose the estimate of million.but the validity of that number is not before us today.
what is before us is the snowmobile number,which as noted above was adjusted from zero to for the year.according to the service demand analysis,stynes estimated that snowmobile visits on the national forest were approximately for that year.demand analysis at.but that characterization is unfair to stynes he made no such estimate.what he does a passage comprising three that the nvum survey was surely wrong in estimating zero snowmobile visits to the forest,that a earlier state study estimated about million snowmobile in the entire northern lower peninsula of michigan in,and that if of the activity is on the forests,we get national forests snowmobile visits.there is nothing more.those three sentences,so far as we can tell from the record,are the entire basis of the service adjustment of the snowmobile estimate from zero to.
so we see two serious problems with the service estimates of snowmobile and visitors.the first is that there is scarcely any basis for the snowmobile estimate.behind all of the service invocations of communications,discussions,and professional judgment,there lie only those three sentences.those sentences themselves contain not an estimate,but a hypothetical.the record otherwise contains not a hint of professional judgment on the service part as to why the number,as opposed to some other number,is reasonable.we mean no criticism of stynes,since in this respect his email was put to a use that he appears not to have contemplated.but we do say that the nation forests deserve better than this as the basis for significant decisions regarding their management.
the second problem is the disparate treatment of the estimate.most,if not all,of the service rationales for boosting the snowmobile numbers generally as opposed to pegging them at specifically namely,abnormally low snowfall during the survey year,high gas prices,and that participants in the activity typically enter the forests via trails rather than at developed sites where the survey forms were fully to visitors.meister quite reasonably asks why snowmobile visits received an upward adjustment,but visits did not.the service responds that there was i nsufficient data from which to make an estimate of visitors.given the data found sufficient for the snowmobile estimate,that response is hardly persuasive.and given that the demand analysis contains reliable and likely data showing the participation rate in skiing to be about half that for snowmobiling in the parts of the nation near the forests,see demand analysis at,it would seem that once the service had a snowmobile estimate in hand,a estimate would soon follow.but there is none so far as the tables in the demand analysis are concerned,the forests have seen their last skier.
deference must be earned.kadia gonzales,cir.it was not earned in the two respects that we discuss here.the service estimates of snowmobile and visitors to the forests are entirely arbitrary.the service own interpretation of a those estimates are integral to the analysis required under that subsection.to that extent,the service issuance of the plan was arbitrary and without observance of procedure required by law.a,d.
meister also claims that,in developing the plan,the service did not coordinate with michigan recreational planning as required by e.that subsection provides that the service planning efforts 
shall be coordinated to the extent feasible with present and proposed recreation activities of local and state land use or outdoor recreation plans,particularly the state comprehensive outdoor recreation plan,and recreation opportunities already present and available on other public and private lands,with the aim of reducing duplication in meeting recreation demands.
e.in plainer english,the subsection requires the service,to the extent feasible,to coordinate with the state in eliminating duplicate recreation opportunities on state and national forests.gov t br.at.plainer still the acreage already dedicated to a particular activity on state land should be considered in deciding how much federal land to allocate to the activity.
meister claims that the service failed to coordinate in this manner with respect to gun hunting and snowmobiling.the first step in this coordination,it would seem,would be simply to determine how much land is already available for these activities on state lands.the service has not done that.in its answer to meister complaint,the forest service after the plan had been it lack s sufficient knowledge or information to respond to the allegations concerning firearm hunting on state forest lands managed by the state of michigan.the service made essentially the same admission with respect to snowmobiling on state lands.it is hard to see how the service could even attempt to reduce duplication of hunting and snowmobiling opportunities on state lands without that basic information.
meister also seeks to show actual duplication as a means of proving that the service made no attempt to reduce it.specifically,he the service does not h unting is permitted on approximately million acres of state forest land and over acres of state game and wildlife areas in the state of michigan,and that there are more than miles of snowmobile trails in the state.meister br.at.he further notes that hunting is permitted virtually everywhere in the forests,save perhaps the parking that the forests duplication of hunting opportunities,to the extent there is any within the meaning of the rule,literally could not be greater.and he asks specifically why it was not feasible to reduce duplication by prohibiting gun hunting as opposed to bow hunting,which is largely silent,and to which meister seems not to object and snowmobiling in at least the primitive and semiprimitive nonmotorized areas of the forest.those areas,as defined by the ros,are supposed to bring an extremely high probability and a high probability,respectively,of experiencing isolation from the sights and sounds of humans.ros users guide,table experience characterization.firearm and snowmobile use,as the service itself recognizes,involve noises created by humans.primitive and semiprimitive areas together comprise less than acres of the acres occupied by the forests,or just of the forests acreage.see final statement at.meister therefore contends that the service failure to restrict these activities in even these in light of the circa million acres open to hunting on state land,and the miles of snowmobile trails strong evidence that the service did not comply with the coordination procedures mandated by e so far as gun hunting and snowmobiling are concerned.
the service response is insubstantial.first,it says that it uses the state comprehensive outdoor recreation plan as a tool to monitor recreation demand.but that only means the service has done half of what its regulation requires.section e,as shown above,requires consideration of the extent to which the supply of state lands already meets that demand.and the service admits it lacks knowledge on that point.second,the service again tells us that it consulted with stynes,and that its communications with him and internal discussions regarding his opinions are.gov t br.at.we are referred to the same email exchange.the exchange has even less to say about duplication that is,nothing than it does about snowmobile visits.finally,the service cites a letter from the michigan department of natural resources,in which the state says that the plan increases in semiprimitive nonmotorized and semiprimitive motorized areas work to meet the demand for those areas and may supplement existing recreational efforts that address recreation demand in a cooperative manner orv trails,pathways,campground placement.final statement at.the state comments speak well of the service decision to increase semiprimitive acreage in the forests.but they simply have nothing to do with whether hunting and snowmobiling opportunities on forest lands duplicate those on state lands.
thus,with respect to hunting and snowmobiling,there is no evidence that the service complied with e,and ample evidence that it did not.in that respect as well,therefore,the plan approval was without observance of procedure required by law.d.
meister remaining claim under the management act is that the service failed to comply with g.that regulation provides 
vehicle use shall be planned and implemented to protect land and other resources,promote public safety,and minimize conflicts with other uses of the national forest system lands.forest planning shall evaluate the potential effects of vehicle use off roads and,on the basis of the requirements of cfr part of this chapter,classify areas and trails of national forest system lands as to whether or not vehicle use may be permitted.
this regulation plainly contemplates that vehicle use may conflict with other interests and uses of the forests.in meister view,the regulation means that,if there is a conflict between vehicles and other uses,vehicles lose.meister br.at.the service disagrees.we agree with the service the regulation requires it only to minimize conflicts between vehicles and other uses,not to eliminate them.
but the mandate to minimize remains.meister contends it was not met.he is concerned about snowmobiles in particular and the basis of his claim is the service itself activities have continued to occur in or near several existing semiprimitive nonmotorized management areas.final statement at.those areas,as noted above,are supposed to be characterized by a large probability of isolation from the sights and sounds of others.id.at.therein lies the conflict and meister suggests that its elimination was feasible enough to fall within the mandate to minimize.
the service offers several responses.first,it says that the forest plan is not an appropriate vehicle for making individualized trail closure decisions.gov t br.at.that is true so far as it goes once the service decides that an area should generally be open to vehicle usage,the decision whether to close trails within it can properly be made on an individualized basis at the field level.but g by its plain terms imposes the bulk of its obligations at the planning stage and one such obligation,as we read the regulation,is to determine whether certain classes of areas and trails ought to be altogether to vehicle use.meister says that one such class are trails that the service itself admits are in or near semiprimitive nonmotorized areas.that claim is properly presented at the plan level.
the service other responses go to the merits.one is that s ome of the nonconformities result because the snowmobile trail coincides with a county road that the service does not have jurisdiction to close.gov t br.at.that is a good answer as to those trails.less good is that other trails which we call trails existed prior to their designation or proposal for designation.final statement at.the argument seems to be that these trails were used by vehicles before being designated for that use,and thus should be grandfathered in.but elsewhere in the plan documents,the service repeatedly emphasizes the importance of limiting vehicle usage to designated routes only.record of decision at.so vehicle use on undesignated trails is a bad thing and thus it hardly seems rational to say that a trail should remain open to vehicles simply because the trail was used by them before its designation.and it is likewise incoherent to a basis for keeping other trails club trails open to s nowmobile clubs use motorized equipment to groom snowmobile trails on roads within several of the current semiprimitive nonmotorized management areas.final statement at.the mere fact of a nonconformity is no reason to allow it to continue.
there conceivably might be reasons for keeping and club trails open to vehicle presumably the reasons should be good ones,given the service own recognition that these uses are nonconformities.if the service were to articulate good reasons,we would defer to them.as the record now stands with respect to these trails,however,the service has not articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,at internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,as matters now stand,the service has not complied with g mandate to minimize conflicts between vehicle use and other uses and interests of the forests.to that extent,the plan approval was arbitrary and without observance of procedure required by law.a,d.
meister remaining two claims arise under the national environmental policy act.the act serves procedural rather than substantive goals.save our cumberland mountains,at.the act has a specialized standard of review for arbitrariness in deciding whether the agency acted arbitrarily,we will not substitute our own judgment for that of the agency,but we will insist that the agency has,in fact,adequately studied the issue and taken a hard look at the environmental consequences of its decision.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the act requires,among other things,that an agency study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.e.meister argues that there were unresolved conflicts between different recreational uses of the forests here,and that the service should have,but did not,consider his proposed alternatives to resolve them.
meister first claim is based upon a conflict between the noise generated by gun hunting and snowmobile use,on the one hand,and the quiet recreational activities that primitive and semiprimitive nonmotorized areas are supposed to support,on the other.he argues that the service should have,but did not,consider the alternative of closing these areas to gun hunting and snowmobiling as a means of resolving this conflict.meister proposed this alternative during the administrative process,but the service rejected it out of hand.
as a general matter,the range of alternatives that must be discussed under the national environmental policy act is a matter within an agency discretion.save our cumberland mountains,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,an agency may apply a rule of reason in this area and discuss only reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.id.at.the question,then,is whether the service acted within its discretion in rejecting meister alternative without any discussion.
that rejection was based on a series of factual and legal errors.the principal factual error is that,during both the administrative and now the legal process,the service has treated meister proposed restriction on hunting as something it obviously is not namely,a proposal that the service impose a complete ban on hunting in the forests.gov t br.at see also may,letter from forest supervisor leanne marten to kurt meister it is my determination that a general closure of the forests to hunting is not justifiable final statement at same.
all but one paragraph of the government briefing of this claim is dedicated to ruling out such a complete ban.the service did accurately characterize meister proposal in its decision rejecting this part of his administrative appeal,but in doing so merely adopted supervisor marten rationale.but a complete ban is not what meister proposes.he proposes that gun hunting and snowmobiling be prohibited only in primitive and semiprimit
