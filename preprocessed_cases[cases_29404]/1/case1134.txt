in this immigration case,the department of homeland security seeks to deport an alien based on misrepresentations she made in applying for an adjustment of status more than five years previously.we conclude that a subsequent amendment to the statute did not negate our earlier precedent that the government was required to rescind and begin deportation within five years.accordingly,we will grant the petition for review.
appellant rosalba roa garcia is a native and citizen of the dominican republic.in,when she was almost years old,garcia filed a form application for adjustment to permanent resident status,asserting she was an unmarried adult child of dinora altagracia landestoy,a united states citizen.at the time she filed the application,garcia knew that landestoy was not her biological or legal mother.in september,immigration authorities approved the application and granted garcia lawful permanent residence status.
landestoy had filed multiple prior unsuccessful petitions on garcia behalf,including one in september that was approved in january,but then rescinded in august after an investigation determined that landestoy was not her mother.the notice of intent to revoke that petition referred to an earlier application that was rescinded in on the same basis.landestoy filed another petition in that was denied in september because she did not prove that garcia was her child.
despite the multiple rejected applications,the dhs did not realize until,when garcia filed an application for naturalization,that she was ineligible for the adjustment of status she received in.in,the dhs began removal proceedings charging garcia with being removable under ina a a,a a,because she was inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under ina a a i i,a a i i,as an alien not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or entry document,and under ina a c i,a c i,as an alien who attempted to procure a visa,other documentation,or admission into the united states through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.
an immigration judge ordered garcia removed on the charged grounds,and the bia affirmed.she has now petitioned this court for review.garcia contends that the limitation in ina a,a,barred the dhs from commencing removal proceedings against her based on her fraudulent application.she argues that bamidele immigration naturalization service,cir,supports her position.
in bamidele,this court vacated a final order of deportation where an alien had obtained an adjustment of status through a sham marriage.id.at.although it discovered that bamidele marriage was a fraud,the dhs waited five years to begin deportation proceedings.id.at.
we concluded,the running of the limitation period bars the rescission of bamidele permanent resident status and,in the absence of the commission of any other offense,thereby bars initiation of deportation proceedings in this case.id.at.we reasoned further that,i t defies logic to say that facts known to the ins within five years of bamidele adjustment of status and which would form the basis of a rescission action had the ins taken timely action should also empower the ins to deport bamidele.id.at.allowing deportation in such circumstances would effectively read a out of existence.id.at.
when we decided bamidele,a read in pertinent part 
if,at any time within five years after the status of a person has been otherwise adjusted under the provisions of section or of this title or any other provision of law to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,it shall appear to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the person was not in fact eligible for such adjustment of status,the attorney general shall rescind the action taken granting an adjustment of status to such person and cancelling deportation in the case of such person if that occurred and the person shall thereupon be subject to all provisions of this chapter to the same extent as if the adjustment of status had not been made.

after this court decided bamidele,congress added the following language to the end of a as part of an extensive revision of the immigration statute 
nothing in this subsection shall require the attorney general to rescind the alien status prior to commencement of procedures to remove the alien under section,and an order of removal issued by an immigration judge shall be sufficient to rescind the alien status.

the bia held in the case before us that bamidele is not applicable because the amendment to a separated rescission and removal proceedings so that the limitation applies only to rescission.according to the bia,when an adjustment to permanent lawful resident status is erroneously granted,the dhs has the choice of either instituting rescission proceedings if it catches its mistake within five years or commencing removal proceedings without being subject to any time limitation.in this case,the dhs argues that we should defer to the bia interpretation of the amendment rather than follow bamidele.
we decided the matter of deference in bamidele,explaining that a is a statute of limitations,a subject that is not within the particular expertise of the ins.bamidele,at.therefore,we did not grant the agency interpretation any presumption of special expertise.id.quoting dep t of navy fed.labor relations,cir.
we are bound by precedential opinions of our court unless they have been reversed by an en banc proceeding or have been adversely affected by an opinion of the supreme court.in re cont l airlines,cir.because the amendment to a is part of the same statute of limitations discussed in bamidele,its holding applies and we will not defer to the agency construction.
the dhs,however,also maintains that the amendment to a,has undermined bamidele.in bamidele,after analyzing the statutory language,we decided that the limitation applied to both rescission and deportation actions that were taken to invalidate an adjustment of status that was erroneously granted to an ineligible alien.bamidele,at.the issue before us now is whether the statutory amendment that became effective altered the primary holding in that case.
our first step is to scrutinize the text of the amendment.it has two clear provisions 
the attorney general may remove an alien without taking steps to rescind an adjustment of status and 
an order of removal by an immigration judge is sufficient to rescind the alien status.
it is significant that the amendment does not invalidate nor modify nor refer in any respect to the statutory language within five years after the adjustment.the text remains in the statute.although the dhs would limit its application to rescission only,removing any statute of limitations to removal under,we find no justification for such a restrictive application of the plain language of the statute.
the dhs argument is a repetition of what we rejected in bamidele.we observed that the statute of limitations bar on deportation is narrow and quoted approvingly the bia opinion in re belenzo,where the board said that a prohibition is effective only where deportation is based on an attack on the adjustment itself.bamidele,at quoting belenzo,at.nothing in the amendment to a undermin
