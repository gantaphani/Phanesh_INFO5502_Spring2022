in this immigration and asylum case,petitioner joseph afanwi,a citizen of cameroon,seeks review of three board of immigration appeals bia orders i a november,order affirming an immigration judge denial of afanwi asylum claim ii a february,order denying afanwi motion to rescind and reissue the november order and iii a may,order denying afanwi motion to reopen immigration proceedings.for the reasons that follow,the petition is denied.
afanwi,a citizen of cameroon,entered the united states legally in july.as a visitor,afanwi was authorized to remain in the united states only until january.on january,afanwi filed,pro se,an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat afanwi claimed that he was a member of the social democratic front and the southern cameroons national council and that his membership and involvement in these groups made him a target of persecution in cameroon.
afanwi application was referred to an immigration judge ij,and while the application was pending the immigration and naturalization service ins began removal proceedings by filing a notice to appear before the ij.the ins alleged that afanwi was removable pursuant to the immigration and nationality act,a b,because he had remained in the united states longer than permitted.afanwi resisted removal on the same grounds underlying his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat application.the ij issued a written opinion finding afanwi claims lacking in credibility and consequently denied his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims.afanwi timely appeal to the bia was unsuccessful the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed afanwi appeal on november.
the bia sent a copy of its november,order to afanwi attorney of record at the time but because the attorney had relocated to another office and did not check his mail until early january,afanwi counsel did not learn of the bia order until after the deadline for filing a petition for judicial review had passed.afanwi was therefore unable to file a timely petition for review of the bia november,order.instead,afanwi filed a motion to rescind and reissue the november,decision and order to allow him to file a timely petition.in support of this motion,afanwi argued that the bia had used an incomplete address when it sent the november,order to his attorney,which,he said,could have delayed delivery thereby preventing him from filing a timely appeal.on february,the bia denied afanwi motion to rescind and reissue.
afanwi then filed a motion to reopen his application on two grounds i that new evidence relating to his asylum claim justified reopening his application,and ii that afanwi had received ineffective assistance of counsel.this effort also failed.the bia denied afanwi motion to reopen on may,finding i that the new evidence proffered by afanwi failed to remedy the shortcomings of his original application,and ii that afanwi ineffective assistance claim was beyond the bia jurisdiction.
following the bia denial of his motions,afanwi filed this petition for review with this court on february,seeking review of the bia november,order affirming the denial of his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims.afanwi corrected this petition on march,to add a request for review of the bia february,order denying his motion to rescind and reissue.afanwi further amended the petition on june,to seek review of the bia may,order denying his motion to reopen respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition on march,and afanwi responded in opposition on march,arguing that his amended petition rendered respondent motion moot.following oral argument,the parties were instructed to file supplemental briefs addressing whether an alien has a fifth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in the filing of a petition for review and,if so,whether the right extends to other aspects of the process.the parties have filed their supplemental briefs,and the appeal is now ripe for disposition.
the immigration and nationality act ina vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction to review final orders of removal of an alien.an order of denominated an order of deportation is the order of the special inquiry officer,or other such administrative officer to whom the attorney general has delegated the responsibility for determining whether an alien is deportable,concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation.such an order becomes final upon the earlier of a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order or the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the board of immigration appeals.the ina further provides that a petition for review must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.because afanwi seeks review of three separate,i the november,order affirming the immigration judge denial of afanwi asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims,ii the february,order denying afanwi motion to rescind and reissue,and iii the may,order denying afanwi motion to will consider each individually.
before doing so,however,we must address a threshold jurisdictional matter,namely whether afanwi has correctly invoked this court jurisdiction by filing procedurally proper petitions.respondent argues that afanwi corrected and amended petitions are procedurally improper,and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to review the bia orders denying afanwi motion to rescind and reissue and motion to reopen.according to respondent,the supreme court in stone,d,construed the ina to require separate petitions for review of the original order of removal and review of any subsequent motions for reconsideration.in other words,respondent claims that stone required afanwi to file a separate petition for review for each of the three orders in issue on this appeal.
this argument misreads stone,for that decision,closely read,does not require that a petitioner must,in all circumstances,file a separate petition for review for each order.instead,stone stands for no more than the unremarkable proposition that a petitioner who files a motion for reconsideration of an order can not wait for disposition of that motion before filing a petition for review of the order for which reconsideration is sought.in other words,stone avoids delaying judicial review of an order that is pending reconsideration by requiring timely filing of a petition for review of that order notwithstanding that a motion for reconsideration remains unresolved.stone further contemplates the filing of a separate petition once the motion for reconsideration is resolved and the subsequent consolidation of these petitions by the court of appeals.in the words of stone,deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance,irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider.at.
correctly read,therefore,stone is no obstacle to our jurisdiction to consider afanwi petition.he was not required to file separate petitions for review of the bia february,order denying his motion to rescind and reissue and the bia may,order denying his motion to reopen.petitioner march,corrected petition and his june,amended petition suffice to bring these matters before us for review we therefore turn to a consideration of each of the bia decisions in turn.
afanwi first seeks review of the bia november,order affirming the immigration judge denial of his asylum,request for withholding of removal,and cat application.afanwi concedes,as he must,that this petition is untimely,for the ina required him to file his petition not later than days after the bia order,that is,not later than december,it is undisputed that the untimeliness of afanwi petition with respect to the november order is attributable to his attorney failure to check his mailbox following his transfer to another office.as a result of this oversight,afanwi and his counsel did not learn of the november,order until after the expiration of the period allowed by the ina for filing of a petition for review.specifically,afanwi filed this petition on february,some sixty days after the bia november,order and thirty days after the statutory deadline.afanwi petition is accordingly untimely with regard to the bia november,order,and it must be denied in this respect.
afanwi next seeks review of the bia february,order denying afanwi motion to rescind and reissue the november order.we affirm the bia february order for two reasons.
first,afanwi sought reissue of the november order on the ground that the bia had used an incomplete address that may have delayed delivery of the november order.there is no evidence that the incomplete address caused any delay in delivery of the order.afanwi has conceded that his attorney did not check his mailbox until well after the deadline for a timely petition for review had passed,and thus he can not show that the incomplete address prevented his filing a timely petition for review to the contrary,it is clear that had the bia used a complete address afanwi would still have missed the filing deadline owing to his attorney failure to check his mail 
second,the bia is not obligated to rescind and reissue its orders in circumstances such as these,as the decision to rescind and reissue when the bia has committed no error is a matter of grace and discretion.although this issue is one of first impression in this circuit,the seventh circuit has addressed the issue in a similar situation in firmansjah ashcroft there,the petitioning alien had not received the bia order of removal until after the deadline to file a petition for review had passed the seventh circuit concluded that while nothing prevents the bia from entering a new removal order,which is subject to a fresh petition for review,the court would not say that the board must reenter its decision if notice miscarries rather,when the bia extends to aliens this measure of grace,there is no legal obstacle to judicial review.we join the seventh circuit in holding that the decision to rescind and reissue an order of removal is properly left to the discretion of the bia,and that where,as here,a petitioner fails to receive an order through no fault of the bia,a court of appeals properly defers to the bia decision not to extend this measure of grace.accordingly,afanwi petition for review is denied with respect to the bia february,order.
finally,afanwi seeks review of the bia may,order denying his motion to reopen his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat application.the ina permits an alien to file a single motion to reopen removal proceedings a bia decision denying the motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion and we will reverse such a decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law 
afanwi asked the bia to reopen his application on two grounds i new evidence supporting his claim for asylum,and ii ineffective assistance of counsel.the bia denied afanwi motion on each ground.
first,the bia found that the new evidence did not support reopening afanwi application because it did not correct the application existing deficiencies.we affirm the bia reasoned decision in this respect.to establish eligibility for asylum,afanwi must demonstrate that he is a refugee,that is,a person who is unable to return to his or her country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a rusu,cir.the new evidence presented in afanwi motion to,his allegation that cameroon police visited afanwi home in that country looking for not create a fear of persecution,and the bia decision to that effect can not be said to be arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law accordingly,the bia denial of afanwi motion to reopen on this ground is affirmed.
next,the bia found that it lacked jurisdiction over afanwi ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the allegedly ineffective assistance,namely counsel failure to file a timely petition for review of the board november,decision,occurred after the bia had issued its final order of removal.the question,therefore,is whether the bia has jurisdiction to consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim when that claim arises,as here,from the failure to file a timely petition for review with the court of appeals.a review of the authority on this issue discloses no settled or uniform view.the courts of appeals have not squarely addressed the issue,although some,including the fourth circuit,have apparently assumed without deciding that the bia does have jurisdiction over such ineffective assistance of counsel claims and have affirmed bia decisions regarding such claims on the merits the bia itself has issued contradictory opinions on the subject,at times holding,as it did here,that failure to file a timely petition for review is beyond the bia jurisdiction and at times assuming that such a claim is properly within the bia jurisdiction because the bia denied afanwi motion to reopen on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over his ineffective assistance claim,the matter is squarely before us,and we take this opportunity to state clearly that the bia does not have jurisdiction over an ineffective assistance claim arising out of an alien counsel failure to file a timely petition for review with the court of appeals.
the bia has jurisdiction to review questions of law,discretion,and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges.an attorney failure to monitor his mailbox for receipt of a bia decision and to file a timely petition in the court of appeals for review of that decision is not a question of law,discretion,or judgment or other issue in appeal from decisions of immigration judges.as the bia itself has concisely put it,any error before the court of appeals by an alien counsel does not implicate the board since the board made no error as a result of the alien counsel alleged ineffectiveness on this ground.accordingly,we affirm the board denial of afanwi motion to reopen on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and dismiss afanwi petition for review in this regard,since the alleged ineffective assistance,if any,occurred before this court,not before the board of immigration appeals.
yet this does not end our analysis,for the immigration and nationality act vests the courts of appeals with jurisdiction over all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states.b.this section,known as the zipper clause,consolidates review of matters arising from removal proceedings only in judicial review of a final order under this section,and strips courts of habeas jurisdiction over such matters.because afanwi ineffective assistance claim is before the court pursuant to a timely petition for review of an order of the bia denial of afanwi motion to over this claim is appropriate under b.
afanwi ineffective assistance claim requires us to address whether the constitution guarantees effective assistance of counsel to an alien in removal proceedings.it is well settled that removal proceedings are civil in nature,not criminal it is equally well settled that because removal proceedings are not criminal proceedings,aliens facing removal are not entitled to the sixth amendment right to counsel,nor to the associated right to effective counsel yet,aliens facing removal are not without rights congress,by statute,has created a right to retained counsel at removal proceedings and it is quite clear that aliens enjoy a fifth amendment right to due process in such proceedings 
at issue is whether afanwi fifth amendment right to due process in his removal proceedings includes the right to a remedy for ineffectiveness of retained counsel.since the,a number of circuits have held that counsel performance in a removal proceeding can be so deficient that it deprives the alien of his due process right to a fair hearing interestingly,this line of cases grows out of the fifth circuit decision in paul,which does not squarely recognize a right to effective assistance of retained counsel but merely suggests that such a rig
