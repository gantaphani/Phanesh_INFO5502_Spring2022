appellants collectively referred to as adp,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant,the united states forest service,on counts i and iii of their complaint.adp filed suit under the administrative procedure act apa,and the national forest management act nfma,to challenge the forest services decision to undertake a project the east side project in the allegheny national forest the anf adp claimed that the forest service improperly selected a harvesting system primarily based upon dollar return,and sought a declaratory judgment that selection of the harvesting system on that basis violated the apa and nfma.adp also sought to enjoin the forest service from implementing the logging plan on that basis.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background.
history of the anf 
the anf occupies more than acres in elk,forest,mckean and warren counties in northwestern pennsylvania.originally,pennsylvania forests included stands of very large,mature or overmature trees of differing ages and species.the forests were in varying stages of recovery from natural catastrophes such as fires and windthrow david marquis,the allegheny hardwood forests of pennsylvania,marquis manuscript manuscript available at,book,tab.originally,hemlock and beech,which are very trees,were the most common species.together,they represented percent of the forest.maple,birch,white pine,and chestnut represented an additional thirty percent.id.at.black cherry,the tree at issue here,composed only of the forest from the years to.however,by,of the anf was black cherry,book,tab at,and today black cherry amounts to of the overstory forest and of the understory forest,book,tab,appendix l at.
when the forest was primarily inhabited by native americans,wildlife was abundant.it included deer,elk,bear,wolves,cougars,wildcats,and lynx.deer were also common,though not abundant.the deer population was kept down by natural predators and by the limited availability of food.their numbers were also checked because dear were an important source of meat and clothing for the native americans.marquis manuscript at.
the first settlers arrived around,and timber harvesting became important by.there were,by then,an estimated sawmills in warren county,producing million board feet of timber annually.industry was developing in the area by,and the first oil well was drilled in.there were also steam railroads,sawmills and steam log loaders.by,there were three railroads.marquis states that,b etween and,the virgin and partially cut forests were almost completely clearcut in what must have been the highest degree of forest utilization that the world has ever seen in any commercial lumbering area.id.at.however,the deer population was still under control because of extensive hunting.forest fires were common from to in areas that had originally contained conifers.heavy cutting and frequent fires resulted in a reduction of conifers and an increase in hardwoods.marquis concluded that fires were probably a major factor in the virtual elimination of white pine and hemlock in the allegheny forests.in some places,fires burned intensely enough to remove all humus,exposing the clay soil and creating some of the numerous open areas that are still present on the plateau.id.at.as the number of conifers and white pine in the allegheny forest was reduced,they were replaced by stands dominated by hardwoods such as black cherry,red maple,sugar maple and white ash species that are excellent as timber.according to marquis,heavy cutting favors hardwoods because small hardwood seedlings have a head start on new pine seedlings and can outgrow conifers such as hemlock seedlings.id.at.in addition,heavy cutting provides ideal conditions for forest fires,and fires are more damaging to coniferous seedlings than to hardwood seedlings because of the hardwoods ability to resprout.species such as black cherry also thrived during the period of to due to the absence of shade.in the vast open areas created by clearcutting black cherry,a tree,regenerates much more successfully than species such as beech.
the increase in cherry from century logging and the resulting increase in the percentage of cherry in the forests had a cost.the environmental impact included serious flooding,erosion and other harm to the area watersheds.it also harmed wildlife species,some of which are only now being reintroduced to the area.furthermore,the popularity of venison in hotels,lumber camps and city markets reduced the deer population to such scarcity that measures had to be taken to increase their numbers.these measures included appointment of a game commission in.at about the same time that affirmative steps were being taken to protect deer,extensive timber harvesting was resulting in increased accumulation of browse for the deer to feed on.with predators eliminated,browse accumulating in clearcut areas,and does being protected from hunting,conditions were ripe for the deer population to explode.
in his article,marquis reported that after the original forest had been cleared,the industries of the allegheny plateau suffered a significant decline.id.at.those industries did not begin to rebound until around.by,the forests that sprouted after the clearcuttings of were fifty to eighty years old.trees in the older stands were therefore large enough to be valuable for timber.according to marquis,much of the forest land was then under some sort of management.this had been insured by setting large acreages aside in the national and state forests where cutting was carefully regulated and integrated with other uses.marquis believed that timber cutting would never return to the type of operation that saw the entire region cut over a thirty to forty year period.id.at.however,he recognized there were still problems.for example,it was very difficult to obtain prompt regeneration after the mature trees had been removed.this was partly because of the large deer population marquis observed that m uch research is under way to find ways of increasing advance regeneration,of protecting seedlings from deer,and of establishing new stands through seeding or planting so that our allegheny hardwood forests will continue to provide all of the many goods and services we have come to expect from them.id.
deer were not the only obstacle to successful regeneration.the anf was also affected by a series of droughts from through,as well as epidemic populations of parasites.the latter included elm spanworm,forest tent caterpillar and sherry scallop shell moth,book,tab,at.this resulted in a series of defoliations across a wide swath of northern pennsylvania,including the anf.as a result,a substantial portion of the anf at issue here was repeatedly defoliated.the stress of these repeated defoliations weakened trees and made them more susceptible to attack by secondary pathogens that actually kill trees.as a result,by,the anf contained a sizable zone of mortality areas of dead and declining trees.
the species most affected by these events were sugar and red maples,american beech,birch and white ash,book at.although black cherry suffered defoliation along with the other species,species like sugar maple and white ash suffered greater levels of mortality.those species are more vulnerable to drought and defoliation stress on sites with low nutrient capital like the unglacieated plateau sites and upper slopes in the areas involved.id.at.
according to adp,absent certain measures such as more clearcutting or other management followed by fertilization and the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing,extensive herbicide use,and thinning to eliminate hardier species of trees,most of the forested areas of northwestern pennsylvania would eventually revert to the native forest.
statutory and regulatory framework 
in the organic administration act of,congress identified the purposes for which national forests may be established and administered.those purposes include improving and protecting the forest,obtaining favorable conditions for water flows,and furnishing a continuous supply of lumber for the citizens of the united states.id.more than sixty years after congress enacted the organic administration act,congress enacted the act of musya.that act provides,in relevant part 
it is the policy of the congress that the national forests are established and shall be administered for outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,and wildlife and fish purposes 
in,congress enacted the national environmental policy act,nepa,et.nepa requires all federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for every recommendation,report or proposal,legislation,or other actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment.c.thereafter,in,congress enacted the nfma,et,requiring the secretary of agriculture to promulgate regulations for the development and revision of land management plans,guidelines and standards prescribed pursuant to the nfma.
the nfma further requires that the regulations issued by the secretary of agriculture include 
guidelines for land management plans developed to achieve the goals of the program which 
a insure consideration of the economic and environmental aspects of various systems of renewable resource management including the related systems of silviculture and protection of forest resources,to provide for outdoor recreation including wilderness,range,timber,watershed,wildlife,and fish 
d permit increases in harvest levels based on intensified management practices,such as reforestation,thinning,and tree improvement 
e insure that timber will be harvested from national forest system lands only where 
iv the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber and 
f insure that clearcutting,seed tree cutting,shelterwood cutting,and other cuts designed to regenerate an stand of timber will be used as a cutting method on national forest system lands only where 
i for clearcutting,it is determined to be the optimum method,and for other such cuts,it is determined to be appropriate,to meet the objectives and requirements of the relevant land management plan.
the forest service regulations implementing these provisions of the nfma are codified at part.the first planning rule was adopted in,substantially amended in,and partially amended again in june and september of.the rule,as amended,guided the development,amendment,and revision of the forest plans now in place for the anf as well as all other national forests and grasslands in the united states.
the following provision is particularly relevant to our inquiry 
management prescriptions that involve vegetative manipulation of tree cover for any purpose shall 
be best suited to the goals established for the area with potential environmental,biological,cultural resources,aesthetic,engineering,and economic impacts,as stated in the regional guides and forest plans,being considered in this determination 
assure that lands can be adequately restocked 
not be chosen primarily because they will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest output of timber,although these factors shall be considered 
provide the desired effects on water quantity and quality,wildlife and fish habitat,regeneration of desired tree species,forage production,recreation uses,aesthetic values,and other resource yields.
this rule was superceded in november,when the secretary of agriculture substantially revised certain provisions of part.the new rule included a transitional provision.the transitional provision delayed the application of the new rule to decisions such as the east side project until after november.d decisions made by the responsible official years from november,and afterward must be in conformance with the provisions of this subpart.
the department then proposed revising the rule and extending the transition period,and it published an interpretative rule clarifying the intent of the transition provision.on january,the department of agriculture rescinded the regulations and replaced them in their entirety with a new final rule entitled national forest system land management planning,to be codified at part.the regulations do not contain the language found in the regulations prohibiting forest management that maximizes the dollar return or the output of timber.
on march,however,the forest service issued several interim directives that were effective immediately.one of those directives states,in relevant part 
vegetation management requirements 
the minimum specific management requirements to be met in carrying out projects and activities in the national forest system nfs are set forth in this section a responsible official may authorize projects to harvest timber only where 
the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return.
under nepa and nfma,forest planning and management occurs at the programmatic level and at the project level.at the programmatic level,the forest service develops a forest plan for each national forest.the plan is designed to provide for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services obtained from the forest in accordance with musya and,in particular,include coordination of outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish and wilderness.e.each forest plan contains a summarized analysis of the management situation a description of the forest goals and objectives,including a description of the desired future condition of the forest and an identification of goods and services that are expected to be produced prescriptions standards and guidelines and monitoring and evaluation requirements.the forest plan divides the forest into different management areas ma units of land in which the provision of a particular management goal is sets out for each ma an emphasis statement,goals,desired future condition,description,and standards and guidelines.the development of the forest plan is accompanied by a public review process conducted in accordance with nfma and nepa.see d and g.
the second level involves project activities.at this stage the forest service proposes,analyzes and decides upon actions that must be consistent with the forest plan.they must also be consistent with the limitations imposed under nepa.therefore,the forest service must produce either an eis and record of decision rod or an environmental assessment ea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi each proposed project may proceed only if it is consistent with the forest plan,has been analyzed under nepa,and has been specifically approved by the appropriate forest service official.i.
pursuant to the requirements of the nfma,the forest service adopted the allegheny national forest land and resource management plan in.the plan recognized that 
forest plans must assure that they provide for and a sustained yield of products and services.in addition,forest plans must provide this and sustained yield of goods and services from the allegheny national forest in a way that maximizes net public benefits in an environmentally sound manner.
the plan divided the national forest into mas,determined the desired future condition and featured logging method for each ma,and set both and management area specific standards and guidelines.
c.the curry litigation 
in,the forest service undertook a series of studies to assess tree mortality in the anf in an effort to identify treatments that could promote a healthy forest ecosystem.after completing an ea and issuing a fonsi pursuant to nepa,the forest service approved a project known as mortality that project identified ecosystem management actions for treating portions of the anf that had suffered the most severe mortality and decline.when mortality i was completed,the forest service undertook an additional project,mortality ii,to continue the efforts begun under mortality mortality ii addressed ecosystem sustainability,harvesting,and reforestation concerns on additional areas within the zone of mortality,book at.it also proposed selling timber from within the anf.more specifically,it authorized acres of logging and acres of herbicide applications in ma.
many of the same individuals who are appellants in this appeal initiated an action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania to challenge mortality ii.they claimed that proposed sales of timber violated the nfma,the migratory bird treaty act,and the nepa.see curry united states forest service.plaintiffs alleged that the management techniques that were to be used under the mortality ii project could have significant adverse environmental effects on wildlife and old growth forests.they claimed the project effects could irreparably destroy the recreational,research and aesthetic values of the affected areas.id.at.
the district court concluded that the magnitude of the mortality ii project and its selection of management as the predominant management technique undermined the defendants claim that the project would not have a significant impact on the human environment.id.at.the court identified several factors indicative of the severity of mortality ii impact,and concluded that the forest service had not done an analysis of the combined effects of mortality i and mortality ii.id.at.the district court agreed that the forest service failure to prepare an eis for mortality ii violated nepa,and the services decision to approve the project without an eis was arbitrary and capricious.id 
accordingly,on october,the district court issued an order granting the curry plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on their nfma and the nepa claims,and enjoining the forest service from implementing the mortality ii project until it prepared an eis and considered a broad range of alternative techniques for managing the anf.the district court also directed the forest service to reconsider its determination that the management techniques proposed by the mortality ii project for ma met the optimality and appropriateness requirements set forth in g f.id.at.
d.the east side project 
the forest service produced an eis for the east side project pursuant to the district court order in curry.the east side project combined the mortality ii proposal with several other smaller logging proposals and included activities in three of the anf management areas ma,ma,and ma.the project was intended to implement the forest plan by restoring the forested ecosystem and moving the area towards the desired future condition described in the forest plan.more specifically,the project was intended to initiate reforestation treatments to restore the declining forest ecosystem establish tree seedlings to restore tree regeneration or replacement and to improve the horizontal and vertical diversity in the ecosystem enhance the vigor of forested stands by regulating stocking and species composition promote sustainable delivery of forest products in ma supply forest products to meet public demand and to contribute to the economic vitality of local communities improve road access and safety and maintain water quality by improving and maintaining needed roads and eliminating unnecessary roads and restore wildlife habitat.rod,app.at.
most of the activities comprising the east side project,including logging and clearcutting,were to occur in ma which,at acres,is the largest management area in the anf.according to the forest plan,the primary purposes of ma include providing a sustained yield of allegheny hardwood and oak sawtimber through management,and providing a variety of age or size class habitat diversity from seedling to mature sawtimber in a variety of timber types,book at.additional stated primary purposes for ma include providing a habitat for wildlife that prefer the openings created by cutting and creating and maintaining roads for recreation.id.the project authorizes miles of road construction and reconstruction,acres of herbicide application,acres of fertilizer application,and acres of fencing around the large openings created by the logging.id.
the project also includes treating vegetation in ma,which comprises acres of primarily northern hardwoods and hemlock.under the forest plan this management approach is primarily intended to 
provide a continuous forested scene through practicing management which will promote shade tolerant species and produce quality sawtimber.
feature wildlife species associated with shade tolerant vegetation,primarily songbirds and birds and mammals.
provide the opportunity for a variety of developed and dispersed motorized recreation opportunities in a roaded natural setting.
the project also includes reforestation treatments in the acres comprising ma.the emphasis in this management area is intended to maintain or enhance scenic quality,provide for dispersed recreation,and provide habitat for wildlife species that require mature and overmature hardwood forests.id.at.the forest plan allows for the use of both and management in ma.id.at.
pursuant to the ruling in curry,and as the rod for the project explains,before finalizing the details of the project,the forest service evaluated five alternatives in detail and additional alternatives were eliminated from detailed study after being evaluated.one of the alternatives considered in have made extensive use of management in addition,more limited use of management was included in alternative and.
ultimately,the acting forest supervisor of the forest service selected alternative as the option that would best achieve the project intended purposes.the forest supervisor found alternative consistent with the forest service natural resource agenda with respect to watershed protection,sustainable forests and roads.app.at.the supervisor also found alternative to be the best response to the issues identified for the project because it could best attain the desired condition envisioned by the forest.at.
the rod described the proposed activities of alternative,which included transportation activities,wildlife treatments and timber outputs.app.at.the rod also discussed the environmental consequences of alternative,including a review of the impact on ecological land types,water,transportation,oil,gas and mineral,vegetation,wildlife,heritage resources,recreation,scenic resources,economics,and human health and safety.app.at.the rod also discussed the reasons that alternatives were rejected,app.at,and it evaluated the use of logging and considered whether logging could be used.id.
ultimately,when considering whether alternative was consistent with the forest plan and federal laws,the rod concluded that logging is appropriate,and clearcutting optimal,in order to regenerate the species and forest types found in the anf app.at.the rod concluded that logging would move the project area toward the desired future condition set forth in the land management plan.the rod states that this management is necessary to restore and maintain a healthy,sustainable forest in the project area.
procedural history 
adp filed an administrative appeal of the rod on february.the regional forester denied that appeal on march.adp then filed a complaint in the district court,raising multiple issues under nfma and nepa.
the district court ultimately adopted the magistrate judge second report and recommendation r r.allegheny defense project forest service,slip.op.in the first r r,the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment in favor of adp on counts i and iii,the two counts at issue in this appeal.app.
count i alleged that,in the east side decision,the forest service chose to manage the anf as a black cherry tree farm in violation of musya,which requires that the national forests be established and administered for outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,and wildlife and fish purposes,and nfma,which requires that the regulations specify guidelines for land management plans which insure that timber will be harvested from nfs lands only where the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber,g e iv.count iii alleged that the east side decision violated the apa and the nfma because the decision determination that clearcutting was optimal and that logging was appropriate were based on the fact that these logging methods would produce the most cherry sawtimber and regenerate the most cherry for future logging,thereby giving the greatest dollar return 
after appellees and filed objections to the r r,the magistrate judge vacated the r r and heard oral argument on the outstanding motions for summary judgment.thereafter,the magistrate judge issued her second r r,recommending that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants on counts i and.at.the magistrate judge concluded it is clear that the high value of black cherry was a major consideration in developing the east side decision.whether the east side decision was based primarily on the fact that black cherry will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber is not so clear.app.at.the magistrate judge went on to conclude the following as to count i 
considering that congress did not define the meaning of primarily in the nfma no court has held that the secretary of agriculture has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the apa and the nfma by selecting management as the harvesting system primarily because it would give the greatest dollar return or the greatest output of timber that when the anf was established in it had already been substantially,resulting in stands of conifers and white pines being replaced by stands dominated by hardwoods such as black cherry,red maple,sugar maple and white ash,which were excellent for sawtimber the forest service is required to consider the costs and benefits of its management practices in developing the east side decision the forest service included in its purposes,in addition to providing a sustained yield of high quality allegheny hardwood,the provision of a variety of age or size class habitat diversity as well as diversity of wildlife health problems existing in the anf and management of the anf is a complex matter this court can not find that in the east side decision defendants arbitrarily and capriciously selected their harvesting system primarily because it would give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber in violation of the nfma.
in explaining her grant of summary judgment on count iii,the magistrate judge stated 
congress again did not define what it meant by the optimum method and appropriate cuts and these terms would appear to be extremely ambiguous.therefore,congress would appear to have delegated to the forest service the role of determining what they mean,as long as their definition is not arbitrary and capricious.plaintiff admit that the forest service made the determination that logging was appropriate,and that clearcutting was optimal but assert that it did this in order to regenerate black cherry and other commercially desirable species and achieve the desired future condition set forth in the land management plan.
during oral argument counsel for plaintiffs admitted that their argument as to count iii is essentially the same as their argument in count the forest service chose the logging methods which would produce the most cherry and thereby give the greatest dollar return.for the reasons given in the analysis of count i,plaintiffs have not shown that defendants determinations that clearcutting is optimal and that logging is appropriate are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the apa.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge second r r and entered summary judgment for defendants.see allegheny defense project,supra at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion.

here,neither the government nor the district court have questioned appellants standing nor do we indeed,we see nothing improbable about the proposition that the forest service proposed activities in the anf would cause nearby residents to curtail their recreational use of the forest and would subject them to economic and aesthetic harms.see friends of the earth,at.

alleged deficiencies of the east side project 
adp main contention is that the forest service decision to use harvesting combined with fertilizer and herbicide,and fencing,violates the apa and the nfma because it seeks primarily to achieve the highest dollar return by emphasizing the logging and regeneration of black cherry timber,which is by far the most commercially valuable species in the allegheny.adp reply brief at.adp also contends that the forest service incorrectly determined that the logging authorized by the project was appropriate and the clearcutting optimal when that logging was authorized primarily to give the greatest dollar return the numerous factors adp cites to support that position include 
in its summary judgment brief,the forest service asserted that the rod adopted the recommendations of the northeastern forest experimental station as set forth in the marquis manuscript.page one of the manuscript states that it is designed primarily as a guidebook for practicing foresters whose goal is timber production.also,the magistrate judge found that the object of the manuscript was to produce the maximum profit from management.
in the same brief,the forest service cited to a different marquis publication entitled,quantitative silviculture for hardwood forests of the alleghenies and explained that it used the publication silvah system as the scientific basis for the rod.adp contends that the express goal of the silvah system is to maximize growth and value.adp also maintains that this document is a lengthy manual for cultivating black cherry and other high value hardwood species,and the document warns that the use of logging will result in fewer allegheny hardwoods and less profits.
several monitoring reports,including one specifically cited by the forest service,document how management techniques similar to those authorized by the rod have negatively impacted other sites in the anf.thus,according to adp,by choosing to employ these techniques,black cherry promotion and regeneration and the resulting financial returns must be the forest service primary goals.
in its response to adp administrative appeal of the rod,the forest service noted that more logging was not included because it would not regenerate black cherry.additionally,the forest service explained that fertilizer would be applied to encourage more black cherry and not because the forest soils were otherwise depleted.
adp also maintains that the forest service explanations for why it selected the particular silvicultural techniques are merely pretextual since none of these justifications can even begin to explain the east side decision overwhelming preference for logging and the accompanying techniques.adp brief at.for example,according to adp 
the forest service can not justify its choice of silvicultural techniques by relying on the assertion that the success of management is uncertain since,according to the magistrate judge,management could work if it was supported by the same supplemental and the forest service uses to support management.according to adp,research has found that management could be used to obtain adequate regeneration of diverse tree species and at the same time promote and protect other multiple use resources.
health concerns also can not justify the forest service silvicultural practices since thousands of acres that will be subjected to the forest service management scheme are quite healthy and are not threatened by disease,and management creates stands with their own health problems,including specific threats to the health of black cherry trees such as the cherry scallop moth and ground level ozone caused by pollution.
the forest service argument that it chose management to maintain diversity is not supported by the record.according to adp,management would result in the least amount of old growth habitat,the highest amount of soil compaction,the lowest amount of standing dead and lying dead trees for wildlife habitat,the highest acreage of forest with more than stocking of interfering ferns and grasses,and the lowest acreage of forest with an intact of all alternatives.conversely,according to adp,simply not logging or using more harvesting techniques would create the most diversity in the anf.
the forest service can not justify its practices by claiming that it is simply maintaining conditions created by earlier logging since the same harvesting system authorized by the rod has in the recent past significantly increased the anf black cherry component.
the forest service can not blame the deer for the anf increased conversion to a forest dominated by black cherry since,according to adp,the logging being employed by the forest service contributes to the deer problem.
the forest service maintains that the east side project is consistent with nfma prohibition against selecting a harvesting system primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return.we agree.although it is beyond serious contention that the forest service considered the economic benefits of generating black cherry stands in structuring the project,economic concerns may be considered under the organic act,musya and nfma indeed,congress has mandated consideration of economic factors.see g a providing that forest planning regulations shall include guidelines that insure consideration of the economic and environmental aspects of various systems of renewable resource management.however,the record does not support adp claim that economic considerations were paramount or determinative in the forest service selection of appropriate forest management techniques for the project.
when a party challenges agency action as arbitrary and capricious the reasonableness of the agency action is judged in accordance with its stated reasons.in re comptroller of the currency,citing citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.moreover,we can assess the facts and evidence of record we can not speculate about the agency ulterior motives to an extent not supported by the record.see ohio forestry ass sierra club,d chastising the court of appeals for the sixth circuit for surmising,without evidence supported by record citation,that the forest service suffered from a kind of general bias in favor of timber production and clearcutting.here,the voluminous record illustrates that the forest service decision to utilize management in ma was not arbitrary and capricious.rather,the record shows that decision was based on a thorough analysis of a variety of both economic and factors.as the rod explains,the overall purpose of the project is the implementation of the forest plan by maintain ing and restor ing healthy and resilient watersheds and ecosystems.app.at.in order to do this,the forest service must initiate reforestation treatments,establish tree seedlings,improve the horizontal and vertical diversity in the ecosystem,regulate stocking and species composition,supply forest products to meet public demand and to contribute to the economic vitality of local communities,and restore wildlife habitat.see app.at.
the rod also embraces some of the diverse considerations that provided the original justification for the adoption of the forest plan in.those considerations included tree species mix wildlife species mix forest structure and the fact that management is more problematic in terms of deer browsing requires more and use of herbicides,and is less than management see app.at.
the record shows that in stands treated with methods,the anf is achieving adequate levels of regeneration.in fact,there is as much as a percent reforestation success rate,book at see also app.magistrate judge second r r.moreover,the record reflects the marginal regeneration success rates of management.an appendix to the east side eis explains 
reforestation success with management has been very marginal,whereas results with management have been quite good.large scale implementation is not consistent with the objectives of certain management areas established by the forest plan,and it does not seem prudent until more is known about how to develop adequate tree seedlings of appropriate species.
book at.given this record,we simply can not conclude that the forest service should refrain from pursuing a plan that addresses all of the aforementioned related factors merely because the forest service considered economic factors as well.
the rod also documents why the forest service chose alternative emphasizing management over alternative emphasizing management.the reasons include the following harvesting better achieves the desired future condition in ma of allegheny hardwoods because such species regenerate better with larger forest opening several of the tree species are experiencing decline or disease,and management could result in greater susceptibility to insect and disease outbreaks management is less cost effective and there are general uncertainties as to whether management could meet the needs of the plan.rod,app.at.additional reasons for selecting alternative include the fact that clearcutting is the optimum method for maintaining aspen due to its intolerance for shade management provides abundant sunlight enabling seedlings to quickly grow out of the reach of deer and management improves distribution,increases species diversity and moves the project toward the desired future forest condition for the various mas.rod,app.at.
adp stresses the fact that management tends to increase the amount of black cherry,and we realize that black cherry is a very profitable species.nevertheless,we can not accept the inference that the forest service reached this result primarily because of the economic rewards endemic in management given the conditions in the anf.adp argument would require us to invalidate any properly developed forest management plan that might have a concomitant economic benefit a result that is even less defensible given the congressional mandate to consider economic concerns as long as they do not drive the plan.
this record simply does not support the inference that adp asks us to management was chosen primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return.the record demonstrates that the forest service emphasis on black cherry is not based on the value of the tree alone.black cherry also has numerous environmental benefits,including its superior resilience to drought,deer,and pests such as insects the forest service is surely not required to ignore these benefits merely because black cherry has the additional benefit of its commercial value.accordingly,we can not conclude that the forest service choice of silvicultural practices,which emphasized the regeneration of black cherry,was based primarily on financial concerns.although adp may disagree with the forest service decision to manage ma through harvesting,this disagreement is insufficient to establish that the forest service choice of alternative was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.the record provides ample support for the forest service stated rationale and confirms that management was not selecte
