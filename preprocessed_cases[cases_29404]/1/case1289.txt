hobet mining,llc hobet petitions for review of a decision awarding black lung benefits to carl epling,epling.the administrative law judge alj found that epling was entitled to the benefit of the presumption,a statutory provision that presumes eligibility for benefits when a claimant suffers from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment and has fifteen years of qualifying coal mine employment.see c.because hobet had failed to rebut that presumption,the alj concluded,epling was entitled to benefits.we find that the alj determinations were supported by substantial evidence,and we therefore deny the petition for review.
the black lung benefits act act provides benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis,popularly known as black lung disease.a.to prove entitlement to black lung benefits in the absence of the presumption,an individual must show that he has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment and that this disease is a substantially contributing cause of his totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.see mingo logan coal owens,cir 
t he existence and causes of pneumoconiosis are difficult to determine,and congress accordingly has established a number of evidentiary presumptions to assist miners in proving their claims.broyles,office of workers comp.programs,cir.among them is the presumption at issue in this case,c,which was enacted in,eliminated in,and then restored in the presumption is expressly intended to r elax the often insurmountable burden of proving a black lung claim for the special class of miners with years experience who are disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment,reprinted in.through the presumption,congress has singled out this group of miners for special treatment,making it easier for them to show their entitlement to benefits.regulations implementing the byrd amendments to the black lung benefits act determining coal miners and survivors entitlement to benefits,see also west virginia cwp fund bender,slip op.at cir.
to that end,c provides that,
if a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines,and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.
under the presumption,if a claimant has at least fifteen years of underground coal mine employment and a qualifying respiratory or pulmonary disability,a rebuttable presumption arises that he is entitled to benefits.in other words,we presume both prongs of the showing required for benefits eligibility that the claimant has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment,and that this disease is a substantially contributing cause of his disability.see mingo logan,at.
a coal mine operator may defeat the miner claim by rebutting either of these presumptions.first,an operator may establish that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment.d i.second,the operator may establish that no part of the miner disability was caused by such a disease,id.d ii,a standard under which it must rule out the disease as a cause of the miner disability,bender,slip op.at rose clinchfield coal,cir.
after working for over years in underground coal mines most recently for petitioner hobet in respondent epling is unable to exert himself at all without experiencing shortness of breath.because this impairment prevents epling from performing his previous coal mine employment,which required heavy manual labor,it constitutes a totally disabling respiratory impairment for purposes of the act.
epling filed this claim for benefits under the act in.due to epling long history of coal mine employment and totally disabling respiratory impairment,the alj reviewing his claim applied the presumption,reinstated in while epling case was pending.as required by that provision,the alj presumed both that epling has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment,and that epling pneumoconiosis is a cause of his disabling respiratory impairment.together,those presumptions qualify epling for benefits,absent rebuttal by hobet.
on the first presumption the existence of pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment the alj found that epling does indeed have pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment.hobet does not contest that finding on appeal.accordingly,only the second presumption that epling pneumoconiosis is a cause of his disability is at issue here.
to rebut that presumption,hobet presented the alj with testimony from two doctors,robert crisalli crisalli and kirk hippensteel hippensteel.the alj discredited crisalli testimony in a finding that hobet does not challenge on appeal,and hobet now relies entirely on hippensteel opinion,set forth in a number of submissions over the course of this litigation.
critically,in submissions made between and,hippensteel was unpersuaded that epling suffered from pneumoconiosis at all,though he conceded that the evidence was not unequivocal.as the alj explained,after reviewing chest ct scans,hippensteel believed that the evidence did not indicate pneumoconiosis.in this key respect,hippensteel opinion was directly contrary to the alj finding that epling did have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment.
hippensteel attributed epling respiratory impairments not to pneumoconiosis but instead entirely to obesity and sleep apnea.hippensteel acknowledged abnormalities in epling.he believed,however,that it would be unusual for epling to have developed pneumoconiosis over ten years after he left work in the coal mines.see.and in light of the evidence against pneumoconiosis,he reasoned,it followed that the abnormalities were the result of the obesity and sleep apnea.
at the same time,hippensteel asserted that even if,hypothetically,epling did have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment,that disease would not be the cause of his impairment.by way of explanation,hippensteel offered only his agreement with the views of crisalli,the expert,reciting crisalli opinion as to the cause of epling gas exchange impairment.
in february of,upon review of additional ct scans,hippensteel diagnostic opinion changed,and he concluded that epling did indeed suffer from pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment.but hippensteel did not revisit his causation analysis in light of this new finding.instead,he simply recited again his prior conclusion that epling respiratory problems were not caused by pneumoconiosis.
reviewing this evidence,the alj made the determination central to this appeal that hippensteel opinion that pneumoconiosis did not cause epling disability was entitled to little weight because the doctor had failed to diagnose pneumoconiosis,in direct contradiction to the alj own finding and hippensteel position that it would be unusual for epling to have pneumoconiosis ten years after he ended his coal mine employment was not in accord with the accepted view that coal workers pneumoconiosis is both latent and progressive.see also.having discounted that key testimony,the alj went on to find that hobet could not rebut the presumption that epling pneumoconiosis is a cause of his disability,and awarded benefits to epling.
the benefits review board board affirmed the alj decision.on the weight to be given hippensteel opinion,the board,citing scott mason coal,cir,invoked the rule discrediting causation testimony by a doctor who fails to diagnose pneumoconiosis when,as here,an alj has made a contrary finding.in such cases,a doctor opinion as to causation may not be credited at all unless there are specific and persuasive reasons for concluding that the doctor view on causation is independent of his or her mistaken belief that the claimant does not have pneumoconiosis,in which case it may be assigned,at most,little weight.scott,at quoting toler associated coal,cir.
applying that standard,the board held that the alj had rationally discounted hippensteel opinion.hippensteel failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis could not be salvaged,the board explained,by his hypothetical assumption of the existence
