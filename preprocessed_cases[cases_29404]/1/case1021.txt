opinion of the court 
jose castro,a citizen of costa rica,challenges a determination by the board of immigration appeals bia that he is inadmissible under section a c ii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a c ii,which provides that a ny alien who falsely represents,or has falsely represented,himself or herself to be a citizen of the united states for any purpose or benefit under this chapter including section of this title or any other federal or state law is inadmissible.we conclude that the statute does not apply to castro conduct,and we therefore reverse and remand to the bia.
administrative proceedings 
castro has lived in the united states since entering the country on a visitor visa in,when he was twenty years old.in,he married alma rangel,who became a citizen by naturalization in.castro and rangel have one child,born in new jersey in.
adjustment of status application 
in,castro filed an application to adjust his status to permanent residence based on his marriage to rangel.during his interview with the department of homeland security dhs on his adjustment application,castro disclosed that he had been arrested in.at dhs request,castro provided dhs with a copy of the arrest report for this incident from the paterson,new jersey,police department.the arrest report showed that castro was arrested on september,on a charge of violating stat.ann.b the arrest report listed castro place of birth as puerto rico.castro also provided dhs with documentation showing that he had resolved the charge against him by pleading guilty to a disorderly conduct municipal offense.
dhs concluded,based on the arrest report,that castro had falsely claimed to be from puerto rico rather than costa rica at the time of his arrest.in the agency view,this triggered the bar to admissibility contained in a c ii.on the basis of its inadmissibility determination,dhs concluded that castro was ineligible for adjustment of status to permanent residence dhs notified castro on september,that his application for adjustment of status had been denied and that he could be subject to removal proceedings if he failed to depart from the country voluntarily.
immigration court proceedings 
on february,dhs initiated removal proceedings against castro on the basis of a c ii dhs later added a charge that castro was removable because he had overstayed his visa.a b.castro conceded that he was removable for having overstayed his visa,but he denied that a c ii applied to him.
in the immigration court,castro pursued two forms of relief from removal first,he renewed his previously filed application for adjustment of status to permanent residence second,he applied for cancellation of removal under ina b,b the immigration judge ij held a hearing on castro case on march.at the outset of the hearing,castro counsel observed that he had not yet received the entire administrative record from dhs.that prompted the ij to ask castro counsel whether counsel would like time to review the entire administrative file.castro counsel declined,stating,i do think there anything else relevant regarding the adjustment in the administrative package.
two witnesses testified at the hearing castro and detective william palomino,the paterson police officer who arrested castro and filled out the arrest report.they gave contrasting accounts of castro statements after the arrest.
palomino testified that castro provided him with the information about castro place of birth that palomino entered on the arrest report.he further testified that he spoke spanish and that there was no chance that he could have misunderstood costa rica as puerto rico.on,castro counsel asked palomino a series of questions about the arrest report 
okay,so basically your only recall of this arrest,and it admittedly over three years ago,is from your police arrest report 
looking at your arrest report again,there several things that are not filled in.why did you not fill in his social security number 
he,he did give me one.
and,if he did give you a social security number would that lead you to believe that he may not be a united states citizen 
a.he did know his,not necessarily.he did know his,he did know his social security number.a lot of people do know their social security number at the time when we arrest them.
do you see that box where it says citizen,yes or no,officer 
and,how come there nothing checked there 
i do know,sir.
in addition to the arrest report,dhs submitted to the ij a second document relating to the same incident,entitled jail arrest card.on the jail arrest card,the question citizen had been marked castro counsel also questioned palomino about the jail arrest card 
d o you know who fills out the jail arrest card 
whoever the officer is who is assigned to cellblock,he usually fills it out,but i do know.
palomino also testified about the procedure by which he handled castro case 
okay,would castro saying he was a united states citizen or citizen of costa rica have made any difference regarding your procedure in handling this matter 
q.so there was no benefit gain ed by castro saying he was from puerto rico 
no,there no gain.
okay,and would you treat him any differently if he was incarcerated as a person from puerto rico or costa rica 
q.in your practice and procedure in how you arrest people and how you act,would it make a difference where a person is from to what your job is 
okay,so you would have arrested him regardless of his country and you would have detained him and sent him to jail regardless of his country of birth 
after the conclusion of palomino testimony,castro took the stand.castro testified that he told palomino that he was born in costa rica.he explained that,at the time of his arrest,we were two people in the car and the other guy was puerto rican.as to the jail arrest card,castro stated that he volunteered his driver license at the jail but that he did not provide any additional personal information.
castro also testified that he first saw the arrest report on the second day after i was arrested and that he returned to the police station to tell an officer that the report was incorrect.when the ij asked castro why he went back to the police,castro answered because my wife read the arrest report and told me that it was incorrect.castro explained that he was about to submit his application for adjustment of status to permanent residence and that he was concerned that what was being said in the report was erroneous.castro testified that when the police officer told him that the error as to his place of birth was not a problem,castro explained to the officer that yes that was a problem because automatically they will send me back to my country and i been here in this country many years.
at the conclusion of the march,hearing,the ij issued an oral opinion accompanied by a written summary.the ij credited palomino testimony that castro gave his place of birth as puerto rico.from this,the ij inferred that castro had made a false claim to citizenship.
the ij further concluded that castro had falsely claimed to be a citizen for a purpose or benefit under federal or state law,within the meaning of a c ii.he explained his reasoning as follows 
this is the more difficult issue.counsel claims there is some kind of case law.there has been no brief by respondent counsel.there has been no specific board case,other circuit case,or circuit case proffered here today.and,we have as a factual matter,respondent own testimony here today that he knew the potential consequences because he was going to be applying for legal status in the united states.
now,i want to make it clear here the respondent indicated that,has already acknowledge d that he has no legal status.so,it is clear to this court that there is a direct benefit here for someone because if you have a crime,you may face some sort of legal consequences.counsel pointed out that this may alone not have been enough,but it goes to the issue of discretion and he chose,respondent chose not to be candid with his country of designation as the court understood his testimony here today.
respondent further testified that his wife had a naturalization application pending and that this would have,may have had a deleterious impact on that for him as well.so there you have a series of benefits.you have the benefit of someone who had no legal status and having an arrest come up.you had someone who was in the process of filing for an adjustment of status,its impact therein is a matter of discretion and you have the wife seeking naturalization and the impact this would have on the naturalization process which respondent readily acknowledged.
therefore,i unfortunately find that the respondent did make a false claim to citizenship in an effort to obtain a benefit.in this instance to stay in the united states.
because the ij found castro to be inadmissible under a c ii,he denied castro application for adjustment of status.without stating his reasons for doing so,the ij also denied castro application for cancellation of removal.having thus denied both of castro applications for relief from removal,the ij ordered that castro be removed to costa rica.
proceedings before the bia 
appeal of the merits 
castro counsel filed a notice of appeal with the bia on april.in the notice,the stated ground of appeal was that the ij improperly interpreted the law in finding that castro made a false claim to citizenship in order to receive a legal benefit.
attached to the notice of appeal was a copy of a letter dated september,addressed to the attorney of jose castro from sergeant thomas trommelen of the paterson police department.in the letter,trommelen stated,i spoke with palomino who said it was possible castro could have said costa rico sic as apposed sic to puerto rico when he asked him for his place of birth that night.the notice of appeal made no reference to the attached letter,and no separate written brief was filed on castro behalf with the bia in support of the notice of appeal.
on january,a panel of the bia,one member dissenting,issued a decision affirming the ij denial of castro application for adjustment of status.the bia unanimously found no clear error in the ij determination that castro told palomino that he was born in puerto rico.the board acknowledged receipt of trommelen letter but declined to consider it because castro ha d not demonstrated that the letter,dated september,was not available and could not have been discovered or presented in the hearing before the immigration judge.
a majority of the bia panel also upheld the ij determination that castro statement that he had been born in puerto rico satisfied a c ii.the majority reasoned that castro had made a false claim to citizenship for a purpose or benefit under federal or state law,within the meaning of a c ii,because inter alia,the respondent had no status in this country,and evidently feared being turned over to the department of homeland security.bia member patricia cole dissented on this point,stating,i do not find the section a c ii of the act charge to be sustained because the record does not establish that the respondent met the purpose or benefit requirement for this charge.
having upheld the ij inadmissibility determination,the bia dismissed castro appeal,thereby sustaining the ij order that castro be removed to costa rica.the bia did not address the ij denial of castro application for cancellation of removal under u.b 
motion to reconsider 
on february,castro filed a motion to reconsider the bia decision,arguing that the bia erred in adopting the ij application of a c ii.castro maintained that he did not say that he was from puerto rico and,alternatively,that giving his place of birth as puerto rico would not satisfy a c ii under the circumstances.additionally,castro argued that the failure of dhs to provide him with a copy of trommelen letter violated due process.
on june,the bia denied castro motion to reconsider its prior decision,concluding that castro had not shown any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome.castro then filed the present petition for review of the bia denial of his motion to reconsider.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
petition for review of denial of reconsideration 
the scope of our jurisdiction is contested by the parties.we review questions of our own jurisdiction de novo.higgs att y,cir.
castro filed a timely petition for review of the bia june,order denying his motion to reconsider.he did not file a petition for review of the bia january,decision on the merits of his administrative appeal.
an adverse bia decision on the merits and accompanying order of removal and a bia order denying a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders.stone ins,d.either one may be the subject of a petition for judicial review,which must be filed within thirty days of the date of the order.a,b.as the government points out,filing a motion to reconsider does not toll the period for seeking review of the earlier merits decision.stone,at see also khalil att y,app x,cir,cert.denied,d.when judicial review is sought of both a bia decision on the merits and a bia decision on reconsideration,the two petitions for review must be consolidated and considered together.b.but nothing prevents a petitioner from seeking review of only one of the two bia orders.see,nocon ins,cir only reviewing denial of motion to reconsider.
the government contends that castro decision to seek review of the bia reconsideration decision,but not the bia earlier merits decision,curtails our jurisdiction to consider the merits of his arguments against inadmissibility and removability.in the government view,these arguments are,in effect,an untimely appeal of the bia earlier decision.we disagree.some review of the merits decision is required in order to determine whether the bia erred in concluding,on reconsideration,that castro had not shown any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome.
the bia has described a motion for reconsideration as a request that the board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments,a change of law,or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.matter of ramos,bia see also b.thus,b y its very nature,a motion for reconsideration alleges defects of some sort in the underlying decision by the bia,such that judicial review of the denial of a motion for reconsideration ordinarily requires some review of the underlying decision.esenwah ashcroft,cir see also narine holder,cir reviewing issues addressed in bia merits decision on petition for review of bia denial of motion to reconsider.
we review a bia denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.pllumi att y,cir.as a consequence,a petitioner who only seeks review of a bia order on reconsideration forgoes any more favorable standard of review that might have applied had the petitioner sought review of the bia underlying decision on the merits.esenwah,at.nevertheless,without some appraisal of the underlying merits,it would not be possible for an appellate court to evaluate whether the bia abused its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider the merits.
the bia abuses its discretion when it acts in a manner that is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to the law.guo ashcroft,cir.questions of law are reviewed de novo,subject to any applicable administrative law canons of deference.fadiga att y,cir citing borges gonzales,cir.
exhaustion 
the government also argues that castro failure to exhaust some of his claims presents a jurisdictional barrier to our review.we may review a final order of the bia only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.the exhaustion requirement attaches to each particular issue raised by the petitioner.lin att y,cir.a petitioner failure to exhaust an issue by presenting it to the bia deprives us of jurisdiction to consider that issue.id.at hua wu att y,cir.
we agree that exhaustion presents a barrier to reviewing one issue that castro raises for the first time in his briefing to this court namely,that the arrest report and jail arrest card generated after his arrest should not have been admitted in his removal proceedings because the loitering law under which he was arrested was unconstitutional.castro never presented that issue to the i
