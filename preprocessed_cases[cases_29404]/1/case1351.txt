kevin morrison,a resident of maryland,was born in jamaica and can not read or write english.he filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc or commission asserting that appellee randstad,which provides temporary staffing services to client companies,terminated his employment pursuant to a requirement that its employees read and write english.morrison alleged that randstad literacy policy violated title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,u,et.two years later,in an amended charge,morrison asserted that the literacy policy violated the americans with disabilities act ada,et,because he has a learning disability.in investigating morrison charges,the eeoc served an administrative subpoena on randstad,which randstad resisted,in part.when the eeoc sought judicial enforcement of its subpoena,the district court denied relief.for the following reasons,we reverse the order of the district court denying enforcement.
randstad has branch offices in states,including thirteen offices in maryland.in any given week the company employs a total of approximately individuals randstad internal talent who recruit,screen,and hire temporary and permanent employees for client companies,and randstad external talent who are on assignment to randstad customers.randstad focuses its staffing services on two main types of clients light industrial clients that use laborers in manufacturing or warehouse settings,and administrative clients that use clerical and administrative employees in office settings.
in august,morrison approached randstad hagerstown,maryland office,seeking temporary employment.he was ineligible for assignment with randstad administrative clients because he does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent,and so randstad placed him in industrial positions.he first successfully completed a assignment as a mail clerk for randstad client good humor.in september,randstad referred morrison to two temporary warehouse positions,one at ashley home store,and the other at cosmic pet products.according to randstad,both clients terminated morrison within days because of poor performance.during that time randstad was not aware that morrison could not read or write.
morrison did not seek any additional assignments for more than a year.in september,however,he returned to randstad hagerstown office in search of another temporary work assignment.as before,randstad sent him to fill a warehouse job,this time with lenox.upon arriving at lenox facilities,he was asked to fill out some forms.unable to read or write,morrison called his placement manager at randstad to ask if she would help him complete the forms.according to morrison,the manager told him,we do hire people who can not read.come back when you learn to read.on september,randstad ended morrison assignment and informed him that,although it remained willing to place him in the future,it would do so only if he were to develop remedial reading and writing skills.
on january,morrison filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.a checkbox on the form identified the type of discrimination as national origin discrimination and the following allegations stated 
on september,randstad denied me placement in a position with its customer lenox.randstad had previously placed me in jobs in and.randstad sent me to lenox where i was given forms to complete and return.i called randstad and spoke with renee.i asked renee if randstad could assistance sic me in completing the forms i received from lenox.i was told we do hire people who can not read.come back when you learn to read.
ii.i was given no explanation for randstad discriminatory action.
iii.i believe i have been discriminated against in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,regarding failure to hire because of my national origin,jamaican.
the eeoc served a copy of the charge on randstad on february,and began to investigate.
randstad timely responded to the charge.it admitted that morrison was terminated because he could not read,but denied that the termination was the result of national origin discrimination.rather,randstad explained,the company maintained an unwritten policy against hiring people who can not read because virtually all of the assignments that randstad is called upon to fill require reading writing skills.as for the administrative positions,most of randstad clients have minimum education requirements indeed,the eeoc has since conceded that morrison was not eligible for an administrative position.as for randstad industrial clients,the company explained that although there is no written policy requiring that employees be literate,the inability to read and comprehend safety notices,warnings,or machinery operating instructions potentially would place morrison and his at risk of serious injury.because the company unwritten literacy policy was justified,randstad argued,and because there was no evidence of discriminatory animus on randstad behalf toward morrison,the eeoc should enter a no cause finding in morrison case.id.
the eeoc investigation remained open for approximately two years without the commission issuing a request for information or seeking any other information concerning morrison allegations.during that time morrison underwent a psychological evaluation that revealed an intellectual disability mild retardation that prevents him from reading and writing.on january,over two years after filing the original charge,morrison filed an amended charge of discrimination.the amended charge contained two changes.first,instead of the checkbox for national origin discrimination,the checkbox for disability discrimination was marked.second,in the last sentence of the factual allegation section,the allegation that randstad actions violated title vii was replaced with the following i believe i have been discriminated against in violation of the ada regarding failure to accommodate because of my disability.as the eeoc explained,morrison allegedly has a learning disability that prevents him from learning to read and write english 
randstad was given notice of the amended charge on february.in response,randstad stated that its original position statement was largely unaffected by the amendment,but it supplement ed its prior letter by arguing that morrison charge of disability discrimination lacked merit because illiteracy is only a protected disability under the ada if it stems from an organic dysfunction rather than a lack of education,quoting morisky broward county,cir,and there was no evidence that morrison illiteracy follows from a physical or mental impairment.id.randstad also argued that,even if morrison illiteracy was a protected disability,he had an obligation to inform randstad of the impairment but failed to do so.
the eeoc issued a request for information rfi seeking,among other things,information about any literacy requirements randstad imposes,and a list of all position assignments made by randstad hagerstown office from through in response,randstad explained that although the company did not have a formal literacy policy,a significant number of assignments require reading and writing skills,and so randstad requires talent to be at least literate at a remedial level.as for information on other position assignments,randstad objected,arguing the request was unduly burdensome and that the information requested was irrelevant to the resolution of morrison charge.
the eeoc maintained that morrison charge authorized it to obtain the requested information,and not just for randstad hagerstown office.thus,on january,it issued an administrative subpoena that requested,among other things,documents or a data compilation setting forth all position assignments made by randstad during the period january,through the present.after randstad objected to the time period and nationwide scope of the subpoena,the commission narrowed the geographic scope to randstad thirteen maryland offices but otherwise insisted on receiving information on all position assignments made by those offices for the years through.randstad provided information about the positions to which morrison himself was assigned,at good humor,lenox,and the two other temporary warehouse positions in september,but otherwise refused to comply.
thus,the eeoc filed the instant petition for enforcement of the disputed portion of the subpoena the requested information namely 
documents or a data compilation setting forth all position assignments made by randstad thirteen maryland offices from through,including position title,client name,and the date the assignment was filled 
copies of job orders and job descriptions for each position 
copies of all applications for each position and 
a statement for each position as to whether reading and writing was required for the position.
the eeoc petition for enforcement asserted that both title vii and the ada,combined with morrison original and amended charges of discrimination,authorized it to obtain the information and documents sought under the subpoena.title vii authorized the investigation,the commission asserted,because randstad literacy requirement may have a disparate impact on jamaicans and others who are not fluent in english due to their national origin.in addition,the commission asserted,because morrison illiteracy resulted in part from a learning disability,and because d iscrimination based on ability to read may constitute a violation of the ada,the subpoena was also authorized by the ada.the commission argued that information about all of randstad positions in maryland was relevant because if contrary to randstad representation some randstad positions do not actually require reading skills,the fact that randstad nevertheless hires only people who can read could be evidence of discrimination.such evidence could also uncover the existence of other individuals who have been harmed by randstad literacy policy.j.
the district court ordered randstad to show cause why the subpoena should not be enforced pursuant to title vii the ada.in its answer,randstad first argued that morrison charges of discrimination did not authorize the investigation because although randstad generally does not give assignments to people who can not read,that is not because the company discriminates against or individuals,but rather because reading is an implicit requirement for virtually every light industrial client assignment.while randstad has never maintained a policy against hiring individuals who can not read and write,it argued,it typically has no work for talent who lack remedial reading skills.randstad human resources manager asserted that it sometimes fills positions that involve purely manual labor where reading may not be required,but such positions are rare,are not a focus of randstad business,and would ordinarily not be in a factory or warehouse setting.
second,randstad argued that,to the extent the eeoc relies on the ada,morrison amended charge was untimely on its face because it alleged a new theory of recovery and therefore did not relate back to the date of his original charge.third,randstad argued that,even if one or both of morrison charges were timely,information on positions other than the ones to which morrison was assigned was not relevant because morrison did not allege systemic discrimination or that randstad policies have a disparate impact on a protected class.fourth,randstad argued,even if some of the requested information was relevant,the subpoena should not be enforced because complying with the subpoena would be unduly burdensome.its maryland branches made over temporary assignments during the time period of the subpoena.due to the structure of randstad databases,compiling the requested information would require a database administrator,it developer,and business analyst each to spend hours reviewing job orders,at a labor cost of to.
the eeoc argued it had jurisdiction to investigate under both title vii and the ada because morrison original charge remained in effect and the amended charge allegation of disability discrimination flow s from the national origin discrimination because they are both the result of the same literacy requirement.it argued the full scope of the materials sought were relevant because respondent refusal to assign morrison based on his inability to read and write may not be an isolated incident,but rather may be an instance of a larger discriminatory practice of turning away illiterate individuals when there is available work within their skill sets.moreover,the eeoc argued,randstad position that it typically has no work for talent who lack remedial reading skills,was belied by the fact that morrison himself was placed in several positions.finally,it argued,there was no undue burden because randstad cost estimate could not have been correct if it were,it would mean the three employees preparing the materials would receive annual salaries of nearly,and in any event a showing that production will three employees for a week do es not rise to the level of establishing undue burden.
at a hearing on the commission petition,the eeoc reiterated its position that there were two independent bases for the commission authority to issue the subpoena title vii and the ada.with respect to title vii,morrison original charge alleged that randstad literacy requirement discriminated on the basis of national origin.the commission explained that the information requested was relevant to alleged national origin discrimination because a reading requirement is going to have a disparate impact on people of varying national origin.citing a department of education study,the commission explained,o f the people who read at the lowest levels,percent of them are people who are learning english currently,so there is a broad overlap between people who are unable to read and people who have a unique national origin.
the second basis of authority for the subpoena,the commission argued,was the ada,arising out of morrison amended charge,which alleged that the literacy requirement discriminated on the basis of disability.the commission recognized that if the amended charge had been filed as a standalone charge,it would have been untimely.the commission argued that the amended charge related back to the original charge,however,because the disability discrimination claim arises out of the same factual allegations raised in the original charge,and the amended charge merely altered the statute under which the alleged discrimination constitutes an unlawful employment practice.
the district court denied the eeoc petition to enforce the subpoena.see eeoc randstad,d.as for title vii,the district court rejected on relevance grounds morrison national origin discrimination claim as a basis for enforcing the subpoena that is,assuming morrison original charge triggered title vii as a basis for the eeoc authority to investigate,the court disagreed with the commission alleged factual nexus between national origin discrimination and literacy requirements.information related to reading and writing requirements for particular positions relates to the matter of reading and writing ability,not national origin,the court stated.in particular,the court expressed skepticism about the causal link between morrison jamaican origin and his illiteracy 
jamaica is an english speaking island.it not haiti i not really sure where you make the jump from a national origin claim of discrimination to the matter of literacy in english,particularly from a country that,in fact,does have english as its basic native language.clearly there is what is known as patois spoken by other members of the community there,sometimes those with lesser education.but english is clearly spoken in kingston and in montego bay.english is the spoken language in jamaica.
thus,the court apparently concluded,none of the information requested in the subpoena would be relevant to morrison charge of national origin discrimination.
as for the ada,the district court rejected the commission argument,reasoning that when the amended charge added the ada claim,a new theory of recovery was put forward and an amendment to an eeoc charge alleging a new theory of recovery does not relate back to the original charge.randstad,d at citing evans tech.applications serv,cir.thus,the court concluded it did not have jurisdiction to enforce the subpoena under the ada.
the court also offered two alternative grounds for declining to enforce the subpoena under the ada.first,the court found that even if it had jurisdiction under the ada,any information beyond that which randstad had already produced was irrelevant to morrison charge of disability discrimination by randstad hagerstown office.the court ruled that because the subpoena requested information about all randstad positions including administrative positions,for which morrison was concededly unqualified,for all maryland offices even though morrison solely sought employment by randstad in its hagerstown office,and for a period after morrison termination even though morrison was employed by randstad only from august until september,the information requested was beyond the scope permitted by the amended charge.id.at.second,the court ruled that,even if it had jurisdiction under the ada or title vii,and even if the requested materials were relevant,the cost of compliance with the subpoena to according to randstad rendered the requests unduly burdensome.id.at.
the eeoc sought reconsideration,which the district court denied,and then timely appealed.
title vii proscribes discriminatory employment practices on the basis of,among other things,national origin.the ada proscribes discriminatory employment practices based on disability,including an employer failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.a,b a.each statute authorizes the eeoc to investigate instances of discrimination,but only if a charge of discrimination has been made with respect to a particular person or entity.b a.
if a charge of discrimination triggers the eeoc authority to investigate under title vii or the ada,the eeoc may access any evidence that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by the statute and is relevant to the charge under investigation.a see also describing the investigatory powers of the national labor relations board,which the eeoc also may exercise pursuant to title vii,see,and the ada,see a.if a respondent does not comply voluntarily with requests for such evidence,the eeoc may issue an administrative subpoena,a,and may petition for enforcement in federal district court.id.see also eeoc shell oil,d explaining that the existence of a charge of discrimination relevant to material being sought through an administrative subpoena is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the enforcement of the subpoena.

we first explain why,contrary to the district court conclusion,the eeoc had authority to investigate morrison charges under both the ada and title vii.we then explain why the requested materials were within the scope of the commission investigatory authority.the applicable legal standards thus clarified,we conclude that the commission is entitled to an order enforcing its subpoena.
we first address whether the eeoc had authority to seek enforcement of the subpoena under the ada under title vii.this requires that we decide whether the amended charge alleging an ada violation relates back to the date the original charge was filed,and whether the original charge alleging a title vii violation continued to trigger the eeoc investigatory authority even after the amended charge was filed.
as explained above,morrison amended charge,filed on january,alleged that randstad discriminated against him by refusing to accommodate his alleged learning disability,and thereby violated the ada.as an original charge,the ada charge clearly would have been untimely.the question on appeal is whether the amended charge,which alleged the same facts as the original charge refusal to give him temporary employment because he could not read but asserted that those facts violated a different statute the ada instead of title vii relates back to january,the filing date of the original charge.
eeoc regulations provide that an amended charge will relate back to the date the charge was first received if the amendment cure s technical defects or omissions,including failure to verify the charge,clarif ies and amplif ies allegations made therein,or alleg es additional acts which constitute unlawful employment practices related to or growing out of the subject matter of the original charge.b as noted,the factual allegations in morrison two charges were identical that randstad denied him placement because it maintains a policy of not hiring people who can not read.morrison originally alleged that the literacy requirement was discriminatory because it imposed unwarranted disadvantages on people who,like him,were from another country.in his amended charge,he alleged that the same literacy requirement,which led to the same adverse employment decision,was discriminatory for a different reason it disadvantaged people who,like him he had later learned,have a learning disability.
the commission argues morrison amended charge merely clarifie d that there is another possible explanation for the employment action referenced in the original charge disability discrimination.appellant br.at.the commission argues that morrison amended charge relates back under the clarify and amplify prong of b because b is a reasonable exercise of the eeoc authority under the ada and entitled to deference,and its interpretation of b as applying to morrison amendment is also reasonable and entitled to deference.we agree.
congress has expressly delegated to the eeoc the authority to promulgate suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of title vii and the ada.a.section b is a reasonable exercise of that authority.indeed,randstad does not argue b exceeded the eeoc authority,and for good reason.we have recognized the wide discretion congress granted the eeoc to promulgate procedural regulations governing discrimination charges.eeoc bethlehem steel,cir.in edelman lynchburg college,d,the court unanimously upheld a different aspect of b as a reasonable exercise of the eeoc authority under a as justice observed in addressing yet another aspect of the eeoc administrative processes,deference to the eeoc is particularly appropriate when it comes to eeoc regulations involving a technical issue of agency procedure.eeoc commercial office,d,concurring.just as the edelman court upheld the eeoc interpretation of title vii as permitting relation back of a verified charge to the filing date of a prior unverified charge,we hold that the eeoc acted reasonably in interpreting the ada as permitting relation back of a charge that clarif ies and amplif ies allegations made in a prior charge.
we also find reasonable the eeoc interpretation of b as permitting relation back of the amended charge here.as noted,b permits an amended charge to relate back if it clarif ies and amplif ies allegations made in a prior timely charge.in arguing that morrison amended charge relates back,the eeoc interprets the phrase clarif ies and amplif ies allegations as encompassing amended charges in which,as here,the charging party makes no new factual allegations but rather solely revises his or her charge to allege that the same facts constitute a violation of a different statute.an agency interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted bethlehem steel,at upholding eeoc interpretation of regulation because the interpretation was reasonable.
the eeoc interpretation is not inconsistent with b,and we see no reason to find it plainly erroneous.time limits serve to encourage a potential charging party to raise a discrimination claim before it gets stale,for the sake of a reliable result and a speedy end to any illegal practice that proves out,edelman,at,and to protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past,delaware state coll.ricks,d.interpreting b as applying to amended charges that alter solely the statutory basis or legal theory of recovery is entirely consistent with these purposes.morrison amendment did not assert a stale claim because it did not allege any discriminatory incidents other than those already included in the original charge.rather,it asserted that the same adverse employment action was at least in part the product of a different type of discrimination disability discrimination.relating back the ada charge to the date of the original charge does not require randstad to defend against a stale claim arising from an employment decision that is long past.moreover,there is no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter,and the commission position is not a post hoc rationalization advanced simply to defend past agency action against attack.auer,at.this is also not a situation where the underlying regulation does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself,in which case auer deference would be unwarranted.gonzales oregon,d.
for these reasons,we defer to the eeoc promulgation of b and its interpretation thereof.accord washington kroger,cir holding that,based on an earlier version of b,an amended charge relates back where it alleges the same facts as the original charge even though the nature of discrimination alleged is different citing b sanchez standard brands,cir also citing the precursor to b,and allowing a national origin discrimination charge to relate back to the date of a prior sex discrimination charge because a charging party failure to attach the correct legal conclusion to the factual allegations contained in a charge of discrimination is a mere technical defect see also id.at the selection of the type of discrimination alleged,the selection of which box to check,is in reality nothing more than the attachment of a legal conclusion to the facts alleged.in the context of a statute like title vii it is inconceivable that a charging party rights should be cut off merely because he fails to articulate correctly the legal conclusion emanating from his factual allegations.
as noted above,the district court relied on evans,at,for the proposition that an amendment to an eeoc charge alleging a new theory of recovery does not relate back to the original charge.randstad,d at.that reliance was misplaced.first,evans was a case deciding the merits of a discrimination claim at the summary judgment stage,whereas this case presents a proceeding to enforce an administrative subpoena.because the strength of the nexus between factual allegations in an original charge and a theory of recovery requires some degree of inquiry into the merits,and because the eeoc has presented a plausible nexus here,evans is of limited authority for refusing to enforce the eeoc subpoena.second,in evans,the plaintiff filed her private lawsuit very shortly after amending her charge,which prevented the local agency from investigating her allegation of age discrimination.a crucial reason we rejected the plaintiff argument in evans was because permitting relation back in those circumstances depriv ed the employer of adequate notice and result ed in a failure to investigate by the responsible agency.evans,at.this case presents the opposite scenario.as the eeoc cogently explains,n ot only has no private lawsuit been filed,but the dispute exists because the eeoc is attempting to complete its investigation of morrison discrimination claims.appellant br.at.third,although pursuant to the age discrimination in employment act,the statute at issue in evans,the eeoc has determined that a charge alleging a violation of one statute may be amended to allege that the alleged discrimination constitutes an unlawful employment practice under another statute administered and enforced by the commission,c,it appears c was not brought to the court attention in evans.thus,evans has no bearing on the appropriate level of deference due to the commission promulgation of b.
for these reasons,we hold that the amended charge of discrimination relates back to the filing date of the original charge and that the eeoc had authority under the ada to investigate matters relevant to that charge.
the commission also argues that title vii,not just the ada,authorized it to investigate,and thus its authority encompassed morrison claim that randstad discriminated against him on the basis of national origin as explained above,the original charge,which randstad concedes was timely filed,alleged that morrison was terminated because he is jamaican.the amended charge alleged only that the termination was the result of disability discrimination it omitted the allegation of national origin discrimination and replaced the checkmark for national origin discrimination with a checkmark for disability discrimination.the eeoc argues this omission is immaterial because the original charge was never resolved or dismissed and therefore continues to serve as a jurisdictional basis for the subpoena.appellant br.at.as above,the eeoc argument turns on the reasonableness of both its regulations and its interpretation thereof 
under the eeoc regulations,a charge may be resolved in one of five ways if the eeoc makes a finding of cause makes a finding of no cause dismisses the charge or if the charging party withdraws the charge or if the parties reach a negotiated settlement.the first three require that the commission give notice to the parties.see finding of cause id.finding of no cause id.dismissal.similarly,a withdrawal or settlement requires the consent of the commission.see id.withdrawal of charge id.settlement.the eeoc argues that none of these dispositions occurred after all,the commission never gave notice of a finding of cause,no cause,or dismissal,and never gave consent to a withdrawal or settlement.rather,it argues,under b the additional information in morrison amended charge was simply incorporated into the original charge,and thus when morrison amended his charge,morrison original allegation of national origin discrimination remained in place.appellant br.at.
section b,the same regulation the commission relies upon for its ada argument,does not expressly address the scenario here.it provides in pertinent part that a charge may be amended to cure technical defects or omissions,including failure to verify the charge,or to clarify and amplify allegations made therein.the eeoc regulation that governs the withdrawal of charges also does not address whether a charging party who files an amended charge that omits a previously asserted legal theory has withdrawn that portion of the original charge.see a charge filed by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved may be withdrawn only by the person claiming to be aggrieved and only with the consent of the commission.
we find the phrase a charge may be amended to clarify and amplify allegations made therein,b,to be ambiguous as applied to the scenario here it is consistent with,but does not necessarily require,the conclusion that the original charge remained in effect even after the amended charge sought to clarify and amplify the original charge.thus,the dispositive question again becomes whether the eeoc interpretation of b is plainly erroneous,auer,at.we easily conclude it is not.morrison original charge put randstad on notice that the eeoc might investigate his allegations of national origin discrimination.see sydnor fairfax,cir explaining that requiring a party to file a charge with the eeoc ensures that the employer is put on notice of the alleged violations and places the resolution of employment discrimination disputes initially in the hands of the eeoc internal quotation and citation omitted.although upon receiving notice of the amended charge randstad may have assumed the eeoc investigation would focus instead on the allegation of disability discrimination,any minimal prejudice which is all but randstad may have perceived does not render the eeoc interpretation of b plainly erroneous.the procedure should not become a tripwire for hapless plaintiffs.sydnor,at.
for these reasons,the original charge triggered the eeoc investigatory authority under title vii,and the amended charge because it related back triggered its authority under the ada.accordingly,the eeoc had jurisdiction under both statutes to issue and seek enforcement of the administrative subpoena.
once the eeoc has authority to investigate a particular charge of discrimination,it may access any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by this subchapter and is relevant to the charge under investigation.a emphasis added see also a incorporating into the ada by reference.the relevant to the charge requirement contrasts the eeoc investigatory authority from that of other federal agencies that possess plenary authority to demand to see records relevant to matters within their jurisdiction.shell oil,at.tellingly,however,a charge of discrimination is not the equivalent of a complaint initiating a lawsuit.id.at.rather,it serves to place the eeoc on notice that someone either a party claiming to be aggrieved or a commissioner believes that an employer has violated the title.id.
once a charge has placed the commission on notice that a particular employer is or may be violating title vii or the ada in a particular way,the commission may access virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.id.at.this definition of relevance necessarily is broader than evidentiary relevance because in this context w e determine relevancy in terms of the investigation,eeoc lockheed martin,aero naval systems,cir internal quotation marks omitted,not in terms of litigation of the merits of the underlying charge.see eeoc konica minolta bus.solutions,cir analogizing an eeoc investigation to civil discovery under.b,where r elevant,and thereby discoverable,information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.congress has delegated to the eeoc the authority to investigate charges of discrimination,and naturally the agency has developed expertise in that area.in this and other areas,where an agency is tasked with investigation,we defer to an agency own appraisal of what is relevant so long as it is not obviously wrong.lockheed martin,at citing ftc invention submission.accordingly,although we must be careful not to render the relevance requirement a nullity,it is not especially constraining,shell oil,at,precisely because we largely defer to the eeoc expertise.
as noted,the requested materials include information on all positions made by randstad maryland offices from to,including position descriptions and copies of applications for each position.the question is whether and to what extent these materials were relevant to the eeoc investigation of morrison charges,which alleged that he had approached only the hagerstown office for assignments,and was terminated in september as the result of alleged disability national origin discrimination.the district court concluded that none of the requested materials were relevant.the district court application of an unduly strict standard of relevance amounted to legal error,leading to an abuse of discretion.applying the correct standard,with deference to the eeoc assessment of relevance,we conclude that all of the eeoc requested materials fall within the broad definition of relevance applicable to eeoc administrative subpoenas.
as for morrison charge of national origin discrimination,the eeoc argues the requested materials are relevant as follows 
the information requested in items and will assist the eeoc in determining whether randstad imposes a literacy requirement that discriminates on the basis of national origin.knowing the types of jobs into which randstad has placed individuals since january,the year morrison first sought work through randstad,will assist the eeoc in ascertaining whether randstad is correct when it claims that an ability to read is needed to perform all of its laborer positions,or whether randstad has made other placements like the good humor job morrison did in september that can be performed successfully even without an ability to read.this information,in turn,will help the eeoc determine whether randstad professed literacy requirement eliminates from consideration individuals who could perform the jobs in question but are nevertheless excluded simply because they can not read and write english because their national origin is somewhere other than the united states and their native language is not english.
appellant br.at.this appraisal of what is relevant is not obviously wrong,lockheed martin,at,because the requested information might cast light on morrison allegations of national origin discrimination,shell oil,at.accordingly,we defer to the eeoc assessment of relevance.
the district court rejected the argument that the requested materials were relevant to morrison charge of national origin discrimination because it disbelieved one premise of the commission relevance argument,namely,that someone from jamaica might be less proficient in english because he is from jamaica.that is,the court discerned no factual nexus between morrison jamaican origin and his illiteracy,apparently because although some people in jamaica speak the language patois,english is also predominant.see observing that although in jamaica there is what is known as patois spoken by other members of the community there,sometimes those with lesser education,english is clearly spoken in kingston and in montego bay.
at the stage,however,any effort by the court to assess the likelihood that the commission would be able to prove the claims made in the charge would be reversible error.shell oil,at.the eeoc authority to investigate is not negated simply because the party under investigation may have a valid defense to a later suit.eeoc united air lines,cir.although there may sometimes be a fine line between,on the one hand,assessing the relevance of requested information to a charging party allegations and,on the other hand,determin ing whether the charge of discrimination is well founded or verifiable,shell oil,at,we conclude that the district court rejection of the eeoc alleged factual nexus crossed the line into an assessment of the merits of morrison claim.the effect of inquiring into the merits was essentially to require the eeoc to make a reasonable cause showing as a prerequisite to enforcement of the subpoena.graniteville eeoc,cir.this served not only to place the cart before the horse,but to substitute a different driver the district court for the one appointed by congress the eeoc.id.see also eeoc dillon,cir we will not either encourage or allow an employer to turn a summary proceeding into a by allowing it to interpose defenses that are more properly addressed at trial.the eeoc has satisfied the relevancy requirement as to the title vii charge.
the eeoc argues the requested materials are also relevant to the charge of disability discrimination,as it explains 
randstad terminated morrison employment because the company concluded that absent an ability to read a condition that,in morrison,may be the result of
