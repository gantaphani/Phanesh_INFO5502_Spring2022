donna randolph filed a complaint in united states district court for the southern district of ohio against the ohio department of youth services,asserting claims of sex discrimination,sexual harassment,and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the district court granted the ohio department of youth services motion for summary judgment in its entirety.randolph now appeals.
for the following reasons,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
randolph claims arise out of her employment with the state of ohio as a food service worker in the circleville youth center cyc from april until december.cyc is an,youth intake facility.donald feldkamp,cyc superintendent,initiated a cadre program at cyc in that was designed to provide job training to inmates who were nearing their release dates.a few cadre members were assigned to the kitchen,where they worked directly alongside randolph and other food service workers.the events giving rise to randolph lawsuit stem from her interaction with the cadre members in the kitchen.
initially,we note that there is much conflicting evidence in the record about randolph interaction with cadre members.we make no effort to summarize it all but instead focus on the evidence produced by randolph in opposing summary judgment because it is the sufficiency of this evidence that governs our analysis.
randolph claimed in her deposition that the cadre members daily listened to music with lyrics that were degrading to women and used body language that was offensive to the female workers.additionally,randolph and other workers stated in deposition testimony that the cadre members used offensive language to address the female workers and to describe their bodies and that they directed the foul language only toward the female workers.randolph stated in her deposition that while she believes that she and other female workers complained about these issues,the cadre members behavior did not interfere with her work life because she was a hard worker.nonetheless,randolph claimed in her deposition that cyc failed to adequately address the complaints.in addition,sandra fletcher,another food service worker,stated in her deposition that supervisor doug smith verbally castigated and physically threatened her for complaining about a cadre member.randolph also claimed in her deposition that complaints about the cadre members behaviors often exacerbated those behaviors and fletcher and joanna tinney,another food service worker,testified that the verbal harassment escalated and became far more threatening over time.
according to randolph testimony,the harassment eventually became physical.she testified that jh,one of the inmates,tried to sexually assault her.jh came upon her as she was walking toward the staff bathroom and put something that she feared was a knife against her back.randolph testified that jh forced her into the bathroom and shut and locked the door.jh ordered her to pull down her pants,but there was a sudden knock on the door.jh left,telling randolph not to come out until she heard another knock at the door.randolph did not immediately report the encounter.
randolph testified that jh sexually assaulted her on a second occasion in may.jh again forced her into a staff bathroom and shut and locked the door once inside.jh turned her around,hitting her head against the mirror,and got on top of her.randolph testimony is unclear as to whether penetration occurred she stated that she may have blocked it out.jh left the bathroom when he heard a knock on the door and told randolph not to leave until she heard another knock.randolph again failed to immediately report the assault to anyone at cyc.
randolph testified in her deposition that subsequent to the alleged sexual assault,the inmates began taunting and verbally harassing her about the incident.randolph told two of the inmates to tell jh that she was going to report both encounters.jh later found randolph and was infuriated.randolph testified that he threw her against a kitchen appliance and lifted her off the floor by the throat.tinney observed the altercation and in her deposition corroborated randolph account of the events.doug smith entered the room and witnessed this event,but described it in his deposition as horseplaying.smith did not talk to either randolph or jh about the incident,nor did he report it or investigate it further because he thought that the event was merely horseplay.
on june,while randolph was on vacation,tinney reported the altercation between jh and randolph to supervisor donna carpenter but asked carpenter not to tell anyone else.carpenter stated that she discussed this report with smith.smith acknowledged witnessing the event but reported that it appeared to him to be mere horseplay.carpenter credited smith response and found tinney untrustworthy,so she did not pursue the matter further.tinney also reported the attack to mike logan,who was in charge of indirect services at cyc and who reported directly to feldkamp.at that time,tinney also informed logan that other food service workers had been continuously subject to verbal sexual harassment since the horseplay incident.according to tinney testimony,logan stated that he could not pursue the allegations because randolph had failed to file a report.
on june,tinney and rose harman,randolph sister took randolph to see logan and jim greek,another cyc administrator.at this time,randolph reported the choking incident but did not report either the alleged sexual assault or the alleged attempted sexual assault because she felt dirty and ashamed and disgusting and did not want others to know about it.both randolph and tinney gave logan a written statement of the assault.soon after the report,jh pressed himself against tinney back and threatened to harm her should she report the incident.randolph was also threatened by other cadre members as a result of these reports,jh was put on house arrest and removed from kitchen duty.at some later point,randolph went into logan office,crying,and told him that she had been raped.
labor relations officer aiesha saunders investigated randolph reporting of the choking incident.saunders did not interview randolph,but her investigation uncovered rumors that randolph had engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior in front of the inmates.as a result,saunders recommended that the highway patrol conduct a formal investigation into any impropriety by randolph.upon receiving this recommendation,feldkamp reported the allegations of randolph inappropriate behavior and a possible consensual sexual relationship between randolph and jh to the department of youth services chief inspector office and the ohio state highway patrol.this resulted in a criminal investigation,conducted by trooper don whipple,to determine whether randolph had violated ohio revised code,which criminalizes engaging in sexual activity with a person who is in state custody.whipple concluded that there had been a consensual sexual encounter between jh and randolph and referred the case to the pickaway county prosecutor.the prosecutor found the evidence insufficient to prosecute and took no action.
saunders recommendation also resulted in an investigation by rebecca martin of the chief inspector office.at the end of her investigation,martin concluded that randolph was not a credible witness and that the sexual encounters seemed to be consensual.martin found especially suspect randolph decision to report the choking incident well in advance of the sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.
on approximately july,harman checked randolph into harding hospital in columbus,ohio,because harman believed that randolph was suicidal.randolph was placed on administrative leave.after she was released from the hospital,randolph sought counseling.randolph administrative leave ended on july.randolph was then required to use sick,vacation or personal time to remain away from work.randolph applied for and was granted disability benefits,which consisted of a portion of her regular income.
the cyc decided to take disciplinary action against randolph.a meeting was scheduled for october,but was postponed because randolph psychiatrist,kevin ware,stated that randolph was under a large amount of stress and that the meeting would be detrimental to her condition.ware requested that the meeting be postponed for at least six months.despite this request,the meeting was rescheduled for november,and occurred without her being present.on december,cyc terminated randolph.randolph filed a grievance,and an arbitrator reinstated her on march.randolph applied for and was granted a transfer shortly after her reinstatement.
randolph filed a timely charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on january.the eeoc determined that enough evidence had been uncovered during the investigation to establish a title vii violation and issued a right to sue letter.on december,randolph filed a complaint in united states district court for the southern district of ohio,alleging sexual harassment,sex discrimination based on disparate treatment and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,et.cyc moved for summary judgment on all claims.on march,the district court granted cyc motion with respect to all claims.randolph filed a timely notice of appeal on april.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.williams mehra,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit.anderson liberty lobby,d.we must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
on appeal,randolph first argues that the district court erred in holding that randolph charges for a sexually hostile work environment prior to may,are barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the district court so held because in randolph charge of discrimination filed with the eeoc,she stated that the earliest date of discrimination was may.the district court therefore ruled that randolph had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to those actions occurring prior to may.though randolph evidence regarding events occurring after may,is by itself sufficient to support our holding that summary judgment was improvidently granted in this case,we hold that the district court erred in excluding evidence of prior acts.
a person seeking to bring a discrimination claim under title vii in federal court must first exhaust her administrative remedies.brown servs,d.this requirement exists so that the eeoc will have an opportunity to convince the parties to enter into voluntary settlement,which is the preferred means of disposing of such claims.parsons yellow freight,cir.the requirement,however,is not meant to be overly rigid,nor should it result in the restriction of subsequent complaints based on procedural technicalities or the failure of the charges to contain the exact wording which might be required in a judicial pleading.eeoc mccall printing,cir.as a result,the eeoc complaint should be liberally construed to encompass all claims reasonably expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.haithcock frank,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court holding that randolph failed to exhaust her claims prior to may,was improper because randolph is not making a separate claim for actions prior to that date.the district court holding bifurcated randolph claim and held one of the claims exhausted.hostile work environment claims by their very nature require ongoing conduct,however.see bell chesapeake ohio ry,cir m any discriminatory acts occur in such a manner that it is difficult to define precisely when they took place.one might say they unfold rather than occur.internal citations omitted.this case is no exception.randolph allegations are not bounded by discrete temporal boundaries,but rather describe an escalating progression of harassment.thus,the actions prior to and after may,all support randolph single claim.as a result,the district court holding misconstrued both the nature of the evidence presented and the nature of randolph claim.as the,actions do not constitute a separate claim,the district court exhaustion holding was incorrect.
the district court holding is more accurately described as evidentiary in nature.although the court couched its ruling as relating to exhaustion,the court fundamentally held that the events occurring prior to may,were outside the scope of the eeoc claim and thus irrelevant.to the extent that it did so and excluded evidence of events prior to may,its conclusion was also incorrect for two reasons.first,the actions prior to may,are not beyond the scope of the eeoc complaint,as the eeoc could reasonably be expected to investigate those actions notwithstanding the date listed on the face of randolph complaint.see eeoc roadway express,cir t he supreme court has held that title vii gives the eeoc very broad powers of investigation and affords the eeoc access to virtually any material which might cast light on the allegations against the employer.quoting eeoc shell oil,d.second,the ongoing nature of sexual harassment claims undergirds our totality of the circumstances review of these claims.see jackson quanex,cir.as noted above,this case is no exception,and the imposition of an artificial of may,would exclude evidence relevant to the totality of the circumstances.the eeoc complaint can not be read as a temporal limitation on the admission of evidence for the hostile work environment claim.as a result,we consider the events alleged both before and after may,in reviewing randolph claim.
randolph next argues that the district court erred in finding that she had not raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether she was subjected to a hostile work environment.under title vii,in order to make out a claim based on sexual harassment,an employee must show that she was a member of a protected class she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment the harassment complained of was based on sex the charged sexual harassment created a hostile work environment and the employer is liable.hafford seidner,cir the elements and burden of proof are the same,regardless of the discrimination context in which the claim arises.quoting crawford medina gen l,cir.a hostile work environment occurs w hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris forklift,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.both an objective and subjective test must be met in other words,the conduct must be so severe or pervasive as to constitute a hostile or abusive working environment both to the reasonable person and the actual victim.id.at.
rather than considering each event complained of in isolation,we must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive.black zaring homes,cir.specifically,we must consider the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it was physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interfere d with an employee performance.harris,at.s imple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.faragher city of boca raton,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we may,however,consider the effect of the incidents on the employee psychological.harris,at.
cyc conceded before the district court that randolph is a member of a protected class and has produced evidence of unwanted sexual harassment,so randolph has satisfied the first two elements of the hostile work environment claim.the sufficiency of randolph evidence of the remaining three elements,however,is in dispute.
the district court found that randolph satisfi
