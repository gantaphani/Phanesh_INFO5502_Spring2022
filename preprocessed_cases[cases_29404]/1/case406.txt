on march,juan padró brought suit against elaine chao,secretary of labor,and robert semler,regional administrator for the department of labor employment and training administration for region i,boston collectively,defendants,alleging employment discrimination on the basis of national origin and retaliation for asserting his employment rights.he subsequently amended his complaint to add further claims of discrimination.on summary judgment,the magistrate judge dismissed padró action in its entirety because of the failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.although the magistrate judge correctly granted summary judgment on some of padró claims,he failed to address others.as a result,granting summary judgment on the entirety of padró claim was an error.therefore,we must vacate part of the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
padró began working for the employment and training administration of the department of labor dol in.in and,respectively,padró filed two equal employment opportunity eeo complaints for employment discrimination.he settled these two eeo complaints in.in november,padró was assigned to the position of regional monitor advocate ma padró remained in the ma position,at a pay grade of,for the next fifteen years,without reassignment or promotion.
in march,padró filed an informal complaint the eeo claim with the dol alleging continuing discrimination based on national origin and retaliation for filing his prior complaints.on or about june,padró received a telephone call from dol eeo counselor zenon brena.during that conversation,brena told padró that the agency would not mediate his informal complaint and that he had fifteen days on receipt of his nofi letter to file his formal complaint.the nofi letter arrived on or about july.padró,acting pro se,did not file his formal complaint until august,after the fifteen days had elapsed.pursuant to d,the dol dismissed his complaint for failure to file within the time period.on january,padró appealed this dismissal.on may,the eeoc denied padró appeal,also on the ground that he had failed to act in a timely fashion.on march,padró filed suit in federal district court to appeal the dismissal.
meanwhile,on january,padró request to attend a training conference was denied the sturbridge conference.as a result,padró filed a second eeo informal complaint on april,the eeo claim,again alleging continuing discrimination based on national origin and reprisal for his prior eeo activities.this second eeo complaint also added a hostile work environment claim.on june,the dol accepted the second eeo claim for investigation.on march,the dol dismissed this second eeo claim,pursuant to a,for being a matter that is pending in a united states district court.on september,the eeoc affirmed the dol dismissal of the eeo claim pursuant to a and advised padró of his right to file a civil action in district court.
while padró could have filed his second eeo claim as a separate civil action in district court,he chose to consolidate his and eeo claims into a single district court action.on december,padró moved to amend his first complaint,which focused on his eeo claim,in order to add the eeo claim.the motion was granted on january.on july,after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.following oral argument,the magistrate judge granted defendants motion,holding that padró had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he had filed his administrative complaint after the applicable filing deadline.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.johnson gordon,cir.an order granting summary judgment should be reversed if there existed any factual issues that needed to be resolved before the legal issues could be decided.sabree united of carpenters joiners local,cir quoting rossy roche,cir.when reviewing the facts cited by the party moving for summary judgment,those facts are reviewed in the light most favorable to the party,and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of that party.see mesnick,cir.here,that party is padró.
b.the magistrate judge order and the eeo claim 
in his decision granting defendants motion for summary judgment,the magistrate judge focused exclusively on the eeo claim in padró amended complaint.the facts the magistrate judge relied on in his decision only describe the factual and procedural history of padró eeo claim.there is no mention of the eeo claim even though the magistrate judge granted summary judgment on that claim.
in explaining his decision,the magistrate judge recounted defendants argument that they were entitled to summary judgment because padró failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his claims of retaliation and discrimination.relying on this argument alone,the magistrate judge concluded that a failure by padró to file a formal complaint within the fifteen day period specified in the regulations,absent a showing of excuse by waiver,estoppel or equitable tolling,would bar him from filing a civil action based on that discriminatory complaint.
the magistrate judge devoted the balance of his decision to an explanation of why the doctrine of equitable is available to a plaintiff who is excusably ignorant of the statutory filing period and has been affirmatively misled by the opposing not apply to padró complaint.see thomas eastman kodak,cir ponce fed.bank,cir.the magistrate judge found that t here wa s no factual or legal basis to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case and that padró had not specifically asserted claims of waiver,estoppel or equitable tolling the magistrate judge explained that padró rather argue d in his memorandum that the time limitation should not be imposed in his case because the discrimination was a continuing violation.finding no merit to this argument,the magistrate judge granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to padró amended complaint,which included both the and eeo claims.
padró does not appeal the magistrate judge dismissal of his eeo claim.as the magistrate judge pointed out in his order,padro admits that the filing of his formal complaint was untimely.but padró emphasizes that his whole case was dismissed by the magistrate judge for failure to exhaust administrative remedies emphasis added even though his eeo part of his complaint as the result of an timely filed.this disposition of his claim,he insists,was an error.
b.the eeo claim 
in an effort to defend the magistrate judge decision,the government notes his reference in the body of his decision to padró continuing violation claim and the footnote attached to that reference e ven if i were to consider the substance of the continuing violation argument proposed by padro in his memorandum,there are insufficient facts to support such a contention.the government argues that the magistrate judge reference to a continuing violation claim means that the magistrate judge was fully cognizant of padro second eeoc complaint being separate and distinct from his first eeoc complaint.
we are not convinced.in the body of his opinion,the magistrate judge links padró continuing violation argument to what he thought was padró attempt to circumvent the time limitation period applicable to his eeo claim.this time limitation issue has nothing to do with padró eeo claim.to the extent that the government argues that the magistrate judge reference in his footnote to the substance of padró continuing violation argument is a separate reference to padró claim,we note that padró claim also set forth a continuing violation argument.this oblique reference in a footnote does not assure us that the magistrate judge analyzed padró claim at all,especially since every fact mentioned in the opinion relates to the claim 
moreover,the government own actions belie its position that the eeo claim was addressed by the magistrate judge.the dol dismissed the eeo claim on march,for being a matter that is pending in a united states district court.in its affirmation of this dismissal on september,the eeoc reasoned that the claims raised in the first district court action encompass the claim rais
