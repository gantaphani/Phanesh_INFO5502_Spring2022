petitioner massachusetts society for the prevention of cruelty to children mspcc seeks review of a decision of the national labor relations board nlrb or board.in the proceedings below,the board concluded that mspcc committed unfair labor practices under the national labor relations act nlra or act,by failing to negotiate with the duly elected representative of a bargaining unit comprising the employees at a single facility of mspcc operations.mspcc contests,inter alia,the appropriateness of the unit certified by the board for purposes of collective bargaining.given the deference we show to the board in such matters,however,we conclude that the unit determination must be sustained.accordingly,we deny mspcc petition for review and grant the board for enforcement of its order.
background 
mspcc is a nonprofit corporation that is engaged in providing mental health care services,child welfare services,and behavioral programs to children and families within massachusetts.it has an office and a place of business in the jamaica plain section of boston and maintains approximately thirty other facilities throughout the state.
on january,the intervenor,service employees international union,local,union or local,filed a petition pursuant to c of the act,c,with the first region of the nlrb.the union sought to represent all employees in mspcc jamaica plain office.mspcc contested representation on the ground that the single location was an inappropriate bargaining unit.the regional director of the nlrb investigated and,on march,entered a decision approving the unit and ordering an election.
on march,mspcc requested that the board review the decision and stay the election.the board denied the request on april,and an election was conducted on april.the tally of ballots showed that the employees at the jamaica plain facility voted in favor of representation by the union by a margin of to ten.the regional director then issued a certificate of representation on april.
despite certification of the union as the representative,mspcc refused to bargain.the union then filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging that mspcc had violated a and a of the act,a the regional director issued a complaint,and mspcc filed an answer defending its actions on the ground that the bargaining unit was inappropriate.instead of first taking the case before an administrative law judge,the board general counsel moved to transfer the proceeding directly to the board for summary judgment.the board granted the transfer.in opposition to the general counsel motion for summary judgment,mspcc argued that the bargaining unit was inappropriate.in addition,mspcc argued for the first time that the union was disqualified from representing the employees at mspcc jamaica plain facility because of a conflict of interest.
the board issued a decision and order granting the general counsel motion for summary judgment.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to children,wl.the board upheld the appropriateness of the regional director bargaining unit determination,slip op.at.furthermore,the board found that mspcc waived the issue of the union disqualifying conflict of interest,slip op.at.accordingly,the board found that mspcc had committed an unfair labor practice and ordered it to commence bargaining with the union,slip op.at.mspcc then filed the instant petition for review.
ii.analysis 
the board is assigned many functions in furtherance of its duty to effectuate the policies of the nlra.among them is its responsibility under b of the act to define the composition and scope of unit s appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining.b.appropriate bargaining units are the very building blocks of the federal system of labor relations.congress thus expressly directed the board to exercise its power under b with the purpose of assur ing to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this subchapter.id.
in this case,mspcc makes a challenge to the board rulings concerning its duty to bargain with local.mspcc argues first that the board erred in determining that the employees at a single facility of mspcc operations constitute an appropriate unit for collective bargaining.second,mspcc argues that,in any event,local suffers from a conflict of interest that precludes it from representing mspcc employees.we address each of these arguments in turn.
unit determination 
it is now well settled that the selection of an appropriate bargaining unit lies largely within the discretion of the board,whose decision,if not final,is rarely to be disturbed prairie constr.local,int l union of operating eng rs,d quoting packard motor car nlrb.see also friendly ice cream nlrb,cir t he board unit determinations are rarely disturbed.nonetheless,mspcc asks us to take the unusual step of upending the board unit determination.we decline to do so.
in making its determination,t he board is not required to select the most appropriate unit in a particular factual setting it need only select an appropriate unit from the range of units appropriate under the circumstances.friendly ice cream,at emphasis in original.thus,an employer seeking to disturb the board unit determination can not merely point to a more appropriate unit rather,the burden of proof is on the employer to show that the board unit is clearly inappropriate.id.emphasis added.
we review unit determinations only to assure that they are not unreasonable,made arbitrarily or capriciously,or unsupported by substantial evidence.see also nightingale oil nlrb,cir.in recognition of the board expertise in this area,we may affirm the board action,even though we might not have reached the same unit determination.see marriott servs.nlrb,cir.
the critical inquiry in determining the appropriateness of a proposed unit is whether the employees comprising the unit share a community of interest.friendly ice cream,at.when considering the appropriateness of a bargaining unit in a operation,the board is also aided by its policy that a single facility is presumptively an appropriate unit for bargaining.id.quoting haag drug,wl.once this presumption is invoked,the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the single facility is so effectively merged into a more comprehensive unit,or is so functionally integrated,that it lacks a separate identity.see rental unif,slip op.at,wl d l,wl.to determine whether such a strong shared interest between facilities exists to rebut the presumption,the board considers several factors,with no single one being determinative.these factors include geographic proximity of the facilities in relation to each other level of employee interchange between various facilities degree of autonomy exercised by the local managers,especially with respect to labor relations extent of union organization history of collective bargaining desires of the affected employees employer organizational framework and similarity in skills,employee benefits,wages,and hours of work.see friendly ice cream,at.
our review is not for the purpose of weighing the evidence upon which the board acted and perhaps to overrule the exercise of its discretion but to guarantee against arbitrary action by the board.may dep t stores nlrb.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,w hile we must assure that the board fairly and reasonably considered all relevant factors,the weight assigned by the agency to each factor it has fairly considered is a matter for it to determine.friendly ice cream,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we turn now to the principal factors disputed by the parties to determine if they were fairly and reasonably considered.
geographic proximity.mspcc has thirty sites throughout the state,divided into seven regions.the closest regional office to the jamaica plain facility is twenty miles,and the farthest is miles.mspcc argues that the regional director should have construed this factor in its favor.alternatively,mspcc maintains that,if the factor counts in favor of a unit,the board should not give it controlling weight.the board contends that the distance between the jamaica plain facility and other facilities was correctly weighed in favor of a unit.
we see no indication that the board gave controlling or undue weight to geographical factors.moreover,the distance between facilities fits comfortably alongside cases where the board found geographical proximity to favor a unit.see,armored,nlrb,cir approving unit where distance between facilities was approximately one hour staten island.hosp.nlrb,cir same where distance between two hospitals was eight miles.
employee interchange.mspcc emphasizes that there has been interchange between employees at the jamaica plain facility and those from other mspcc facilities.however,evidence of such interchange is fairly weak mspcc has only identified two employees from other facilities who work in the jamaica plain facility with any regularity.we therefore see no error in the board decision to tally this factor in favor of a unit.see nlrb heartshare human,cir approving a unit where there was no routine interchange of employees among facilities.
autonomy of local employer managers.the regional director concluded that the relative autonomy of local managers at mspcc individual facilities favored the certification of a unit.although final employment decisions such as hiring,firing,discipline,and promotion were approved by mspcc central office,the regional director found that local managers also had a significant role in these decisions.the regional director also found that the local managers controlled most aspects of the operation of the facility and supervision of employees.
although mspcc assails the regional director decision to count this factor in favor of a unit,we detect no abuse of discretion.our review of the record confirms that substantial evidence supports the regional director understanding of the duties and responsibilities of local managers in mspcc individual facilities.
history of collective bargaining.it is undisputed that there is no prior history of collective bargaining anywhere in mspcc operation.however,the parties disagree over how this fact should enter into the calculus.mspcc argues that the absence of bargaining history should assist it in rebutting the presumption.the board,on the other hand,argues that the absence of a bargaining history should weigh in favor of a unit.
it is probably most accurate to say that the dearth of prior bargaining favors neither position in any active sense.see heartshare human,at stating that absence of previous bargaining made that factor irrelevant.nonetheless,it was certainly within the agency discretion to conclude that the factor created no impediment to establishing a unit.and,based on our reading of the regional director decision,we are convinced that no abuse of discretion occurred in taking bargaining history into account.
organizational framework.the regional director found that mspcc maintained a high degree of central control with respect to its operations and labor relations.such control is evidenced by mspcc decision to maintain uniform job descriptions,pay structure,and benefits throughout its facilities.however,the regional director noted that integration of mspcc operations was limited by the fact that each facility provides essentially the same services,thus eliminating the need for clients to progress from one facility to another.
overall,the regional director construed this factor in mspcc favor.nevertheless,mspcc complains that the factor was not given the weight it deserved and that the strong showing of an integrated organizational framework should have rebutted the presumption.we find no error in the regional director appraisal of this factor.as we noted earlier,our task is only to assure that each factor was fairly and reasonably considered the weight assigned by the agency to each factor is a matter for the agency to determine.friendly ice cream,at.the regional director considered this factor he simply did not find it dispositive when placed in context.
other factors.where an employer is engaged in the health care industry,the board will also weigh evidence of an increased risk of work disruption or other adverse consequences.manor healthcare,wl.mspcc argues that the possibility that patient care could be interrupted by bargaining on a basis was not considered by the board and that such a factor should have counted strongly in mspcc favor however,we see no evidence presented to the board that disruption would be likely to occur.without such evidence,we will not require the board to take into consideration mere unsupported speculation that a unit might interfere with patient care.see staten island,at rejecting employer unsubstantiated claim that wage whipsawing would jeopardize patient care.
evaluation of the totality of factors.in his decision establishing the as an appropriate unit,the regional director summarized his evaluation of the various factors as follows 
a lthough mspcc has established a high degree of centralization in regards to its operations and labor relations,the duties and responsibilities of its local managers in each region,together with the almost total lack of employee interchange and transfers,the distances of the various facilities,and the absence of a bargaining history on a basis,prevent mspcc from rebutting the presumption.
despite mspcc protestations to the contrary,we see no reason to disturb the unit determination.the board has applied its presumption to health care facilities with court approval.see,heartshare human,at cal.pac.med.ctr.nlrb,cir.moreover,all of the relevant factors were fairly and reasonably considered.the fact that certain factors favored mspcc position is by no means dispositive.rather,a strong showing on just a few of the factors may suffice to sustain the board decision,which is entitled to considerable deference on such matters.heartshare human,at.we therefore reject mspcc challenge to the board unit determination.
mspcc also contends that it had no duty to engage in collective bargaining because local has a conflict of interest that disqualifies it from representing employees of mspcc.see cmt,slip op.at,wl it is well settled that a union may not represent the employees of an employer if a conflict of interest exists on the part of the union such that collective bargaining between the union and the employer could be jeopardized.in particular,mspcc claims that the union disqualifying conflict arises from its efforts,on behalf of certain members it represents,to limit the state ability to work to private entities such as mspcc.
as this court has stated 
there is a strong public policy favoring the free choice of a bargaining agent by employees.the choice is not to be lightly frustrated.there is a considerable burden on the nonconsenting employer,in such a situation as this,to come forward with a showing that danger of a conflict of interest interfering with the process is clear and present.
nlrb david buttrick,cir.in order to satisfy this heavy burden,an employer must show that the alleged conflict of interest is proximate and substantial,not remote and speculative.greyhound lines,wl.
mspcc raised the issue for the first time in the unfair labor practice proceedings following its refusal to bargain with the newly elected representative.reasoning that the employer could have raised the issue in the prior representation proceeding,the board concluded that the conflict argument had been forfeited.mspcc,slip op.at citing colonial gardens care,wl.we agree with the board and find that mspcc failure to seasonably raise the issue precludes review in these proceedings as well.
