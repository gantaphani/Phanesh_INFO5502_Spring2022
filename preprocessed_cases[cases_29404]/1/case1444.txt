appellant fred allnutt,allnutt failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the years through.in,after being acquitted of certain tax crimes,allnutt prepared the past returns and submitted them to the internal revenue service irs.in,the irs issued a notice of deficiency for those tax years,indicating that he underpaid by nearly two million dollars.
allnutt subsequently filed a petition before the united states tax court arguing that the notice of deficiency was barred by the limitations period established in a of the internal revenue code the code,a,and that the irs was therefore prohibited from assessing and collecting his delinquent taxes and accrued penalties.the tax court found that the irs properly issued the notice to allnutt within the period immediately following the date that he filed his income tax returns.because allnutt has failed to demonstrate that he meticulously complied with the applicable statutory provisions for filing income tax returns on a date more than three years prior to the irs issuance of the notice of deficiency,we affirm the tax court judgment.
the parties agree that the irs issued allnutt a notice of deficiency on march.the parties also agree that of the code requires the irs to assess a taxpayer deficient taxes or to issue him a notice of deficiency within three years from the date the taxpayer files his federal income tax return.the dispute here centers on the date allnutt should be deemed to have filed the returns in question.thus,we focus on the facts pertinent to establishing whether allnutt through tax returns were filed prior to march.
after a federal investigation into allnutt alleged internal revenue code violations concluded in,allnutt hired an accounting firm to belatedly prepare his tax returns forms for the years through.he was instructed by his counsel,who was in contact with the department of justice,to file his returns by hand with the district coun se l office in baltimore.on february,allnutt signed his prepared tax returns for the years through the original returns and wrote the following letter of transmittal to accompany those returns,addressed to the irs district director for the baltimore area,paul harrington harrington,and the irs district counsel for the baltimore area,elizabeth henn henn 
dear harrington and henn,
i am delivering to district counsel with this letter original filings of tax returns for the year and for each year thereafter up through and including.my attorney,jeffrey dickstein,has spoken with gregory hrebiniak,department of justice,who instructed him to have me file said returns with district counsel.
allnutt then photocopied the returns and signed over the photocopied signatures with blue ink the photocopied returns.
on february,allnutt delivered the original returns,along with the letter of transmittal,to henn secretary at the irs district counsel office in baltimore.allnutt admits that he intended for these original returns to be his filed returns and that he thought he had effectively filed them by delivering them to the district counsel office henn secretary stamped the transmittal letter received and signed her name under the stamp.these original returns were ultimately forwarded from the district counsel office to the special procedures office of the baltimore district director the special procedures office the original returns arrived at the special procedures office without any identifying marks or stamps.the special procedures office stamped them received on march.an unknown individual from that office later wrote,copy of return secured or received by examination,on the top of the first page of each of the returns.see allnutt,ria,wl,at.these returns were never further processed by the irs.see.
after allnutt left the district counsel office,he took the transmittal letter and the photocopied returns in a clasped envelope marked attention paul harrington to the irs office building housing the baltimore district director offices.he did so to provid e district director harrington copies of the returns as a courtesy more than as a filing.upon his arrival to the building,allnutt asked a security guard for directions to harrington office.the guard told him that harrington was at lunch and directed him to a second person.the second person,an unidentified gentleman whom allnutt encountered on a different floor than harrington office,also told allnutt that harrington was at lunch and offered to take the package from him and give it to harrington upon his return.allnutt asked the gentleman,whose title or position allnutt failed to request or obtain,if he had authority to accept packages on behalf of harrington.the gentleman responded affirmatively.allnutt then asked if he would be sure to give it to harrington personally.the gentleman agreed,and allnutt gave him the package.at no time did allnutt disclose to the gentleman the contents of the package,ask that the gentleman see to the filing of the enclosed returns,ask that the package or the enclosed returns receive a date stamp,or request a filing receipt.allnutt testified that he did consider getting a second date stamp at the district director offices because the first date stamp at the district counsel office to him confirmed the filing date.allnutt also failed to consult the irs employees working at the taxpayer services area located on the first floor of the building,as is customary for taxpayers attempting to file returns.
district director harrington secretary,susan arczynski arczynski,testified before the tax court that she typically processed all deliveries addressed to harrington and that if the gentleman in the hallway brought the package in question to harrington office it would have been presented to her.her usual practice was to stamp an item with the time and date that she received it,and to use harrington routing stamp on the item if there was room to do so.if there was no room on the document,she would ordinarily staple to the item a small routing slip containing the same information as the routing stamp.according to arczynski,she always used a routing stamp if the item was an income tax return.she also testified that personnel in the district director offices usually directed persons who wanted to file a tax return to the area of the taxpayer services office located on the entry level,or first floor.
arczynski was present at the district director offices on february,day that allnutt visited the could not remember whether she had received the package containing his photocopied returns.these photocopied returns received no routing stamp or routing slip marked february.sometime between that date and may,however,the photocopied returns were forwarded to the irs philadelphia service center.on the front page of each return appears irs received from district postmark and received delinquent original cleared for processing by on june,and resort received on june.see allnutt,ria,wl,at.on the bottom left corner of the front page of each return,pos sorted for statute review,also appears,but is struck out in an attempt to make it indistinguishable.id.on a date not specified in the record,an unidentified irs employee also added a document locator number to the upper right corner of the first page of each photocopied return.the government admits that these returns,rather than the originals delivered to the district counsel office,were those processed by the irs.see.
section of the code requires the irs to assess any deficiency in a taxpayer payment of taxes or to issue a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer within three years from the date the taxpayer files the applicable return.see.irs personnel use an internal document,form,to keep track of the limitations period for each filed return.any irs employee who handles a return has the responsibility to ensure that the statute of limitations date for that return is correctly reflected in the case file and on the form.internal revenue service,internal revenue manual,last visited april.personnel are instructed to determine that date by first ascertaining the return received date and then adding to it the appropriate limitations period.id.the received date,in
