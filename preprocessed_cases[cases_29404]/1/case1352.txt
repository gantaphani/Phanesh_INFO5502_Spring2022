waterford investment services,waterford appeals the district court ruling that it must arbitrate certain claims that a group of investors brought before the financial industry regulatory authority finra the investors allege in their finra claims that they received bad advice from their financial advisor,george gilbert.the investors named gilbert,his current investment firm,waterford,and his prior firm,community bankers securities,llc cbs,among others,as parties to the arbitration.in response,waterford filed this suit asking a federal district court to enjoin the arbitration proceedings and enter a declaratory judgment that waterford need not arbitrate the investors claims.the district court,adopting the recommendations of a magistrate judge,concluded that because gilbert was an associated person of waterford during the events in question,waterford must arbitrate the investors claims.for the following reasons,we affirm.
because the relationship between gilbert current firm,waterford,and his prior firm,cbs,is critical to our holding here,we begin with a discussion of these entities and their relationship.
waterford,a florida corporation,is a registered securities with the securities and exchange commission sec and has been a member of finra since march.cbs,a virginia corporation,is also a registered with the sec,although it no longer conducts business,and was a member of finra from july through february.in,aic,a virginia corporation,became the majority owner of both cbs and waterford by,aic owned approximately percent of both firms.through,cbs and waterford filed separate tax returns and made separate disclosures and filings with finra and the sec.
although separate corporate entities,cbs and waterford had in common,in addition to the same majority shareholder,a significant number of directors and officers during the events in question.nicholas skaltsounis,for example,was the chairman of the board of directors of waterford and its secretary and treasurer,president and chief executive officer of cbs,and a director and president of aic.roger leibowitz was the chief operating officer and executive vice president of waterford,a vice president of cbs,and a vice president of aic.paula ann collier was an executive vice president of both waterford and cbs and,along with skaltsounis,one of only three directors of waterford.further,cbs and waterford had in common the same chief financial officer,franklin flanary the same vice president of operations,richard landi and another vice president,lawrence barnes.
the two firms did have distinct chief compliance officers.frank wainscott served as the president and chief compliance officer of waterford and worked out of waterford principal office in clearwater,florida he had no position with cbs.similarly,cbs chief compliance officer,james mitchell,had no position at waterford.however,the two firms had an overlapping compliance manager,cindy freeland.in his sworn affidavit,gilbert stated that during his tenure at cbs he reported exclusively to mitchell and freeland.
skaltsounis,leibowitz,collier,flanary,landi,barnes,mitchell,and freeland worked in a shared office suite located in richmond,virginia.there was no division of the firms in that office suite,which was home to cbs main office and housed the majority of waterford employees.the two firms also had six common employees working in compliance,operations,sales,and accounting.
within the shared office space,cbs and waterford used the same trading desk and shared various resources,for which cbs paid,including internet,phone service,postage,cable,office supplies,and office casualty insurance,among others.cbs also paid the rent for the office suite up until august,at which time the rent was abated by lease.after cbs ceased operations in december,waterford took over the payments for the office supplies and the rent.at all relevant times,the lease was in the name of both firms majority owner,aic.
beginning in,louis and annette bosco and various members of their family collectively investors invested large sums of money,assertedly their life savings,through gilbert,their financial advisor.the investors allege that the two largest investments they made through gilbert turned out to be fraudulent ponzi schemes as a result,by,the investors had lost over one million dollars in these two securities.
during this time period,gilbert sold securities exclusively through cbs under an independent associate agreement to sell any and all securities approved for sale by cbs.beginning in september,cbs learned of various finra arbitration claims that customers had filed against the firm,at least some of which involved the same securities at issue in the investors claim.shortly thereafter,in december,cbs ceased operations.
on december,landi,the vice president of operations at both cbs and waterford,contacted gilbert by phone to inform him that cbs was shutting its doors.during the same call,landi offered gilbert a position with waterford.the following day,gilbert sent emails to two of the investors informing them that cbs was combining with their sic sister company and using the name of the sister company,waterford investment services,and asking them to sign an attached account transfer form to change their accounts to waterford.although gilbert acknowledges sending the emails,he now asserts that it was his own personal belief that cbs and waterford were combining and that he was wrong.
waterford made transfer offers to approximately of cbs associates based,in part,on their revenue production.approximately of those associates accepted the offers and transferred to waterford,as did seven cbs staff members.of cbs customer accounts,of them also transferred to waterford.although several of the investors transferred their accounts to waterford at that time,they have since closed those accounts.
on december,freeland,as a representative of cbs and on cbs letterhead,officially informed gilbert of his termination from cbs.six days later,on january,freeland,as a representative of waterford and on waterford letterhead,officially welcomed gilbert to waterford.
in april,waterford learned that the investors had filed a finra arbitration claim against the firm.the investors also named gilbert,cbs,aic,skaltsounis,and mitchell in their statement of claim.the investors contend that gilbert and the others failed to perform proper due diligence of the alleged ponzi scheme securities,that they made various misrepresentations and omissions with respect to these securities and failed to disclose the risks involved,and that they recommended unsuitable investments for the investors particular needs.
on august,waterford filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to arbitrate any claim with the investors,and injunctive relief to enjoin certain arbitration proceedings commenced by the investors in which they have or seek to name waterford as a party.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and stipulated to the material facts.magistrate judge dennis dohnal,in an exceedingly thorough report and recommendation,concluded that gilbert was an associated person of waterford during the events in question and,thus,pursuant to finra rules,waterford had to arbitrate the investors claims.magistrate judge dohnal also concluded that,under virginia law,waterford was a mere continuation of cbs and thus was a to cbs agreement to arbitrate its customers claims.over waterford objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and granted the investors motion for summary judgment,concluding the investors dispute was arbitrable waterford timely filed this appeal.
we review de novo the district court determination that a dispute is arbitrable.square,aune,cir.
