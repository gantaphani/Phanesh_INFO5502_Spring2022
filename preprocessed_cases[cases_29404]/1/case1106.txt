this appeal asks us to determine whether chapter bankruptcy petitions filed by santa fe minerals,and memorial corporation together,the debtors were filed in good faith.there is ample evidence to support the finding of the district court that the debtors bankruptcy petitions served no valid bankruptcy purpose and were used primarily as a litigation tactic to protect the debtors and their parent companies from liability in pending litigations.thus,we will affirm the district court order dismissing the bankruptcy petitions for lack of good faith 
the debtors raise two issues in this appeal.first,they argue that the district court incorrectly exercised plenary review,instead of review for an abuse of discretion,of the good faith inquiry.second,they argue that the district court erred in concluding that they did not file their bankruptcy petitions in good faith 
the historical and narrative facts in this case are not disputed.the district court,finding no clear error in the bankruptcy court findings of fact,adopted those facts for the purposes of its decision,bepco,mem l in re mem l.iii,and we do so as well.these facts were ascertained during a trial held by the bankruptcy court to decide several motions,including a motion by bass enterprises production bepco to dismiss the debtors chapter petitions for lack of good faith.santa fe minerals,bepco,in re mem l.i.
the parties 
the parties in this case are all companies involved in oil and gas exploration.the debtors,memorial corporation memorial and santa fe minerals,santa fe,are both subsidiaries of globalsantafe corporation gsf.id.at.both subsidiaries list the address of the headquarters for gsf,memorial drive,houston,texas,as their address.id.neither company,however,actually has offices at that address or at any other location.id.
memorial is a holding company incorporated in delaware and is the immediate parent of santa fe.id.it has no employees and engages in no business other than acting as the sole shareholder of santa fe.id.in june,memorial voluntarily dissolved,but that dissolution was revoked in june under the advice of counsel.id.
santa fe was an oil and gas exploration company incorporated in wyoming.id.on december,id.at,it filed for dissolution under wyoming law,id.at.at that time,santa fe assets were upstreamed to gsf and related entities or other of the debtors affiliates.id.at.santa fe dissolution permits it to act only through its sole shareholder,memorial,in furtherance of winding up its remaining business.id.at.it currently has no officers,directors or employees and engages in no business.id.despite its december,dissolution,santa fe did not publish notice of that dissolution until august.id.at.as a result,santa fe may not have been able to avail itself of the wyoming state law statute of limitations defense for dissolved corporations until august.stat.ann.providing three year statute of limitations starting from date of publication of notice of dissolution for claims against dissolved corporations 
gsf is a cayman islands corporation that indirectly owns memorial and santa fe.in re mem l.i,at.it also owns numerous other companies collectively,including gsf,the gsf entities,including entities holdings,ehi and globalsantafe corporate services,gsfcsi.id.the gsf entities,together with memorial and santa fe,are one of the world largest offshore oil and gas drilling contractors and a leading provider of drilling services.id.at.
ehi is a wholly owned,direct subsidiary of gsf.id.it is the parent and sole shareholder of memorial,id.at,and it also owns several other subsidiaries,id.at.ehi is a holding company and has no employees.id.
gsfcsi is a wholly owned,indirect subsidiary of gsf.id.it provides corporate services to memorial,santa fe,and the gsf entities.id.gsfcsi,among other things,maintains the debtors books and records.id.
david faure,the vice president and assistant secretary of memorial,was charged with marshaling the debtors assets prior to the filings of their bankruptcy petitions,dealing with the debtors liabilities,and working on the debtors bankruptcy cases.id.aside from handling these tasks,faure held other important responsibilities at gsfcsi,ehi,and memorial.id.he was employed by gsfcsi as vice president,assistant general counsel and assistant secretary.id.as an employee of gsfcsi,faure provided legal services to ehi,primarily assisting it with the defense of litigation.id.he also serve d as vice president and assistant secretary of both memorial and ehi.id in carrying out his various duties,faure reported to and took direction from james mccullough,the senior vice president and general counsel of gsf.id.although mccullough had no formal title at santa fe or memorial,faure had to receive mccullough approval before he could file the debtors bankruptcy petitions faure consulted mccullough while preparing the debtors bankruptcy petitions.id.faure also sought legal advice from mccullough regarding memorial on matters unrelated to bankruptcy prior to filing its bankruptcy petition.id.
as part of faure effort to marshal the debtors assets,he oversaw the recovery of funds from the gsf entities for the benefit of the debtors estates.id.this included seeking recovery of funds that were upstreamed to ehi and memorial after santa fe dissolution.id.after an initial investigation,though,faure determined that the debtors potential claims against the gsf entities were not viable.id.faure determination is unsurprising considering that he also testified that he did not think the claims against the gsf entities we re very good claims.id.faure further testified that filing a lawsuit against gsf on behalf of the debtors to facilitate the return of upstreamed funds would jeopardize his job.id.
bepco is a limited partnership that is,among other things,challenging the debtors bankruptcy petitions for lack of good faith.its involvement in the debtors bankruptcies stems from a property of which bepco and santa fe are both in the chain of title,a mineral lease of land in avoyelles parish,louisiana the tebow property.both companies have been accused of contaminating the tebow property.id.at.on april,bepco filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy court asserting a right to recover against the debtors and the gsf entities all obligations and damages arising out of or related to litigation concerning the tebow property.id.at.
the tebow litigation 
on april,individuals affected by the contamination of the tebow property the tebow plaintiffs filed suit in louisiana state court naming santa fe,bepco,and others as defendants,seeking million for the contamination the tebow action.id.at.the tebow plaintiffs alleged that water produced from oil wells on the tebow property was disposed of in unlined earthen pits on their property this water contained salt and dangerous minerals,metals,and radioactive materials,and the contamination migrated both horizontally and vertically into the surrounding soil and ground water.id.some of the pollutants entered and contaminated a drinking water aquifer.id.at.
as a result of trial preparation,the debtors learned that the tebow plaintiffs e xpert r eports indicated that the worst contamination on the tebow property occurred in the east pit area located on the m ineral l ease for which both bepco and santa fe were in the chain of title.id.at.they also learned from the work of their own expert and that of the tebow plaintiffs expert,that the east pit was probably constructed after and that bepco assigned the mineral lease to a different company in.id.thus,santa fe ascertained that bepco liability for contamination caused by the east pit was likely to be less than companies like it,companies that used the tebow property after.id.in short,santa fe knew that the e xpert r eports showed that it,not bepco,was to blame for pollution around the east pit.id.santa fe also learned that the contamination caused to the drinking water aquifer by the east pit would cost approximately million to clean.id.
the debtors were also aware that filing for bankruptcy would permit them to avoid liability in the tebow action.id.at.the tebow plaintiffs complaint stated that if a party has or intends to file for bankruptcy concerning any of the claims alleged,it is the express intention of plaintiffs not to pursue those claims or party or parties in this action,even if such party or parties has been inadvertently named as a defendant.id.
the tebow action was scheduled for trial on october.id.leading up to the trial,bepco and santa fe participated in depositions,hired experts,and engaged in fact and expert discovery.id.santa fe hoped that its dissolution under wyoming law would be a defense to the tebow action,but it was concerned that its failure to publish notice until would undermine the defense.id.at the debtors determined in the summer of that the failure to give proper notice in connection with santa fe dissolution created a risk to santa fe shareholders for its liabilities in litigations,including the tebow action.in june,the tebow plaintiffs and bepco informed santa fe that they would pursue the gsf entities under an alter ego theory.id.although the record is unclear as to when,at some point during the tebow action bepco asserted claims against santa fe and its insurers for the damage done to the tebow property.id.at.it also asserted alter ego claims against the gsf entities.id.
the demand note 
on august,eight days before the debtors filed for bankruptcy,memorial,through faure,executed a demand note issued by ehi.id.at.the demand note provided a revolving credit line of in exchange for,among other things,memorial i accept ing all liabilities existing or arising from the activities of santa fe and agreeing that ii it is not a single business enterprise with gsf or any affiliate of gsf and that iii it will defend and indemnify gsf from any claims,whether based on an,single business enterprise or other principle,relating to santa fe operations.id.at.a few days later,memorial obtained from ehi under the note to pay bankruptcy costs.id.
faure testified at trial that clause i of the demand note was intended to protect ehi and other gsf entities from liability arising from santa fe activities,including the tebow action id.clause ii,according to faure,stipulated that memorial had no claim against ehi,gsf or gsf affiliates based on a single business enterprise theory.id.this clause was not objectionable to faure because,based on his due diligence,he had concluded that memorial was not a single business enterprise with any of the gsf entities.id.at.clause iii provided for memorial to defend and indemnify ehi from any claim related to santa fe operations,whether based on alter ego,single business enterprise or other theories.id.at.together,the three clauses were included in the demand note so that ehi and other gsf entities would not be prejudiced in the face of assertions being made by the tebow plaintiffs that gsfcsi designation of faure as the debtors representative in bankruptcy and his assistance in the defense of the tebow action rendered such entities liable as a single business enterprise.id.at.the terms of the demand note were negotiated between faure and drew baker,an attorney employed by gsfcsi who provided legal counsel to ehi.id.
the bankruptcy filings and their effect on the tebow action 
on august,eight days after executing the demand note,the debtors filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.the next day,the tebow plaintiffs dismissed santa fe from the tebow action.id.at.
on august,bepco filed a third party complaint in the tebow action seeking relief from the gsf entities under an alter ego theory.id.that complaint was dismissed without prejudice on the same day for procedural reasons.id.on august,bepco refiled its third party complaint.id.in response,the debtors accused bepco of violating the automatic stay of litigation outside the bankruptcy proceedings.id.on october,bepco sought relief from the bankruptcy court automatic stay to file its third party complaint in louisiana state court,and the bankruptcy court denied bepco request.id.at.
four months later,on february,bepco proceeded to trial in the tebow action and settled with the tebow plaintiffs before a judgment was rendered.id.in the settlement,bepco agreed to pay the tebow plaintiffs million and assist in cleaning the tebow property in exchange for an assignment to bepco of the tebow plaintiffs property damage claims.id.on april,bepco filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court against the debtors based on santa fe liabilities in the tebow action.id.bepco asserted claims against santa fe for assignment,contribution,indemnity,and for the contamination of the tebow property.id.bepco also asserted claims against memorial and the gsf entities based on wyoming law authorizing the recovery of distributions made at dissolution and alter ego and other related theories.id.
on february,the bankruptcy court granted bepco relief from the automatic stay to pursue its action against santa fe and santa fe insurers in louisiana state court.id.at.the bankruptcy court also held that bepco assertion of alter ego claims against memorial and the gsf entities did not violate the automatic stay.id.at.the bankruptcy court did not,however,permit bepco to proceed with its alter ego claims in louisiana state court at that time.id.at.it left open the issue of whether memorial and the gsf entities could be held liable under an alter ego theory,requesting further briefing on the issue by the parties.id.it did so in part because the debtors insisted that any alter ego claim against the gsf entities was property of their estates and,thus,could not be asserted by bepco.see id.at.
in sum,after the debtors filed for bankruptcy,the tebow plaintiffs dismissed santa fe from the tebow action and settled with bepco.as part of that settlement,bepco was assigned the tebow plaintiffs claims for property damage.bepco asserted those claims against santa fe,santa fe insurers,memorial,and the gsf entities in louisiana state court.the bankruptcy court granted bepco relief from the automatic stay for the claims against santa fe and its insurers,but it did not permit bepco to proceed with its alter ego claims against memorial and the gsf entities.
the litigations pending at the time of the debtors bankruptcy petitions 
at the time the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions,they were on notice of three pending lawsuits against them the tebow action,an oklahoma state court action for property damage the ellison action,and a california state court personal injury action the harris action.id.at.
the ellison action was filed in and principally targeted a disposal company,fpc disposal,for damage to land caused by its construction,operation and maintenance of a commercial disposal facility.id.at.santa fe was named as a defendant because it was one of many parties who disposed of materials at the facility.id.bp amoco corporation,a of santa fe in the ellison action against which santa fe asserted a right of indemnity,defended the ellison action on santa fe behalf.id.as a result,santa fe incurred no material defense costs or expenses in the case.id.the ellison action settled on february,and santa fe was released from liability without making any contribution to the settlement.id.
the harris action was filed in california state court and relat ed to memorial past ownership of an allegedly contaminated site,located in alhambra,california.id.the current status of this action is unclear,but at the time the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions they had not hired counsel or incurred material expenses to defend the action.id.at.
in addition to these three lawsuits,the debtors had notice of three others that they believed could affect their interests.id.two lawsuits in california state court were pending against a predecessor of memorial the sinz and troia actions.id.debtors were also concerned about a oilfield legacy suit in louisiana for which they had received a request for discovery the dore action.id.
the insurance review project 
faure and gsfcsi conducted an extensive insurance review between october and may to determine the extent of santa fe insurance coverage.id.at.they discovered that the debtors had policies that covered the claims asserted in the tebow action and other policies that could possibly cover the sinz and troia actions.id.at.the i nsurance r eview was undertaken for the benefit of the entire globalsantafe corporate family.id.at.the overall goal was to compile a database of policies that could be reviewed as claims came up against any entity,whether it be the debtors or others.id.
the debtors assets 
aside from the insurance policies,debtors have few assets.id.at.memorial,at the time of filing for bankruptcy,had the advanced by ehi under the demand note.id.at.presumably this cash has been spent on litigation and accounting fees related to the bankruptcy.santa fe had no cash when it filed for bankruptcy.id.neither company holds any real property.id.
the debtors asserted a handful of claims for cash as assets in their bankruptcy petitions.id.at.santa fe claimed a right to from a class action settlement arising from a suit against conoco.id.at.it also claimed approximately in escheated funds held by the state of texas,and approximately from memorial for assets that were upstreamed to memorial upon its liquidation,id.at.memorial listed an intercompany tax refund claim against an affiliate for.id.at.the debtors also claimed a right to indemnity in the tebow action to reduce the extent of their exposure were someone else to be successful in recovering on a claim against them within the scope of the matters for which they are entitled to indemnity contribution.id.finally,the debtors assert ed that all claims that bepco seeks to assert against the gsf entities arising out of or related to the tebow action on the basis of alter ego,veil piercing or single business enterprise or similar theories we re property of their estates.id.at.
the debtors reasons for filing for bankruptcy 
the debtors filed their chapter bankruptcy petitions because they were concerned about their ongoing and pending litigations.in particular,they considered the wearing effect of piecemeal litigation involving one case after another over a possible finite pot of money the ability to obtain jurisdiction over a geographically disparate group of claimants located in texas,oklahoma,louisiana and california,among other states and possible multiple claims on the same insurance policies and the problem of dividing up the proceeds of such policies among multiple claimants.id.at.ultimately,though,the tebow action was the principal factor in the debtors decisions to file for bankruptcy.id.at.the debtors were unsure of whether santa fe would be able to assert a dissolution defense because of its defective notice of dissolution.they feared alter ego liability for memorial and the gsf entities.id.
the procedural history leading to this appeal 
on february,the bankruptcy court denied bepco motion to dismiss the debtors petitions for lack of good faith and on april,denied bepco motion for reconsideration.on april,bepco appealed to the united states district court for the district of delaware.on january,the district court reversed and remanded the case,concluding that the debtors petitions should be dismissed for lack of good faith.on february,the debtors filed their timely notice of appeal to this court.
the bankruptcy court refusal to dismiss a chapter bankruptcy petition for want of good faith is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.nmsbpcsldhb,integrated telecom express,in re integrated telecom express,cir.a n abuse of discretion exists where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law,or an improper application of law to fact.id.quoting official comm.of unsecured debtors nucor in re sgl carbon,cir.w e review the findings of fact leading to the decision for clear error and exercise plenary review over the district court conclusions of law.in re sgl carbon,at.
the issue in this appeal,whether the undisputed facts support the bankruptcy court determination that the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions in good faith,calls for reviewing the bankruptcy court application of law to the facts of this case.such review requires analyzing not only basic and inferred facts,which are subject to clearly erroneous review,but also ultimate that are usually expressed in the language of a standard enunciated by rule or by statute,an actor conduct was negligent the injury occurred in the course of employment the rate is reasonable the company has refused to bargain collectively.universal minerals,hughes,cir quoting smith harris,cir aldisert,concurring.ultimate facts are conclusion s of law or at least determination s of mixed question s of law and fact.id.the determination of whether the basic and inferred facts of a case support the conclusion of good faith in the filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition,whether the application of law to fact was proper,is reviewed as an ultimate fact and is subject to plenary review because it is,essentially,a conclusion of law.universal minerals,at see also in re sgl carbon,at.
the district court correctly exercised plenary review,but it misread authority in reaching its conclusion that plenary review was appropriate.it stated,citing in re hechinger investment of delaware,at,and in re telegroup,at,that its responsibilities we re informed by the directive of this court,which effectively reviews on a de novo basis bankruptcy court opinions.in re mem.l.iii,at citations omitted.the district court reliance on these cases was misplaced.in these cases we stated only that our review effectively amounts to review of the b ankruptcy c ourt opinion in the first instance.in re hechinger inv.of,at citation omitted.in other words,b ecause the district court sat below as an appellate court,we conduct the same review of the bankruptcy court order as did the district court.in re telegroup,at citation omitted.nowhere did we state that we apply plenary review to all bankruptcy court decisions regardless of the issues raised.at all events,this error by the district court was harmless.
the debtors raise three objections to plenary review of the good faith inquiry.first,they assert that the district court improperly departed from the bankruptcy court findings of fact without concluding that those facts were clearly erroneous.thus,according to the debtors,the district court conclusion that the debtors lacked good faith can not stand.because we disagree with the debtors premise,we must reject their conclusion.aside from finding no clear error in the bankruptcy court findings of fact,in re mem l.iii,at,the district court opinion was peppered with citations to the bankruptcy court fact finding.the district court departed from the bankruptcy court decision only in its determinations of ultimate facts.because its review of those determinations was plenary,it was free to do so.
second,the debtors claim that an abuse of discretion can occur only when no reasonable person would adopt the bankruptcy court determination of the good faith inquiry.in support of their view,the debtors rely on solow ppi enterprises,in re ppi enterprises,cir,but that decision only stated that a n abuse of discretion can occur when no reasonable person would adopt the bankruptcy court view,id.at emphasis added quoting rode dellarciprete,cir.that case does not hold that an abuse of discretion can only occur under those circumstances.indeed,in in re ppi enterprises,this court followed in re sgl carbon,explaining that abuse exists where there is a clearly erroneous finding of fact,errant legal conclusion,or improper application of fact to law.at citing in re sgl carbon,at.
third,the debtors make much of the district court failure to explicitly declare that the bankruptcy court improperly applied the law to the facts,using those precise words.we fail to see the significance of the debtors argument.regardless of whether the district court used those exact words,its reasoning compels the conclusion that the bankruptcy court improperly applied the law to the facts.after e xamining the facts in totality,in re mem.l.iii,at,and without disturbing the bankruptcy court factual findings,id.at,the district court concluded that the debtors filings lacked good faith,id.at.in particular,the district court identified the questions relevant to the good faith inquiry and determined that the record does not support the conclusion that the debtors petitions have captured value for the estates that otherwise would have been lost and that the record supports the conclusion that the debtors primary objective in filing the petitions was to gain a tactical advantage in litigation.id.both of these determinations were based on applications of law to fact and,therefore,were correctly subject to plenary review.
in sum,while the district court cited the wrong authority,it correctly determined the standard of review.its mistake was harmless error.the proper standard of review for the ultimate determination of good faith is plenary where the review pertains to whether the bankruptcy court made an improper application of law to fact.
chapter bankruptcy petitions are subject to dismissal under b unless filed in good faith and the burden is on the bankruptcy petitioner to establish good faith.in re integrated telecom express,at citations omitted.whether the good faith requirement has been satisfied is a fact intensive inquiry in which the court must examine the totality of facts and circumstances and determine where a petition falls along the spectrum ranging from the clearly acceptable to the patently abusive.id.quoting in re sgl carbon,at we focus on two inquiries that are particularly relevant to the question of good faith whether the petition serves a valid bankruptcy purpose and whether the petition is filed merely to obtain a tactical litigation advantage.id.at citing in re sgl carbon,at 
in this case,both inquiries compel dismissal of the debtors bankruptcy petitions for lack of good faith.the petitions do not serve the valid bankruptcy purposes of preserving a going concern or maximizing the values of the debtors estates.moreover,the timing of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions shows that the debtors were not seeking chapter protection for a valid bankruptcy purpose,but instead were using the filings as a litigation tactic to avoid liability in the tebow action and to protect the gsf entities.thus,based on the totality of facts and circumstances we conclude that the debtors bankruptcy petitions were not filed in good faith.see id.at quoting in re sgl carbon,at.
a party filing for chapter bankruptcy may prove that its petition served a valid bankruptcy purpose by showing that the petition preserv ed a going concern or maximiz ed the value of the debtor estate.in re integrated telecom express,at citing in re sgl carbon,at see bank of am.trust sav.ass lasalle,d toibb radloff,d.the debtors,recognizing that they have no going concerns to employees,offices,or business other than the handling of their arguments on the latter inquiry.
to say that liquidation under chapter maximizes the value of an entity is to say that there is some value that otherwise would be lost outside of bankruptcy.in re integrated telecom express,at citing elizabeth warren,bankruptcy policymaking in an imperfect world.the bankruptcy court identified eleven purported benefits of filing for bankruptcy that it believed maximized the values of the debtors estates.it believed that filing the bankruptcy petitions permitted the debtors to 
a assert the automatic stay in connection with the tebow,ellison,harris,sinz,troia,boudreaux actions,and other matters,to limit the estate involvement in litigation other than in this bankruptcy court 
b facilitate dismissal of debtors as defendants from the ellison,harris,tebow,sinz and troia actions and,again,to centralize these claims in the bankruptcy court forum 
c establish a bar date to set the number of claims and fix the notice problem that existed with respect to santa fe dissolution 
d create a known universe of claims 
e analyze the bepco claims to be able to file a motion contesting whether bepco ha d any legally cognizable claim at all against debtors 
f take advantage of the breathing spell afforded by bankruptcy to inventory and analyze potentially applicable insurance policies and related information 
g pursuant to the insurance review project,discover the london market policies,which appear to provide coverage for legacy cases including the tebow related claims and other insurance policies that may respond to other claims in the bankruptcy cases sinz and troia 
h commence and continue substantive communications with insurers,including those identified in connection with the tebow action and those subsequently identified pursuant to the insurance review project 
i negotiate and propose a settlement of issues with the globalsantafe entities under which,inter alia,they will continue to cooperate in the pursuit of insurance rights and will contribute well over in cash and other value so that substantial value can be delivered to all the creditors of the estates on their claims 
j formulate the liquidation plan and 
k continue to manage and search for assets.
in re mem l.i,at.at first blush,this may appear an extensive list of activities designed to maximize the debtors estates.closer examination,however,reveals that the purported benefits identified did not add or preserve value that would otherwise be unavailable to creditors outside of bankruptcy.in re integrated telecom express,at in re sgl carbon,at requiring chapter petitioners to act within the scope of the bankruptcy laws to further a valid reorganizational purpose to satisfy the good faith filing requirement.
the first purported benefit amounts to nothing more than the debtors availing themselves of the automatic stay of litigation outside of bankruptcy.the protection of the automatic stay,however,is not per se a valid justification for a chapter filing rather,it is a consequential benefit of an otherwise good faith filing.in re integrated telecom express,at quoting in re hba east.as such,courts universally demand more of chapter petitions than a naked desire to stay pending litigation,and any perceived benefit of the automatic stay,without more,can not convert a bad faith filing to a good faith one.id.quoting in re hba east,at.more generally,the desire to take advantage of the protections of the code,such as the automatic stay of litigation outside of bankruptcy,can not establish good faith as a matter of law given the truism that every bankruptcy petition seeks some advantage offered in the code and that any other rule would eviscerate any limitation that the good faith requirement places on chapter filings.id.
the second purported benefit was the centralization of claims and the consolidation of litigations into a single forum.according to the bankruptcy court,the debtors petitions served a valid bankruptcy purpose by facilitat ing an orderly liquidation of claims and assets of the debtors estates in a central forum.in re mem l.i,at citation omitted.it is true that,at its most basic level,bankruptcy is designed to handle the distribution problems arising when the system of individual creditor remedies harms the creditors as a group and there are not enough assets to go around.in re integrated telecom express,at citing thomas jackson,the logic and limits of bankruptcy law.that distribution problem is not implicated in this case.the majority of the debtors potential liabilities lay in the sinz,troia,and tebow actions.the debtors face up to approximately million in liabilities from those cases,with the tebow action accounting for the bulk of the potential liability,million the other proofs of claim amount to just over and indemnity rights the debtors basically have no cash and approximately in claims for cash from entities besides the gsf entities.in re mem l.i,at.obviously these limited assets can not cover the substantial liabilities the debtors face.the debtors do,however,have insurance policies that cover the tebow action,id.at,and other insurance policies that may cover the sinz and troia actions,id.at.it is undisputed that if coverage exists for the claims of the sinz and troia plaintiffs,it will arise under insurance policies separate and distinct from those that provide coverage for bepco claims.id.these insurance policies,therefore,are the debtors most valuable assets since they,at a minimum,cover the tebow action,the debtors most significant potential liability.as such,a central forum for distribution adds little value to the debtors estates because the debtors insurance policies can not be used to pay for liabilities that the policies do not cover.in sum,given that three of the four active litigations against the debtors,the sinz,troia,and tebow actions,are likely covered by insurance policies,and that those litigations dwarf the other proofs of claim in size,id.at,centralization of claims in a single forum does not implicate the basic distribution problem bankruptcy was designed to resolve.
furthermore,looking at all the proofs of claim filed at the time of the bankruptcy court decision on february,it appears that the vast majority of them,minus the six tax claims filed by the state of texas that the debtors claim are not their obligations,are somehow related to the sinz,troia,and tebow actions,and may be covered by insurance,further mitigating the need for bankruptcy.two proofs of claim were filed in connection with the sinz and troia actions,and the balance of the proofs of claim appear to relate to the tebow action three were filed by attorneys and expert witnesses for services provided in connection with santa fe defense in the tebow action six were filed by the gsf entities for funds provided to file for bankruptcy,id.at,which was primarily motivated by the tebow action,id.at,and indemnity rights for,among other things,protection from alter ego claims in the tebow action,id.at and two were filed by bepco in connection with the tebow action,id.at.
in addition,the insurance policies are and have always been available outside of bankruptcy without detrimentally impacting any creditor recovery.thus,like the petitioner in in re integrated telecom express,the debtors can not identify assets that were threatened outside of bankruptcy but that could be preserved or maximized in an orderly liquidation under chapter.in re integrated telecom express,at.moreover,an orderly distribution of assets,standing alone,is not a valid bankruptcy purpose.id.at.antecedent to any such distribution is an inquiry into whether the petition was filed in good faith,whether it serve d a valid bankruptcy purpose.id.in other words,the creation of a central forum to adjudicate claims against the debtors is not enough to satisfy the good faith debtors must show that bankruptcy has some hope of maximizing the value of the debtors estates.id.finally,consolidation of litigation was not achieved in this case.the bankruptcy court has already permitted piecemeal litigation of bepco claims against santa fe and its insurers in louisiana state court.santa fe minerals,bepco,in re mem l.ii.
the third and fourth purported benefits identified by the bankruptcy court,that filing for bankruptcy established a bar date to set the number of claims,fixed the notice problem that existed with respect to santa fe dissolution,and created a known universe of claims,in re mem.l.i,at,were tied to santa fe botched dissolution under wyoming law.dissolution is not an objective that can be attained in bankruptcy.in re integrated telecom express,at citation omitted.moreover,neither the bankruptcy court nor the debtors explained how the establishment of a bar date maximized the debtors estates.at the time of filing their bankruptcy petitions the debtors knew of only six litigations in which they could conceivably have been held liable for damages,and only a handful of creditors have filed proofs of claim in the debtors bankruptcy proceedings.without some risk of significant liability from a substantial number of litigations or claimants in bankruptcy,it is difficult for this court to assign much value to the mere fact that a bar date was established and a known universe of claims was created.also,we reiterate that the desire to take advantage of the protections of the code can not establish good faith,id.at,so the establishment of a bar date for claims under the bankruptcy code to remedy santa fe failure to publish notice of its dissolution under wyoming law,which,if done properly,would have established a bar date back in,does not evidence good faith.
next,the bankruptcy court claimed that bankruptcy enabled the debtors to analyze bepco claims and file a motion contesting whether bepco has any legally cognizable claim against them.in re mem l.i,at.the mere fact that the bankruptcy court provided a forum to adjudicate the dispute between bepco and the debtors is not a benefit of same adjudication could have occurred,and in fact,is currently occurring,in louisiana state court.on february,the bankruptcy court granted bepco relief from the automatic stay so that it could pursue its claims against santa fe and sante fe insurers in louisiana state court.id.at.the bankruptcy court permitted that claim to proceed because,among other things,the louisiana state court action allowed bepco to vigorously pursue all of its rights to insurance proceeds instead of having to wait for santa fe to assert those rights.id.at see in re mem l.ii,at noting that louisiana was the proper forum for the claims because t he claims involve d state law issues addressing liability for contamination of groundwater and soil in louisiana.in effect,the bankruptcy court did nothing more than permit bepco louisiana state action,which was stalled by the debtors bankruptcy filings and the subsequent automatic stay,to go forward.this is not a benefit of bankruptcy,and it did not maximize the value of the debtors estates.
three other purported benefits pertained to the insurance policy review.the debtors purportedly availed themselves of the breathing spell afforded by bankruptcy to inventory and analyze potentially applicable insurance policies and related information,discovered insurance policies that appear to cover the tebow,sinz,and troia actions,and commenced and continued substantive communications with insurers.in re mem l.i,at.first,the review was conducted by gsfcsi,a company that needed no breathing spell because it was not under financial distress and faced no litigation threats.in addition,the review was undertaken for the benefit of all gsf entities,not just the debtors.id.at.the pending litigations probably would have necessitated the insurance policy review regardless of the debtors bankruptcies since the overall goal of the review was to locate and categorize all policies and to determine whether the policies protected the debtors or the gsf entities.see id.second,there was absolutely no causal connection between the bankruptcy filings and the insurance policy review.the insurance policy review was neither required by bankruptcy nor impeded outside of bankruptcy,and gsfcsi was free to conduct the review at any time.third,the value of the insurance policies was not affected by the bankruptcy.thus,the fact that gsfcsi happened to conduct the review after the debtors filed for bankruptcy is irrelevant 
next,the bankruptcy court reasoned that bankruptcy permitted the debtors to negotiate a settlement of issues with the gsf entities in which the gsf entities would cooperate in pursuit of insurance rights and would contribute over so that substantial value could be delivered to the debtors creditors.id.at.first,considering that gsfcsi conducted the insurance review for the benefit of all the gsf entities,not just the debtors,id.at,it is difficult to consider cooperation in pursuit of insurance rights as a benefit of bankruptcy.the gsf entities acted out of self interest.they knew of the risks they faced from alter ego claims and realized that the debtors insurance policies could aid them in protecting themselves,so they had an incentive to cooperate on insurance rights wholly independent of bankruptcy.assuming,hypothetically,that the debtors never filed for bankruptcy,the gsf entities would still have had an incentive to cooperate on insurance rights because of the risk of alter ego liability in louisiana state court.second,the bankruptcy court,in granting bepco relief from the automatic stay to bring claims against santa fe and santa fe insurers in louisiana state court,conceded that the debtors did not have the necessary incentive to pursue their insurers.id.at.in conceding that point,it negated the purported benefit gained by cooperation between the gsf entities and the debtors on insurance rights.if the debtors lacked the incentive to pursue their insurers,the cooperation of the gsf entities in that inaction hardly seems beneficial to the debtors estates or the creditors seeking insurance proceeds.third,the slated to be contributed by the gsf entities is not much of a concession in light of their systematic use of the debtors to protect themselves from litigation liabilities that far exceed their contribution.moreover,faure,the for the debtors bankruptcies,lacked an incentive to vigorously negotiate on behalf of the debtors against the gsf entities because doing so would jeopardize his job.see id.at noting that faure testified that filing a lawsuit against gsf on behalf of the debtors to facilitate the return of upstreamed funds would jeopardize his job.
the next purported benefit,the formulation of a liquidation plan,did not maximize the debtors estates.the debtors must show that the liquidation plan served a valid bankruptcy mere creation of a liquidation plan,standing alone,is not enough.in re integrated telecom,at.the last purported benefit,that bankruptcy enabled the debtors to continue to manage and search for assets,in re mem l.i,at,is unimportant because the debtors have not conducted any business outside of litigation for several years and have no offices,operations,or employees,id.at in addition,the debtors could have managed and searched for assets without filing for bankruptcy.in fact,filing for bankruptcy has only increased the debtors cash shortfall.at the time of filing for bankruptcy,t he debtors financial condition when viewed on a cash basis wa s poor.id.at.their condition has only deteriorated as substantial administrative expenses,including legal fees and fees owed to gsfcsi for support services,have accrued.id.at.in short,the debtors could have managed and searched for assets without filing for bankruptcy and without incurring administrative expenses.
having considered each of the purported benefits identified by the bankruptcy court as justifying the chapter filings,we turn to an issue that the bankruptcy court failed to consider in its good faith analysis the debtors representative was primarily concerned with protecting the gsf entities,not the debtors faure,the principal guiding the debtors bankruptcies,was inextricably entangled in numerous aspects of the gsf entities operations.aside from handling the debtors bankruptcies,faure was also employed by gsfcsi as vice president,assistant general counsel,and assistant secretary,and acted as vice president and assistant secretary of ehi.id.at faure mixed allegiances prevented him from adequately protecting the debtors interests.for example,faure negotiations with ehi,a company for which he was the vice president and assistant secretary,on the terms of the demand note amounted to a litany of concessions by memorial that insulated the gsf entities from any liability.id.at.memorial stood to gain nothing from the demand note except the ability to pay the costs of filing for the bankruptcy itself,as explained in the next section,was a litigation tactic to protect the gsf entities.also,the debtors decision to file for bankruptcy was not their own gsf was ultimately in control of whether the debtors filed.leading up to the filings,faure reported to mccullough,gsf senior vice president and general counsel,on legal matters relating to memorial and he had to receive approval from mccullough to file the debtors bankruptcy petitions.id.at.finally,faure testified at trial that filing a lawsuit against gsf on behalf of the debtors would jeopardize his job.id.even if faure had wanted to act in the debtors interests,he did not consider himself free to do so because it would have placed his job at risk.
in sum,the debtors filing for bankruptcy did not maximize the value of their estates.indeed,it would be exceedingly difficult to do so where neither santa fe nor memorial had any real assets to preserve besides various insurance policies.the purported benefits to the debtors estates identified by the bankruptcy court either had no causal connection to filing for bankruptcy,they were events that could have occurred outside of bankruptcy,or were based on procedural benefits gained from bankruptcy that can not be said to have maximized the value of the debtors estates.as such,we conclude that the debtors petitions failed to serve a valid bankruptcy purpose.
in addition to failing to serve a valid bankruptcy purpose,the timing of the debtors bankruptcy petitions shows that they were filed primarily as a litigation tactic to avoid liability in the tebow action.f iling a chapter petition merely to obtain tactical litigation advantages is not within the legitimate scope of the bankruptcy laws.in re sgl carbon,at internal quotation omitted accord in re integrated telecom express,at.where the timing of the filing of a chapter petition is such that there can be no doubt that the primary,if not sole,purpose of the filing was a litigation tactic,the petition may be dismissed as not being filed in good faith.in re sgl carbon,at quoting in re hba east,at 
in this case,the bankruptcy court found that the tebow action was the principal factor in the debtors filing for bankruptcy.in re mem l.i,at emphasis added.debtors filed their petitions on august,roughly two months before trial in the tebow action and shortly after bepco and the tebow plaintiffs informed santa fe that they would pursue the gsf entities under an alter ego theory.id.at.at that time,discovery in the tebow action was already complete and expert reports showed that santa fe contamination of the east pit area of the tebow property was a significant part of the overall contamination of the property.id.at.the debtors were worried that their dissolution defense would fail,id.at,exposing them to at least million in damages,id.at,and filed their bankruptcy petitions with the knowledge that doing so would result in their dismissal from the tebow action and would shield the gsf entities from litigation,id.at.given this mix of facts and the debtors sudden decision to file for bankruptcy despite their having been dormant and without employees or offices for several years,we can not escape the conclusion that the filings were a litigation tactic.
considering the results of the debtors bankruptcy filings,the tactical advantages gained by the debtors and the gsf entities against bepco are obvious.the debtors bankruptcy filings protected the gsf entities from liability for the damage to the tebow property.indeed,the debtors continue to argue that any alter ego claims against the gsf entities are part of their estates and can not be asserted by bepco,while simultaneously,and incongruously,stating that they believe that any such claims would have no value.see id.at.if the debtors and the gsf entities had their way,bepco would be left without any opportunity to litigate its alter ego claims against the gsf entities and,conveniently for the gsf entities,the debtors would not bring the claims because they do not believe the claims have value.even if the bankruptcy court later permits bepco to bring its alter ego claims against the gsf entities in louisiana state court,bepco will have already been prejudiced to the extent of the lost time value of money for the settlement funds it has already paid out to resolve its liability in the tebow action.id.at.more critically,bepco will be prejudiced by the lapse of time in terms of its ability to effectively prosecute its claims because w itnesses and documents may become unavailable.id.
taking into account the lack of a valid bankruptcy purpose,the timing of the filings of the petitions,and the tactical advantages gained from the bankruptcy filings by the debtors and the gsf entities,we agree with the district court conclusion that the debtors filed their petitions primarily as a litigation tactic to frustrate bepco claims against the debtors and the gsf entities.
the debtors have failed to show
