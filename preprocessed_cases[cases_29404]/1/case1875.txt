the hamilton county board of county commissioners and the city of cincinnati collectively,the county appeal the district court award of attorneys fees to the sierra club and individual plaintiff marilyn wall collectively,the sierra the honorable danny reeves,united states district judge for the eastern district of kentucky,sitting by designation.club in this clean water act case.the district court determined that the sierra club was entitled to recover litigation costs both on the basis of the catalyst theory and because the plaintiff was a prevailing or substantially prevailing party under section of the act,d.the county argues that the catalyst theory of recovery was debunked by the supreme court in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d,that the sierra club can not be considered a prevailing party under existing case precedent,and if the sierra club is entitled to attorneys fees in this amount awarded by the district court can not be sustained on the record.we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the sierra club was entitled to recover attorneys fees as a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in this case,but we also find it necessary to remand the case for a particularized determination of the amount of that award.
factual and procedural background 
despite the legal nature of the dispute in this case,the to its resolution turns out to be fairly and finds its genesis in the intricacies of cincinnati aging sewer system.generally speaking,there are two principal types of sewer systems a sanitary sewer system carrying only waste products and a combined sewer system,which carries both sanitary waste and storm water runoff.cincinnati began efforts in the to separate its combined sewer system,which dated back to the,in order to avoid the commingling of sanitary waste and storm water.although the separate sanitary sewer system was designed to handle only sanitary waste,many foundation drains and other drainage systems were constructed to flow into the sanitary sewer system,leading to an overtaxed sewer system and frequent basement flooding.in response to overflows,which caused wastewater to back up onto streets and into homes,the county created sanitary sewer overflows ssos along local tributaries as planned escape points when the sewer system was operating beyond capacity.
the result was the construction of approximately overflows,designed to release excess waste into rivers and other waterways when the system was overtaxed.eventually,the ssos were discharging hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage,at a rate of approximately million gallons a year.combined sewer systems also incorporated planned overflows,and because these combined sewer systems carried both sanitary waste and storm water,they were more prone to overflows and resulted in some six billion gallons in overflows annually.
in,congress enacted the clean water act,with the goal to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.in order to achieve this goal,the act prohibits discharge of pollutants,including raw sewage overflows,into waters,see a,unless authorized by a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit.see.sanitary system overflows are a violation of the act and have been since.
there are multiple parties responsible for enforcement of the act,including the states,the federal government,and private citizens.although the primary responsibility for enforcement rests with the state and federal governments,private citizens provide a second level of enforcement and can serve as a check to ensure the state and federal governments are diligent in prosecuting clean water act violations.see a.because citizen suits were meant to supplement rather than to supplant governmental action,gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay,d,citizen suits must fulfill several procedural prerequisites.
the act provides that a citizen may not commence an action under prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation.b a.under the relevant regulation,the notice must include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated,the activity alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the location of the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.a.the notice provides federal and state governments with the time to initiate their own enforcement actions.if either the state or federal government is diligently prosecuting the clean water act violation,a citizen suit for that same violation may not proceed.nevertheless,a citizen may still play a role in a governmental enforcement action under b b,which provides that in any such action in a court of the united states any citizen may intervene as a matter of right.
in response to at least two decades of sewage discharge into area rivers and tributaries,as well as concerns over what the sierra club described as ten years of,the sierra club provided a citizen suit notice to the required parties in a letter dated december.the notice states 
on a monthly basis for at least the past years to the present,the sanitary sewer conveyance systems owned and operated by the metropolitan sewer district,the city of cincinnati hamilton county have and continue to overflow into the mill creek and the little miami river both navigable waters of the united states from specific openings in the sewer systems.these openings are known as sanitary sewer overflows or ssos.such raw sewage overflows are a direct violation of the federal clean water act,a threat to public health and safety and cause injury in fact to the recreational and aesthetic interests of the sierra club miami group,its members,and marilyn wall,individually.
the msd is required to keep records of the date,location and duration of each unpermitted sanitary sewer overflow.msd is also required to provide that information to the ohio environment protection agency oepa.the specific information of each and every sso on the mill creek and little miami river is in the possession of the msd,so it is on actual notice of each activity that constitutes violation of the clean water act,the location of the violations,and the dates and the duration of the violations.each monthly report from msd to oepa on sanitary sewer overflows dating back from the date of this notice letter is specifically incorporated by reference,herein.this notice letter,however,is not limited by the msd written reports to oepa.it is also meant to include any additional ssos to the little miami river the mill creek of which msd has actual notice,but were not reported to oepa,as required.it is the intent of the club and marilyn wall to enforce and seek elimination of all ssos into the mill creek and the little miami river,regardless of whether said sso was properly recorded and notice of it sent to the ohio epa 
the record indicates that the sierra club action in this regard was spurred by the fact that the county and the ohio environmental protection agency had been engaged in negotiations concerning implementation of an order issued by the oepa in,compelling the county to remedy its illegal ssos.in the intervening ten years,hamilton county and the city of cincinnati had spent more than million to eliminate a total of ssos.nevertheless,additional ssos remained,and violations continued despite the order and the county and city efforts.
during the days following the filing of its citizen suit notice on december,the sierra club communicated with government officials at the federal,state,and local levels.on february,the county provided the sierra club and the general public with a proposed interim partial consent decree on sanitary sewer overflows.following the release of the proposed consent decree,the public had only two days to review the document before the hamilton county commissioners voted to approve the decree.according to an excerpt of a transcript of the february meeting,the participants discussed whether approving the proposed consent decree would eliminate the possibility of the sierra club lawsuit proceeding the proposed consent decree required the county and city to complete remedial projects on of their most active ssos to design and construct a chemical treatment facility to treat discharges from sso number sso with the highest volume of well as implement a permanent solution for sso number by the year and to develop a plan for remedying the remaining ssos.the decree also included stipulated penalties for violation of its requirements.
on february,the united states filed suit against the board of county commissioners of hamilton county,the city of cincinnati,and the state of ohio.on the same day,the state of ohio filed an action against the board of county commissioners of hamilton county and the city of cincinnati.in addition,the united states,the state of ohio,the board of county commissioners of hamilton county,and the city of cincinnati jointly filed the proposed consent decree with the court.
despite the state and federal enforcement action,on february,the sierra club and marilyn wall,the chair of the ohio chapter of the sierra club,filed a citizens suit complaint under the clean water act against the board of county commissioners of hamilton county,the city of cincinnati,and the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati in its complaint,the sierra club alleged that t he defendants have failed to eliminate the ssos and have failed to even furnish a fixed date compliance schedule for their elimination.these failures were exacerbated by the failure of the state federal government to diligently prosecute these violations during the period from.
on march,the court consolidated the actions initiated by the state of ohio and the united states and,six weeks later,consolidated that action with the sierra club citizen suit.on may,the sierra club filed a seeking to intervene in the state and federal segments of the litigation.in this second complaint,the sierra club detailed what it considered to be the inadequacies of the proposed consent decree and requested the entry of an order to eliminate all the remaining ssos,rather than just the ssos addressed in the proposed settlement,including water in in basement or ssos the court granted the motion to intervene,conferring upon the sierra club plaintiff status in the consolidated litigation.
on august,the federal government moved to enter the proposed consent decree.the sierra club opposed the motion,citing the lack of an adequate public comment period and evidence that the motive for the proposal was simply to block the sierra club citizen suit,rather than permanently address the clean water act violations.the sierra club then sought and was granted discovery to investigate the adequacy of the proposal.the court stayed a motion to dismiss submitted by the county,in which it argued that the proposed consent decree amounted to diligent prosecution under the act and should therefore be deemed as a bar to the citizen suit.
on november,despite its earlier contentions that the proposed consent decree was the result of ten years of negotiations among the government parties and that it could adequately remedy existing violations,the federal government and the state of ohio withdrew their motion for entry of the consent decree.the district court issued an order on december,noting the governments withdrawal of the motion for entry.in that order,the court mandated that the parties keep the sierra club apprised of their settlement negotiations so that the parties will have the benefit of the sierra club views.
the sierra club participated in this second stage of negotiations,providing its views in writings and in meetings with the parties.on july,the sierra club submitted comments to the governmental plaintiffs on the first draft of a proposed global decree.these comments included suggestions on how to deal with victims of violations.at a status conference,the sierra club informed the district court of the magnitude of the ssos and the inadequacy of the county response to the problem.
following the conference,the district court,obviously frustrated by the delays in the settlement efforts,issued an order requiring that a draft of the consent decree be filed with the district court by october.failure to meet that deadline,the order indicated,would result in a bench trial in december.further,the district court ordered that a copy of the final proposal be provided to the sierra club for review and comment.
the government parties filed a revised consent decree on october,barely in time to meet the court deadline.this draft required the county to remedy the combined sewer overflows and to address events by cleaning up such occurrences,to compensate customers for damages incurred as a result of the violations,and to install devices in residential basements to prevent further events.in response,the sierra club filed objections,contending that the revised decree lacked firm deadlines,that its soft deadlines were too far in the future,and that it failed to require a special master,which the sierra club argued was necessary to oversee implementation.
at an ensuing hearing on may,designed to determine whether the proposed final decree and the incorporated interim decree were fair and adequate,an attorney for the federal government represented to the district court that 
together,these decrees provide a comprehensive program to bring the defendants sanitary sewer overflows,combined sewer overflows and waste water treatment plan violations into full compliance with the law at an expected cost to taxpayers of over a billion dollars.
the decrees require defendants to develop comprehensive compliance plans that must be completed by no later than and must be completed as expeditiously as practicable.
the sierra club expressed its concern that the deadlines in the proposal could be extended without consequence through openers provisions in the proposal that would allow the defendants to extend deadlines under certain circumstances by claiming that timely completion was not practicable rendering the consent decree ineffective.the district court pressed the parties to confirm on the record that any potential for the extension of the dates would not be used inappropriately and that the consent decree would be read to ensure that the county would comply with the deadlines and would be subject to the stipulated penalties if it failed to do so.
two weeks later,on june,the district court issued its final order,finding the consent decrees to be fair,adequate,and in compliance with the clean water act.in doing so,the court addressed the sierra club concerns,rejecting their request for appointment of settlement master but finding the appointment of an ombudsman entirely appropriate,which mechanism,the court said,should provide the public with an advocate who can ensure that the wib program is working,investigate complaints,and keep the court informed of the status of such program.
the court also addressed the sierra club concerns about two opener provisions that enabled the county to avoid deadlines set up in the consent decree.the district court made it clear that the openers could go into effect only under narrow circumstances.additionally,the court ensured the sierra club continuing involvement in the implementation process by requiring that the county quarterly reports to the federal government also be provided to the sierra club 
the united states commits to provide all documents that it receives to the sierra club so that the intervenors can monitor efforts to enforce the decrees.in addition,the united states indicates it has invited marilyn wall,a representative of the sierra club,to serve as a member of the ltcpu long term control plan update steering committee,which will provide oversight and guidance to defendants as they develop the ltcpu.
in urging the appointment of a settlement master,the sierra club had drawn the court attention to releases that msd had earlier demanded from wib victims in exchange for assistance with the water in their basements.though the msd had since redrafted its releases,the sierra club argued that a settlement master was needed to ensure that such abuses did not recur.the court held that releases signed by victims before the plan revisions were unenforceable and added that it appreciate d the involvement of sierra club as intervenor and recognize d that the releases prepared by the cincinnati solicitor office were highly improper.however,the court did not consider the risk of future abuses significant enough to require appointment of a settlement master.
following entry of the revised decree,the sierra club moved to recover over million in attorneys fees under the act citizen suit provision,which states that a court may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.d.the district court subsequently granted the motion,finding that the sierra club was entitled to fees on the basis of alternative grounds.
first,the court found that the sierra club should recover litigation costs because it served as a catalyst for developments in the litigation,detailing why buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,would not preclude application of the catalyst theory under the clean water act.in the alternative,the court held that the sierra club was a prevailing party or substantially prevailing party for purposes of d.the court did not award the full amount requested,however,saying 
the court has reviewed carefully the lodestar figures of those requesting fees and reimbursement of costs.it finds their requests generally reasonable.the court does find,however,some duplicative and unreasonable charges.as such,the court awards the following amounts.to albert slap,the court awards in fees and costs.to david altman.lpa the court awards in fees and costs.to the sierra club the court awards.the total amount of fees and costs awarded to the various plaintiffs is.
the county now appeals the district court order awarding attorneys fees.
discussion 
because the clean water act leaves the award of attorneys fees and costs to the discretion of the district court,see d,we review such an award for abuse of discretion.purtle eldridge auto sales,cir.the district court ruling should be affirmed unless it is based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record.isabel city of memphis,cir.in addition,in the context of attorneys fees provided by statute,we review a district court determination of prevailing party status under the clear error standard.knology,insight comm ns,cir citation omitted.we find no abuse of discretion in this case,nor any demonstration of clear error on the part of the district court.
as the county correctly notes on appeal,under the common law,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.consequently,the courts have held that statutes awarding fees to the prevailing party in federal court are to be narrowly construed.see,united states texas,d.the county is also correct in noting that the primary responsibility for enforcing the clean water act rests with the federal and state governments and that if the primary actors are diligently prosecuting violations of the act,there is no need to provide incentives for private citizen action.nevertheless,we conclude in this case that the award of fees under d was appropriate.
section d of the clean water act provides that in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section,a court may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.d.relying on parallels between the clean air act and the clean water act,the county cites to cases from this circuit in which an intervenor was denied attorneys fees because a citizen suit had not been brought pursuant to subsection a of the clean air act citizen suit provision.united states steel,cir.significantly,however,the sierra club action here was filed under the citizen suit provision of section.moreover,even though that suit was subsequently consolidated with the federal and state enforcement actions,the order of consolidation did not destroy the legal basis on which the sierra club was originally authorized to bring suit.indeed,the sierra club did not merely intervene in the governments actions instead,its section citizen suit was consolidated with those other actions by order of the district court.thus,to the extent that the sierra club was a prevailing or substantially prevailing party,it was entitled to attorneys fees under section d 
nor,contrary to the dissent assertion,was the sierra club complaint a mere duplicate of the governments complaints.rather,it was filed based on allegations that the government plaintiffs had fail ed to diligently prosecute the violations during the period from and now proposed to consent to a settlement that was inadequate to remedy the failures of the previous decade.as the district court noted in response to the county allegation that the court was without jurisdiction to award fees to the sierra club 
d iligent prosecution is normally determined as of the time of the filing of a complaint.accordingly,a diligent prosecution bar at the end of the litigation is of no consequence.additionally,as noted already,the court views the sierra club,as an intervenor.thus,the sierra club is a party to this case able to litigate fully on the merits the court jurisdiction is not barred as sierra club has a right to intervene pursuant to the applicable statute,it did intervene,and this court granted that intervention viewing sierra club as equivalent to a party in this case.
having determined that the sierra club was a party to the action,the district court was next faced with deciding whether it was a prevailing party or substantially prevailing party under the statute.the court held that it was,invoking as alternative grounds application of the catalyst theory and a interpretation of the language of c,as applied to the facts of this case.because we conclude that the district court determination on the latter basis can be sustained,we pretermit discussion of the catalyst theory,which,as the county points out,has been called into question by the supreme court opinion in buckhannon.see,d see also ailor city of maynardville,cir it is an open question whether the catalyst theory remains viable in the context of environmental statutes like the cwa that limit attorneys fees to a prevailing party or substantially prevailing party.emphasis omitted citing marisa ugalde,the future of environmental citizen suits after buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,envtl.see generally lucia a silecchia,the catalyst calamity post buckhannon in environmental litigation and a proposal for congressional action,colum.envtl,examining future of catalyst theory jason douglas klein,attorney fees and the clean water act after buckhannon,hastings.envtl.pol y concluding that buckhannon should have no impact on awards under the clean water act.
the county argues,however,that a proper reading of buckhannon not only undermines the application of the sierra club catalyst argument but also precludes a finding that it was a prevailing party under any analysis.under buckhannon,a plaintiff must obtain or relief in order to be considered a prevailing party.see at.despite the sierra club forceful and persistent advocacy throughout the negotiation of the final consent decree,the county argues that it can not be considered a prevailing party because it was not a party to that decree.we conclude that this argument borders on the absurd.the sierra club may not have been a signatory to the final consent decree in this case,but it is abundantly clear on the record that without the sierra club active intervention in the litigation,the interim consent decree would not have been withdrawn and a fully adequate consent decree would not have been entered in its place.likewise,the imprint of the sierra club involvement is obvious from the district court decision to appoint an ombudsman,to whom the citizens of hamilton county may carry their complaints in the future.
in finding that the sierra club was entitled to an award of litigation costs,the district court observed 
the court witnessed these efforts of the sierra club.after reviewing the above,it is hard to conclude that the sierra club is anything but a prevailing or substantially prevailing party.the sierra club began this litigation as its own independent complainant.subsequently,the court consolidated the sierra club own action with the government litigation and granted the sierra club status as intervenor in this instant action.the sierra club extensively participated in the discovery and development of the final consent decree,despite its not being a signatory to said decree.its participation resulted in changes and additions which were improvements beyond the terms contained in the interim decree.without the efforts of the sierra club,the affected citizens of hamilton county would not have benefited as substantially from this litigation as they did.
as the district court also noted,although the sierra club was not a party to the consent decree,as an intervening party in the underlying litigation,it can inform the court of unenforced violations of the consent decree and request that the court enforce the terms of the decrees and this court order.
the county also argues that because the sierra club notice letter identified specific ssos,to the exclusion of others and to the exclusion of any wib violations,it can not claim attorney fees for any claims not included in the notice.the district court comprehensively addressed this argument,concluding that the sierra club notice was sufficient 
first,sierra club,as an intervenor,assumed the same position as the primary litigants in this matter and are dealt with by this court as if they are the primary litigants and are not restricted to the specificity of their notice.furthermore,the code of federal regulations states sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated is adequate.a emphasis added.the court holds that the sierra club notice did contain sufficient information to allow defendants to identify all pertinent aspects of its sso,wib,and cso violations without extensive investigation.lastly,as required by comfort lake association dresel contracting,cir,the court views the wib,sso,and cso violations as closely related and,thus,the notice was sufficient.
the county remaining challenge to the sierra club notice,concerning the adequacy of the contact information for the sierra club counsel,was not raised below and is therefore not properly before us for review.see,barner pilkington,cir.
as for the argument that the sierra club can not be considered a prevailing party because none of its objections to the final decree were successful,the district court found that those objections were only a small part of the sierra club efforts throughout the course of the litigation and observed 
the proposed interim decree and the complaint in this matter were filed at the same time.the court found the proposed interim decree illusory in that there were no fixed dates or enforceable rights establishing who would provide relief to those affected.plaintiffs and defendants,those involved in the case not including the sierra club claimed they had been negotiating for approximately ten years about ssos,csos,and other problems.however,despite ten years of negotiations nothing concrete was accomplished to help those being injured.it was not until the sierra club filed its own complaint and ultimately intervened in this matter that positive solutions began to emerge.
the record before us fully supports the district court conclusion that,without the sierra club efforts,the more comprehensive consent decree would not have come to fruition.for example,the sierra club argued that the language of the final consent decree could be manipulated improperly to justify extensions of the deadlines set forth within the document.the court observed that as a result of the objections,the sierra club achieved representations from the government that this language would not be used to unduly delay the implementation of the decree deadlines.and,as the court added,not only were these representations made by the government but they were incorporated into an enforceable order of the court.the district court also emphasized the sierra club success in ensuring that the plan was included in the final consent decree.despite the county contention on appeal that those provisions are beyond the reach of the act and,therefore,can not provide a basis for a fee award,the federal government had conceded that the sewer overflows,the deficiencies at wastewater treatment plants,and backups in people basements were interrelated problems.those people affected obviously have the sierra club to thank for any relevant improvements in their sewer service.moreover,the court need not trace the relief achieved back to a discrete claim in the litigation,so long as the claim involve d a common core of facts or related legal theories.hensley eckerhart,d.
finally,as to the amount of the award,the county contends that if the recovery is affirmed,it should be radically reduced because the sierra club enjoyed only a de minimis level of success.we conclude to the contrary,but we do find that the case must be remanded in light of the district court order summarily reducing the requested fees without specifying what duplicative and unreasonable charges were excluded from the award.as noted in structures,structures,the district court should state with some particularity which of the claimed hours the court is rejecting,which it is accepting,and why.failure to provide such an explanation requires us to remand the case for further consideration,cir quoting wooldridge marlene indus,cir.
conclusion 
for the reasons set out above,we affirm the district court decision to award litigation costs to the sierra club but remand the case for clarification as to the amount of the award.
the majority upholds the district court award of attorney fees to sierra club under d.however,because i believe that d does not authorize such an award,and because sierra club is neither a prevailing nor a substantially prevailing party,i must respectfully dissent.further,while the majority found it unnecessary to address whether the catalyst theory remains a viable theory of recovery under the clean water act,i believe this issue must be addressed because it was an alternative basis for the district court decision.and as discussed below,analysis of relevant authorities leads me to conclude that this is no longer a viable theory for recovery of attorney fees.accordingly,i would reverse the decision of the district court.
i.the clean water act

first,notice allows government agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environmental regulations,thus obviating the need for citizen suits second,notice gives the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.

finally,in addition to injunctive relief and monetary penalties,private party plaintiffs may seek an award of attorney fees and costs if they substantially prevail in the litigation.
ii.relevant 
as noted by the majority,the city of cincinnati waste removal system constitutes the backdrop for this appeal.in,the director of the ohio environmental protection agency oepa formulated a sso elimination plan.this plan required hamilton county,the city of cincinnati,and the metropolitan sewer district an entity operated by the county and city to control the sewer system,to prepare a plan for elimination of all unpermitted discharge of sewage,industrial waste and other wastes to the waters of the state from identified overflow point in msd separate sanitary sewage system within nine months.on june,the defendants submitted their general compliance plan to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows.however,in subsequent years,they continued to report illegal overflow locations.
in,the oepa joined with the united states epa epa to negotiate a comprehensive solution associated with the defendants ssos,csos,and various water treatment plants.over the next two years,the parties met frequently to discuss the proper solution to the issues raised by the oepa and epa.the parties agreed to divide the negotiations into two phases to address ssos and csos and issues related to msd wastewater treatment plants.
on december,sierra club sent a notice letter to the defendants.the letter pertained exclusively to ssos,specifically alleging that the defendants were violating the cwa because their sanitary sewer conveyance systems have and continue to overflow into the mill creek and little miami river both navigable waters of the united states from specific openings in the sewer system.sierra club indicated it was providing notice of ssos included in e ach monthly report from msd to oepa dating back from the date of th e notice letter.in addition,sierra club stated that it was providing notice of any additional ssos to the little miami river the mill creek of which msd has actual notice.
on february,before the notice period elapsed,the federal and state governments filed an enforcement action against the defendants.the federal and state action alleged that the defendants wastewater discharge constituted a violation of the cwa and ohio environmental laws.on that same day,the parties filed a interim partial consent decree ipcd in the united states enforcement action relating to implementation of remedial measures to address the ssos.the parties also made the decree available for a public comment period 
two weeks later,on february,sierra club filed a citizen suit against the defendants,alleging that the oepa and epa were not diligently prosecuting the defendants violations because the ipcd fail ed to seek comprehensive or substantial relief.the district court opined that citizen suit filed by sierra club was more definite and comprehensive than the federal and state enforcement actions,inasmuch as the enforcement actions did not cover violations after the lawsuit was filed.notably,however,both sierra club complaint and the government complaint involved the defendants alleged sso violations.the defendants moved to dismiss sierra club citizen suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the federal and state entities were already diligently prosecuting the same cwa violations raised in the citizen suit.the district court never ruled on the motion.instead,sierra club citizen suit was consolidated with the federal and state actions and sierra club was permitted to intervene in the federal enforcement action.
while the litigation was pending,the defendants continued to pursue the second phase of their negotiations with the federal and state environmental officials in an attempt to craft a second consent decree addressing the remaining issues,including csos and wastewater treatment plants.the consent decree on csos,wastewater treatment plants,and implementation of a capacity assurance program plan for sanitary sewer overflows the cso decree was filed with the district court on december.the united states,the state of ohio,the county,the city,and the ohio river valley water sanitation commission an interstate agency responsible for preventing pollution of the ohio river were signatories to the cso decree.sierra club,however,was not a party to either the cso decree or the ipcd decree.thus,it did not obtain any enforceable rights as a result of the decree.
the cso decree required that the defendants remedy their csos as expeditiously as practicable and improve the performance of their wastewater treatment plants.it also required that the defendants install devices in residential basements to prevent in customer basements or wib events,wib events when they occur,and compensate customers for damages that they incur as a result of wib events.in addition,through the cso decree,the defendants agreed to pay million in civil penalties for past cwa violations and implement at least million in supplemental environmental projects in lieu of additional penalties.
by order dated june,the district court granted the government plaintiffs motion to enter the ipcd and cso decrees.the district court noted that the two decrees presented a comprehensive plan for remedying the defendants issues and achieving full compliance with the cwa.sierra club opposed entry of the decrees,alleging,in part,that the decrees lacked firm deadlines and contained deadlines that were too distant.sierra club also moved the district court to appoint a special master to oversee the implementation of the decrees.the district court rejected sierra club objections noting,in particular,that it was unnecessary to appoint a special master to supervise implementation of the decrees.however,in accordance with the federal government suggestion,the district court appointed an ombudsman to oversee implementation of the wib program.
following entry of the decrees,sierra club moved to recover over million in attorney fees under the cwa citizen suit provision.the district court granted the motion,resulting in the present appeal.
iii.analysis 
d does not authorize an award of fees to sierra club.
the district court awarded fees in this case pursuant to the citizen suit provision of the cwa,d.as an initial matter,the majority opinion fails to adequately address whether d authorizes an award of fees in this case.instead,the majority notes that the sierra club intervened in the government action and filed a separate action pursuant to d which was later consolidated with the government action.
it is unclear whether the majority upholds the award of fees to sierra club because it was a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in the or because it was a prevailing or substantially prevailing intervening party in the government enforcement action.in either case,i do not believe that sierra club was entitled to fees under d.sierra club was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in its citizen suit or the consent decree and d does not authorize an award of fees to an intervening party in an enforcement action.
the majority concludes that to the extent that the sierra club was a prevailing or substantially prevailing party,it was entitled to attorneys fees under section d.i disagree with this conclusion.section d provides that 
t he court,in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section,may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.
d.based on a reading of the plain language of d,a court is only authorized to award fees and costs in an action brought pursuant to the citizen suit provision of the cwa.
additionally,while the majority notes that the sierra club action here was filed under the citizen suit provision of,the mere filing of suit does not warrant an award of fees under d.rather,a court may only award fees to prevailing or substantially prevailing parties in such actions.and sierra club certainly was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in its citizen suit.after filing the citizen suit,sierra club elected to consolidate it with the federal enforcement action and to cease prosecution of its claims sierra club then intervened in the government enforcement action and did not seek or achieve any relief beyond that sought and achieved by the governmental entities.in fact,sierra club ceased prosecution of its own citizens suit claims and proceeded exclusively as an intervenor in the enforcement action.therefore,the district court lacked authority to award fees to sierra club inasmuch as it was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in its citizen suit.
i must also part company with the majority conclusion that the district court had authority to award fees to sierra club because it was an prevailing or substantially prevailing intervening party in the government enforcement action.while the majority does not address whether the d authorizes an award of fees to an intervening party in an enforcement action,the district court relied primarily on the eighth circuit decision in epa city of green forest,cir,in finding that a citizen group with intervenor status was entitled to an award of fees under d.in green forest,the court held that the district court erred when it refused to allow a group of citizens to intervene in the epa enforcement action.the citizens argued that the denial of the intervention motion robbed them of their right to seek attorney fees and that their efforts were instrumental in spurring the epa into finally taking action against the city.id.at.the court noted that these arguments had some force and agreed that the citizens should be permitted to seek their fees.id.as such,the court remanded the attorney fees issue back to the district court to determine the proper amount of such fees.id.
green forest can not bear the weight that the district court placed upon it.it does not stand for general proposition that d authorizes fees to citizen intervenors in federal enforcement actions.the court found that the citizen group was entitled to fees not simply because they were intervenors but because their efforts were instrumental in spurring the epa into taking action.id.in other words,based on the language of the opinion,the court believed that the citizens were a catalyst for the epa enforcement action.however,as discussed below,i believe the catalyst theory is no longer a viable theory of recovery for attorney fees.therefore,the holding in green forest is not,as the district court suggests,persuasive authority upon which this court should rely in concluding that d authorizes an award of fees to in enforcement actions.
in united states comunidades unidas contra la contaminacion,cir,the first circuit acknowledged t here exists a question currently undecided at the court of appeals level whether,in a case brought under the clean water act,an intervenor,as distinguished from a plaintiff which has initiated its own suit,is entitled to counsel fees.id.at.the court declined to address the issue,noting that the district court failed to provide an explanation for the denial of the fee award.the court stated that it would not decide the issue of whether an intervenor was entitled to fees under d unless it was the only obstacle to an award of fees.ultimately,the case was remanded to the district court for the purpose of revisiting the attorney fees issue.
the two district courts that have considered whether an intervenor in an enforcement action is entitled to fees under the cwa have reached different conclusions.in united states maine department of transportation,the court held that sierra club was not entitled to attorney fees under d where it intervened in a cwa enforcement action brought by the united states pursuant to instead of bringing a citizen suit action.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that d unambiguously authorizes an award of fees only in an action under and determined the filing of a notice did not constitute the commencement of an action.the court also rejected the argument that,because b b authorizes citizen intervention into a enforcement action,the intervention constitutes an action under.the court pointed out that such a claim was contrary to the plain language of,which prohibits citizen suits where the united states has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action,thereby recognizing that a citizen suit is distinct from a enforcement action.
in contrast,in united states city of san diego,d,the district court stated,with little discussion,that it could award attorney fees to a prevailing intervenor.as justification,the court simply noted that at an earlier stage in the proceedings,it had found that the cwa authorized an award of fees to an intervenor when that inventor was a prevailing party.
while there exists an unresolved question regarding whether a intervening party in a cwa enforcement action is eligible for fees under d,under the clear language of the statute the analysis in maine department of transportation,supra,is than the green forest decision relied upon by the district court.therefore,i disagree with the conclusion that d authorizes an award of fees to intervening parties in enforcement actions.
because sierra club was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party in its citizen suit and because d does not authorize an award of attorney fees to intervening parties in enforcement actions,sierra club was not entitled to a fee award under d.inasmuch as the majority concludes that sierra club was entitled to a fee based on its status as a prevailing party in the citizen suit or its status as a prevailing intervening party in the enforcement dissent from the opinion.
sierra club is neither a prevailing nor a substantially prevailing party.
even if the district court had authority to award attorney fees under d,i would reverse the award because sierra club was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party.a party prevails either by obtain ing an enforceable judgment or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement that directly benefit s the plaintiff at the time of the judgment or settlement.farrar hobby,d internal citations omitted.in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d,the supreme court made clear that a party must receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail,such that the relief material ly alter s the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.further,the change in the relationship must be judicially sanctioned.id.at.according to the supreme court recent decision in sole wyner,d,interpreting buckhannon,the term prevailing party does not include a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a consent decree,but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.sole wyner,d reversing an award of attorney fees to a party who prevailed in a preliminary injunction,but ultimately lost on the merits of her claim.
here,sierra club did not obtain any relief on the merits.the defendants entered into consent decrees with the government plaintiffs,agreeing to remedy the ssos and csos and agreeing to address wib events.however,sierra club was not a party to the consent decrees and did not obtain any relief or rights as a result of the decree.while the district court allowed sierra club to express its concerns and file objections to the proposed consent decrees prior to entry,it declined to grant any of the relief that sierra club sought,specifically denying its objections 
the majority places great emphasis on the fact that the government plaintiffs and the defendants spent a great deal of time addressing issues raised by sierra club.however,such an argument can be made in almost every environmental case which require public notice and comment before a consent decree may be confirmed and entered as noted above,the supreme court has expressly held that such a voluntary change in the relationship between the parties as a result of a lawsuit is insufficient to trigger a shift in the general rule that parties pay their own fees.buckhannon,at.see also sole.at.although the majority opinion notes that sierra club,as an intervening party,was entitled to inform the court of unenforced violations of the consent decree s and request that the court enforce the terms of the decrees and this court order,this entitlement had no effect on the defendants behavior toward sierra club.moreover,sierra club did not receive an enforceable judgment and was not a party to the consent decrees.without obtaining any relief to enforce,sierra club can not be said to be a prevailing or substantially prevailing party.
c.the catalyst theory is not a viable theory of recovery.
finally,although not addressed by the majority,the sierra club was not entitled to a fee award under the catalyst theory.prior to the supreme court decision in buckhannon,prevailing parties included parties who secured a judgment on the merits,parties who obtained a settlement decree,and,in most circuits,parties who achieve d the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct,pursuant to the catalyst theory.buckhannon,at.in buckhannon,the supreme court clearly rejected the catalyst theory that had been the case law in this and other circuits.see andretti borla performance,cir citing chambers ohio dep t of human,cir.in buckhannon,the plaintiff brought a preemption challenge to a state law but the action became moot after the state legislature repealed the allegedly preempted law.even though the court did not rule on the merits of the action,the plaintiff sought an award of attorney fees,arguing that its suit was the catalyst for the repeal.
the supreme court began its analysis by observing that the term prevailing party is a legal term of art.buckhannon,at.quoting from black law dictionary,the court explained that prevailing party means a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered.id.alternation in original.after surveying its own precedents involving prevailing party statutes,the court observed that it had never approved an award of attorney fees without finding that a party had obtained some degree of formal success.as such,the court concluded that a prevailing party is one who has been awarded some relief by the court.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court rejected the catalyst theory because it permits an award where there is no change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.specifically,the court noted that 
a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term prevailing party authorizes an award of attorney fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.
id.at.emphasis in original.the court further explained that only enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees create the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.id.at.citing texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d internal quotation marks omitted.
in chambers ohio department of human services,this court concluded that buckhannon invalidat ed the catalyst theory as a permissible basis for awarding attorneys fees.chambers,at.discussing buckhannon,the chambers court noted that 
t he court concluded that to prevail,and thus become eligible for attorneys fees,a party must have obtained a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.more specifically,the court noted that an award of attorneys fees is appropriate where a plaintiff has obtained an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree,but not under the catalyst theory,which allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.thus,the court concluded that a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.proceeding from this analysis,the court categorically rejected the catalyst theory as a permissible basis for awarding attorney fees.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original.
the chambers court acknowledged that,although buckhannon involved an award of attorney fees under different statutes,the fair housing amendments act fhaa and americans with disabilities act ada,the supreme court rejection of the catalyst theory was not limited to those statutes.specifically,this court pointed out that the supreme court has expressly stated that all statutes that authorize attorney fees to the prevailing party are to be treated consistently.id.at internal citations omitted.
in finding that the catalyst theory under the cwa survived the buckhannon decision,the district court stated that a lthough buckhannon might logically prevent the catalyst theory from being used for prevailing parties its application to substantially prevailing parties is not as clear.however,a party that substantially prevails or a substantially prevailing party under the cwa is not necessarily different from a prevailing party as that term is construed in buckhannon.
several circuit courts have expressly held that buckhannon holding applies with equal force to statutes such as the cwa that include prevailing or substantially prevailing party language for example,in sierra club city of little rock,cir,the eighth circuit held that sierra club was not entitled to attorney fees under the cwa where the district court found the city of little rock to be in violation of the cwa but did not order any relief.relying upon buckhannon,the court explained that sierra club was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party because the judgment did not change the relationship between sierra club and the city.id.at.also,in kasza whitman,cir,the ninth circuit addressed language in the resource conservation and recovery act of that allows for an award of fees to a prevailing or substantially prevailing party,e.the court held that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party and thus could not be a substantially prevailing party because she did not gain by judgment or consent decree a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.
likewise,in oil,chemical atomic workers international union,department of energy,the circuit concluded that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory is broad enough to preclude an award of attorney fees under foia,which makes fees available to a substantially prevailing party.the court noted that it had seen nothing to suggest that congress sought to draw any fine distinction between the phrases prevailing party and substantially prevail.id.at.the second circuit agreed in preservation coalition of erie county federal transit administration,cir,and determined that the provision of the national environmental policy act of,d,which allows fee awards to a party who substantially prevails is fundamentally the same as those statutes containing the term prevailing party for purposes o
