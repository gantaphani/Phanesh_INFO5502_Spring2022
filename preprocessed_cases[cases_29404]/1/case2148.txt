background 
wetzler began working at the illinois cpa society the society in and participated in the plan throughout his employment.at the time of his retirement,wetzler was the society vice president of governmental affairs and qualified as a employee hce under the terms of the plan.
the plan is a defined benefit plan consisting of less than participants and is required to comply with the erisa,g and sections a and a of the internal revenue code.on the date that wetzler retired,may,the plan had participants and approximately million in assets.section d of the plan provided that participants could select a single sum cash payment of their benefits.
the first and only hce to retire under the plan prior to wetzler did so in.at that time,the society actuary permitted that hce to take a payout of his benefits without providing any security to the plan even though the plan was underfunded.the plan now maintains that this distribution was made in error.indeed,such a distribution was not permitted by the applicable treasury regulations.
the plan maintains that it did not find out about the distribution until.once it determined that the distribution violated treasury regulations and therefore risked the plan tax status,the board of directors adopted amendment one on june.this amendment provided that all plan distributions would be subject to treasury reg.sections a b and.in addition,restricted distributions made prior to july,would remain available if accompanied by the posting of security as permitted by revenue ruling,wl.specifically,the amendment allowed a distribution to an hce if the hce obtained the distribution before july,and provided security in the form of either an escrow account containing of the distribution amount a letter of credit in the amount of the distribution or a bond in the amount of the distribution.the plan adopted amendment one in order to correct the prior improper payout and protect the plan from disqualification by the irs.
when wetzler retired from the society in,he received forms from the society which listed a disbursement as an option.similarly,on may,wetzler discussed his retirement options with the society during a teleconference during which the disbursement was discussed as an available option.the next day,however,the society notified wetzler that a disbursement was unavailable due to the amount of disbursement.wetzler elected to defer his benefits in a letter dated may.
in september of,wetzler requested a plan amendment that would allow him to receive a disbursement of his benefits without posting security.the executive committee denied this proposal.later,in january of,wetzler sent a letter demanding that his benefits be rolled into an ira in a lump sum without any security.the plan denied this request,noting specifically that because the plan was underfunded,a disbursement would violate treasury regulations and would cause the plan to risk its status.finally,wetzler once again demanded a distribution in a letter dated june,this time offering to post security.the plan once again rejected his demand.
wetzler filed this suit on august,arguing that amendment one to the plan violated the rules of erisa by eliminating a benefit and that the plan acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying his demands for a distribution.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan noting that the plan granted discretion to the administrator to interpret its terms.the district judge reviewed the administrator interpretation under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard and accepted the administrator interpretation that a distribution was not allowed before amendment one and therefore such a distribution was not an accrued benefit and did not violate erisa provisions.the district judge concluded that the plan denials of wetzler requests for a distribution were not arbitrary and capricious.
wetzler appealed,arguing that the district court erred in applying the incorrect standard of review finding that amendment one did not violate erisa provision concluding that distributions were not allowed by the plan prior to amendment one and ruling that the plan denial of wetzler request for a distribution was not arbitrary and capricious.

discussion 
wetzler first argues that the district court erred by using the arbitrary and capricious standard of review in ruling on the motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether amendment one violated erisa and asserts that a de novo standard of review should have been used because the question at issue was whether a term in the plan violated erisa.
denials of benefits are reviewed de novo unless the plan at issue gives the plan administrator discretion to construe the policy terms.hess,at.if the administrator is given such discretion,then its decision is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.the plan at issue here grants the administrator such discretion stating,the administrative committee shall have the power to interpret and construe the plan,to determine all questions of eligibility,status and rights of participants,their beneficiaries,an others hereunder,to commute payments,and to decide any disputes arising hereunder.
the district court first had to determine whether a distribution was available prior to amendment one.that is,the rule of erisa provides that the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan g.a plan amendment which has the effect of eliminating an optional form of benefit,with respect to the benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.g.therefore,before the district court could determine whether the amendment violated erisa,it first had to determine whether the option to receive a distribution was available before,and then taken away,by amendment one.this determination involved reviewing the administrator interpretation of the provisions of the plan,which was appropriately conducted using the arbitrary and capricious standard.
once the district court concluded that the administrator determination that a distribution was not available before the amendment was not arbitrary and capricious,it correctly used de novo review in determining if the plan violated the provisions of
