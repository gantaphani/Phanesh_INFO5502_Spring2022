the massachusetts port authority massport,an arm of the commonwealth charged with among other things operating boston logan airport logan,imposes on bus and other surface transport entities a fee for stops at the airport.four bus companies brought suit against massport in federal district court,seeking a declaration that the fees are prohibited under federal law and an injunction against them.the district court found in favor of massport,and the bus companies now appeal.
the facts are undisputed.the plaintiff bus companies transport passengers between logan and various locations,including locations,concord.to pick up or discharge passengers at logan,each company had to sign a standard commercial ground transportation service operating agreement with massport.the agreement obligates the company to pay a fee based on the number of trips to logan,regardless of the number of passengers and even if the bus is empty.
massport states that the fee is imposed in exchange for providing motor carriers with access to and use of logan and serves to partially defray administrative,maintenance,construction and capital costs associated with the logan facilities used by these carriers.that it costs money to build and operate logan is not in dispute.rather,the bus companies say that as to them,the fees are prohibited by the bus statute,which reads,in its entirety,as follows 
a state or political subdivision thereof may not collect or levy a tax,fee,head charge,or other charge on 
a passenger traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier 
the transportation of a passenger traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier 
the sale of passenger transportation in interstate commerce by motor carrier or 
the gross receipts derived from such transportation.
following massport announcement that it planned to triple the fee to per trip in april is now apparently several dollars bus companies brought the present action in the district court.the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge,c,who,on for summary judgment,rejected the statutory challenge and granted summary judgment for massport.on this appeal,our review of the order granting summary judgment is de novo.banco popular de,cir.
the statute,where it applies,forbids fees massport is a state entity,and the charges are fees.what is at issue is whether the fees fall into any of the four enumerated categories.none of the four clearly embraces the charge the charge is not directly on a passenger clause formally,it is not on the transportation of a passenger or the sale of passenger transportation clauses and,as it applies to any bus trip to logan,full or empty and passenger or freight nor is it measured by or contingent upon gross receipts clause.
but all of the clauses could be stretched to apply to the charge,and this is most apparent as to clauses and,on which the plaintiffs principally rely.although the charge is not formally levied on the transportation of a passenger traveling in interstate commerce or the sale of interstate passenger transportation,the buses in question principally transport passengers and a number appear to be passengers traveling in interstate commerce.thus,such transportation is impacted by the charge even though it is not the sole focus of the charge.
in short,the language of the statute is not so clear as to exclude other sources of guidance as to its meaning.see strickland comm r,me.dep t of human,cir.ordinarily,the main sources of enlightenment are legislative history,judicial precedent,and the legislature underlying policy.in this case,however,there is not very much enlightenment to be wrested from these sources.
the history of the statute begins not with buses,but with airlines and a supreme court decision upholding a locally imposed head,per person tax on airline passengers,vast numbers of whom travel interstate.airport auth.dist.delta airlines,d.the supreme court sustained this tax against a dormant commerce clause challenge,saying that it did not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce.id.at.
congress responded with the tax act ahta,stat.codified as amended at app,prohibiting locally enacted head taxes and other fees on four categories of same four categories quoted above and later adopted in the bus statute.unlike the bus statute,the airline statute as enacted prohibited such taxes directly or indirectly,and,also unlike the bus statute,carved out some exceptions that permitted specific taxes,including landing fees for aircraft see app.northwest airlines,county of kent,d.
two decades later,history repeated itself and it was the bus companies turn to seek protection from the supreme court.in oklahoma tax commission jefferson lines,d,the supreme court upheld oklahoma sales tax on purchases of interstate bus tickets,ruling that the tax did not violate the dormant commerce clause.id.at.again,congress responded,incorporating the language of the ahta into a new bus statute,whose text has been quoted above.
the house conference report summed up the object of the statute thusly 
this section prohibits a state or political subdivision of a state from levying a tax on bus tickets for interstate travel.this reverses a recent supreme court decision permitting states to do so and conforms taxation of bus tickets to that of airline tickets.
conf,at.the house and senate reports contain similar language or parts of it,at,cong,at.no other legislative history,any hearings has been cited to us,and,as we will explain,the hearings on the ahta are not very helpful because of the different statutory tax and funding context in airline regulation.
the conference report just quoted is of limited help as a gloss on the statutory language it repeats the language of one of the four categories and invokes in general terms the treatment of airline tickets.nor does it explain what was troubling to congress the oklahoma statute did not directly distinguish between interstate and intrastate applied to all tickets,jefferson lines,at.there was no showing that oklahoma had placed an undue burden on interstate commerce in the sense of seriously discouraging interstate travel.
the oklahoma statute was arguably vulnerable because it taxed the passenger and required the bus company to collect the tax on the full price of the ticket for an interstate trip originating in oklahoma.in the context of gross receipt taxes on carriers,the supreme court had earlier insisted on some kind of apportionment.central greyhound lines,mealey.however,congress,in overturning jefferson lines,did not require apportionment,but further taxes falling in any one of the four specified categories this,then,is the inconclusive background.
in the present appeal,the bus companies make several different arguments.the leitmotif of the entire that the fee charged on their trips to logan is patently a tax,fee,or other charge levied indirectly on passengers traveling in interstate commerce and levied directly on the transportation of passengers traveling in interstate commerce.but the fee is not charged directly on the interstate transportation of passengers it applies on a basis to buses or other vehicles,delivery vehicles,loaded or empty.
as for indirectly comprising a tax on passengers,some or all of the fee may well be passed on to passengers in higher ticket so the tax may mimic the effect of a charge that would be forbidden under clauses and.but that is true of many,the state tax on could be said of any state charge or fee that affects buses,including parking tickets.
the problem with the argument is not that the bus statute fails to use the term indirect.in fact,the ahta originally prohibited charges that directly or indirectly fell within the enumerated categories,and the language was later deleted as superfluous.see note,above.we would therefore be free to read the bus statute as broadly as the original ahta.the real issue is whether and when the statute should be read to embrace fees and charges that are not within its most straightforward reading but may come reasonably close.
we can not supply a single test for making this kind of judgment.probably the variables include,among others,the closeness of the l
