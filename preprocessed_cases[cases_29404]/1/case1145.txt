opinion of the court 
in this tax case the internal revenue service imposed a tax penalty and collected it by a levy on assets.the trust fund against whose assets the irs levied to collect the penalty and the fund administrator who reimbursed the fund on the penalty it paid seek the return of the monies paid.the irs resists on two grounds that are pertinent to this appeal.it argues that the fund administrator lacks standing to sue the united states for a refund under a,where the penalty was actually assessed against the fund itself but the administrator reimbursed the fund.we conclude that the irs is correct on this issue,and the administrator lacks standing.
but that does not end the matter.the taxpayer the fund may still sue.the irs claims,however,the tax refund request was untimely.the fund counters that it produced evidence that it mailed the request early enough to allow timely physical delivery.this method,known as the mailbox rule,works if the rule still exists.the government argues it does not because preempts the mailbox rule in tax cases.we disagree the mailbox rule simply supplements.in addition,even before any consideration of the mailbox rule,there is sufficient direct evidence of timely receipt to preclude summary judgment against the fund.thus,we vacate the district court order to the extent it concluded the contrary.
facts and procedural history 
the philadelphia marine trade longshoremen association vacation fund the fund is a trust fund that accumulates contributions from collective bargaining agreements between the philadelphia marine trade association and local unions of the international longshoremen association.the fund is required to withhold income and payroll taxes from the money it distributes and to remit these taxes to the irs.accordingly,it hired consulting corporation,a consulting business,as the fund administrator to handle the task of calculating and remitting the taxes.
prior to june,the irs determined that the fund had remitted its taxes for the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of by a paper coupon,rather than electronically,in violation of applicable regulations.it also apparently determined that the fund had remitted its taxes for the fourth quarter of late,though it did so electronically.the irs thus assessed penalties against the fund and notified of the problems.the employee who received the communications from the irs,however,failed to take corrective action.accordingly,on june,the irs levied on held by the fund in a money market account.the employee who had failed to respond to the irs then resigned in february without having disclosed the existence of the levy to or the fund.it was not until the spring of that the fund and discovered the levy as a result of an audit on the fund books performed by anthony pontarelli,cpa.
alarmed,pontarelli and susan president called revenue officer james dugan of the irs to ask for an explanation of the levy.dugan testified that because the tax penalty was paid,and the case therefore closed from the irs standpoint,he did not keep records of this communication.he also testified,however,that during this conversation pontarelli and were frantic,in an uproar,and so nervous and concerned.subsequently,the fund and assert,pontarelli drafted a letter to dugan on or before may,requesting a refund the may letter.pontarelli testified that he faxed the may letter to,and she testified that she received it,immediately signed it,and sent it via united states postal service overnight mail to dugan.can not provide proof of mailing the may letter,and there is no separate billing record to support this assertion because the postage was paid through a meter at office.dugan claimed he could not recall whether he received the letter.
contends that,having not yet heard a response from dugan to the may letter,she called him in late may.she asserts that dugan informed her that he had not yet had a chance to review the matter but would let her know when he had done so.alleges that she then sent another letter to dugan on june,the june letter,with postage again prepaid through a meter in office,this time by first class mail.although dugan again does not recall receiving the letter,a computer printout shows that the june letter was in fact composed by on that date.
pontarelli testified that dugan subsequently left him two voicemail messages in late june.the first assured him that dugan would process a refund for the fund.the second backed off from this assurance,noting that the matter was more complicated than dugan had anticipated.
in august,following various communications over the summer,pontarelli,thomas mcgoldrick attorney,dugan,and allison sigler a trouble shooter for the irs met to discuss the matter.dugan and sigler declined to refund the money at this meeting,but told pontarelli and mcgoldrick how they could formally request a refund.accordingly,in september mcgoldrick,on behalf of the fund,filed a formal refund request via irs form and a letter.the irs then granted a partial refund of,corresponding to the second and fourth quarters of but withheld the portion corresponding to the fourth quarter of.according to the irs,because the penalty for this quarter was paid on june,under a the fund had to request a refund by june.the september refund request,the irs asserted,was therefore untimely.
recognizing that its employee was partly to blame for the fund predicament having failed timely to respond to the irs communications,reimbursed the fund for the tax penalty.it did so via a formal agreement in which the fund,in exchange for reimbursement,promised to cooperate with in processing its appeal to the irs for a refund and to transfer to any money recovered from the irs.
the fund and filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to recover payment of the remaining penalty.they,as well as the government,later moved for summary judgment.in support of its motion,the government argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction over claim,as lacked standing under a.the government also argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over both plaintiffs claims due to untimely filing of the refund request,because the plaintiffs did not produce direct evidence of timely receipt by the irs and could not avail themselves of the mailbox rule,which the government contended was preempted by.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in the government favor thus denying the summary judgment motion of the fund and.the fund and timely appealed,and we exercise appellate review pursuant to.
ii.standard of review 
because the district court granted summary judgment,our review is plenary.see,bailey united airlines,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we must draw all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.bailey,at.
iii.standing 
the district court properly concluded that lacks standing to sue the government for a refund.first,a has conferred no right on to sue for a refund it has conferred that right only on the fund.second,does not qualify for standing to assert the fund right.
lack of statutory standing under a 
statutory standing asks whether congress has accorded this injured plaintiff the right to sue the defendant to redress his injury.graden conexant,cir emphasis in original.the statute at issue here is a,by which the united states has waived sovereign immunity.it confers original jurisdiction on the district courts for civil actions against the united states for the recovery of allegedly erroneous or illegal tax assessments or collections.see united states dalm,d 
the supreme court in united states williams has cautioned that we must not enlarge this waiver beyond the purview of the statutory language,and that we must construe ambiguities in favor of immunity,d.the court held that a authorizes a refund suit not only by a party directly assessed a tax,but also a party who,though not assessed a tax,paid the tax under protest to remove a federal tax lien from her property.id.the government had filed a lien against the plaintiff house because the plaintiff was delinquent on his taxes.id.at.the plaintiff,protesting the lien because she herself was not delinquent on her taxes,nonetheless paid the government to clear title to the house because she had contracted to sell it.id.at.the court held that the plaintiff had standing to sue the government for a refund under a,reasoning that the lien was against the plaintiff own property,id.at.that the plaintiff paid the government under protest,she had insisted that her property was not a proper source from which to extract money to satisfy her tax liability,id.at.and that no other available remedy existed,id.at.
but the court essentially limited its holding in williams to the case facts.it clarified,for instance,that it did not decide the circumstances,if any,under which a party who volunteers to pay a tax assessed against someone else may seek a refund under a.id.at.recognizing the narrowness of this holding,the tenth circuit court of appeals held in dahn united states that a plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the government seizure of his property to satisfy his parents debts,cir.the court reasoned that,whereas the plaintiff in williams deliberately and affirmatively proffer ed payment to the government,the plaintiff in dahn was simply a passive,collateral subject of irs collection activities.id.at.
we conclude that a,as interpreted by the supreme court in williams,does not give a right to sue.it was not assessed the tax penalty.moreover,involvement in the payment differs from that of the plaintiff in williams.unlike that person property,own property was not encumbered by the government.more importantly,did not pay the tax penalty to the irs.rather,the fund paid the irs,and merely decided to reimburse the fund.although claims its reimbursement of the fund was involuntary because was partly at fault for the levy,and consequently the fund would have sued had it not made the fund whole,williams focused on whether the plaintiff payment to the government was voluntary.given that we are required to construe ambiguities in favor of sovereign immunity,williams,at,we deem these distinctions fatal to statutory standing.
can not assert the fund rights 
even where a party satisfies the constitutional standing requirements of injury,causation and redressability,see lujan defenders of wildlife,d,other called prudential considerations generally bar that party from asserting the legal rights of others,see kowalski tesmer,d.the supreme court has created an exception,however,allowing standing where the party asserting the right has a close relationship with the person who possesses the right and there is a hindrance to the possessor ability to protect his own interests.id.at.
invoking this exception,argues that even if the fund technically possesses the right to sue for a refund under a,may nevertheless assert that right as well.it reasons there is a hindrance to the fund ability to assert its own rights because,having already been made whole by,the fund lacks incentive to pursue a refund.fund reply br.at.
we find this argument unpersuasive.even if enjoys a close relationship with the fund,there is not a hindrance to the fund ability to sue for a refund.in different circumstances,a rightholder lack of incentive to sue could suggest there is a hindrance.for instance,in powers ohio,the supreme court cited jurors lack of financial incentive to sue as one of several reasons for allowing litigants to challenge improper exclusion of jurors during voir dire,d.similarly,in pennsylvania psychiatric society green spring health services,our court held that psychiatrists had standing to bring their mental health patients claims against managed health care organizations for impairing the patients treatment,cir.we reasoned that the patients were unlikely to sue in part because they feared that doing so would cause a stigma,creating a considerable deterrent to litigation.id.
here,however,the fund is not only willing to sue on its own has sued.moreover,we have no evidence that the fund would drop its suit were we to dismiss as a plaintiff.also,we are not aware of any case holding that a person or entity such as may purchase standing by paying the rightholder the amount of the rightholder loss thus stripping the rightholder of its incentive to sue and then suing the wrongdoer for reimbursement.cases instead have focused on whether the rightholder lack of incentive,before intervention by the party asserting the right,tends to deter the rightholder from bringing suit.see,carey population servs.int l,d vendor could challenge law prohibiting distribution of contraceptives in part because the desire to avoid publicity would deter potential purchasers from defending their own rights.here,by contrast,the fund did not lack incentive to sue for a refund at the time the irs levied on its property the fund had every reason to,and did,seek a refund.if the fund has lost incentive to sue,it is because stripped the fund of that incentive by deciding to reimburse it.
in short,the fund did not need a third party to protect its rights.consequently,we can not agree that fits within the standing exception.we therefore affirm the district court order to the extent that it denied standing to.
iv.timely filing 
timely filing as a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction 
it is undisputed that the district court had jurisdiction to hear this suit only if the fund filed its refund claim by june.to repeat,by a congress conferred original jurisdiction on federal district courts for civil actions against the united states for the recovery of allegedly erroneous or illegal tax assessments or collections.see dalm,at.it limited this conferring of jurisdiction,however,to suits that follow a duly filed claim for refund or credit.a.a claim is duly filed when it is timely.dalm,at.
governs whether a refund request is timely.comm r of internal revenue lundy,d.subsection a states that a 
c laim for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by this title in respect of which tax the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later,or if no return was filed by the taxpayer,within years from the time the tax was paid.
a.the return for the fourth quarter of the quarter for which the fund seeks a refund was filed on january,and the irs levied on the fund assets on june.using the deadline of two years after the levy,a required the fund to file its refund request by june.doing so is a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction 
summary judgment on the issue of timely filing was improper 
the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government on the issue of timely filing.as an initial matter,there is enough direct evidence of,receipt of the refund requests in the record to raise a genuine issue of material fact.moreover,the mailbox rule remains a way for taxpayers such as the fund to prove receipt indirectly by proof of mailing,notwithstanding the enactment of.
direct evidence of receipt 
aside from any consideration of the mailbox rule continued existence,we believe that there is enough direct evidence of,receipt by the irs of the refund requests per the may and june letters to preclude summary judgment for the government.drawing reasonable inferences in the fund favor as we must,we are satisfied that a reasonable could find that the irs timely received the fund refund requests.
pontarelli testified that he received a phone message from revenue officer dugan acknowledging receipt of the may letter.dugan testimony about this is inconclusive.though he did not recall receiving the letter,he admitted it was possible that he did.and given dugan statement that he would have ultimately destroyed the file containing the may and june letters if he had received them,the government assertion that it has no record of the letters does not resolve the question whether it received them.finally,the irs actions after june,in particular its meeting with the fund representatives in august,suggest that there was a precipitating receipt of a refund triggered this governmental response.
the mailbox rule 
even if we had concluded that the fund direct evidence of receipt is insufficient to preclude summary judgment,it has an alternate method for showing receipt the mailbox rule two of our sister circuit second and held that the mailbox rule has been preempted by.we disagree.specifically,we hold that,where a taxpayer does not rely on protection and produces evidence beyond its own testimony that it mailed the tax document early enough to allow timely receipt by the irs in the regular course of united states post office business,it may avail itself of the mailbox rule accordingly,we vacate the district court order to the extent it concluded to the contrary.
development of the mailbox rule 
a statutory filing requirement generally can be satisfied only by actual,physical delivery to the government.united states lombardo.heard comm r of internal revenue,cir.this has come to be known as the physical delivery rule.to help determine when the pertinent document was physically delivered,courts developed the mailbox rule.if a document is properly mailed,the court will presume the united states postal service delivered the document to the addressee in the usual time.rosenthal walker.see also hagner united states.the government then has the opportunity to rebut this presumption with evidence of untimely receipt.see hagner,at.
in this context,the mailbox rule is merely a method for determining the date of physical delivery under the physical delivery rule.it does not ignore the physical delivery requirement,but merely creates a presumption that physical delivery occurred in the ordinary time after mailing.
in,congress enacted of the internal revenue code.the current version provides in relevant part 
timely mailing treated as timely filing and paying 
a general rule.date of delivery.if any return,claim,statement,or other document required to be filed,or any payment required to be made,within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws is,after such period or such date,delivered by united states mail to the agency,officer,or office with which such return,claim,statement,or other document is required to be filed,or to which such payment is required to be made,the date of the united states postmark stamped on the cover in which such return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment,as the case may be.
c registered and certified mailing electronic filing.registered mail.for purposes of this section,if any return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is sent by united states registered mail 
a such registration shall be prima facie evidence that the return,claim,statement,or other document was delivered to the agency,officer,or office to which addressed and 
b the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date.
certified mail electronic filing.the secretary is authorized to provide by regulations the extent to which the provisions of paragraph with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail and electronic filing.
subsection a relieves a taxpayer from the timely physical delivery requirement where it postmarks the document before the filing deadline but the government actually receives the document after the deadline.the postmark date effectively becomes the delivery date.
subsection c provides,for purposes of,that registering one mail with the postal service establishes a prima facie case of delivery and that the registration date shall be the postmark date which,due to a,is also the delivery date.subsection c,and c,d e promulgated thereunder,extend this safe harbor to certified and electronic mail.
c.the continuing effect of the mailbox rule 
after the enactment of,there are at least two types of the mailbox rule that a taxpayer might seek to invoke,only one of which we deal with here.first,a taxpayer relying on it mailed the document before the deadline,but too late for that document to arrive on time in the ordinary course of post office seek to invoke a presumption of eventual delivery.it would need this presumption because a protects the taxpayer only where the irs actually receives the document at some later time.see sorrentino irs,cir.if the taxpayer sends the document by registered,certified,or electronic mail,c affords it a presumption of receipt.if,however,it does not use one of these three methods,and then faces an irs allegation of nonreceipt,the taxpayer must ask the court to recognize an additional presumption of receipt not listed in the arising from proof of mere mailing or postmark.such a taxpayer would have to argue that the circumstances giving rise to a prima facie case of delivery that are listed in c are not exclusive.several of our sister circuit courts have accepted this argument,at least where the taxpayer introduced circumstantial evidence of postmark beyond its own testimony.see id.at anderson united states,cir estate of wood comm r of internal revenue,cir 
we do not deal with such an intra mailbox rule here.instead,we have a second,more classic mailbox taxpayer who allegedly mailed its refund requests with time here,plenty of time for them to arrive before the deadline.such a taxpayer does not need the protection of,as the statute function is to excuse taxpayers for late receipt.the fund does not ask us to specify either may,or june,the dates it allegedly mailed its refund requests as the date of filing.it only asks for a presumption of delivery of the letters in the ordinary time after mailing here,one day after may or the regular first class delivery time after june,as allegedly sent the letters via overnight and first class mail,respectively,which would be well before the june deadline.accordingly,the dispute here is whether has completely supplanted the mailbox rule in tax cases where the taxpayer does not even rely on the statute.
for starters,the text of does nothing to affect the mailbox rule in cases such as the one before us.it is a principle of statutory construction that the common law ought not to be deemed repealed,unless the language of a statute be clear and explicit for this purpose.norfolk redevelopment housing auth.chesapeake potomac,d internal quotations,brackets,and ellipses omitted.by its terms,a applies only to cases where the pertinent document was delivered to the government after the filing deadline.here,by contrast,neither party claims the refund requests were delivered after the filing deadline of june.to repeat,the fund produced evidence that sent the may and june letters by overnight and first class mail,respectively.if that is true,the letters would presumably have arrived well before the june deadline.the government,meanwhile,claims it has no record of having received the letters at all.the text of a,therefore,does not direct a result here.thus c,which limits its application to cases in which generally applies,see c for purposes of this section,if any return,claim,statement,or other document,or payment,is sent by united states registered mail emphasis added,is also inapplicable.
even looking beyond the text,we see no indication that congress intended to preempt the mailbox rule for taxpayers who do not seek protection.as an initial matter,we find nothing in the legislative history of to support the preemption argument moreover,as a matter of logic,it is difficult to imagine that congress,by passing a law that was designed to protect taxpayers who meet requirements,would without so stating simultaneously seek to roll back the protections for taxpayers that already exist at common law.congress intent,we believe,was to supplement,not supplant,means by which taxpayers can timely file documents with the irs.see estate of wood,at.
the government draws our attention to boccuto commissioner of internal revenue,cir,where we decided that the taxpayers in that case could not satisfy.it argues that in that case we recognized that,after the enactment of,evidence of mailing other than that p
