pierre philippe tchuinga seeks review of the decision by the board of immigration appeals bia to deny his motion to reopen or remand removal proceedings so that he may apply for adjustment of status we hold that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying tchuinga motion.tchuinga is not eligible to adjust his status due to his previous submission of a frivolous asylum application,and we lack jurisdiction to review the frivolous asylum application issue because it was not raised in the motion to reopen.
tchuinga,a citizen of cameroon,entered the united states on or about september.he was detained,and the immigration and naturalization service ins charged him with inadmissibility under the immigration and nationality act ina a c i,a c i,as an immigrant who,by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,sought to procure a visa or other documentation,or admission to the united states or other benefit under the ina.he was also charged with inadmissibility under ina a a i i,a a i i,as an immigrant who,at the time of his application for admission,did not possess valid unexpired entry or travel documents.
during his initial hearing with the immigration judge ij,tchuinga conceded inadmissibility under ina a a i i but contested the charge of inadmissibility under ina a c i.he also filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.tchuinga claimed that he had suffered persecution in cameroon as a member of a militant political party,the social democratic front sdf.the ij notified him of the consequences of filing a frivolous application for asylum.an ins official reviewed tchuinga application and found him to have a credible fear of persecution and paroled him into the united states pending his removal hearing.
on september,at a hearing on tchuinga inadmissibility and claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief,tchuinga gave an account of his life in and flight from cameroon.tchuinga was a member of the sdf and was eventually appointed to the position of director of information and propaganda for the party.in that role,tchuinga served as the spokesperson for the party in his area and encouraged young people to join the group.in april or may,members of the government party,the cameroon peoples democratic movement,approached him and asked him to assist in election fraud by stuffing the ballot boxes.tchuinga refused and reported the request back to sdf party officials.approximately one month later,two men in civilian clothing came to tchuinga house and handcuffed him.they also threatened his wife with a gun,telling her to keep quiet as they drugged tchuinga and led him out of the house.when tchuinga later awoke in a small cell,he discovered that he was being held in the same detention facility where his uncle,also an officer with the sdf,had been tortured and killed five years earlier.a guard told tchuinga that the detention will teach you to disobey the government.
learning that the guard was from tchuinga tribe,tchuinga persuaded him to help him escape in exchange for the money that tchuinga had in his pocket approximately cameroon francs.with that help,tchuinga escaped and went back to his house.his wife informed him that he had been missing for seven days.he sent his wife and children to his house in another town,and fled to nigeria.he asked his cousin to watch his house in cameroon.he later learned that his cousin had been arrested,tortured,and questioned as to the whereabouts of tchuinga and his family.tchuinga returned to cameroon twice,first to obtain a passport from a friend there,and then to obtain a visa to france,where his brother and three sisters lived.he arrived in france in september and stayed with his brother.fearful of the close ties between cameroon and france,tchuinga applied for a visa to enter the united states,but was denied.he then stole his brother passport and entered the united states.
after hearing the petitioner testimony,the ij set a date for another hearing to give tchuinga time to produce and authenticate documents that would corroborate parts of his story,particularly his membership and role with the sdf,the whereabouts of his wife and children,and the arrest and torture of his cousin and uncle.at that later hearing on december,tchuinga testified that he had difficulties producing the requested documents.upon reviewing an american consulate report that questioned the accuracy of tchuinga claims and the authenticity of his documents,the ij expressed concern that some of the documents that tchuinga had submitted,including part of his sdf membership information,were fraudulent.she gave him additional time to authenticate those documents and produce additional support for his story,scheduling another hearing for april.at that hearing,tchuinga again submitted documentation and attempted to explain his difficulties in producing additional corroborating documents.
after considering the evidence,the ij concluded that tchuinga was subject to removal under ina a a i i for failing to have valid entry or travel documents at the time of his application for admission,which he had conceded,and ina a c i for having sought an immigration benefit through fraud.specifically,the ij found that tchuinga held himself out to be a citizen of france and knowingly presented a document that was not his own his brother passport in an attempt to secure admission to the united states.the ij found that tchuinga brother was able to offer him a safe haven in france and that tchuinga accordingly has not claimed in any way that the fraud he perpetrated upon the consulate and attempted to perpetrate upon the ins was occasioned by his flight from his home country or any genuine fears that propelled him to travel to the united states.
turning to tchuinga asylum application,the ij observed that tchuinga has not obtained or satisfactorily explained his failure to obtain documentation from his home country that could authenticate various information that he has provided in his asylum application.the ij concluded that although tchuinga had authenticated his membership in the sdf,he has not verif ied that he was in any way harmed.
examining the documents that tchuinga had produced,the ij found that he has knowingly provided to this court false documentation in an attempt to secure asylum and thus had knowingly filed a frivolous application for asylum.specifically,the ij found that tchuinga had knowingly presented false documents indicating that he was an appointed official of the sdf party so that he could exaggerate the nature of his membership and the extent to which he was persecuted on account of his role with the party.the ij issued a decision denying tchuinga claims and finding that,because tchuinga had submitted fraudulent evidence,he was barred from applying for any other benefits under the ina as having submitted a frivolous application.see d if the attorney general determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under this act,effective as of the date of a final determination on such application.
the petitioner obtained new counsel and,on may,filed a timely motion to reopen his case with the ij,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and arguing that he had not knowingly provided false evidence in support of his asylum claim.the ij denied the motion,and tchuinga appealed to the bia.the bia issued a decision remanding the case to the ij based on new evidence tchuinga submitted an unauthenticated letter from the leader of the sdf,confirming tchuinga membership in the sdf,and some additional documents.
during the course of these proceedings,tchuinga married an american citizen,who filed an visa application for him,a necessary prelude to an application for adjustment of status by the time of the remanded asylum hearing with the ij,the application had been approved.tchuinga informed the ij of the approved visa application.the ij stated that,in light of her previous determination that tchuinga was subject to a permanent bar from benefits for knowingly filing a frivolous asylum applicatio
