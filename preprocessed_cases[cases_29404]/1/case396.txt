petitioner domingos joao liberal de araujo de araujo asks us to review a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen proceedings and finding that he did not qualify for discretionary relief.de araujo claims that the bia denied him due process by his application for relief under former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina and by refusing to reopen his immigration proceedings to allow him an opportunity to present evidence in support of his application for former section c relief.de araujo also argues that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony because he has not committed a crime of violence.we affirm the bia dismissal of de araujo appeal of the aggravated felony issue for his failure to file a brief with the bia.because we find that de araujo due process rights were not violated and the bia acted properly within its discretion on his motion to reopen,we dismiss his remaining claims for lack of jurisdiction.
de araujo removal proceedings 
de araujo is a native and citizen of portugal who was lawfully admitted to the united states on september.he was six years old at the time.on january,de araujo was convicted in massachusetts state court of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.see.laws ch.
on april,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued de araujo a notice to appear,charging him with removability pursuant to ina a a iii,a a iii,for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony 
de araujo failed to appear at his scheduled hearing before an immigration judge ij on january,and was subsequently ordered removed in absentia.however,on april,de araujo massachusetts assault and battery charge was vacated.he then moved to reopen proceedings on april,and the ij granted the motion on july.
on october,the ins amended the original charging document to include two additional charges of removability.the first additional charge alleged that de araujo was removable on account of a november,connecticut state conviction for assault on a department of corrections employee for which he received an sentence of imprisonment.the ins charged de araujo with removability for the connecticut assault under ina a a ii,a a ii,for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
the second additional charge alleged that de araujo was removable because of a january,massachusetts state conviction for illegal possession of a controlled substance.it appears that de araujo was convicted on the same day for three different drug charges which had occurred on different days.removability for the massachusetts controlled substance violations was charged under ina a a iii,a a iii 
at a hearing before the ij,de araujo argued that he was eligible for cancellation of removal under and for relief under former section c of the ina,c repealed.the ij found that de araujo connecticut conviction for assault on a department of corrections employee constituted a crime of violence pursuant to b and therefore qualified as an aggravated felony under a f,which rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal under a in addition,the ij found that de araujo multiple massachusetts drug convictions rendered him ineligible for relief under former section c because the drug convictions occurred after the passage of iirira and repeal of section c.the ij ordered de araujo removed to portugal on february.the ij noted that de araujo had a motion pending to vacate his massachusetts drug convictions and that,if his motion was granted,he would become eligible for relief from removal under former section c.
de araujo appeal and motions to reopen proceedings with the bia 
de araujo filed a timely notice of appeal with the bia and on may,requested an extension of time to file his appellate brief.the bia granted de araujo motion and set a deadline of june.according to de araujo,his counsel sent the brief via federal express on june.however,the brief did not reach the bia until june,and the bia rejected the brief as untimely on july,de araujo filed a motion to accept the brief however,that same day,the bia dismissed the appeal for failure to file a brief.de araujo did not appeal the dismissal to this court but instead filed a motion to reconsider the dismissal with the bia on july.the bia denied de araujo motion on december.on january,de araujo filed a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings with the bia.the bia denied this motion on march,stating that this motion was in essence a second motion to reconsider and therefore exceeded the numerical limits on motions to reconsider set forth in b 
on or about november,de araujo filed a motion in massachusetts state court to vacate his controlled substance convictions.de araujo submitted a short affidavit in support of his motion to vacate,which indicated that he had been unable to understand the nature and effect of his pleas of guilty because of his problems with drug addiction 
on november,a massachusetts state court vacated de araujo drug convictions.the following day,de araujo filed a request with the bia to reopen proceedings sua sponte based on changed circumstances in his case.de araujo argued that he should now be entitled to relief under former section c because his drug convictions had been vacated.de araujo acknowledged that,under in re pickering,bia,convictions vacated solely to avoid immigration consequences remain convictions for ina purposes.he also conceded that the state record was unclear as to the factual reasons for the state court decision to vacate but argued that his affidavit regarding his addiction suggested that his pleas were not made knowingly or intelligently,and that the convictions were vacated in response to this affidavit.de araujo requested the bia to invoke its discretionary authority to reopen the case because of his clear eligibility for a c hearing.
on march,the bia denied the request to reopen proceedings sua sponte.the bia found de araujo affidavit in support of his motion to vacate the massachusetts convictions to be extremely limited in nature and stated that it would need more information before it found that the reason for vacating was sufficiently unrelated to the immigration consequences of his conviction.the bia further found that de araujo was undeserving of a section c waiver in the exercise of discretion,indicating that even if it were to reopen de araujo case,it would not grant his request for relief.it noted that de araujo had previously been convicted of four criminal offenses and,while three of these had been vacated,none had been vacated because de araujo was not guilty of the crimes committed.the bia also noted that,at the time he filed his request to the bia to reopen proceedings sua sponte,de araujo was incarcerated for parole violations.the bia concluded that de araujo criminal actions,and apparent inability to comply with the terms of his probation do not support the reopening of proceedings to apply for discretionary relief which we do not believe he merits in the exercise of our discretion.
de araujo petition for review 
de araujo filed a timely petition for review with this court,claiming that the connecticut conviction for assault against a department of corrections employee did not constitute an aggravated felony,and that the bia abused its discretion in failing to reopen his removal proceedings and,in doing so,violated his constitutional right to due process.de araujo ashcroft,cir de araujo i.on february,we dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction over either claim.id.at.with regard to the first argument,we found that w hether de araujo conviction did or did not amount to an aggravated felony is not an issue now open for review because that order became final on july,and de araujo did not appeal that order to this court within days as required by b.id.at.we described the filing deadline as a strict jurisdictional bar,which precluded us from considering his first argument.id.at.regarding the second argument,we found that we lacked jurisdiction to reach de araujo other claims on direct review because he remained removable as an aggravated felon.id.at citing ina a c,a c emile ins,cir because defendant was convicted of an aggravated felony,we have no authority to consider on direct review any other claim once we conclude that he was legitimately so classified.sousa ins,cir h aving determined that the petitioner is removable as an aggravated felon,our authority to act in this case with respect to the removal proceeding,including incidental rulings on discretionary relief,is at an end.
de araujo petition for a writ of habeas corpus and transfer 
on may,de araujo filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts however,the passage of the real id act,stat,stripped the district court of habeas jurisdiction.the district court therefore transferred the case back to this court,where we are to treat de araujo claims as ones for direct review.see real id act,c.
jurisdiction over de araujo claims under the real id act 
under the real id act,a habeas petition to a district court is transferred to a court of appeals as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review.real id act c ishak gonz√°les,cir.in this appeal,de araujo renews his claim that his connecticut conviction is not an aggravated felony and that he is therefore not removable.de araujo also contends that the bia denied him due process by his waiver and refusing to reopen his immigration proceedings to allow him an opportunity to present evidence in support of his application for relief under former section c.
the aggravated felony 
de araujo claims mirror those he previously made before this court in de araujo i.in that case,we held that the ij february,ruling that the connecticut conviction constituted an aggravated felony,which rendered de araujo subject to removal,became final on july,when the bia dismissed his appeal of the ij order.de araujo i,at.see an order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section of the act shall become final u pon dismissal of an appeal by the board of immigration appeals.we noted the strict jurisdictional requirement that,pursuant to b,all petitions for review addressed to this court from bia orders must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal and dismissed the claim as.de araujo i,at quoting zhang ins,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.however,under the real id act,habeas petitions transferred to the court of appeals are not subject to the time limit.see real id act c the court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section,except that subsection b of such section shall not apply.see also ishak,at.thus the strict jurisdictional requirement does not apply here.
moreover,de araujo properly exhausted his administrative remedies,giving us jurisdiction over his appeal.it is law that a court of appeals may not review an order of deportation or exclusion unless the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.this exhaustion requirement generally means that the bia must first review an ij determination of deportability before a petitioner may present his appeal to us.ins,cir usually issues not raised before the bia may not be raised for the first time on a petition for review.citing ravindran ins,cir citation omitted.here,de araujo filed a notice of appeal with the bia and also stated that he would file a timely brief,but failed to do so.the bia therefore dismissed the appeal.see d i e.the bia also denied de araujo subsequent motion to reconsider the dismissal of his appeal.it therefore never reviewed de araujo argument regarding the aggravated felony.we were presented with a similar situation in ins,cir.in athehortua,the bia summarily dismissed an appeal where the petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal followed by an untimely brief.we held that the petitioner had exhausted his administrative remedies.id.at petitioner did not overlook the board,or ignore it,or attempt to appeal directly to the courts from the ij order he went to the bia,albeit unsuccessfully.he thereby exhausted the remedy.here,we similarly find that de araujo has exhausted his administrative remedies.
the foregoing considerations notwithstanding,however,we will not address the merits of de araujo argument.as discussed above,the bia summarily dismissed de araujo appeal for failure to file a brief.in his current appeal,de araujo does not address this decision but instead goes straight to the merits of his aggravated felony argument.de araujo only hint at a challenge to the summary dismissal occurs in the last paragraph of his brief where he states that we have jurisdiction to review his claim because he raised the aggravated felony issue in his detailed notice of appeal.he does not argue that raising an issue in his notice of appeal could be enough to withstand a summary dismissal for failure to file a brief,nor does he ever actually claim that the bia erred in dismissing his appeal for failure to file a brief.we have repeatedly held that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states zannino,cir it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.see also stoll principi,cir holding that where a petitioner has not proffered an argument along certain lines,any such claim has been abandoned.de araujo conclusory statements,without further development,do not rise to the level of a cognizable appellate argument.inasmuch as our review is limited to the bia final order here,summary dismissal under d i e,de araujo has not adequately challenged the summary dismissal to preserve the issue,and we go no further.
relief under former section c 
de araujo also contended in de araujo i that the bia deprived him of his constitutional right to due process by refusing to reopen proceedings because he was not granted a fair opportunity to establish his eligibility for relief from removal under former section c or to present his case to an ij.id.we determined that because we lacked jurisdiction to review de araujo claim that his assault conviction was not an aggravated felony,he remains removable on that ground,and we lack jurisdiction to reach his other claims on direct review.id.citing ina a c,a c.therefore,under id act law,we did not entertain de araujo other claims,which he could instead have presented as a habeas petition in the district court.however,the real id act made the courts of appeals the sole arbiters of final orders of removal or exclusion for both criminal and aliens.see b,amended by real id act,stat.at ishak,at.
although relief from removal under former section c is a form of discretionary relief over which we generally have no appellate jurisdiction,the real id act carved out a narrow exception to permit the courts of appeals to consider constitutional claims or questions of law notwithstanding most other jurisdictional bars of the ina see,a a iii,stat.codified at a d elysee gonz√°les,cir citing mehilli gonz√°les,cir.under the terms of this limited jurisdictional grant,discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,and bia findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are usually factual determinations.mehilli,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.a constitutional claim would at least have to be colorable before a court will exercise jurisdiction to review such a claim or question.id.at.in other words,a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an argument in constitutional garb to be colorable in this context the claim must have some possible validity.id.quoting ins,cir.therefore,we review de araujo due process claims to determine whether they are indeed colorable constitutional issues.
