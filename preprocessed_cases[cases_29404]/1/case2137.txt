loparex llc owns and operates a small manufacturing plant in hammond,wisconsin.when a handful of the employees working at the plant began to drum up interest in unionizing the workforce,loparex pushed back by placing a number of restrictions on organizing activity at the workplace.loparex actions were soon brought to the attention of the national labor relations board,which concluded that loparex had engaged in a number of unfair labor practices in violation of the national labor relations act,a,a the act,or the nlra.the board ordered loparex to cease and desist and to take several affirmative steps to remedy its past violations.guided by the deferential standard of review applicable to the board decisions,we conclude that its order should be enforced.
loparex owns multiple production facilities scattered across the country at these plants,it manufactures polycoated and papers and films.in june,loparex acquired the hammond plant from the company.though the employees in that location had attempted to form a union when the plant was under the ownership of,these efforts had died off by the time loparex took over.with loparex at the helm,employees prounion sentiment lay dormant until early,when the company announced several controversial employment policies.spurred in part by their disagreement with the company recent actions,a small group of employees renewed their efforts to unionize the plant.this campaign was not warmly received by loparex officials.
in the that followed,loparex imposed several limitations on union organizing at work.after union supporters posted material on company bulletin boards in march,loparex issued a policy statement that required employees to obtain approval before placing any material on the boards.a few months later,several employees attempted to distribute prounion flyers in loparex parking lot,but they were stopped by company officials.around the same time,employees passed out union buttons in the plant and left some of them near a time clock for other employees to pick up.when company officials learned of this activity,they quickly called a meeting and told the union advocates that they had violated company policy.management also discouraged employees from talking about the union during working hours.then,in june or july,loparex informed all of the shift leaders working at the hammond plant that they qualified as supervisors under the nlra and were thus prohibited from participating in union activities.
following these events,teamsters local filed three separate unfair labor practice charges.after a hearing in may,administrative law judge alj paul bogas issued a decision in november finding that loparex had violated the act in several ways by promulgating its bulletin board policy because of antiunion animus by announcing unlawfully broad constraints on employee communications relating to unionization and by treating shift leaders as though they were supervisors under the act.loparex filed exceptions to all but one of the alj findings.the alj also found that production manager todd dennison violated section a of the act in june when he informed a group of employees that they were prohibited from speaking about union organizing at work.since loparex did not contest this conclusion before the board,we summarily enforce the alj order on this issue.see nlrb alwin,cir.the board affirmed the alj findings of fact and conclusions of law for the most part,but it wrote separately on the issue of shift leaders status as statutory supervisors.loparex now petitions this court requesting that we set aside the board decision,and the board to obtain an order enforcing its decision.
our review of the board decision is deferential.we accept its factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence,and its legal conclusions unless they are irrational or inconsistent with the act.ryder truck rental nlrb,cir see also brandeis machinery supply nlrb,cir e.our focus is on the board decision as a practical matter,we look to the alj opinion on issues where the board affirmed without additional comment.
loparex bulletin board policy 
the board adopted the alj conclusion that loparex violated section a when,against a backdrop of a corporate policy that permitted employees to use the bulletin boards for a variety of purposes,it shut off access in response to union organizing activity.as support for his finding that the purpose of the new policy was to inhibit the organization campaign,the alj pointed to a confrontational meeting between management and a union supporter that took place a few months before loparex issued the policy.the evidence of an upsurge in prounion activity following that meeting,in the alj view,supported an inference of loparex knowledge and distaste for the employees organizing efforts.this aversion played a key role in the formulation of the bulletin board policy.loparex objects that there is only a weak temporal connection between the earlier confrontation and the eventual issuance of the new bulletin board policy.loparex adds that the evidence does not establish that the company was even aware that prounion materials had been posted on company bulletin boards.
section a offers employees broad protection from employers attempts to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their statutory rights to organize under section.a.yet this statutory entitlement does not give employees an unfettered right to use a company bulletin boards to stir up interest in unionization.see fleming companies,nlrb,cir guardian indus.nlrb,cir.the critical question is whether the employer is discriminating against union messages,or if it has a neutral policy of permitting only certain kinds of postings for example,those related directly to work rules.discriminatory interference with union organizers access to bulletin boards is forbidden.fleming,at penney,nlrb,cir.though it is undisputed that loparex new bulletin board policy was facially neutral and nondiscriminatorily applied,an employer may violate the act if its motivation for a new policy is its hostility toward prounion activity.see nlrb village ix,cir finding the employer adoption of a rule was motivated by an antiunion position and thus violated the act brandeis machinery supply nlrb,cir explaining that under section a,facially nondiscriminatory policies may not target,either through design or enforcement,activity protected by the act emphasis added see also nlrb wolfe electric,cir four b nlrb,cir roadway,nlrb,cir.
if an employer is alleged to have acted with an antiunion purpose,we apply the analytical framework set forth by the board in wright line,a division of wright line,nlrb.see fedex freight east,nlrb,cir roadway,at.under wright line,the board must make a prima facie showing that antiunion animus was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer decision.nlrb joy recovery technology,cir.once the board does so,the burden shifts to the employer to prove that it had a legitimate business reason for making its decision.id.since loparex did not offer any explanation for why it adopted the new bulletin board policy,the case hinges on whether the board adequately proved its prima facie case.
in determining whether an employer acted improperly,the board is entitled to rely upon circumstantial evidence.see sca tissue north america llc nlrb,cir.in concluding that loparex was opposed to the unionization campaign,the alj focused on a series of events that took place during the months leading up to loparex announcement of the bulletin board policy.in january or february of,schillinger,a production operator at the plant,spoke with randy risler,who worked in human resources,about the employees dissatisfaction with newly enacted attendance and pay policies.id.at.schillinger was someone risler knew.in,schillinger had been fired by,the previous owner of the plant,for his union organizing activity,but he had recently been reinstated pursuant to the settlement of an unfair labor practices charge.in early february,a week after schillinger conversation with risler,todd bloom and jason carlson,both supervisors and former employees,called schillinger into an office to discuss what schillinger said to risler.after questioning schillinger,bloom called in risler and lisa koats,the human resources manager.at some point in the conversation,schillinger pointed out that everyone in the room knew his history of union organizing,and koats responded,that all water under the bridge.schillinger then asked what he should do if people asked him about unionization and koats said,y ou to just work and not talk about the union.
beginning in early february,prounion activity at the hammond plant slowly began to increase.schillinger started to wear union buttons and hats to work,and he donned a union for about half of his workdays.on march,a group of employees posted a prounion flyer on one of loparex many company bulletin boards.the flyer was taken down shortly after it was posted thereafter,it was repeatedly reposted and taken down.the record does not reveal when these postings and took place,or how many times the flyer was replaced,and so we can not tell whether the flyer was displayed on the company bulletin board after march.
these events support the board conclusion that loparex was motivated by antiunion animus when it enacted its bulletin board policy.schillinger discussion of unions with loparex management and his prounion apparel put the company on notice that union organizing efforts at the plant had re commenced.loparex points out that there is no evidence indicating that the company knew that union activists had placed a flyer on one of the many bulletin boards in the plant.nonetheless,the board was aware that this was a relatively small plant.in addition,it was entitled to rely on the suspicious timing of the policy announcement,immediately after a three or period in which loparex witnessed an uptick in employees organizing efforts.brandeis machinery supply nlrb,cir great lakes warehouse nlrb,cir nlrb,cir.
the inference of an antiunion purpose is reinforced by the hostility loparex management displayed toward schillinger at the february meeting.the board,affirming the alj,reasonably viewed the circumstances leading to the meeting as suspect.presumably,risler had already tipped off management about schillinger opposition to the new policies and thus there was little reason to interrogate schillinger about his conversation with risler.the management officials who called the meeting had worked at when schillinger was fired for his union activity.by warning schillinger at the end of the meeting not to speak about the union,koats came dangerously close to illegally prohibiting an employee from engaging in prounion solicitation during the workday.see nlrb aluminum casting engineering,cir holding an overbroad rule may improperly send the message that employees can not discuss unions during break times.we see no reason to the board conclusion that the meeting revealed management distaste for a union.
distribution of union literature in the parking lot 
in may or early june,schillinger,chris meeker and two other employees handed out literature to coworkers in the company parking lot and placed union literature on car windshields.shortly after they got started,three loparex officials came out to the parking lot and informed them that they were violating company policy.the board endorsed the alj conclusion that loparex restriction on union organizing in the company parking lot constituted an unfair labor practice under section a.
in protecting employees right to organize,section a of the act recognizes that employees organizing activities may substantially interfere with employers property rights.see margaret mercy healthcare centers nlrb,cir.thus,while the act grants employees the right to solicit on behalf of a unionization campaign,the statute also recognizes the employer interest in maintaining productivity and discipline.see nlrb babcock wilcox.an employer,for example,is entitled to limit or ban solicitation in the workplace during work time.see nlrb clinton electronics,cir citing republic aviation nlrb.
an employer may not,however,prohibit all solicitation in a company parking lot.loparex contends that this is not what it was doing instead,it argues,it only banned the practice of placing flyers on car windshields.the board saw matters differently it agreed with the alj finding that the loparex officials were telling the employees that they could not distribute any union materials in the parking lot even if they were.because the record provides some support for both positions,this was a classic call for the board.nlrb aluminum casting engineering,cir beverly california nlrb,cir.
we add that even if loparex had proscribed only distribution on car windshields,the board still could have found that its policy violated section a.nlrb village ix,cir.in village ix,we concluded that an employer engaged in an unfair labor practice when it barred several employees from placing leaflets under the windshield wipers of cars parked in the company lot.id.we explained that the distribution of leaflets could not have disrupted the company work and would not have interfered with the owners property right except in the most technical of senses.id.at.loparex alleged concern that distribution on cars would lead to wholesale littering lacks merit.this concern was never mentioned by company officials and there is no evidence indicating that litter would have been a problem.
distribution of union buttons in the lunch room 
in june,meeker left a pile of prounion buttons lying on a table next to a time clock.on june,todd dennison and lisa koats,both members of loparex management team,held a meeting with meeker,schillinger,and another employee about their distribution of the buttons.dennison warned,i do want to catch you passing buttons out,okay,i do want to see them laying around you can pass them out when you outside,on your own time,but when you here working,you,you,need to be working.the alj concluded,and the board agreed,that the prohibition was overbroad because employees could have believed they were barred from soliciting near the time clock,a area,during hours.
loparex comes close to conceding that such an expansive rule against solicitation on company property would violate section a.our review satisfies us that the board position finds support in the evidence.see aluminum casting,at.loparex defends itself in this instance by trying to characterize dennison statement as an order.company officials,it says,are permitted to forbid employees from leaving unattended piles of buttons on company property.once again,the question is whether an otherwise reasonable policy operates in practice in a way that discriminates against union organizers.see fleming companies,nlrb,cir.loparex contends that its prohibition was nondiscriminatorily applied,and it asserts that company officials were acting within their rights in banning the use of company property to distribute union buttons.
loparex argument on this point is terse and largely unsupported by pertinent authority,and so we were concerned that it might be forfeited.see white eagle.ass conner,cir.loparex does,however,refer us to a case that directly addresses the issue.see guard publishing,nlrb,enf in part.the board argues that loparex can not invoke guard publishing because it failed to raise the case before the board properly.see production workers union of chicago nlrb,cir explaining that appellate court can not review an argument first raised on appeal unless extraordinary circumstances are present.loparex did,however,present its argument in its opening brief before the board.this is enough to preserve the point in these enforcement proceedings and to allow loparex to rely on this theory even though the particular case was first mentioned in its reply brief.
nevertheless,this is of no help to loparex.the board affirmed the alj finding that the rule was overly broad,because dennison and koats did not state that they were disallowing distribution only in work areas of the facility.by purporting to restrict distribution in areas,during break times,they stepped over the line.in so finding,the board was following policy to the effect that a rule is presumptively invalid if it prohibit
