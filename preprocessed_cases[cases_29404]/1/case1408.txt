this is a petition for review from a decision of the benefits review board the brb affirming the administrative law judge the alj award of benefits and attorney fees under the black lung benefits act the act,et.petitioner westmoreland coal company westmoreland argues that the alj decision awarding benefits was contrary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence.westmoreland also argues that the alj award of attorney fees was improperly calculated.we find the award of benefits legally proper and supported by substantial evidence,and we therefore affirm that award.however,we find that the alj erred in granting an award of attorney fees without first determining a prevailing hourly rate for the attorney work.that award must therefore be reconsidered in light of this opinion.
respondent lloyd cox worked for westmoreland as a coal miner for approximately thirty years.on april,cox filed an application for benefits under the act,which grants benefits to former miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis,also known as black lung disease.see a.his claim was denied on november.cox brought a second claim on december.the district director of the office of workers compensation programs issued a pro posed decision and order denying benefits on august.upon cox request for a hearing,the case was transferred to the office of administrative law judges for a for mal hearing to determine whether he was eligible for benefits.
in order to prove eligibility under the act,cox had to show that he was totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis caused by his employment.see.because more than one year had passed since the denial of cox first claim,he also had to establish that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement ha d changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.d.
the act provides a statutory presumption of total disability resulting from pneumoconiosis where the coal miner suffers from 
a chronic dust disease of the lung which a when diagnosed by chest,yields one or more large opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter,b when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy,yields massive lesions in the lung,or c when diagnosis is made by other means,would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results described in clause a or b if diagnosis had been made in the manner prescribed in clause a or b.
c.the alj based her analysis largely on this statutory presumption under c.we summarize the evidence relevant to cox claim below 
cox began seeking medical help for lung problems in.on january,cox underwent a computerized tomography ct scan of his lungs.upon reviewing the image,lepsch observed an opacity in the upper part of cox right lung and recommended that chest be per formed in the future to determine whether the opacity cleared.on march,cox had a consultation with tholpady,who concluded that cox had coal worker pneumoconiosis.larry forster saw cox on october,examined cox most recent,and found that there were opacities that were likely caused by coal worker pneumoconiosis.
in cox underwent a number of tests that revealed a pulmonary mass which several doctors interpreted as either pneumoconiosis or cancer.in april and may of michael baron reviewed cox and performed a bronchoscopy.according to baron,both tests indicated signs that could represent pneumoconiosis or cancer.he recommended that cox undergo additional testing to rule out cancer.on october,cox had a chest scan,which was interpreted by thomas haines.haines noted a large mass,measuring by centimeters,in the upper lobe of cox right lung.on october,cox saw william messerschmidt for a consultation on this pulmonary mass.messerschmidt determined that the approximately mass was probably due to coal worker pneumoconiosis,but could also be due to cancer messerschmidt had cox tested for cancer through a needle biopsy and bronchoscopy.both tests were negative for cancer.following the cancer tests,on december,john hutchison conducted another ct scan which confirmed that cox had a large mass,measuring approximately by centimeters,in the upper lobe of his right lung.
in cox again underwent several tests that showed signs of pneumoconiosis.on january,he saw randolph forehand,who interpreted cox as showing pneumoconiosis.on august,cox had an,which was interpreted by donald rasmussen.rasmussen saw large opacities attributable to pneumoconiosis,but noted that cancer was also a possibility.
in the possibility of cancer was raised once again.on january,cox saw roger mcsharry.mcsharry reviewed cox most recent ct scan and saw a dominant right lung lesion and multiple left lung lesions.that same day,mcsharry conducted a bronchoscopy.he found that the masses were likely due to pneumoconiosis,but decided to undertake testing to rule out cancer jack bechtel then conducted an examination of the cells of the tissue of cox right upper lung.bechtel concluded that the tissue showed no signs of cancer.he also noted that the examination results were consistent with pneumoconiosis.
in cox again had several tests showing signs of pneumoconiosis.on january,cox had a chest,which forehand interpreted as showing pneumoconiosis.on february,cox underwent a ct scan reviewed by jandre ward,who determined that the scan showed typical signs of pneumoconiosis.on march,cox had an which was interpreted by ward.ward saw a mass in the center of cox right lung measuring approximately three centimeters.he found that the mass was compatible with a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.
beginning in may,several doctors retained by westmoreland evaluated cox and his medical records.on may,richard naeye examined the results of cox biopsies performed in.he concluded that there was not enough tissue in the biopsy specimens to make a specific diagnosis of coal worker pneumoconiosis.
cox saw kirk hippensteel at the request of westmoreland on june.hippensteel noted an opacity larger than four centimeters.he opined,however,that the opacity was likely not due to pneumoconiosis because it was partly calcified in a manner inconsistent with pneumoconiosis.he also noted that the waxing and waning of the opacity was consistent with granulomatous inflammation.hippensteel concluded that the opacity could be due either to histoplasmosis or to granulomatous disease.
on july,john scatarige and william scott reviewed cox at westmoreland request and interpreted them as not showing pneumoconiosis.scott also interpreted several ct scans from november and february.he found that the masses shown were likely not due to pneumoconiosis because they did not have a background of small rounded opacities.scott opined that they were more likely due to tuberculosis or histoplasmosis 
on july,cox underwent another ct scan,which was reviewed by his doctor,srikumar gopalan.gopalan noted a large density measuring by centimeters in the right upper lobe.kathleen deponte also reviewed that ct scan and noted an opacity of at least five centimeters in diameter in the right lung and several smaller opacities in the left.she concluded that the test showed classic findings of pneumoconiosis.scott reviewed these results and determined that the masses were likely caused by tuberculosis or histoplasmosis.
on august,jerome wiot examined cox at the request of westmoreland and interpreted them as not showing pneumoconiosis.wiot opined that the opacities could be due to sarcoidosis.
on february,david rosenberg,westmoreland expert,issued a report evaluating cox medical records.he found that cox did not exhibit some of the common symptoms of pneumoconiosis and concluded that he did not have pneumoconiosis.rosenberg testified via deposition on may,and stated that,of all the conflicting interpretations,he found wiot to be most reliable because of his vast experience in the area.he also testified that the calcified mass seen in the tests was consistent not with pneumoconiosis but rather with a inflammatory reaction.however,rosenberg noted that no tests had been done for sarcoidosis,the possible disease identified by wiot,or for histoplasmosis,the possible disease identified by scott and hippensteel.he acknowledged that further testing would be necessary to establish those diagnoses.
on july,westmoreland expert,paul wheeler,evaluated one of cox from and found it to be negative for pneumoconiosis.
in cox second claim,all of the medical evidence was presented to the alj for evaluation.on january,the alj issued an order finding in favor of cox.she concluded that cox had established that he is entitled to the presumption of total disability due to complicated pneumoconiosis.she further concluded that,while the evidence before the alj who denied cox claim was not sufficient to establish statutory complicated pneumoconiosis,the newly submitted medical evidence showed a change in circumstances because it conclusively established that cox suffered from the condition.she therefore held that cox was entitled to benefits under the act.on april,the alj issued an order granting an award of in fees to be paid by westmoreland for cox attorney,joseph wolfe,and his staff.
westmoreland appealed both orders to the brb.on january,the brb issued a decision and order affirming the award of benefits and the award of fees.this petition for review followed.
westmoreland makes five assertions of error with regard to the alj decision.first,westmoreland argues that the alj misapplied the relevant legal standard by shifting the burden to westmoreland to show that cox did not suffer from statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.second,westmoreland asserts that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence because she based her finding on one biopsy result from,which did not show statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.third,westmoreland argues that the alj erred in excluding the opinions of westmoreland experts who found that the opacities were due to diseases other than pneumoconiosis.fourth,westmoreland contends that the alj erred in failing to consider evidence predating cox claim.finally,westmoreland argues that the alj erred in her calculation of the reasonable hourly rate for cox attorney.we address each contention below.
on appeal,we must affirm the decision of the alj if it is in accordance with law and is supported by substantial evidence.piney mountain coal mays,cir.we review the alj and the board conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are rational and consistent with applicable law.milburn colliery hicks,cir.in determining whether the evidence supporting the decision is substantial,we evaluate whether it is of sufficient quality and quantity as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the finding under review.piney,at internal quotations omitted.an alj award of attorney fees is discretionary,and will be upheld on appeal unless arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or contrary to law.kerns consolidation coal,cir.
we turn first to westmoreland assertion that the alj applied the wrong legal standard by shifting the burden to westmoreland to disprove the existence of statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.the act mandates payments of benefits in respect of total disability of any miner due to pneumoconiosis.a.to be eligible for those benefits,a claimant must establish the existence of pneumoconiosis,that the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment,and that the pneumoconiosis is totally disabling see.prongs and can both be satisfied by the application of a statutory presumption under c.as mentioned above,that section applies an irrebuttable presumption that the claimant is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if he is suffering 
from a chronic dust disease of the lung which a when diagnosed by chest,yields one or more large opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter,b when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy,yields massive lesions in the lung,or c when diagnosis is made by other means,would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results described in clause a or b if diagnosis had been made in the manner prescribed in clause a or b.
c.the condition described by c is known as statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.double b mining,blankenship,cir.
this court has previously made clear that,throughout the claim adjudication process,t he claimant retains the burden of proving the existence of statutory complicated pneumoconiosis.lester,owcp,cir.we have also set out a detailed legal framework for establishing the irrebuttable presumption of c.in,eastern associated coal director,owcp,scarbro,cir,we explained 
prongs a,b,and c are stated in the disjunctive therefore a finding of statutory complicated pneumoconiosis may be based on evidence presented under a single prong.but the alj must in every case review the evidence under each prong of c for which relevant evidence is presented to determine whether complicated pneumoconiosis is present thus,even where some evidence indicates opacities that would satisfy the requirements of prong a,if other evidence is avail able or if evidence is available that is relevant to an analysis under prong b or prong c,then all of the evidence must be considered and evaluated to deter mine whether the evidence as a whole indicates a condition of such severity that it would produce opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter on an.

westmoreland asserts that the alj erred in her application of the law because,instead of placing the burden on cox to prove the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis,she placed the burden on westmoreland to prove that the opacities seen in the evidence were not due to pneumoconiosis.in support of its position,westmoreland cites the following pas sage from the alj opinion 
in addition to establishing the existence of a one centimeter or greater opacity,c requires that the etiology of these opacities be related.under scarbro,once the claimant establishes this etiology,the employer must provide evidence that affirmatively shows the opacities are not there or that they are from a disease process other than complicated pneumoconiosis.
footnote call numbers added.according to westmoreland,this language shows that the alj interpreted scarbro as holding that,once the claimant presented evidence of a large opacity the burden shifts to the employer to rule out the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis.petitioner br.at.we are not persuaded by westmoreland interpretation of the alj language.
the passage of the alj opinion quoted above is consistent with our statement in scarbro that 
i f the evidence vividly displays opacities exceeding one centimeter,its probative force is not reduced because the evidence under some other prong is inconclusive or less vivid.instead,the evidence can lose force only if other evidence affirmatively shows that the opacities are not there or are not what they seem to be,perhaps because of an intervening pathology,some technical problem,or incompetence of the reader.
scarbro,at emphasis added.in following this language in scarbro,the alj did not,as westmoreland suggests,require westmoreland to prove that the opacities were due to something other than pneumoconiosis she simply stated that the clear evidence of large opacities would support the presumption unless the record contained affirmative evidence showing either that the opacities did not exist or that they were due to something else,such as a disease other than pneumoconiosis.she highlighted throughout her opinion that t he claimant has the burden of proving the existence of pneumoconiosis,as well as every element of entitlement,by a preponderance of the evidence.she further noted that,in addition to showing that the opacities existed,cox must also establish that they are due to pneumoconiosis.
the alj opinion makes clear that she found the presumption established not because she had placed any unmet burden on westmoreland,but rather because the evidence in the record did not amount to affirmative evidence sufficient to cause cox evidence satisfying c to lose force.this approach is consistent with scarbro and therefore legally proper.
next we consider westmoreland argument that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence.westmoreland reasons that the alj found the biopsy was sufficient to diagnos e complicated pneumoconiosis,but the biopsy alone did not establish statutory complicated pneumoconiosis because it did not show opacities measuring more than one centimeter.petitioner br.at.
westmoreland misinterprets the alj analysis.while the alj did state that the biopsy established that cox suffered from pneumoconiosis under a she did not state that it was sufficient to establish statutory complicated pneumoconiosis pursuant to c.the alj made it clear in her opinion that she was basing her award of benefits not on a,but rather on the statutory presumption of total disability due to complicated pneumoconiosis of c.therefore,contrary to westmoreland assertion,her finding that the biopsy was sufficient to satisfy a does not imply that she found the biopsy alone to be sufficient to establish the presumption of statutory complicated pneumoconiosis under c.
in fact,the alj finding of statutory complicated pneumoconiosis was based on all of the available medical evidence,not just the biopsy.in her evaluation of the evidence under c,the alj found that there was no dispute that cox has large masses in his lungs,and that these masses show as opacities of at least one centimeter on his.indeed,there was no dispute that the showed at least one mass measuring more than three centimeters in the upper part of cox right lung.this finding was also supported by several ct scans and other medical tests.westmoreland experts did not dispute the existence of a large mass.instead,they asserted that the mass was likely due to one of a number of other possible diseases.the alj rejected their conclusions as equivocal and speculative,and found that they did not constitute affirmative evidence sufficient to show that the opacities were not due to pneumoconiosis.as we explain in section below,that finding was proper.the alj also reasoned that because the biopsy showed signs of pneumoconiosis or cancer,and cancer had since been ruled out,the record strongly indicated that pneumoconiosis was what caused the opacities found in cox tests.finally,the alj noted that none of westmoreland experts had reviewed the biopsy or questioned its results.
following her detailed evaluation of the evidence,the alj stated 
upon reviewing all of the evidence together,i find that cox has established that he is entitled to the presumption of total disability due to complicated pneumoconiosis.i find that the preponderance of the persuasive evidence establish ed that cox has a condition that has resulted in the presence of a large opacity on,due to his more than thirty years of occupational exposure to coal dust.
thus,contrary to westmoreland assertion,it is clear from the alj opinion that her conclusion was based not on the biopsy,but rather on an evaluation of all of the evidence before her.this approach was legally proper under scarbro.see scarbro,at explaining that,in the alj analysis of whether the claimant established the c presumption,all of the evidence must be considered and evaluated to determine whether the evidence as a whole indicates a condition of such severity that it would produce opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter on an.
upon reviewing all the relevant evidence,the alj found that the consistent evidence of large opacities,when considered in light of the other evidence of pneumoconiosis including ct scans,medical interpretations,and the biopsy,was sufficient to establish statutory complicated pneumoconiosis under c.we find that the evidence in the record is certainly of sufficient quality and quantity as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support that finding.piney,at internal quotations omitted.the finding is therefore supported by substantial evidence.
next we consider westmoreland argument that the alj incorrectly disregarded the opinions of westmoreland experts.westmoreland asserts that the alj erred in finding that westmoreland did not present affirmative evidence showing that the opacities shown in the were due to a disease other than pneumoconiosis.specifically,it argues that she erred in rejecting the opinions of westmoreland experts finding that the opacities were likely due to tuberculosis,histoplasmosis,granulomatous disease,or sarcoidosis.we disagree.
the alj discussed the opinions of each of westmoreland experts who said the opacities might be due to something other than pneumoconiosis.scott believed that the masses were likely due to tuberculosis or histoplasmosis because they had no background of small rounded opacities.hippensteel thought they were likely due to histoplasmosis or to a granulomatous disease because they showed calcification and changes in size.wiot opined that the opacities could be due to sarcoidosis.none of the doctors discussed whether any of the diseases could occur in conjunction with pneumoconiosis.in addition,none of them pointed to evidence that cox was suffering from any of the alternative diseases mentioned or discussed whether the tests showed any signs inconsistent with those diseases.finally,none of the doctors reviewed or opined upon the results of the biopsy.
the alj made the following findings about westmoreland experts opinions 
i give little weight to the opinions of hippensteel,rosenberg,and wiot,whose views are based on a limited and selective review of the new medical evidence,and who,in the case of hippensteel and rosenberg,have not adequately explained how their conclusions are supported by the objective medical evidence 
i find the interpretations of wheeler,scott,and wiot,as well as the opinions by rosenberg,to be speculative regarding the etiology of the large masses t he employer physicians merely speculated that the large masses were attributable to another disease process,without substantiation or corroboration,and without consideration of critical medical evidence bearing on this issue they speculate without basis that the objective evidence must be due to something other than pneumoconiosis.
these interpretations are equivocal,in that they do not make a diagnosis or an objective determination,but instead speculate on the various possible etiologies for the abnormalities or masses that they acknowledge are there.
the alj therefore found that,because they were speculative and equivocal,these opinions did not constitute affirmative evidence sufficient to show that the opacities seen in the medical exams were due to something other than pneumoconiosis.
we previously affirmed the brb approval of a very similar approach by the same alj who authored the opinion at issue in this case.in barker westmoreland coal,owcp,brb bla may,as here,the alj similarly rejected the opinions of several of the same experts that presented evidence in this case,including wheeler,scott,scatarige,and hippensteel.as in this case,the doctors opined in barker that the opacities present in the claimant medical evidence were due to diseases other than pneumoconiosis.scott,scatarige,and wheeler all thought the opacities were due to tuberculosis.in a very similar diagnosis to the one he gave in this case,hippensteel suspected that the opacities were due to granulomatous disease because they showed signs of calcification and of size changes.
in barker,the alj rejected the evidence as speculative because there was no evidence in the record showing that the claimant had any of the alternative diseases.she therefore found that the experts opinions did not constitute affirmative evidence sufficient to weaken the claimant evidence showing large opacities that satisfied the statutory definition of complicated pneumoconiosis.
the brb approved the alj reasoning,stating 
t he administrative law judge found the opinions of wheeler,scott,scatarige,and hippensteel to be equivocal as to the cause of the opacities seen on claimant because they attributed the cause of the opacities to tuberculosis or granulomatous disease when there was no evidence in the record that claimant had ever suffered from or been exposed to tuberculosis,or other inflammatory process,or other disease process.employer does not dispute that statement.the administrative law judge,therefore,properly rejected the evidence pointing to causes,other than coal mine employment,for the abnormalities seen on claimant accordingly,we affirm the administrativ
