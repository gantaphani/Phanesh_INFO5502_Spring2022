xue zhen chen petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner xue zhen chen is a native and citizen of china,where she was born and lived in the fujian province.in august,chen left china illegally and entered the united states with the paid assistance of smugglers,known as snakeheads.upon arriving at the los angeles international airport from vietnam,chen presented a united states passport issued to jenny susan chong.immigration officials determined chen true identity and she was subsequently charged as being subject to removal on grounds that she falsely represented that she was a united states citizen and she did not have any documentation authorizing her presence in the united states.
chen conceded removability in removal proceedings,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and for protection under the united nations convention against torture convention against torture on april.chen asserted in her application that she could not return to china because she feared physical harm from snakeheads and money lenders as retribution for the debt she owed them local officials were corrupt and profited from illegal smuggling operations and therefore would not protect her from snakeheads and money lenders her mother was forcibly sterilized and chen disagreed with china coercive family planning policy and she would be jailed because she left china illegally,and once jailed,would be subject to mental and physical torture.
in the intervening period between chen application for relief and her removal hearing,chen lived in mount pleasant,texas,and worked at her uncle restaurant.while working at the restaurant,chen became acquainted with members of a nearby nazarene church who offered to help her improve her english.chen began taking english lessons at the church,became interested in christianity,and then took bible classes and was baptized at the church.at her removal hearing before the immigration judge ij on march,chen stated,as part of her argument for relief,that she had converted to christianity since her arrival in the united states and that she feared persecution on the basis of religion if she returned to china.
the ij issued an oral decision and accepted chen testimony as basically plausible and credible.the ij,however,denied chen application on all three bases for relief.the ij concluded that if chen were to be jailed as a result of her illegal departure from china,the evidence did not support a reasonable fear of harm constituting persecution or a likelihood of torture.the ij likewise concluded that it was unlikely that snakeheads or money lenders would cause any harm to chen,and that based on the evidence of the chinese government substantial effort to detect,arrest,and prosecute corrupt public officials,it was unlikely that the government of china would acquiesce in any harm from snakeheads or money lenders.the ij further concluded that the substantial period between chen mother forced sterilization,the lack of evidence about chen interest in motherhood,and the government declining efforts to enforce the policy barred relief on the basis of china family policy.finally,the ij concluded that the evidence did not show that it was likely that chen would suffer harm amounting to persecution on the basis of her conversion to christianity.
the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision without an opinion and chen timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
when the bia affirms the ij decision without an opinion,as is the case here,the ij decision is the final agency decision for purposes of judicial review on appeal.soadjede ashcroft,cir.the agency administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary b b.this standard of review essentially codifies the substantial evidence test established by the supreme court in ins,d.we apply this standard in reviewing an ij factual conclusion that an applicant is not eligible for asylum,zhao gonzales,cir,withholding of removal,ins,cir,and relief under the convention against torture,ashcroft,cir.
under the substantial evidence standard,reversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion,but also that the evidence compels it.zhao,at quoting chun ins,cir.the applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.id.
iii.discussion 
chen contends that the ij erred by denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.we review her claims of error according to each basis for relief.
the attorney general has the authority to grant asylum to any applicant who qualifies as a refugee under a a.b.the statute defines a refugee as 
any person who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
a a.being classified as a refugee on the basis of past persecution or a fear of persecution,however,does not automatically entitle a refugee to asylum.mikhael ins,cir.the attorney general statutory power to grant asylum is discretionary.id.noting that the provision language is precatory,giving the attorney general discretion to grant asylum.
because chen converted to christianity after her arrival in the united states,her asylum application rests on a fear of persecution based on religion rather than past persecution.to establish a fear of future persecution,an applicant must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution,and that fear must be objectively reasonable.eduard ashcroft,cir quoting ashcroft,cir.because the ij credited chen testimony,her subjective fear of persecution is not at issue and our review focuses on the objective reasonableness of her fear.the objective prong requires the applicant to establish that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if deported.id.quoting faddoul ins,cir.although the immigration and nationality act does not define persecution,we have relied on a description of persecution as 
the infliction or suffering of harm,under government sanction,upon persons who differ in a way regarded as offensive,race,religion,political opinion,in a manner condemned by civilized governments.the harm or suffering need not be physical,but may take other forms,such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage,or the deprivation of liberty,food,housing,employment,or other essentials of life.
ins,cir quoting matter of laipenieks,bia.the fear standard does not require an applicant to demonstrate that he will be persecuted if returned to his native country,but rather,requires that he establish persecution as a reasonable possibility.ins,d see also eduard,at relying on for the proposition that the applicant must establish,to a reasonable degree,that return to his native country would be intolerable.
to establish the objective reasonableness of a fear of persecution,an applicant must prove that 
he possesses a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of punishment of some sort the persecutor is already aware,or could become aware,that the alien possesses this belief or characteristic the persecutor has the capability of punishing the alien and,the persecutor has the inclination to punish the alien.

chen asserts that the ij erred by holding that she did not have a fear of persecution based on her religion.she argues that the ij conclusion that her fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable was based on two erroneous assumptions that chen nazarene faith was not at a level of sophistication such that she would be subjected to persecution and that only a small percentage of christians are persecuted in china.
chen first argues that the ij erred in relying on her level of religious sophistication to determine whether she would be subjected to persecution because an applicant level of sophistication can not be used as a proxy for depth of religious faith.chen points to the second circuit recent decision in rizal gonzales,cir,for support.in rizal,the second circuit granted an applicant petition for review because the ij erroneously viewed the applicant lack of detailed doctrinal knowledge about christianity as automatically rendering incredible his claim of religious persecution,without assessing the genuineness of his asserted christian id.at.rizal,however,does not resolve the dispositive question presented here.whereas in rizal,the ij posed doctrinal questions to determine that the applicant testimony regarding his religious belief was not credible,in chen case,the ij accepted chen testimony of religious conversion as credible based on her demeanor and documents demonstrating that she had completed bible classes and had been baptized.although the ij did refer to chen level of sophistication,it was in relation to whether chen understanding of doctrinal distinctions was at a stage such that,if returned to china,she would have to attend a nazarene church in particular,which would necessarily be an unregistered or underground church,or if she could attend the protestant church chen counters that she would not attend a church and would be relegated by both choice and geographical logistics in the fujian province to attend an unregistered or underground church.
chen argument for asylum then actually rests on the persecution to which adherents in unregistered or underground churches are subjected.accordingly,although we do not agree with chen that the ij improperly considered level of sophistication in her case,the success of her claim rests not on her first claim of sophistication of her on her second claim,which is that the judge erred in concluding that protestants worshiping in either registered or unregistered churches in china are not subject to persecution to the extent necessary to give rise to a fear of persecution.
we consider it unnecessary to resolve the debate about which church chen would attend because the evidence does not compel a finding of persecution in either case.the ij found that based on the evidence in 
the country materials and the religious freedom report that there are many christians in china and many of them are members of registered churches who do have any particular problems.and to the extent that those who are members of these unregistered churches,again,it would seem to the court that it really a relatively small number or percentage of people who suffer any harm on that account.
consequently,the ij found chen fear of persecution to be highly speculative.
chen points to the china country report on human rights country reports as compelling the opposite conclusion.our review of the entire record,including the china international religious freedom report religious freedom report and the country report,however,does not compel the conclusion that chen faces persecution to a reasonable degree.although the religious freedom report is troubling in indicating that the chinese government respect for freedom of religion remains poor and that unregistered religious groups continued to experience varying degrees of official interference and harassment,the report is not sufficiently detailed to support conduct amounting to a pattern of persecution directed at protestants.eduard,at.the religious freedom report is generally vague and its examples tend to focus on official repression of groups the same report also states that the number of religious adherents at official and underground places of worship continued to grow in china and that many religious adherents reported that they are able to practice their faith in officially registered places of worship without interference.as for underground adherents,the report indicates that although there is governmental pressure for unregistered churches to register,and notwithstanding the fact that police closed some catholic churches and protestant house churches,at the same time prayer meetings and bible study groups held in house churches are legal and generally are not subject to registration requirements so long as they remain small and unobtrusive.moreover,the religious freedom report indicates that f oreign and chinese sources estimate that some million persons worship in protestant house churches that are independent of government control.although we agree with chen that the religious freedom report indicates that in some cases religious adherents have been persecuted,because the specific examples of detention or arrest in that amount to persecution appear to be predominantly focused on the falun gong,underground seminaries,and religious leaders,and because the overall number appears small compared to the enormous number of unregistered protestant adherents,we conclude that the religious freedom report does not compel a finding of persecution to a reasonable degree 
the specific passages in the country report to which chen points do not require us to conclude otherwise.chen argues that the country report generally indicates that the authoritarian chinese government seeks to control every aspect of people lives in china,including religious thought and worship through state regulation.however,regulation does not necessarily amount to persecution.chen further points to a passage indicating that legal protections in camps are routinely violated,but neither report indicates a reasonable possibility that chen will be subjected to detention for her protestant beliefs.although the country report indicates that there are religious adherents who have experienced conduct amounting to persecution,like the religious freedom report,the country report is vague with respect to how many and which religious adherents in particular experience any level of government intimidation or suppression,and for those who do,at what degree and frequency such intimidation or suppression occurs such as to constitute persecution.accordingly,we conclude that the ij denial of chen application for asylum is supported by substantial evidence.
withholding of removal 
to be eligible for withholding of removal,an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see,zhang gonzales,at faddoul,at see also efe ashcroft,cir writing that an applicant for withholding of removal must show it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution quoting b.although the standard for withholding of removal is in one regard less stringent than that required to establish eligibility for asylum,where an applicant must also show a subjective fear of persecution,the requirement of clear probability of persecution requires the applicant to show a higher objective likelihood of persecution than that required for asylum.efe,at faddoul,at.because the evidence does not compel us to conclude that chen fear of persecution on the basis of religion is under the lower objective standard for asylum,we necessarily conclude that she is not eligible for withholding of removal under the higher objective standard.see,efe,at faddoul,at.
relief under the convention against torture 
the convention against torture provides that 
no state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
for the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds,the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including,where applicable,the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights 
claims based on the convention against torture differ from those based on eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal because the claim need not be based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.zhang,at citing efe,
