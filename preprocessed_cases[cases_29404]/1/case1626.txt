appellants kinder canal company,kinder canal and mike unkel unkel challenge the district court determination that they must refund payments received between and under various programs administered by the department of agriculture farm service agency fsa.finding that appellants serially misrepresented data they reported to the fsa on contracts for benefits,the district court upheld the fsa demand to return all payments received by kinder canal and by unkel in his individual capacity.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the fsa program payments at issue in this case involve farm serial number fsn,a parcel of agricultural land used for cultivation of wheat,oats,and rice in allen parish,louisiana.fsn encompassed total cropland acres and acres of combined wheat,oat,and rice base.fsn was divided into seven numbered tracts,and.the parcel was jointly owned by seven entities,including kinder canal,a louisiana corporation consisting of nineteen members of the unkel family.appellant unkel is kinder canal president and a shareholder.additionally,he holds a percent stake in the unkel four joint venture,a separate farming entity by unkel and three of his siblings.having served as the chairman of the fsa allen parish committee for approximately eighteen years,unkel is a sophisticated participant in the fsa various programs and is well versed in their technical requirements.
on july,acting in his capacity as kinder canal president,unkel signed a form production flexibility contract pfc,to enroll fsn in the fsa pfc program see et.beginning in,under the program farmers received a fixed annual payment in return for reducing their acreage of certain agricultural commodities.the fsa approved the kinder canal pfc proposal.kinder canal,through unkel,annually its cropland and received pfc payments from to.additionally,from to,the fsa made payments to kinder canal under the marketing loan assistance program mla program,eligibility for which was directly tied to kinder canal participation in the pfc program.
in december,several years before kinder canal enrolled in the pfc and mla programs,unkel aunt eva,the owner of tract the eva unkel tract,died.appellant unkel had held for his aunt since.in,the eva unkel tract was sold to two individuals unaffiliated with unkel or any of the family business entities.unkel admits that when he first applied for pfc payments in he was aware that the eva unkel tract had been sold and that his had terminated at his aunt death.nonetheless,on fsn first pfc proposal,unkel falsely recorded eva unkel as tract owner and did not notify the fsa of the actual owners.when he kinder canal for pfc annual payments from until,unkel continued to misrepresent to the fsa the company ownership of the eva unkel tract.
another source of inflated pfc payments arose from fsa for eligible acreage on certain tracts in fsn known as the tracts.unkel asserts that he did not notice the fsa mistake and accordingly requested pfc payments on the tracts rice base acreage that was technically no longer eligible during the program years.
in december,unkel enrolled fsn,a reconstituted group of tracts,in a third fsa direct and payments program dcp program see et.in making base acreage and yield elections as required by the dcp contract,unkel informed the fsa of one of the eva unkel tract new owners,but failed to mention the second owner.and,as he had previously reported on the pfc contracts from,unkel continued to incorrectly certify that the rice base acreage was eligible to receive dcp payments when in fact it was not.kinder canal first dcp contract was approved on december.fsn received dcp payments for the and program years.
unkel misrepresentations regarding the ownership and crop acreage bases of fsns and were discovered in by the department of agriculture office of inspector general oig during an audit of programs in allen parish.the audit was part of an effort by the fsa to determine farmers eligibility for program participation and whether the current administration of program payments was based on valid acreage and yield determinations.the oig found that representations made under unkel pfc,mla,and dcp contracts were inaccurate and that unkel had knowingly misrepresented the ownership and cropland acreage bases of fsn and its predecessor parcel,fsn.the oig additionally found that unkel admitted to publicly discussing the sale of the eva unkel tract and to knowing that kinder canal had not owned or leased the tract since,but that it nonetheless was enrolled for pfc and dcp program payments based on the eva unkel tract crop acreage base.
despite unkel misrepresentation of the eva unkel tract ownership and the fsa deletion of the tracts,however,kinder canal received no excessive benefit payments,except during.this is because the company eligibility for pfc,mla,and dcp annual payments consistently exceeded the payment limitations imposed by those programs in,the combined contract misrepresentations on the and eva unkel tracts garnered kinder canal a modest more than the benefits to which they were lawfully entitled.
nonetheless,the oig recommended in its audit report that the fsa louisiana state committee pursue collection of all pfc and mla payments kinder canal received between and,as well as the and dcp payments.additionally,the oig recommended collection of all pfc and mla payments unkel received between and that derived from his participation in the unkel four joint venture the state committee adopted the oig recommendations.subsequent review by an fsa national appeals division hearing officer and the fsa national appeals division nad director affirmed the oig conclusions regarding kinder canal and unkel liability.
appellants turned to federal court for a declaratory judgment that the fsa abused its discretion in making the refund demand.the secretary filed a for summary judgment.the district court arrived at substantially the same conclusion as the nad director regarding appellants liability and entered judgment for the return of the payments.fsa originally demanded well over a million dollars in restitution.after it offset benefits to which the unkel four joint venture was entitled,fsa informally reduced its demand to the modest sum of,plus interest.see kinder canal,johanns,wl,unpublished.this appeal followed.

do the regulatory penalty provisions authorize fsa demand for return of program benefits from kinder canal 
appellants first contend that because the misrepresentations concerning the and eva unkel tracts contained in the pfc and dcp contracts did not result in their receipt of program benefits to which they were not entitled,except during,the statutory penalty provisions do not authorize the fsa demand for repayment.on this score,the district court stated that 
a mistake was made by the fsa in when the acreage tracts,the tracts were deleted without removing the rice acreage basis sic,however,unkel knowingly made misrepresentations year after year after year regarding the true ownership the absence of a lease agreement regarding the eva unkel tract,consequently inflating the potential for program benefit payments.thus,even though kinder canal had received the maximum amount of payments allowed by law in every year except,this fact do
