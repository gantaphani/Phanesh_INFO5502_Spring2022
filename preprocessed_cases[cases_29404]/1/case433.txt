ij evaluation of evidence 
the ij denied hoxha request for asylum,withholding of removal,and withholding under the convention against torture,based on an adverse credibility determination in reaching this determination,the ij recognized that a credibility assessment is not reducible to a finite formula,and that all factors must be considered both individually and cumulatively.while mere trivial errors or errors incidental to a claim are insufficient for an adverse credibility finding,the ij reasoned,discrepancies and omissions that cumulatively go to the heart of the claim or otherwise show testimony ultimately dubious support such a finding.where these discrepancies and omissions exist,the ij noted,the three prong test of in re,i n,bia,must also be met,that is,
the discrepancies and omissions described by the immigration judge must actually be present in the record 
the discrepancies and omissions must provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien provided incredible testimony and 
a convincing explanation for the discrepancies or omissions must not have been supplied by the alien.
even where these credibility factors are present,the ij noted that there may be circumstances where an individual ability to recall dates and times would be in doubt,but should not undermine the individual credibility.these circumstances include where an individual has suffered traumatic occurrences distant in time and in a manner that can impair his ability to provide chronologically cogent and persuasive testimony,or where an individual who is not represented by counsel,either in the preparation of the application or in court,is unartful in the presentation of his case.
the ij determined that,in light of all of these factors,t he discrepancies and omissions in this case are significant,and cause this court to have so sic serious doubts about the respondent credibility that the court is without recourse,but to enter an adverse credibility finding.in making this determination,the ij noted numerous inconsistencies between hoxha two declarations,and between those declarations and his testimony.hoxha first declaration does not reference the march,fire that injured his son,and the second declaration states that the fire occurred on march,not march.neither declaration mentions that during the september,incident,police admitted to setting the fire.while hoxha testimony and second declaration both refer to his being beaten following the mayoral elections in october,hoxha first declaration states that the elections took place one year later in october.in addition,neither declaration mentions the october,incident in which police beat and detained hoxha and his wife.
the ij found very significant the fact that the respondent was unequivocal that he says that he sold his business on february,while both declarations indicate that the respondent business was sold by him in august of.the ij also noted the drastically different reasons that hoxha gave for selling his business hoxha testified that he sold his business shortly after his son was injured by heavy artillery and was sent to greece for treatment,while in both declarations,the respondent stated that the business was sold after they were constantly being threatened by the secret service.the ij also found very significant the discrepancy surrounding the date on which hoxha son returned from greece after receiving medical treatment.according to the ij,t he respondent was clear that his son returned from greece in early february perhaps february,while both declarations state that his son returned on march.lastly,the ij notes that unlike his second declaration and testimony,hoxha first declaration does not mention the december incident in which he was attacked by several civilians upon returning to tirana.
the ij stated that he was also troubled by the fact that hoxha attorney knew of only one of the two declarations submitted by hoxha and thus knew nothing of the inconsistencies between the two.by failing to address these inconsistencies in a supplemental or amended application prior to the hearing before the ij,hoxha attorney effectively ratified one or both declarations that existed in this record.in addition,while hoxha claimed that he went over his application with his attorney,neither hoxha nor his attorney seemed to know of the inconsistencies between the declarations and the testimony that hoxha planned to give at the hearing before the ij.as a result,the ij noted,hoxha made no attempt at the hearing to address the inconsistencies between his two declarations and between the declarations and his testimony.
based on this evidence,the ij determined that he could not enter a favorable credibility finding.d espite the existence of documentation in the record that on its face seems to verify much of what the respondent has claimed happened,the ij stated that the documents proffered by hoxha were not authenticated and their mere existence is insufficient to overcome the adverse credibility finding in addition,the ij noted that hoxha did not attempt to rehabilitate his credibility by providing corroborating evidence,such as documentation of his son medical treatment in greece or his own medical treatment in tirana.if credible,the ij noted,
there is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the respondent claim,given the now evolving conditions in albania.however,on this record,the court finds that the respondent has not met his burden of proof and persuasion,in that he has not presented an adequately credible claim in light of the content of his testimony and the discrepancies that exist both between his testimony and the declarations,as well as to each declaration itself.
