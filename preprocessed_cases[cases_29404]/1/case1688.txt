the sole question for us to decide in this appeal is whether participants in the federal housing act voucher program the voucher program may bring a private action under to challenge the calculation of their utility allowances by public housing authorities under o of the united states housing and implementing regulations in answering this question,we need not and therefore do not reach the merits of the participating tenants underlying challenge our inquiry is limited to whether have a private right of action concluding that they do,we reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
live in jefferson parish,louisiana,and participate in the voucher program under section.their residential rents and utility expenses are subsidized through vouchers provided by the department of housing and urban development hud,administered locally by housing authority of jefferson parish,a public housing authority created by state law.another,the louisiana housing development corporation,is a privately held corporation that contracts with the housing authority to operate the voucher program in jefferson parish.
this voucher program differs from traditional public housing programs by assisting families meeting the statute standard in renting housing in the private market.the voucher program thus gives participants the flexibility to choose among a variety of housing options.further,unlike earlier programs,which featured a statutory cap that limited a family permissible housing costs to percent of adjusted monthly income,the current voucher program contains no such cap.it gives participants even greater flexibility in the housing market as well as access to more expensive units that better meet their needs.under the current program,participating families must contribute at least percent of their adjusted monthly incomes to housing costs,and they need more.therefore,the choice of renting a costlier unit is entirely theirs.
in administering the voucher program,the public housing authority issues vouchers that are payable directly to a participant landlord under a housing assistance payment contract hap contract,the terms of which are governed by the statute and regulations generally,the amount of this payment is calculated as the amount by which the rent including the amount allowed for utilities exceeds percent of the monthly adjusted income of the family.the amount allowed for utilities is determined by the public housing authority,which is directed by regulation to base the utility allowance on the typical cost of utilities and services paid by households that occupy housing of similar size and type in the same locality us ing normal patterns of consumption for the community as a whole and current utility rates.the public housing authority is further required to review its schedule of utility allowances each year,and must revise its allowance for a utility category if there has been a change of percent or more in the utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised.
filed the instant lawsuit in the eastern district of louisiana in april of,alleging that collectively,the housing authority had not provided them appropriate utility allowances as required by the statute and regulations.specifically,they contend that the housing authority has failed to use current utility rates in calculating the utility allowance,and that it had not revised its utility allowance schedule from to despite annual increases in utility rates of percent or more in several years during that period the result,insist,is that their rent burdens have been higher than they would have been had the housing authority complied with the statute and the implementing regulations,which these participants seek to enforce through their lawsuit.
in october of,the district court,without oral argument or hearing,granted the housing authority motion to dismiss under rules b and the district court held that the portions of the voucher program statute and implementing regulations pertaining to the utility allowance do not create individual federal rights that may be enforced by private participants through a action.the district court also denied motion for leave to file a second amended complaint raising the same challenge.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint under rules b and de novo,taking the allegations of the dismissed complaint to be true 
iii.analysis 
private individuals may bring lawsuits against state actors under to enforce not only constitutional rights but also rights created by federal statutes it is essential to a private enforcement action under,however,that the federal statute in question unambiguously give rise to privately enforceable,substantive rights the inquiry in this context is virtually the same as that involved in private rights of action implied directly from a federal statute rather than by way of in either instance,congressional intent to create privately enforceable rights is the key 
the supreme court applies the test that it enunciated in blessing freestone to determine whether,in enacting a particular statutory provision,congress intended to create rights enforceable by private parties congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the private plaintiff the right assertedly protected by the statute must not be so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states,with the asserted right couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms 
the court approach to enforcement of federal statutes has been increasingly restrictive in the end,very few statutes are held to confer rights enforceable under.the narrowness of the doctrine is typified in gonzaga university doe,the court most recent pronouncement on this point,in which it made clear that it reject s the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under.in gonzaga,in which the three blessing factors were applied in evaluating a provision of the family educational rights and privacy act,the court unsurprisingly held that the statutory language on which the plaintiffs relied does not support an action under 
we recognize at the outset,therefore,that the result we reach in this case is a rarity,particularly after gonzaga.we are nevertheless convinced that its resolution is controlled by the supreme court decision in wright city of roanoke redevelopment housing authority in that case,the court interpreted a provision of the housing act that is virtually identical to the one at issue here,to support a challenge brought by public housing tenants concerning the calculation of their utility allowances.as wright predated blessing by a decade the court could not have applied the blessing test under that name,yet the court analysis in wright is wholly consistent with that employed in more recent cases,and indeed constitutes an indispensable element of the current methodology moreover,gonzaga expressly relied on wright,pointing to it as a paradigmatic example of an appropriate case for finding the presence of a private right of action under and leaving no doubt that wright survives as good law.
wright dictates the outcome in this case 
the plaintiffs in wright were tenants in housing projects owned by the city of roanoke redevelopment and housing authority.they sued the authority under,alleging that it them for their utilities and thereby violated the statutory rent ceiling that limited their rent to percent of their adjusted monthly income.the statutory language at issue,commonly referred to as the brooke amendment,stated that a family shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this chapter other than a family assisted under section o of this title per centum of the family monthly adjusted income the implementing hud regulation,in turn,specified that the statutory term rent included reasonable amounts of utilities determined in accordance with the public housing authority schedule of allowances for utilities supplied by the project.
the supreme court in wright concluded that it is clear that the regulations gave tenants an enforceable right to a reasonable utility allowance and that the regulations were fully authorized by the statute.the court found nothing in the housing act or the brooke amendment evidenc ing that congress intended to preclude petitioners claim it emphasized that t he brooke amendment could not be clearer it was a mandatory limitation focusing on the individual family and its income.the intent to benefit tenants is undeniable.the court expressly determined that the benefits congress intended to confer on tenants are sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as enforceable rights under pennhurst and,rights that are not beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.the court was also unconvinced that the remedial mechanisms provided in the housing act were sufficiently comprehensive and effective to raise a clear inference that congress intended to foreclose a cause of action for the enforcement of tenants rights secured by federal law.
in the instant case rely heavily on the wright precedent in arguing that they,too,have an enforceable right under the housing act to challenge the calculation of the utility allowance schedule.the housing authority responsive attempt to distinguish wright is unconvincing.although there are differences between the statutory provision involved in wright and the one at issue here,our careful review of both convinces us beyond cavil that,in adopting the voucher program,congress intended to create enforceable rights in participating tenants to the same extent as it did in enacting the statute implicated in wright.
the key distinction upon which the housing authority relies is the statutory cap limiting a participating family rent to percent of adjusted monthly income under the brooke amendment the provision at issue in wright,while under o the voucher program at issue here a family may choose to pay a greater percentage of its income for housing.this is a classic distinction without a difference.in no way does it compel the conclusion that o does not create a federal right that can be enforced through.
we discern no meaningful difference between the statutory entitlement of the plaintiffs in wright and that of here,regardless of the fact that the latter entitlement gives participants more choices.the effect of an insufficient utility allowance is the same in either case participants are forced to pay more out of pocket than percent of their incomes for housing further,even though the government housing assistance provided under the voucher program is located in a different section of the housing act,when we take the entirety of the legislative enactment into account we see that congress acted with precisely the same overarching intent in both sections,to assist families in obtaining a decent place to live logic prevents the conclusion that congress could have intended to create enforceable rights for one group of housing act rental assistance recipients but not the other.indeed,in the voucher program congress essentially validated wright holding the supreme court holding in wright that congress intended for the complaining tenants to have an enforceable right under the housing act and thus be able to challenge the calculation of the utility allowance schedule,applies with equal force to the instant case.
congressional intent to benefit plaintiffs 
congress intent to provide meaningful housing assistance benefits to individual families participating in the voucher program is just as undeniable as it was with respect to families covered under the brooke amendment.the statutory language could not be clearer in providing for the monthly assistance payment for a family receiving assistance.still,the housing authority argues in its appellate brief that congress did not so clearly intend to benefit voucher program participants because the statutory language addresses rights and duties that flow between the public housing authority and the landlord,while the participants are indirect beneficiaries.according to the housing authority,the statute focus is on fair compensation to the landlord.rather than being concerned with the needs of these individuals,the statute is concerned with requiring these individuals to pay what congress has determined to be their fair share of the rent.
this distortion of the statute flies in the face of its plain language.the fact that the assistance payments happen to be disbursed directly to the landlord rather than to the tenant is of no consequence.congress plainly expressed its intent to provide housing assistance for the benefit of the families participating in the it would be absurd to treat the voucher program as a landlords relief act 
if anything,the benefit to participants under o is even more direct than the benefit that the supreme court so construed in wright.the court observed that the brooke amendment was a mandatory limitation focusing on the individual family and its income.the language of that amendment that the court held to provide an undeniable benefit stated only that a family shall pay as rent per centum of the family monthly adjusted income the government assistance to cover any remaining housing costs was merely implied.in contrast,the benefit provided by the statutory language of the voucher program is undeniably direct.its object is the monthly assistance payment for a family,a tangible,benefit focused directly on the family.even though the voucher is made payable to the landlord,congress obvious intent was for such payment to benefit the participating tenant.
the housing authority also asserts that,unlike in wright,when resort to the hud regulation was not necessary to establish the right,in the present case must reach through the statute to find the right to a utility allowance schedule that is created by a regulation yet,once again,the statutory basis for private enforcement is even stronger here than it was in wright.in fact,the housing authority argument gets it exactly backwards the statutory language at issue in wright made no mention at all of the utility allowance.it provided only for rent,which was subsequently include reasonable amounts of utilities determined in accordance with the public housing authority schedule of allowances for utilities supplied by the project.
in contrast,the statutory language of the voucher program unmistakably the text of the act an amount to be allowed for tenant paid utilities.contrary to the housing authority assertion,the hud regulations are not necessary to establish right to the utility allowance,and certainly no more so than they were in wright,where such an allowance was not even mentioned in the text of the statute itself.congress intent to benefit here can not be gainsaid.
enforcement not beyond judicial competence 
the regulatory commands to public housing authorities to base the utility allowance on the typical cost of utilities and services paid by households that occupy housing of similar size and type in the same locality us ing normal patterns of consumption for the community as a whole and current utility rates,and to review the schedule of utility allowances each year,and revise the allowance for a utility category if there has been a change of percent or more in the utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised are not beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.as the supreme court observed in wright,t he regulations specifically set out guidelines that the public housing authorities were to follow in establishing utility allowances and the court concluded that this mandate was not so vague and amorphous as to exceed the ability of the judicial branch to enforce 
the housing authority argues further that the discretion it enjoys in calculating the utility allowance schedule renders the statute and regulations unenforceable in the courts.it characterizes as inherently imprecise the task to determine the amorphous typical cost of utilities and services paid by households that occupy housing of similar size and type in jefferson parish.although t
