opinion of the court 
this case requires us to address,for the first time,the circumstances under which a plaintiff employment discrimination claims should be dismissed for failure to properly verify a charge before the equal employment opportunity commission.we read title vii and its accompanying regulations to require a plaintiff to verify her charge before an employer receives notice of,or is required to respond to,the charge.however,we conclude that the verification requirement is not jurisdictional,and,where,as here,the employer responds to the merits of the charge without raising the plaintiff failure to verify her charge before the eeoc,it has waived its right to assert that defense in later federal court proceedings.we will accordingly reverse the district court order dismissing plaintiff claims.
plaintiff kathleen buck worked as a secretary to the superintendent of the hampton school district from until october,from until,the superintendent was kenneth scholtz,with whom buck enjoyed a good working relationship.during scholtz tenure,buck often received verbal and financial commendations for her job performance.
buck was diagnosed with,and began treatment for,major depression in.her psychiatrist sent a letter to the school district informing it that she needed to take a leave to seek treatment for her condition.thereafter,scholtz and lawrence korchnak,who became superintendent of the school district in,regularly granted buck leave from work to attend doctor appointments.thus,the school district and korchnak were aware of buck condition.
buck work environment changed when korchnak became superintendent.according to buck,korchnak scrutinized and criticized her job performance on a daily basis,to the point that she began to feel incompetent,stupid and worthless and inadequate and less of a human being.pl.compl.at.he told her on several occasions that members of the school board wanted to get rid of her.as a result,buck began to lose the ability to concentrate and complete tasks that she was assigned.her depression intensified,and she became concerned about her job security.she received her first unfavorable performance review under korchnak tenure and,in,was denied a pay raise because of performance concerns.
korchnak also engaged in behavior that buck deemed inappropriate.he routinely rubbed his genitals in her presence,despite her repeated pleas for him to stop.in the spring of,korchnak asked buck to kiss him after a dispute involving a parent of a student at the school.buck complied in fear of losing her job.
buck met with korchnak,members of the school board and the school district title ix officer on several occasions to voice her concerns about korchnak harassing behavior and its impact on her job performance.she requested accommodations,in the form of changes in korchnak behavior,to help her perform her job appropriately,but the school district took no action.in october of,korchnak told buck that she would be terminated if she did not resign.buck resigned on october,losing her benefits and suffering a penalty on her pension.
on april,buck filed general and ada intake questionnaires with the equal employment opportunity commission,alleging employment discrimination on account of her sex and disability.the eeoc pittsburgh area office scheduled an appointment for buck to come to the office and file a charge of discrimination with a supporting affidavit.rather than attend the meeting,buck filed a detailed,charge of discrimination,signed by her attorney,on july.on july,the eeoc sent korchnak and the school district a notice of charge of discrimination,with a copy of buck charge attached,and requested a response by july.the school board and korchnak filed a joint answer and position statement on september,responding to the individual counts in buck charge and providing a general response to the charge denying that they discriminated against buck and claiming that she voluntarily resigned.buck then filed a rebuttal.the eeoc chose not to pursue buck charge any further,and issued her a right to sue letter on march.
buck filed suit against korchnak and the school district in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.she alleged five counts harassment count i,disparate treatment count ii,failure to accommodate count iii and retaliation count iv,all under the federal americans with disabilities act,et,and a violation of the pennsylvania human relations act count v.korchnak and the school district moved to dismiss the suit under federal rule of civil procedure b based on buck failure to verify her charge with the eeoc and the pennsylvania human relations commission the district court granted the motion with respect to buck federal law claims,and dismissed the remaining state law claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.buck now appeals.

we review a district court decision granting a party motion to dismiss de novo.in reviewing a motion to dismiss,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.we may not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless we find that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief.pryor collegiate athletic ass n,cir.in evaluating a motion to dismiss,we may consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint,id.at,and any matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim,items subject to judicial notice,matters of public record,orders,and items appearing in the record of the case.charles wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed.
plaintiffs bringing employment discrimination charges under the ada must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,at.see a.that provision requires a complainant to file a charge with the eeoc,and states that such c harges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information and be in such form as the commission requires.b.pertinent eeoc regulations state that a charge shall be in writing and shall be verified,and define the term verified as sworn to or affirmed before a notary public,designated representative of the commission,or other person duly authorized by law to administer oaths and take acknowledgments,or supported by an unsworn declaration in writing under penalty of perjury,a.eeoc regulations further authorize plaintiffs to amend their charges to cure technical defects or omissions,including failure to verify the charge s,and provide that such amendments will relate back to the date the charge was first received.b.
applying these provisions,we have little difficulty concluding that buck charge was not verified as defined by the regulation we quote above.the record contains three documents which,if verified,might satisfy the statutory requirement the two intake questionnaires,see,wilkerson grinnell,cir holding that a verified intake questionnaire may constitute a charge for purposes of title vii kuper colonial penn ins,wl,at.may,holding that an eeoc questionnaire signed under penalty of perjury may satisfy title vii oath or affirmation requirement,and the formal charge itself each of these documents was signed by an attorney on buck behalf the two intake questionnaires were signed under the following statement i hereby verify that the statements contained in this complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge,information and belief.however,none of the documents was signed under penalty of perjury as the statute and its accompanying regulations require.accordingly,buck charge does not satisfy the statute literal verification requirement ricciardi consol.rail,wl,at,signed,but unverified intake questionnaire allegedly filed with the eeoc does not satisfy statutory charge requirement.
the question,then,is what consequences flow from buck failure to properly verify her charge.as the district court observed,cases const
