raul barradas,a mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the united states,was found removable from the united states on the grounds that he knowingly attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the country.he appealed the decision of the immigration judge ij to the board of immigration appeals,which affirmed.barradas now petitions this court for relief,arguing that the ij incorrectly concluded that the government met its heavy burden of proof,improperly admitted evidence without allowing him the opportunity to its preparer,and impermissibly denied him due process by compelling him to testify and then excessively interrogating him.for the reasons stated below,we deny the petition for review.
background 
raul barradas,a mexican citizen,became a lawful permanent resident of the united states on september.barradas made his home in monroe,wisconsin,but made frequent trips back to mexico.before one of barradas trips in,a family friend,alfredo meyer,gave him two united states birth certificates bearing the names nicole lynne leighty and jacob brian leighty and asked him to bring the children they named,allegedly meyer own,back to wisconsin from mexico.barradas traveled to mexico with his wife and his own two children to visit his brother.while there,he somehow acquired two mexican children,anyyensy meyer gonzalez,age seventeen,and eduardo doranetes ortiz,age eleven.the record is unclear at best regarding how anyyensy and eduardo came to travel with barradas barradas testimony indicates that unnamed people brought the children to him at some point during his visit.
when barradas tried to reenter the united states at the hidalgo,texas port of entry on october,with his wife,his two children,and anyyensy and eduardo in tow,he was stopped by customs and border patrol agents roel delafuente and mark latigo.barradas presented his resident alien card and the leighty birth certificates to the agents,who became suspicious and ordered secondary inspections interviews of everyone in barradas van.officer delafuente recorded the information gleaned from the secondary inspections on a form record of alien and authored an accompanying form customs and border patrol memorandum.
according to those reports,barradas told the agents that he knew anyyensy was born in mexico and that he had coached both children to memorize the information on the leighty birth certificates.he claimed he was transporting the children to their father in wisconsin and would receive per child for bringing them back.anyyensy and eduardo told the agents their real names and essentially reiterated the story barradas had told the agents that he gave them birth certificates and coached them to say that they were citizens named nicole lynne leighty and jacob brian leighty.
following the secondary inspections,anyyensy and eduardo were returned to mexico,barradas wife and children were permitted to return to the united states,and barradas was detained at la villa detention center and charged with violating a and.
on october,mere days after his apprehension in hidalgo and the same day on which his charging document was completed barradas pleaded guilty to alien smuggling.because no detention space was available at the port isabel service processing center,barradas was paroled into the united states on october.on october,officer delafuente supplemented the forms and with information about barradas conviction.
on october,officer delafuente initiated removal proceedings against barradas and issued him a notice to appear nta the nta alleged that barradas was not a citizen or national was a native and citizen of mexico applied for admission to the united states at hidalgo as a returning lawful permanent resident and was convicted of smuggling illegal aliens into the united states on october.on the basis of those allegations,barradas was charged as subject to removal from the united states pursuant to a e i,which denies admissibility to aliens who at any time knowingly ha ve encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law 
at his january,hearing before an ij,at which he was represented by counsel,barradas admitted the first three allegations of the nta but denied the conviction and consequently his removability.the department of homeland security dhs or the government offered the nta,documentation of barradas permanent resident status,and a copy of the october,criminal complaint into evidence without objection from barradas.barradas objected to the dhs other proffered pieces of evidence,officer delafuente form and accompanying form memorandum,on the grounds that he lacked an opportunity to officer delafuente,their creator.the ij admitted both pieces of evidence over barradas objections.the government did not offer into evidence any official court record of barradas conviction for alien smuggling.
the ij invited the dhs to question barradas about the fourth allegation in the nta alleging an october,conviction for alien smuggling.barradas objected to the questioning,claiming that the dhs could not meet its burden by questioning him in this hearing.the ij stated that barradas had no right to stand mute at this particular time,and informed barradas that he would draw an adverse inference from barradas silence or refusal to take the stand.barradas then took the stand and testified that on october,he applied for admission at the hidalgo port of entry,along with his wife,his two daughters,and two children identified by birth certificates as nicole lynne leighty and jacob brian leighty.he claimed that he believed that the children were u.citizens and that he had been asked by their father,alfredo meyer,to return them to wisconsin.when pressed by the dhs and the ij,he said he thought the children were eight,nine,or ten,and testified that he did not know why he had agreed to pick them up.he denied the form allegations that he coached the children to memorize the leighty birth certificate information,that he knew that they were not citizens,and that he was promised upon their safe return to wisconsin.
the ij interrupted the dhs questioning to clarify barradas testimony about how the children came to be with barradas and how he acquired the leighty birth certificates.the ij also asked barradas to explain what happened following the border inspections.during the ij questioning,barradas denied familiarity with the criminal complaint arising from the october,hidalgo apprehension,but stated that he pleaded guilty to a charge in federal court around that time because he had no choice but to do so.the ij confirmed that barradas knew he had been charged with alien smuggling and that he had pleaded guilty to that charge.after the government and the ij questioned barradas,barradas attorney did not examine him further.
the ij immediately issued an oral decision in which he rejected barradas testimony that he did not know the children were not citizens as incredible and relied instead upon the information contained in the form completed by officer delafuente.the ij noted that the record did not contain a court record of barradas conviction,but found,based on barradas credible testimony about his guilty plea and the other evidence in the record,that barradas engaged in alien smuggling and knew or should have known that the children he attempted to bring into the united states were not citizens.the ij concluded that the dhs had established removability under a e i by clear and convincing evidence and ordered barradas removed to mexico.
barradas timely appealed the ij order to the board of immigration appeals bia.on august,the bia affirmed the ij removal decision,finding that it was supported by evidence of record that established barradas knowing encouragement,inducement,assistance,abetting,or aiding of two undocumented minor aliens to try to enter the united states.in a footnote to its per curiam order,the bia noted that a e i requires an individual to act knowingly and observed that the ij misstated the mens rea requirement as knew,or should have known.the bia found this error to be harmless in light of barradas testimony that he pleaded guilty to alien smuggling.the bia found no evidence in the record to support barradas allegations that the ij violated his due process rights.
barradas now petitions this court for relief and renews the arguments he made before the bia.his arguments logically condense into two primary allegations insufficient evidence and violation of due process rights.first,he alleges that the dhs failed to prove his removability by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence as required by woodby ins,d.he contends that the dhs did not introduce sufficient evidence of his conviction to prove the factual allegation of the conviction asserted in his nta.this contention is entwined with one of his subsidiary arguments that the ij improperly admitted and relied upon the forms and.second,barradas alleges that the ij violated his due process rights by compelling his testimony through inappropriate threats to draw an adverse inference from his silence and then by subjecting him to excessive interrogation once he took the stand.we evaluate his claims in turn.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
barradas argues that the bia decision to remove him should be reversed because the dhs failed to prove by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that he was convicted of alien smuggling.the nta alleged that o n october,barradas was convicted of smuggling illegal aliens into the united states.on the basis of that allegation and the three others to which barradas admitted,the nta alleged him to be inadmissible and thus removable pursuant to a e i,which states that a ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law is inadmissible.although a e i does not require a conviction for inadmissibility or removal,see in re.t hese substantive provisions describe the smuggling activities that will suffice,even in the absence of a criminal conviction,to exclude or deport an alien from the united states,barradas asserts that the dhs must prove the conviction here because it was specifically alleged in the nta.see woodby,at n o deportation order may be entered unless it is found by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.iysheh gonzales,cir 
because barradas has lawful permanent resident status,the government may remove him only if it establishes by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.c a olowo ashcroft,cir.where,as here,the ij and bia found that the government has met that burden,it is our task to consider whether the removal order rests on reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.olowo,at.we can not reverse the order of the bia unless we find that the evidence compels the conclusion that the bia ruled incorrectly.ins,cir.where,as here,the bia has adopted,affirmed,and supplemented a decision of an ij,we review the ij decision as supplemented by that of the bia.alimi gonzales,cir.
our determination of whether there is reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record as a whole to support the ij and bia conclusions that the government proved barradas conviction by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence necessarily requires an examination of the evidence admitted at barradas removal hearing.for reasons unbeknownst to us,and apparently even to itself,the government was unable to produce any documentation of barradas guilty plea or conviction at the time of his hearing left without this evidence in the record,we must determine whether the evidence that the government did criminal complaint,the form,and the form sufficient to satisfy the government heavy burden of proof as to his conviction.first we must determine whether these items were admissible to prove the conviction.from there,we will evaluate their sufficiency.
there is a statutory list of records that constitute proof of a criminal conviction.see c b.barradas correctly observes that neither a criminal complaint nor forms or appears on the list.in light of the deference we accord agency regulations,however,we have held that the list is not exhaustive.see gonzales,cir see also francis gonzales,cir.here,we defer to the attorney general regulation for determining what kinds of evidence may be used to prove a criminal conviction in immigration proceedings.subsection d of this regulation provides that a ny evidence that reasonably indicates the existence of a criminal conviction may be admissible as evidence thereof.d.the federal rules of evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings.doumbia gonzales,cir.evidence is admissible so long as it is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair,at.
the ij admitted into evidence the criminal complaint charging barradas with alien smuggling.barradas did not object to the admission.during questioning,the ij showed the criminal complaint to barradas,who acknowledged that it charged him with alien smuggling.while a criminal complaint does not demonstrate guilt or the existence of a conviction,it at least provides some basis for the government allegations in the nta.barradas did not challenge the admission of or reliance upon this document,and neither do we.
the admissibility of the forms and as proof of barradas conviction and as proof of other facts in the more contentious barradas objected to their admission at his hearing because he was not given the opportunity to their creator,officer delafuente,who was not present at the hearing.the ij admitted both forms over barradas objection.barradas maintains that doing so was fundamentally unfair to him.
we have observed that problems of fundamental fairness associated with hearsay testimony are dispelled when the testimony is subject to,olowo,at,but we did not go so far as to say that is the only way to ensure fundamental fairness.in the immigration context,fundamentally fair should simply be read to mean in accordance with the reasonable opportunity guaranteed by b.doumbia,at.aliens in removal proceedings have the right to a reasonable opportunity to witnesses presented by the government,b b,but when the evidence introduced is that recorded by a dhs agent in a public record,the absent agent can not be presumed to be an unfriendly witness or other than an accurate recorder,espinoza ins,cir.establishing an automatic right to the preparers of such documents would place an unwarranted burden on the dhs.id.absent any indication that a form contains information that is manifestly incorrect or was obtained by duress,the bia has found the form to be inherently trustworthy and admissible as evidence.in re.we have agreed with that position.see ins,cir.
moreover,we have long allowed the admission of forms to prove the truth of their contents.see,at.there is no indication that officer delafuente conviction notation was carelessly or maliciously drafted or was intended to serve as anything other than an administrative record we might doubt the reliability of the require an opportunity for it mischaracterized or misstated any material information about barradas conviction or seemed suspicious in any other way.no such factors are present here.nor does barradas allege that the remainder of the form was carelessly drafted or clouded by bias.he does not claim that the conviction information noted on it is incorrect,nor that officer delafuente obtained any of the form contents by duress or other inappropriate interrogation tactics.perhaps most tellingly,barradas does not assert that officer delafuente mischaracterized or incorrectly recorded the statements of anyyensy and eduardo.he merely attempts to cast doubt on the children credibility,speculating that they got nervous,or they were afraid and they did have nothing else to say.in light of these facts,we find that the form was properly admitted for its truth,both generally and with respect to the conviction notation.
having concluded that the government evidence to prove barradas conviction was properly admitted,we turn to the question of whether it was sufficient to support the ij finding that the government met its clear,unequivocal,and convincing burden.with respect to an alien,a conviction is
