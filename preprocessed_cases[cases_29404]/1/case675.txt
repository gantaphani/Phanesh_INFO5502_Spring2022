chinese nationals mei fun wong and her son ling go petition for review of an october,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board,upholding a march,order by immigration judge ij william jankun,directing petitioners removal from the united states and denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat.see matter of in re,aff g nos.a,because wong failed administratively to exhaust her challenges to the denial of withholding of removal and cat relief,we dismiss this part of her petition for lack of jurisdiction.see d.no such jurisdictional bar pertains to her petition for review of the denial of asylum.in this respect,wong challenges bia determinations,detailed in a precedential opinion,rejecting wong argument that involuntary insertion of a contraceptive intrauterine device iud equates to involuntary sterilization as that term is used categorically to identify a political refugee under the immigration and nationality act ina,see a requiring involuntary iud insertion to be accompanied by aggravating circumstances to constitute persecution under the ina,see and finding no such aggravating circumstances demonstrated in this case wong further challenges the bia determination that in any event,she failed to establish the required nexus between the alleged harms inflicted and her resistance to china population control policy.
wong assertion that involuntary iud insertion equates to sterilization is now foreclosed by our decision in xia fan huang holder,cir.for reasons discussed herein,we defer to the bia interpretation of the ina to preclude categorical treatment of involuntary iud insertion as persecution and,thus,to the agency requirement for some demonstration of accompanying aggravating circumstances to establish persecution.at the same time,however,we conclude that the bia did not sufficiently identify the standards it applied in determining that neither aggravating circumstances nor nexus were established in this case,without which we can not review its decision.accordingly,we vacate the order of removal and remand for the agency to rectify this omission.
background 
a.the factual basis for petitioner claim of past persecution 
on january,wong and her then son attempted to enter the united states through seattle,washington,without valid entry documents.before the immigration and naturalization service,wong conceded her removability and sought asylum and other relief from removal based on a fear of future persecution.the basis for her fear was professed past persecution evidenced by her subjection to involuntary insertion of an iud in furtherance of china population control policy.
testifying in support of her application in,wong essentially relied on facts stated in her asylum application and accompanying declaration.wong stated that she was born in fuzhou,china,where she married in and gave birth to her son on july.wong husband purportedly fled china for the united states in april to avoid persecution for his support of the student movement that culminated in the tiananmen square massacre 
about a year after wong husband left china,on april,chinese family planning officials required her to have an iud inserted.finding the device painful,wong requested its removal during one of her required quarterly gynecological examinations.with official permission denied,wong arranged for a private doctor to remove the iud in may.when her actions were discovered in the course of a january gynecological examination,wong refused to have another iud inserted because i was afraid of the pain and problems it caused.decl.in supp.of asylum appl.at.as a result,she was detained without harm for three days until she finally succumbed to wearing another iud and her paid a bribe,ostensibly a fine for wong missing gynecological examinations,to secure her release.id.
five years later,in january,wong attempted to leave china to avoid what she characterized as the continual torture and torment of wearing an iud.id.stopped in hong kong,she was jailed there for four months,again without harm,before being returned to the mainland.there,she was fined rmb for leaving china illegally and for continuing to miss gynecological examinations.wong stated that she paid the fine under threat that she would otherwise be jailed and her son prohibited from attending school.
wong asserted that,thereafter,she continued to feel that family planning officials were harassing and menacing her,although she provided no particulars.id.at.characterizing her life as unbearable,wong stated that she decided to leave china and to end the torture.id.accordingly,in january,wong fled to the united states,where she sought asylum.
sometime in,in new york,wong had her iud removed.the following year,she and her husband conceived a second child,who was due to be born in april.in march,wong testified that if she were removed to china before delivering her child,she would be forced to undergo an abortion if she were removed after delivering her child,she would be involuntarily sterilized.
agency proceedings 
at the conclusion of the hearing on wong claims for relief from removal,the ij issued an adverse oral decision.preliminarily,the ij expressed serious reservations as to the credibility of wong overall account.although wong claimed that she was compelled to wear an iud after the birth of her son,the ij noted that a state department report stated that in wong province,iud usage was mandated only for families that had two children see bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,dep t of state,china profile of asylum claims and country conditions.further,he pointed out inconsistencies between wong assertions and those made by her husband in support of his asylum application.wong testified that from the time of their marriage which she alternatively reported as may,and june,until her husband departure from china in april,the couple had always lived together in their home.by contrast,her husband had asserted that chinese authorities came to the home in june,prompting him to escape the premises and to hide with relatives until his departure from china the following year.further,in a application for advanced parole,wong husband sought permission to return to china,professing a need to care for his dying wife who had been seriously injured in a traffic accident.wong never reported being near death while in china.
despite these reservations,the ij did not rely on an adverse credibility finding to deny wong relief from removal.instead,he concluded that,even if wong account were credited she failed to qualify for relief from removal because she had not demonstrated a fear that she would be forced to undergo abortion or sterilization,or would be subjected to arrest,if returned to china.nor had she demonstrated that involuntary reinsertion of an iud constituted past persecution.
the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision.before this court considered wong initial petition for review of this decision,the parties submitted and we so ordered a stipulation to remand the case to the bia for it to explain the bases for its conclusion that the forcible insertion of an iud,and any attendant pain or discomfort,does not fall within the amended definition of refugee.wong ashcroft,at cir,stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal the bia provided that explanation in a precedential opinion filed on october.see in re.rather than discuss that opinion in detail here,we do so in addressing wong petition challenges.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standards of review 
our jurisdiction to review final orders of removal is established by.where,as here,the bia issues a decision independent of the ij,we review the bia decision alone.see xia fan huang holder,at belortaja gonzales,cir.we review the agency factual findings under the substantial evidence standard,treating them as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see also yanqin weng holder,cir.thus,because the agency assumed the credibility of wong factual account despite reservations raised by record inconsistencies,we do likewise.we review questions of law and the bia application of law to undisputed fact de novo.see yanqin weng holder,at.nevertheless,when reviewing the bia interpretation of the ina,a statute it administers,we defer to the agency interpretation so long as it is reasonable in light of the analysis set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see xia fan huang holder,at deferring to agency interpretation of ina as reasonable shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir en banc rejecting agency interpretation of ina as contrary to unambiguous statutory language.
b.the statutory scheme 
the ina authorizes the attorney general,in his discretion,to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee,defined under the ina as one who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a see also a.an asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing through credible evidence that he suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution if removed from the united states.see a b dong zhong zheng mukasey,cir.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.see id.citing poradisova gonzales,cir.
how to apply these principles to persons seeking asylum based on opposition to china population control policy has challenged both the agency and the courts.the issue is complicated by both political and practical concerns.as to the first,few societies have valued individual liberty as strongly as our own or erected such high legal barriers to government intrusion on personal freedom.thus,it is not surprising that other governments restraints on personal autonomy strike us as oppressive.see zhou yun zhang ins,cir observing that in world inhabited by more than six billion people,most of whom live in societies that we in the united states would consider oppressive for a variety of reasons,it is hardly surprising that thousands of refugees continue to present themselves at our borders each year seeking asylum.which of these restraints rise to the level of persecution warranting asylum is not always easy to determine.as for practical considerations,china population control policy applies in a country of more than billion people.the persons opposed to the policy,the potential applicants for asylum in the united states from that policy,could therefore easily number in the millions.further complicating the issue is the ease with which opposition to the state population policy might be invoked to support asylum claims by large numbers of chinese nationals whose real reason for seeking entry into the united states is the historic motivation for generations of immigrants the search for better economic opportunities.see id.at.
prior to,the bia apparently balanced these concerns by construing the ina to permit persons opposed to china population control policy to claim refugee status only if they demonstrated that the policy had been selectively applied to them on the basis of a protected ground.shi liang lin dep t of justice,at calabresi,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting matter of chang.in response to reports that china was enforcing its population control policy through forced abortions and sterilizations,however,congress legislatively recalibrated the balance to ensure that persons subjected to such treatment qualified as refugees.section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.codified at et,states 
a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
a see also shi liang lin dep t of justice,at discussing scope of amendment ke zhen zhao dep t of justice,cir discussing background to change in law.
thus,after,aliens compelled to undergo involuntary abortion or sterilization,or who refused to undergo these procedures,categorically qualify as refugees.they need not establish their own political motivation or that of their persecutors their political opinion exists de jure rather than as a matter of fact on which the applicant bears the burden of proof.shi liang lin dep t of justice,at at the same time,congress provided that persons not subjected to abortion or sterilization but who claimed persecution on account of other resistance to a coercive population control program might also qualify as refugees,but only upon showing that they resisted the population program,they suffered persecution,and the persecution was inflicted on account of their resistance.a.
c.the bia ruling 
in dismissing wong appeal,the bia concluded as a matter of law that involuntary iud insertion does not equate to involuntary sterilization under the ina and,therefore,that wong was not a refugee per se.see in re,at.in so ruling,the bia highlighted the permanency of the sterilization procedure,which renders a person incapable of having children.id.emphasis in original.by contrast,the board characterized iud use as a temporary measure meant to provide for birth planning and not to remove all possibility of future birth opportunities.id.emphasis in original.
turning to the other resistance prong of the ina definition of refugee,the board concluded that unauthorized removal of an iud and failure to attend gynecological exams can,and in wong case did,constitute resistance to china population control policy within the meaning of a,because such acts,while arguably not comprising active or forceful opposition to china family planning policy,would certainly thwart the goals of the plan and be viewed with disfavor by chinese officials implementing the plan.id.at,see also in re,construing resistance to cover wide range of circumstances,including expressions of general opposition,attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases,and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of family planning law.nevertheless,the board ruled that involuntary iud insertion in response to such resistance does not categorically constitute persecution.an asylum applicant must adduce some evidence of aggravating circumstances,which the bia found were not present in wong case.see in re,at.further,the bia concluded that wong had failed to show that her alleged harms were inflicted on account of her resistance to china population control policy,because the actions of which she complained were simply intended to secure compliance with the policy.see id.at.
wong challenge to the bia ruling 
failure to equate iud insertion with sterilization 
wong submits that the bia erred in failing to construe involuntary iud insertion as the equivalent of involuntary sterilization for purposes of identifying an alien as a refugee under the ina.this argument must be rejected after xia fan huang holder,in which this court accorded chevron deference to the bia challenged construction.see id.at.in so holding,we observed,first,that the ina is silent as to whether iud insertion constitutes sterilization.see id.second,we determined that the bia conclusion that involuntary iud insertion did not constitute involuntary sterilization was reasonable and,therefore,entitled to deference.id.at.
panels of this court are,of course,now bound by our holding in huang,and we would not,in any event,be inclined to hold otherwise.indeed,we note that the third circuit has recently cited approvingly to huang in reaching the same conclusion.see fei mei cheng attorney of,cir upholding bia determination that involuntary iud insertion does not constitute involuntary sterilization.
accordingly,because we identify no merit in wong argument that she qualifies as a refugee because she was involuntarily sterilized,we deny this part of her petition for review 
requirement that involuntary iud insertion be accompanied by aggravating circumstances to constitute persecution on account of other resistance 
the bia the government does not the removal of an iud or the failure to attend mandatory gynecological appointments can constitute other resistance to china population control policy and that wong exhibited such resistance by removing her first iud and refusing to have a second one inserted for three days while she was detained.see in re,at.thus,we need here consider only wong challenge to the board determination that she failed to demonstrate that she was persecuted for such resistance.
a.the aggravating circumstances requirement is reasonable in light of congress failure to treat involuntary iud insertion,like involuntary abortion and sterilization,as per se persecution 
wong argues that the bia erred in construing the ina to require that involuntary iud insertion be accompanied by aggravating circumstances to demonstrate persecution.she submits that the invasion of personal autonomy and the restraint on liberty inherent in involuntary iud insertion are alone sufficient to demonstrate persecution.neither the bia nor this court can consider the relative merits of such an argument in the abstract.rather,we must consider it in the context of a statutory scheme in which congress identified only two involuntary procedures for population and per se persecution.in that context,we conclude that the bia construction of the statute was not unreasonable.
the ina failure to define persecution 
although persecution is the fundamental concept at the core of the ina refugee definition,in re,the term is not statutorily defined and courts have not settled on a single,uniform definition,ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir citing ins,cir.this court has described persecution as the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground,ivanishvili dep t of justice,at,a definition that closely tracks that developed by the bia,see in re,defining persecution as the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ in race,religion or political opinion in a way regarded as offensive internal quotation marks omitted quoted in ivanishvili dep t of justice,at.such a definition is sufficiently general to encompass a variety of forms of adverse treatment,including violence and physical abuse,or forms of harm such as the deliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage.ivanishvili dep t of justice,at internal quotation marks,citation,and brackets omitted see also gonzales,cir instructing that series of incidents,none of which alone rise to level of persecution,may do so when viewed cumulatively.
the difficulty with identifying the boundaries of such a general concept is evident in our precedent.we have emphasized that persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.ai feng yuan u.dep t of justice,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also fatin ins,cir alito,p ersecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust,or even unlawful or unconstitutional.at the same time,we have admonished the bia to be keenly sensitive to the fact that what might be viewed as mere harassment in some circumstances can take on an entirely different character when officially inflicted on an individual while detained on account of protected grounds.beskovic gonzales,cir observing that minor beating may constitute persecution when inflicted on detainee by government authorities on account of protected ground see ivanishvili dep t of justice,at p hysical abuse and violence at the hands of government agents,if credible,may preclude a finding that the conduct is mere harassment that does not as a matter of law rise to the level of persecution,for violent conduct generally goes beyond the mere annoyance and distress that characterize harassment.
caselaw urging bia guidance on whether involuntary iud insertion constitutes persecution 
any involuntary iud insertion,even one conducted according to the same medical procedures as a voluntary iud insertion,involves a serious violation of personal privacy and deprives a woman of autonomy in making decisions about whether to bear a child.see qiao hua li gonzales,cir.nevertheless,in the years preceding the bia decision in in re,courts of appeals had taken an array of positions on whether,and under what circumstances,involuntary iud insertion constitutes persecution.ying zheng gonzales,cir.more to the point,the courts repeatedly solicited bia guidance on the issue.see id.at remanding with observation that bia has not yet opined on this issue in a published,precedential opinion,thus depriving the bench,the bar and potential asylum applicants of guidance concerning whether and how they might approach the issue chao qun jiang bureau of citizenship immig,cir to further the goals of uniformity and fairness that prompted our remand on the same issue in ying zheng,we remand this case to the bia for it to articulate a consistent position on whether and under what conditions forced insertion of an iud constitutes persecution.internal quotation marks omitted see also,li fang lin mukasey,cir remanding where bia left unclear how it factored the temporary nature of iud insertion and usage into its overall persecution calculus,whether forced iud insertion and continued usage is never persecution or whether it is not persecution only because it did not deprive petitioner of a significant portion of her reproductive life feng chai yang attorney,cir remanding for consideration of whether two iuds inserted against petitioner will could be construed as other resistance to china birth control policies yahong zheng gonzales,cir observing that no court of appeals has decided whether persecution can be established on the basis of forcible iud insertions alone and remanding because bia assumed the answer arguendo,providing scant basis for review meng rong fang ashcroft,app x,cir unpublished remanding in absence of bia or circuit authority on whether a woman who unwillingly acquiesced to obtaining an iud has been persecuted under the other resistance clause and seeking board considered views internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the bia attempted to provide this guidance in in re.see at collecting cases and noting that guidance on this issue is necessary.
the bia articulation of the aggravating circumstances requirement 
in re holds that simply requiring a woman to use an iud,and other more routine methods of china implementation of its family planning policy,do not generally rise to the level of harm required to establish persecution.id.at.rather,to rise to the level of harm necessary to constitute persecution,the insertion of an iud must involve aggravating circumstances.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the board did not minimize the serious violation of liberty represented by an involuntary iud insertion.see id.at acknowledging that having an iud inserted involuntarily is certainly intrusive and hinders a person ability to control procreation.rather,it grounded the demand for some evidence of aggravating circumstances in an assessment of congress intent in amending the statutory definition of refugee in.
the board concluded that those amendments were intended to afford categorical refugee status to the two classes of persons whom congress understood to be most deserving of protection,those subjected to either involuntary abortion or involuntary sterilization.id.at quoting shi liang lin dep t of justice,at.the bia identified no basis for concluding that congress also intended to include iud insertion or removal as an automatic basis for gaining relief from removal.id.
when,as here,the bia interprets ambiguous language in the ina in a precedential decision,we defer to that interpretation so long as it is reasonable under the analysis set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,at.see ins,d t he bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.internal quotation marks omitted.as we have already observed,the ina does not specifically address whether involuntary iud insertion constitutes persecution.because the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,step one of the chevron analysis is satisfied,and we proceed to step two,asking whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron,natural res.def.council,at,and deferring to any reasonable interpretation by the board,see kuhali reno,cir citing ins,at.
we conclude that the board interpretation is reasonable.there is no question that,at the time it amended the statutory definition of refugee,congress was aware that mandatory iud insertions,like mandatory abortions and sterilizations,were employed by china to carry out its population control program.see,coercive population control in china hearings before the subcomm.on int l operations human rights of the house comm.on int l relations,cong.statement of john aird,former senior research specialist on china at the bureau of the census noting upward trend in coerced iud insertions in china see also patrick tyler,birth control in china coercion and evasion,times,june,at reporting that communist party in china urged sterilizations or verified insertions of iuds to thwart additional pregnancies.nevertheless,congress determined that only persons subjected to involuntary abortions or sterilizations would qualify as per se refugees under the amended statutory definition.
against this background,the board congress did not intend for all involuntary iud insertions to be treated as per se be viewed as a rational interpretation of congressional purpose and not as arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,at.while this is the first time we so conclude in a published opinion,this holding is consistent with a number of our unpublished decisions that have already deferred to the board rationale on this issue.see xue mei lin holder,wl,at cir,summary order citing in re,at,in concluding that bia reasonably concluded that petitioner failed to establish that insertion of the iud constituted past persecution xiu mei chen holder,app x,cir citing in re,at,in holding that record did not compel conclusion that involuntary insertion of iud was accompanied by aggravating circumstances rising to the level of persecution ping lin holder,app x,cir citing in re,at,in concluding that petitioner failed to demonstrate aggravating circumstances sufficient to render the insertion of her iud persecutive chun mei ying holder,app x,cir citing in re,at,in concluding that petitioner failed to prove that iud insertion involved aggravating circumstances rising to the level of persecution bing xin lin holder,app x,cir t he bia analysis in matter of is applicable here w e are not persuaded that the gynecological examinations petitioner endured were conducted under aggravated circumstances.yu chai huang holder,app x,cir citing in re,at,in concluding that petitioner described no aggravating circumstances that would make an iud insertion persecution in her case.two sister circuits have reached the same conclusion,one summarily,see xiu rong chen holder,app x,cir observing that even if bia construction was not the best available interpretation of the statutory language,we certainly can not say that its interpretation is unreasonable,and we must therefore afford chevron deference to the bia conclusion that an iud insertion,unaccompanied by any aggravating circumstance,does not generally constitute persecut ion for other resistance to a coercive population control program within the meaning of a,and one implicitly,see fei mei cheng attorney of,at cir.holding that bia conclusory statement that petitioner has not shown aggravating circumstances is not supported by substantial evidence.
by deciding that the bia reasonably resolved this statutory ambiguity,we do not suggest that the agency could not have made a different choice.we conclude only that the choice it made was not unreasonable.one reason courts do not a reasonable executive branch choice about the showing necessary to demonstrate persecution under the ina is that the answer necessarily implicates foreign relations,an area where,as the supreme court has cautioned,the judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of potential diplomatic repercussions.ins,at.in such a context,we must take appropriate account of the greater expertise of the executive branch,of the serious administrative needs and concerns inherent in the necessarily extensive ins efforts to enforce this complex statute,and the nation need to speak with one voice in immigration matters.zadvydas davis,d internal quotation marks omitted.of course,if congress takes a different view,it remains free to amend the statute,as it did in,to identify certain conduct as categorically persecutive.
in the absence of any clear congressional directive regarding involuntary iud insertion,however,we uphold the bia reasonable determination that such insertion must be accompanied by aggravating circumstances to demonstrate persecution under a.
b.the bia failure adequately to explain its application of the aggravating circumstances test in this case 
in rejecting wong asylum application,the board determined that aggravating circumstances were lacking because the facts presented paint a picture of discomfort resulting from the routine implementation of the family planning policy,rather than persecution and although the three days of detention preceding wong iud insertion were not insignificant,wong experienced no persecutory harm,as might have been the case if she had also been beaten or injured.in re,at.
we identify two concerns with the board analysis that hamper our review of its decision.first,the bia failed to indicate what,if any,weight it assigned to the involuntary iud insertion itself in the aggravating circumstances analysis.second,the bia did not explain how it distinguished wong case from similar circumstances that were found to constitute persecution in in re chao qun jiang,denying asylum to chinese family planning official who participated in such mistreatment.we remand to allow the board to address these concerns.
according weight to involuntary iud insertion in assessing aggravating circumstances 
while the board acknowledged that involuntary iud insertion was certainly intrusive,in re,at,it is not clear what weight,if any,it accorded that fact in deciding whether wong experienced persecution.by emphasizing that the detention preceding the iud insertion involved no beating or injury and that the iud itself caused only discomfort,the bia decision might be read to demand proof of aggravating factors that would,by themselves,constitute persecution.see,gonzalez,at holding that physical abuse and violence at hands of government agents may preclude finding of mere harassment ivanishvili dep t of justice,at same.we are not certain,however,that the bia intended to accord the involuntary procedure at weight in its persecution determination.
even if,consistent with congressional intent,the bia reasonably declined to recognize all involuntary iud insertions as categorically persecutive,and even accepting its factual finding that the medical procedure used to insert wong iud was no different from that used in the case of a voluntary insertion,the board might well conclude that when such a procedure is involuntary,it bears some weight in a persecution determination.as we have recognized in other contexts,an act that may be voluntarily undertaken can become persecutive where consent is absent.see,e,balachova mukasey,cir we have no doubt that rape is sufficiently serious to constitute persecution.because involuntary iud insertion involves a greater affront to privacy autonomy than other mandated population control procedures,ingestion of a pill or attendance at counseling sessions,the board might assign the former procedure greater weight in
