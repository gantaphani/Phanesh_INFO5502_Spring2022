this case requires us to determine whether the deficient manner in which the members of the puerto rico examining board of accountants the preba or the board presided over the administrative hearings to suspend and revoke appellant certified public accountant cpa license disqualifies them from the protections of immunity.we affirm the district court determination that it does not.
facts and procedural history 
when reviewing a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.peñalbert rosa fortuño burset,cir.
appellant,miguel guzmán rivera guzmán,received a license to practice as a cpa from the preba on february.p.laws ann.tit.on june,the preba required appellant to submit to an involuntary practice and to provide a corresponding report the practice review report on or before august.on june,guzmán requested that the practice review be postponed until but the preba denied the request based on a need and urgency to conduct the review.at guzmán request,the preba scheduled a hearing for october,but due to his own scheduling error he failed to appear.guzmán contacted the board on october,to explain his absence and to request a rescheduling,but the board did not respond to his request.
on november,the preba issued a resolution summarily suspending guzmán cpa license indefinitely.guzmán suspension,which took place without the benefit of a hearing,was based on guzmán failure to comply with the preba disciplinary requirement of submitting to a practice review.guzmán was notified of the suspension on november.on november,guzmán requested that the board reconsider its decision because he had already begun the practice review process.the board scheduled a hearing for december,and sent guzmán notice of the same.the notice that guzmán received did not comply with the requirements of puerto rico law it did not contain information regarding the nature or purpose of the hearing,the legal provisions authorizing the hearing,guzmán alleged violations,his right to attend the hearing with counsel,or the consequences of his failure to appear.see laws ann.tit.during the december,hearing,the preba informed guzmán that the puerto rico association of certified public accountants pracpa had referred his case to the preba based on a audit.preba ordered the practice review process based on pracpa referral.the preba informed guzmán that his cpa license would remain suspended until he presented his practice review report.the deadline to submit the practice review report was set for january.guzmán completed the requested practice review report on march,the pracpa approved the practice review report on july,and guzmán submitted it to the preba on july.
on august,the preba informed guzmán that it would not lift the suspension on his license.the preba reasons were as follows i guzmán bought certification stamps on the same day he had been suspended ii the practice review report was delivered after the january,deadline and iii the practice review opinion was adverse on the merits.the preba notified guzmán that it would hold another hearing on september.again,the notice did not comply with local law requirements.see laws ann.tit.
at the september,hearing,the preba did not discuss the contents of the practice review report.instead,the board questioned guzmán regarding the delay in submitting his practice review report and about the certification stamps he acquired on november,the preba failed to inform guzmán of his due process rights.
on october,the preba issued a resolution revoking guzmán cpa license,stating that guzmán did not follow the standards of the profession and that he had a clear intention to violate the public accountancy act and the profession code of ethics.guzmán was notified of the same on october.on october,guzmán filed a request for reconsideration,which the preba denied on november,without explanation.
on december,guzmán filed for judicial review before the puerto rico court of appeals alleging that the preba had violated his due process rights when suspending and revoking his cpa license.on june,the puerto rico court of appeals issued a judgment revoking the preba ruling and ordering it to reinstate guzmán license immediately and without any kind of delay.guzmán rivera examining bd.of certified pub.accountants,no,wl,at cir.june,certified translation provided by the parties.the court held that the board erred in law,when suspending,as well as revoking guzmán cpa license.certainly,the board totally disregarded the procedures required to suspend and revoke a license.id.at.yet,the court held that the board could make the corresponding findings,if any,pursuant to the rulings of the judgment and noted that the board could carry out an administrative hearing if it deemed that such a hearing was necessary id.at.
on august,guzmán filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against the appellees suing the individual defendants in their official and individual capacities.guzmán alleged a violation of section of the civil rights act of due to defendants violations of his fourteenth amendment due process rights.on november,appellees filed a motion to dismiss the case pursuant to,inter alia,federal rule of civil procedure b claiming that they were entitled to absolute immunity in their individual capacities because they were performing duties.
the court granted defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that they were entitled to absolute immunity in their individual capacities.guzmán rivera lucena zabala,sec,wl,at july.the court concluded that the appellees perform traditional adjudicatory function s,that the functions are comparable to those of a judge,and that procedural safeguards,including the right to appeal the board decision via judicial review in the puerto rico courts,protect the individual whose license is in dispute.id.at citing bettencourt bd.of registration in med.of,cir.the court found that the allegedly deficient manner in which the members of the board presided over the administrative hearings is irrelevant,insofar as the tasks they performed were in fact adjudicatory in nature,are functionally comparable to those of a judge,and thus entitle them to the absolute immunity that is vested upon judges.id.at.
the court entered judgment on july.appellant filed a motion for reconsideration on july,and appellees filed their response thereto on the same day.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal on july.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on august.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b based on its conclusion that the individual defendants were entitled to absolute immunity and that guzmán constitutional right to due process was adequately protected.guzmán appeals such dismissal and contends that the defendants are not entitled to absolute immunity because they acted outside the scope of their duties by disregarding the procedural safeguards mandated by puerto rico law.
we review a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted de novo.peñalbert rosa,at coggeshall.bd.of registration of psychologists,cir.we agree with the district court assessment that the defendants are entitled to immunity in their individual capacities.
t here are some officials whose special functions require a full exemption from liability.butz economou.judges are entitled to absolute immunity from lawsuits even where they are accused of deciding the case due to improper motives.id.at.if a civil action could be maintained against a judge by virtue of an allegation of malice,judges would lose that independence without which no judiciary can either be respectable or useful.id.at quoting bradley fisher.the supreme court has extended this immunity to federal agency officials performing adjudicatory duties.id.at.we have found that this immunity may apply to licensing boards where the board members roles are functionally comparable to those of judges.see bettencourt,at.
to determine whether the agency officials roles are akin to those of a judge,we must first determine whether the preba members perform a traditional adjudicatory function,in that they decide facts,appl y law,and otherwise resolve disputes on the merits free from direct political influence.id.at.next,we must determine whether the cases the preba members decide are sufficiently controversial that,in the absence of absolute immunity,they would be subject to numerous damages actions.id.finally,we must ask whether the preba members adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect a n accountant constitutional rights.id.we address only the first and third prongs of the analysis as guzmán does not contest that the second prong was met.guzmán rivera,wl,at.
first,we conclude that the preba members perform traditional adjudicatory functions.members of the preba are statutorily authorized to issue licenses to practice and to revoke or suspend them.laws ann.tit.when revoking or suspending a cpa license,the preba is required to hold a hearing to determine if there is cause to revoke or suspend the license.see id.the public accountancy act,id,permits the board to institute proceedings against a certified public accountant and requires the board to comply with the requirements of the uniform administrative procedures uapa,laws ann.tit.the uapa allows each agency to designate examining officials to preside over the adjudicatory procedures that are held and provides that t hese officials or employees shall be designated by the title of administrative judges.id.like judges,the preba members who preside over the adjudicatory procedures decide facts,apply laws,and otherwise resolve disputes on the merits.id.the final order or resolution shall include and expound the findings of fact,the conclusions of law that provide the grounds for the adjudication,and the availability of the recourse of reconsideration or review,as the case may be.therefore,the first prong of the functional analysis is met.see bettencourt,at.
we must now ask whether the preba members,like judges,adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect a n accountant constitutional rights.id.guzmán argues that the district court erred in finding that this prong of the analysis was met.he argues that his constitutional right to due process was not adequately protected because,as the puerto rico court of appeals determined,the preba disregarded all procedural safeguards required under puerto rico law,guzmán rivera,no,at,and due to this unlawful deprivation he was stripped of his proprietary right to practice his profession for twenty months.
as our precedents indicate,the third prong of the functional analysis is meant to examine whether,generally,enough safeguards exist to enhance the reliability of information and the impartiality of the decisionmaking process bettencourt,at quoting butz,at examining whether massachusetts medical licensing proceedings generally provide sufficient safeguards against malicious action by members of the medical licensing board.the uapa provides procedural safeguards for actions undertaken by puerto rico administrative agencies pérez acevedo rivero cubano,cir citing laws ann.tit.the uapa mandates that,in every formal adjudicatory proceeding,an agency safeguard a t he right to timely notice of the charges or complaints or claims against one of the parties b t he right to introduce evidence c t he right to an impartial adjudication and d t he right to have the decision based on the record of the case.laws ann.tit.the uapa allows for the preba and the accountant to litigate against a backdrop of procedures that provide for an adversarial process which includes the use of complaints,the opportunity to intervene,conferences,and discovery.id.the accused accountant has the right to be represented by counsel,present witnesses,witnesses,examine evidence,and request the issuance of subpoenas.laws ann.tit,d.the preba is also represented by an attorney.id.h.these safeguards ensure that there is impartial adjudication.in addition to explicitly guaranteeing the right to impartial adjudication,the uapa allows a party who is adversely affected by an agency resolution to file a motion for reconsideration.laws ann.tit.further,the adversely affected party may file a petition for review before the puerto rico court of appeals,id,or before the court of first instance,laws ann.tit,j.
the procedures available to an accountant under the uapa are similar to those that were available to the physician in bettencourt.see at noting that in massachusetts medical licensure proceedings,the physician may be represented by counsel,there is a board prosecutor,there is a transcribed record,there is an opportunity to present evidence and for,there is a written opinion,and there is an opportunity to appeal to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts.in bettencourt,we found the procedures available sufficiently ensured the impartiality of the decisionmaking process and provided protection against the board of registration in medicine malicious actions.id.we find that the procedures available to an accountant before the preba are very similar to those that were available to physician in bettencourt,are a sufficient safeguard against the preba wrongful actions,and justify granting absolute immunity to the preba members.see diva city of bangor,cir concluding that the right to request an explanation for the denial of the permit and the right to appeal the decision to the bangor board of appeals were sufficient procedural safeguards to protect the permit applicant from a violation of its constitutional rights.
the issue guzmán raises is whether the deficient manner in which the members of the preba presided over the administrative hearings disqualifies them from the protections of immunity.guzmán alleges that,due to their undisputed disregard for the procedural safeguards required under puerto rico law,guzmán rivera,no,at,the defendants acted outside the scope of their duties and are therefore not entitled to absolute immunity ricci key bancshares of me,cir.but as ricci states,t he requirement that conduct protected by absolute immunity falls within the outer perimeter of the official line of duty is read fairly expansively.id.alterations in original.the supreme court has stated that the necessary inquiry in determining whether a defendant judge is immune from suit is whether at the time he took the challenged action he had jurisdiction over the subject matter before him.stump sparkman.the court further instructed that we construe the scope of the judge jurisdiction broadly.id.a judge is absolutely immune from liability for his judicial acts even if his exercise of authority is flawed by the commission of grave procedural errors.id.at see also decker hillsborough cnty.attorney office,cir.here,the preba summary suspension of guzmán license was a grave and unacceptable procedural error.guzmán rivera,no,at.nevertheless,the preba had jurisdiction to revoke or suspend guzmán license and the members of the preba are therefore entitled to immunity.see stump,at.
