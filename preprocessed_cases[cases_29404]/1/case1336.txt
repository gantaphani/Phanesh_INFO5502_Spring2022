in this appeal,we decide whether a biological opinion biop issued by the national marine fisheries service fisheries service or the service to the environmental protection agency epa is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.the biop,which the fisheries service provided as part of the epa process of reregistering the pesticides chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion,concluded that these pesticides would jeopardize the viability of certain pacific salmonids and their habitat and that the pesticides could not be reregistered and therefore used without substantial restriction.
three manufacturers of these pesticides commenced this action,challenging the biop by contending that it rested on numerous unsupported assumptions and conclusions and faulty analyses and that therefore it was arbitrary and capricious.the district court,unpersuaded,granted the fisheries service motion for summary judgment,finding that the biop was rationally supported by the voluminous facts and studies considered by the fisheries service.
on appeal,we reverse,concluding that the biop was not the product of reasoned in that the fisheries service failed to explain or support several assumptions critical to its opinion.to enable a renewed agency process,we vacate the biop and remand this case to the district court with instructions to remand it to the fisheries service for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

chlorpyrifos was first registered in diazinon,in and malathion,in.therefore,these pesticides had to be reregistered for use because of the amendments to fifra.
as an agency action,the reregistration of pesticides by the epa is subject to the requirements of the endangered species act,which provides that every federal agency must insure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat deemed critical to such species.a.if an agency proposed action is likely to affect an endangered species,the agency must consult with the secretary of the interior,acting through either the fisheries service or the fish and wildlife service,to obtain an opinion evaluating the agency action under the endangered species act.id.as part of the consulting process,the consulted agency issues a biop that explains whether the agency proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.g,h.and in issuing the biop,the consulted agency,whether it be the fisheries service or the fish and wildlife service,must use the best scientific and commercial data available.a.
in reregistering chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion,the pesticide manufacturers and the epa agreed on steps to reduce the volume of those pesticides being used.among other measures,the manufacturers agreed to voluntarily phase out chlorpyrifos for residential use and phase in buffer zones,reduced application rates,and other restrictions for that pesticide.additionally,they agreed to curtail the use of diazinon and malathion so as to eliminate homeowner use of diazinon and reduce application rates of malathion.in this reregistering process,however,the epa did not consult or confer with the secretary of the interior to obtain a biop under the endangered species act.
in january,several environmental groups filed suit against the epa in the western district of washington,alleging that the epa failed,as required,to consult with the secretary of the interior with respect to the reregistration of active ingredients in pesticides.the district court agreed with the groups and ordered the epa to determine whether it was necessary to consult with the secretary of the interior.toxics coalition epa,civ,wl.july,aff,cir.thereafter,the epa evaluated the effects of the pesticide ingredients concluded that active pesticide ingredients,including chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion,might affect specific salmonid species and their habitats and consequently initiated a formal consultation with the fisheries service.
when,after a long delay,the fisheries service had failed to issue a biop,an environmental group filed a second suit,again in the western district of washington,to require the fisheries service to issue its biop.see northwest coalition for alternatives to pesticides marine fisheries,civ.the fisheries service settled this suit on july,agreeing to issue a biop within days.a day after the settlement agreement,the fisheries service delivered a page draft biop to the epa,in which the service proposed to conclude that chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion would jeopardize the continued existence of pacific salmonid species and impact critical habitats.the epa also opened an online docket on august,to permit comments in response to the draft biop.
the epa itself,as well as the pesticide manufacturers,several states,and others,responded to the draft biop,criticizing many of its assumptions and much of its analysis.the epa noted that t he draft lacks a level of transparency necessary for epa to understand the fisheries service rationale for its opinion that the use of any of these pesticides will jeopardize the continued existence of any of the species at issue.the epa identified a number of specific problems,including the fisheries service failure to consider already mitigation measures the fisheries service assumption that pesticides would be applied unlawfully the fisheries service use of historical data and the fisheries service critical assumption in its model that the subject species would be exposed to a lethal level of pesticides on a continual basis for a period.
in response to comments,the fisheries service revised its draft,adding information on reductions and supplementing its original data with additional studies.it issued a final biop on november,now some pages,in which it still concluded that chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion would jeopardize numerous salmonid species and adversely affect critical habitat for them.it found that exposure to these pesticides would kill salmonids and,even at low levels,would reduce salmonid growth,reduce the availability of prey,and impair salmonids swimming and olfactory senses.and it found ultimately that the reregistration of the pesticides would jeopardize the survival of of listed salmonid species and adversely affect the critical habitat of of listed species.
as required by applicable regulations,the fisheries service recommended reasonable and prudent alternatives that would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.to that end,the fisheries service recommended imposing a requirement to create specific buffers in which pesticides could not be used limitations on applying pesticides in high winds a requirement to create a foot strip of vegetation near surface waters connected to salmonid habitats monitoring and regular reporting concerning salmonid mortality and limitations on applying pesticides when soil moisture is,or is likely to become,high.
following the fisheries service issuance of its final biop,the pesticide manufacturers commenced this action under the administrative procedure act,alleging that the fisheries service biop was arbitrary and capricious and that the service did not comply with the endangered species act mandate to use the best scientific and commercial data available.on the fisheries service motion,the district court entered an order dismissing the manufacturers complaint on the ground that,pursuant to fifra,the biop was judicially reviewable only after the epa issued a final reregistration order.dow agrosciences llc marine fisheries,d.on appeal,we reversed and remanded the case,concluding that the biop was indeed a final agency action subject to judicial review.dow agrosciences llc marine fisheries,cir.
on remand,the parties filed for summary judgment.in connection with its motion,the fisheries service submitted an explanatory affidavit from anthony hawkes,a toxicologist at the fisheries service,in which he discussed the sources of data and information that the service considered and rebutted a number of arguments that the pesticide manufacturers had made in their motion for summary judgment.the manufacturers objected to the hawkes affidavit,contending that it contained improper rationalizations for the fisheries service biop.
in an opinion dated october,the district court rejected the pesticide manufacturers challenge to the hawkes affidavit and,on the merits,granted summary judgment to the fisheries service.while the court conceded that the hawkes affidavit provided an explanation not already given in the administrative record,it nonetheless found that the explanations did not constitute rationalizations because they stem med from information provided in the administrative record.in granting summary judgment to the fisheries service,the court concluded that there was a rational connection between the voluminous facts and studies considered by the fisheries service and the decisions reached in the fisheries service final biop.acknowledging that the biop was of less than ideal clarity,the district court nonetheless concluded that the pesticide manufacturers had not shown that the fisheries service ignored the best scientific and commercial data available or that the fisheries service conclusions were irrational.
this appeal followed.
as a threshold matter,the pesticide manufacturers contend that the district court erred by permitting the fisheries service to supplement the record and fill gaps in the biop with post hoc justifications,including arguments by counsel and a declaration from agency staff.they fault the district court for relying on new justifications provided solely by counsel in the judicial review process,pointing out that the district court relied on counsel purportedly new explanations for the fisheries service assumption that salmonids will be exposed to pesticides continuously for hours the fisheries service modeling assumption that when imposing buffers and the fisheries service reliance on water monitoring data developed during a period when pesticides were more heavily used.the manufacturers also fault the district court for relying on the hawkes affidavit,which they argue provided new justifications and facts not contained in the agency record.
in response,the fisheries service contends that the arguments of counsel and the hawkes affidavit were simply explanation s supported by citations to the administrative record.
the principles applicable to this issue are well established.in reviewing agency action,a court may not intrude upon the domain which congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.sec chenery.thus,a court must only consider the record made before the agency at the time the agency acted.citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d.the agency record does not refer simply to the facts presented to the agency but also includes the reasons given by the agency for taking the action.and a reviewing court may look only to these contemporaneous justifications in reviewing the agency action.chenery,at.as such,facts and justifications for agency action provided to a reviewing court for the first time are generally not to be considered by the court.see,motor vehicle mfr.ass state farm auto.ins,d c ourts may not accept appellate counsel post hoc rationalizations for agency action.
in this case,the district court explicitly found that the fisheries service biop did not include adequate explanations in at least two critical areas.first,the court concluded that the fisheries service provide d scant explanation for its assumption in the biop that salmonids would be exposed to lethal levels of the pesticides continuously for a hour period.nonetheless,the court upheld the fisheries service assumption,crediting an argument made by the fisheries service summary judgment brief that the hour exposure assumption was not the final step in the fisheries service analysis.
second,the district court concluded that the biop does not explain why the buffers it requires do not vary according to channel depth and width.nonetheless,the court again upheld the uniform buffers requirement,relying on an argument made by counsel during the summary judgment process that uniform buffers are the industry standard.
in short,even though the district court recognized that the biop was infirm in two critical respects,it inappropriately overlooked the infirmity based not on the record,but on justifications provided by counsel during the judicial proceedings.thus,the court erred in failing to confine itself to a review of the agency record.
as to the hawkes affidavit,the pesticide manufacturers argue that it impermissively expanded the agency record by providing justifications,explanations,and facts not relied on by the fisheries service in its biop.again we agree with the manufacturers argument.
in overton park,the supreme court noted that litigation affidavits generally amount to rationalizations that have traditionally been found to be an inadequate basis for review.overton park,at.but a court may,in rare circumstances,consider such materials.for example,in overton park,the court recognized that a reviewing court could require the administrative officials who participated in the decision to give testimony explaining their action.id.at.but it did so in the circumstances where the court had no administrative record from which to evaluate the agency decision in the case.see id.at.this contextual limitation was further refined by the court in later decisions when it noted that affidavits not contained in the agency record are permissible only where there was such failure to explain administrative action as to frustrate effective judicial review.camp pitts,d.and the court recognized that the more generally applicable rule is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.power light lorion,d.
here,where the fisheries service provided a page biop,it can hardly be argued that the administrative record was so lacking in explanations as to necessitate reliance on a litigation affidavit in conducting judicial review.see camp,at.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in receiving and considering the hawkes affidavit.
additionally,the district court would probably have erred in receiving the hawkes affidavit even in the limited circumstances approved in overton park because hawkes did not explain how he had authority to speak on behalf of the fisheries service to explain or justify its decisions.he stated only that he was a toxicologist for the national marine fisheries service,who had helped write the biop.
for these reasons,we will review the fisheries service action in this case its biop of november,on the basis of the agency record before the district court,disregarding the justifications and rationalizations given to the district court by counsel and by the hawkes affidavit.
the pesticide manufacturers contend,on the merits,that the fisheries service biop failed to justify numerous critical components of its analysis,rendering the biop substantially arbitrary and capricious.rather than address each claimed deficiency,we address what we consider to be their three most significant claims that the fisheries service failed to justify its model assumption that juvenile salmonids would be exposed to a lethal level of pesticides continuously for hours that the biop fails to justify its reliance on water monitoring data that the manufacturers allege were outdated and not representative of current conditions and that it failed to explain why it imposed uniformly sized buffers to all bodies of water,whether they be rivers or drainage ditches,and regardless of the economic feasibility of such uniform buffers.
in reaching the conclusions made in the biop,the fisheries service considered numerous studies and data to analyze the levels of pesticide exposure that the salmonids were likely to experience the individual salmonid likely response to those exposures and the likely consequences of that exposure to the population of the relevant salmonid species.upon completing these analyses,the fisheries service concluded that the pesticides chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion were likely to jeopardize the continued existence of salmonid species and destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of of the species.
important to the fisheries service analysis and conclusions was a population model that sought to extrapolate the effects on individual salmonids to an entire population of those salmonids.the model assumed that salmonids would be exposed to lethal levels of the pesticides continuously for a hour period.the biop explained that the hour exposure assumption was a laboratory standard a large body of laboratory toxicity data indicates that anadromous salmonids die following short term h exposure to the three insecticides,defining the standard as an acute test.the biop then explained its use of this acute test 
an acute toxicity model was constructed that estimated the impacts of juvenile mortality resulting from exposure to lethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion.these models excluded sublethal and indirect effects of the pesticide exposures and focused on the outcomes resulting from an annual day exposure to juveniles to chlorpyrifos,diazinon,or malathion.
emphasis added.using the model that applied the acute test,the biop thus found 
these results indicate that salmonid populations exposed to chlorpyrifos,diazinon,or malathion for days at the reported a lethal concentration sufficient to kill of the test population would have severe consequences to the population growth rate.
but then,without explaining why the hour exposure assumption accurately reflected conditions,the biop concluded that all but ozette sockeye populations will experience reductions in viability,which ultimately reduces the likelihood of survival and recovery of these species.
also important to the fisheries service conclusions especially with respect to the level of pesticide exposure was the water monitoring study conducted by the geological survey during the period from to.that study tested water samples from streams across the united states and found that chlorpyrifos was present in of the samples,diazinon in,and malathion in.based primarily on that study,even though it also considered other more limited data,the biop concluded 
pacific salmon and steelhead use a wide range of freshwater,estuarine,and marine habitats and many migrate hundreds of miles to complete their lifecycle.chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion are widely used pesticides and their detection is common in freshwater habitats within the four western states where listed specific salmonids are distributed.therefore,we expect some individuals within all the listed pacific salmon and steelhead evolutionary significant units will be exposed to these chemicals and other stressors of the action.concentrations of chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion can occur at levels well over and upwards of based on measured environmental concentrations and exposure models.
emphasis added.
after the biop reached its ultimate conclusion that chlorpyrifos,diazinon,and malathion were likely to jeopardize the viability of species of salmonids,it turned,as it was required to do,to recommending reasonable and prudent alternatives in using the pesticides.in this case,the alternatives limited the scope of the pesticides use and required monitoring and reporting.in the recommended limitations of use,the biop required that the pesticides not be used in ground applications within feet and in aerial applications within a feet of salmonid habitats,intermittent streams that connect to waters,and all known types of habitats as well as drainages,ditches,and other manmade conveyances to salmonid habitats that lack salmonid exclusion devices.
the pesticide manufacturers contend that the fisheries service biop was deficient,among other ways,in failing to provide support for its hour modeling assumption relying on the geological survey water monitoring study and failing to justify the uniform buffers.we address these points seriatim.
a.the hour exposure assumption 
in its biop,the fisheries service used an analytical model that incorporated an assumption that all subyearling juvenile salmonids in the wild are exposed for straight hours to a lethal concentration of the pesticides.it candidly recognized that the hour exposure assumption was derived from a laboratory protocol,but it never explained why the laboratory protocol was appropriately reflective of conditions in the environment.the pesticide manufacturers assert that the application of the laboratory standard was the only quantitative evidence in the biop that salmonid populations are likely to be affected by the epa reregistration of the products at issue.
when the fisheries service released its draft biop and posted it for comment,the hour exposure assumption was severely criticized.indeed,the epa itself argued that the assumption was unreasonable,particularly given the infrequency of those concentrations in the actual monitoring data sets.the epa added that the fisheries service had provide d no explanation of how the day exposure assumption can be characterized as realistic or reasonable.other commentary made the same point.
despite this critical commentary,the fisheries service added nothing to the final biop to respond to it,and the district court acknowledged,as it had to,that the biop provide d scant explanation for this assumption.the court,crediting the service interpretation,found that the day period is one of the standard periods for acute toxicity testing in laboratories under controlled conditions.the district court also observed that if the fisheries service 
were to rely solely on this test in drawing conclusions about the degree to which actual populations of salmonids are affected,it would have an obligation to explain why such a test,which relies on assumptions of consistent exposure,serves as a basis for predicting population exposure or survival in the field.
nonetheless,the court forgave the absence of an explanation because the biop stated that the hour exposure standard was only among a host of factors that had to be considered in determining the viability of the salmonid species.the court concluded 
while four days may seem arbitrary to a lay person,it is not the duty of the court to sit in judgment of scientific standards.the court also declines to the fisheries service decision to utilize this standard,ordinarily confined to laboratory tests,as part of its larger analysis in determination of effects.
on that basis,the court concluded that the assumption was not arbitrary and capricious.see a.
yet the district court failed to recognize that the fisheries service had to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action that demonstrates a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.satellite broadcasting commc ns ass fcc,cir alterations in original quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.rather than doing so,the court instead deferred to the agency and failed even to address whether there was any rational connection between the agency use of the hour laboratory exposure assumption and field conditions.
the fisheries service argues that while the biop does not explicitly discuss the basis for the assumption,the fisheri
