benson eziamaka onwuamaegbu appeals from the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his motion to reconsider its summary affirmance of an immigration judge decision,which refused to waive inadmissibility pursuant either to h or i of the immigration and nationality act ina.see ina h,i,h,i.we vacate the denial,and remand to the bia for written clarification of its grounds for summary affirmance.
background 
onwuamaegbu,a native and citizen of nigeria,came to the united states in the early on a temporary student visa.during,he i married a lawful permanent resident lpr ii was convicted of larceny by check in massachusetts and received a suspended sentence and iii applied for adjustment to lpr status based on his recent marriage to an lpr.in his application,however,onwuamaegbu falsely responded no to the question have you ever,in or outside the united states,been arrested,cited,charged,indicted,convicted,fined,or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance,including traffic violations in,onwuamaegbu was convicted on two occasions for forgery in new hampshire,and again received suspended sentences.nevertheless,onwuamaegbu was granted unconditional lpr status in.
at some point prior to march,onwuamaegbu took a trip of unknown duration to nigeria.upon returning to the united states,he was charged with inadmissibility by the immigration and naturalization service ins,based on his three prior convictions for crimes of moral turpitude,larceny by check and forgery,ina a a i i,a a i i,and for his willful misrepresentation regarding his massachusetts conviction in his application for adjustment of status,ina a c i,a c i.onwuamaegbu conceded removability,but contended that his deportation would result in extreme hardship to his family,and requested waivers of inadmissibility pursuant to ina h and i.
following a hearing,the immigration judge ij found onwuamaegbu removable under ina a a i i or a c i.although the ij determined that onwuamaegbu family would suffer extreme hardship if he were to be deported,she denied his request for a h and i waiver due to the fact that he had previously been admitted as an lpr,but had not accrued the requisite seven years of continuous lawful residence in the united states.onwuamaegbu appealed the ij decision to the bia,contending that the ij had erred in denying him a h or i waiver,given that i onwuamaegbu had achieved lpr status in ii the fact that he achieved that status by fraudulent means was not relevant to his entitlement to a h waiver iii he therefore had lived lawfully and continuously in the united states from to,more than the requisite seven years and iv his brief trip to nigeria could a matter of retolled the continuous residence requirement.in september,the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision.onwuamaegbu did not petition for review of that denial,electing instead to file a timely motion to reconsider the bia denial of his appeal.the bia denied the motion for reconsideration,and onwuamaegbu filed a timely petition for review.
discussiona.standard of review 
as onwuamaegbu filed no petition for review from the bia september denial of his appeal from the ij decision,and that denial became final after days we lack jurisdiction to review it.see b zhang ins,cir noting that the need to timely appeal is a strict jurisdictional requirement.rather,onwuamaegbu submitted a timely petition for review from only the bia january denial of his motion for reconsideration of the september bia decision.see b.although we have jurisdiction to review this bia decision,see nascimento ins,cir,our standard of review is more circumscribed than it otherwise would have been had onwuamaegbu petitioned for review from the bia denial of his appeal.we review the denial of a motion to reconsider only for abuse of discretion.see zhang,at see also esenwah ashcroft,cir noting that review of the bia denial of a motion for reconsideration is considerably more deferential than the ordinary standard that governs our review of agency decisions,cert.denied,d.in order to surmount this higher standard of review,onwuamaegbu must demonstrate that the bia denial was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as race.zhang,at citation omitted.
although we normally review bia decisions,and not ij decisions,we directly review the ij decision in this case because the bia summarily affirmed it.see stroni gonzales,cir.
removability pursuant to ina a a i i a c i 
first,onwuamaegbu asserts that the ij erred in ruling that he was removable due to his previous conviction for a crime of moral turpitude,the may massachusetts conviction for larceny by check,ina a a i i and that he had conceded that he was removable for failing to disclose that conviction in his september application for lawful permanent resident status,see ina a c i,a c i onwuamaegbu points out that,at the time of that conviction,the ina excepted convictions for a petty offense,see ina a,a repealed,and argues that his state conviction meets this criterion given that larceny by check is classified punishable as a misdemeanor under massachusetts law,see.laws ann.ch.he further contends that his failure to disclose this misdemeanor conviction on his lpr application was therefore,by definition,not material,hence not an additional ground for removability under a c i.
we need not address these questions,however,as onwuamaegbu failed to raise them before the bia,either by appeal from the ij decision,or in his motion for reconsideration.instead,he simply challenged the ij decision to deny him a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h and i,see infra.arguments not raised on appeal to the bia are deemed waived,for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see susanto gonzales,cir.
c.the section h waiver of inadmissibility 
next,onwuamaegbu challenges the ij determination that he was ineligible for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under ina h,which provides in pertinent part 
the attorney general may,in his discretion,waive inadmissibility 
b in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse,parent,son,or daughter of a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the alien denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien 
no waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien has not lawfully resided continuously in the united states for a period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the united states.
ina h b,h b emphasis added.hence,subsection invests the attorney general with the discretion to grant a waiver to an immigrant who demonstrates that his deportation will result in familial hardship,whereas subsection defines several subcategories of immigrants who are per se ineligible for this waiver even if they can establish extreme hardship.
the ij found that onwuamaegbu satisfied the extreme hardship criterion of h b,but went on to deny the waiver because onwuamaegbu i was an immigrant previously admitted for lawful permanent residence,and ii had not lawfully resided continuously in the united states for a period of not less than seven years.the ij noted that the bia had interpreted the unambiguous phrase previously admitted to refer to any immigrant who had in fact obtained lpr status,regardless of whether he had done so by lawful or unlawful means.see in re,wl,bia.thus,the ij noted that onwuamaegbu admission as an lpr in,even if he obtained that status by making a material misrepresentation in his application,satisfied the previously admitted criterion of h,and onwuamaegbu was therefore bound by the requirement that he must have lawfully resided continuously in the united states for at least seven years.the ij noted that onwuamaegbu was a returning alien in march,and therefore did not satisfy the
