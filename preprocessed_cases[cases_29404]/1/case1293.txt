henri kamenga ndibu petitions for review of a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia which affirmed the immigration judge conclusion that ndibu filed a frivolous asylum application and was therefore ineligible for adjustment of status.for the reasons that follow,we deny ndibu petition for review.
ndibu,a native and citizen of the democratic republic of the congo drc,entered the united states in september using a canadian passport that did not belong to him.in july,after evading the attention of immigration officials for nearly three years,ndibu filed an affirmative application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.ndibu claimed that he feared persecution on account of his political opinion were he to return to the congo.according to ndibu supporting affidavit,he was living in the drc in june when he was arrested by government security forces because of his membership in the army of victory church and participation in the let us save the congo movement.ndibu alleged that he was detained for days,during which time he was endur ing severe mistreatments,sexual abuses imposed over us by the police officers,and other types of tortures.
in september,the department of homeland security dhs placed ndibu in removal proceedings,charging him with removability for being present in the united states without valid documentation.see a a a a i i.at the removal hearing,ndibu testified and essentially repeated the claims he asserted in his affidavit.in april,the immigration judge denied ndibu relief from removal.the immigration judge concluded that ndibu failed to demonstrate that he filed his asylum claim within one year of entering the united states,finding that ndibu testimony that he arrived in the united states in was not credible and that he failed to present other evidence supporting an entry date of.the immigration judge offered specific reasons for its adverse credibility determination in this regard.additionally,the immigration judge concluded that ndibu failed to establish a clear probability of persecution and denied his claim for withholding of removal.singh holder,cir to prevail on his withholding of removal claim,the applicant must establish a clear probability of persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,political opinion,or membership in a particular social group.internal quotation marks omitted.in explaining her decision,the immigration judge implied that ndibu lacked credibility regarding his membership in the political organizations that he claimed to have belonged to,but did not provide specific reasons for doubting ndibu credibility in this regard.furthermore,the immigration judge stated that even if ndibu testimony had been credible regarding his political affiliations,the evidence still would have failed to demonstrate a a clear probability of persecution if he returned to the drc.and,finally,the immigration judge denied relief under the convention against torture cat,see c,stating summarily that ndibu failed to show that it would be more likely than not that ndibu would be tortured if he were removed to the drc.
ndibu appealed,and in april,the bia affirmed the denial of asylum,concluding that substantial evidence supported the immigration judge conclusion that ndibu failed to establish,through clear and convincing evidence,that his asylum application was filed within one year of his arrival in the united states.as to the immigration judge denial of withholding of removal and relief under the cat,however,the bia found the decision to be inadequate for purposes of our appellate review.the bia concluded that the immigration judge did not adequately explain the reasons for her adverse credibility finding as to ndibu political affiliation.the bia also rejected the alternative conclusion that ndibu evidence would have been insufficient even if ndibu testimony had been credible because the immigration judge failed to make a specific finding as to whether such past treatment,if credible,constituted persecution on account of a protected ground,and,if so,why the presumption of b would be overcome.thus,the bia remanded the matter for a more complete decision as to the withholding and cat claims.
in september,ndibu failed to appear before the immigration judge for the remanded proceedings,and he was ordered removed in absentia.in november,however,the immigration judge granted ndibu motion to reopen proceedings on the grounds that ndibu did not receive sufficient notice of the hearing following remand from the bia.
during the proceedings on the remanded claims for relief from removal,ndibu,represented by new counsel,applied for an adjustment of status on the basis of his marriage to a united states citizen in.see a.because an alien seeking to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident is in a position similar to that of an alien seeking entry into the united states,ferrans holder,cir,he is required to establish that he is admissible in the first place,see a.the admissibility requirement was problematic for ndibu,who admitted to the immigration court that he had previously sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud or by concealing or misrepresenting a material fact,in that he first entered the united states in using a canadian passport issued to charles legault and he made false statements to the immigration court so that he could obtain asylum.an alien is inadmissible who by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,seeks to procure or has sought to procure or has procured a visa,other documentation,or admission into the united states or other benefit provided under the ina.a c i.therefore,ndibu applied for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to i,which permits the attorney general,in her discretion,to waive the application of a c i in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse of a united states citizen.
at the waiver hearing,ndibu testified that he entered this country on september,using the aforementioned canadian passport which was obtained for him by his parents because they believed it was unsafe for then year old ndibu to remain in the drc.ndibu claimed that he did not want to enter the united states under false pretenses but eventually acceded to pressure from his parents.ndibu married his wife,a united states citizen,in december.he subsequently asked his brother,who enjoyed permanent legal resident status,to help him adjust his status.ndibu brother incorrectly advised him that the only way for him to obtain an adjustment of status was to apply for asylum,and referred ndibu to a friend named george,who was not a lawyer but prepared the asylum application for ndibu and helped him file it in.ndibu testified that george had concocted the facts supporting his asylum claim that he feared political persecution if he were to return to the drc,and ndibu admitted falsely testifying at the asylum hearing that he was tortured and sexually abused during his alleged detention.likewise,ndibu admitted to the court that his application falsely represented that he arrived in and that he signed the asylum application knowing that it was false.ndibu also acknowledged that he lied on the application by stating that he was not married 
ndibu nonetheless suggested to the immigration court that,despite having made a mistake in agreeing to submit a false asylum claim,he had otherwise lived as a member of the community and that he was worthy of a fraud waiver to enable him to adjust his status and remain in the united states with his family.
on may,the immigration judge issued an order denying ndibu applications for a waiver of inadmissibility and an adjustment of status.the immigration judge found that ndibu knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum,d,and deliberately fabricated material elements of his claim after having been advised of the consequences for so doing,citing.the court specifically noted that ndibu knew it was false when he claimed that he was tortured and sexually abused in the congo,even though the i asylum application ndibu signed expressly warned against filing a frivolous claim for asylum.as a consequence o
