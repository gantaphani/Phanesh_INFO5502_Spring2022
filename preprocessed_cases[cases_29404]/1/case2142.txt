washington nzeve,a citizen of zimbabwe,petitioned the united states for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.lorraine mapepa,nzeve wife,would qualify as a derivative beneficiary of any relief granted to nzeve.nzeve claims that he suffered past persecution and has a fear of future persecution on account of his involvement with the movement for democratic change mdc,a political party opposed to president mugabe zimbabwe african national front.the immigration judge ij denied each request.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the decisions,as do we.
background 
nzeve joined the mdc in.he had a membership card,attended meetings,and made contributions to the party,although he did not hold a leadership position.later in,nzeve traveled to the united states for two weeks to attend a church conference on aids and hiv awareness.when he returned home,members of the mdc informed nzeve that members of the ruling party were looking for him and threatening his life because they suspected that he went to the united states to raise money for the mdc.nzeve took the reported threat seriously and moved to his uncle house in a different town for a few weeks.however,nothing came of the threat and he was never confronted or directly threatened by the.nzeve continued his involvement with the mdc for several years without incident.
in early september,nzeve heard that the army had been conducting nighttime raids and assaulting mdc members in order to intimidate them before an upcoming parliamentary election.in response to this information,nzeve destroyed his mdc membership card and other evidence linking him to the mdc.on september,ten men in army uniforms arrived at nzeve house at around,asking to speak with him.nzeve is not sure whether the men were government soldiers or youth whom the government supplied with equipment.
when he identified himself,the men took nzeve inside his house,asked him questions pertaining to his affiliation with the mdc,including his trip to the united states,accused him of funding the opposition,and searched his house for materials linking him to the mdc.nzeve denied his affiliation with the mdc and the men found nothing inside the house linking him to the party.the men beat nzeve with batons,kicked him,struck him with the butt of a gun,and threatened to silence him forever if he did not change whatever he was doing with the mdc.nzeve incurred blisters on his buttocks and the bottom of his feet,and bruises on his back.
to be treated at the hospital,nzeve needed a police report documenting the incident.he called the police,but they told him that they could not attend to such petty matters.mapepa drove nzeve to his uncle house,and remained there for a few days to care for nzeve wounds.nzeve stayed with his uncle for approximately six months,during which time nzeve did not continue his activities with the mdc because he wanted to lay low and not to raise any suspicions.however,nzeve continued to work as a banker at the same bank he had worked at before the assault.he was not confronted again by the or any other group,and his family,some of whom continued to live in nzeve house,has not been harmed.
in march,nzeve left his uncle house and came to the united states on a visitor visa.mapepa followed nzeve to the united states shortly thereafter,also on a visitor visa.both overstayed their visas.two days after his visa expired,nzeve filed a petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.the ij denied the requested relief and ordered nzeve and mapepa removed from the united states.the ij found that nzeve experiences did not rise to the level of past persecution and that he did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.in a brief opinion,the bia affirmed the decision f or the reasons stated by the immigration judge,but granted nzeve and mapepa request for voluntary departure.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,nzeve argues that the ij and bia were wrong to deny his petition for asylum and withholding of removal.he claims that the totality of his experiences in zimbabwe constitutes past persecution and that he sufficiently demonstrated a fear of future persecution.specifically,nzeve claims that the ij failed to appropriately consider certain documents in the record reporting on abuse mdc members suffer in zimbabwe and the increased risk to returned asylum seekers,and that the ij applied the wrong standard of proof to his asylum claim.nzeve no longer pursues his claim under the convention against torture.
where,as here,the bia adopts the ij decision while supplementing the decision with its own reasoning,the ij decision,as supplemented by the bia decision,becomes the basis for review.we review the denials of asylum and withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard.under this deferential standard,we uphold the decision so long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.we will overturn the decision to deny relief only if the record compels a contrary result.

procedural matters 
before starting in earnest,we pause to address one procedural issue.the ij conducted the proceedings in this case via conference.the ij sat in chicago and all evidence and motions were filed in chicago,but the parties were in kansas city,missouri.nzeve correctly points out that the ij was wrong in deciding that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the eighth circuit and in applying some eighth circuit law.see b petition for review to be filed with court of appeals for the circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings see also ramos ashcroft,cir location of the court,not the litigants,determines where proceeding is completed.however,nzeve does not claim that this error caused him prejudice.
to be eligible for asylum,nzeve must prove that he is a refugee.b a.a refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a a c.b an applicant may qualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a fear of future persecution.nzeve carries the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum.a gonzales,cir.
nzeve first claims that the ij erred in finding that nzeve has not suffered past persecution.if an alien can prove that he suffered past persecution,he is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he also has a fear of future persecution.b.in deciding whether a petitioner experiences rise to the level of persecution,an ij must consider the record as a whole rather than addressing the severity of each evident in isolation,without considering its cumulative significance.tchemkou gonzales,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.
nzeve points to two incidents that he argues prove that he suffered past persecution when considered threat in and the assault in.threats can constitute past persecution only in the most extreme circumstances,such as where they are of a most immediate or menacing nature or if the perpetrators attempt to follow through on the threat.bejko gonzales,cir.nzeve was not threatened or confronted directly by the government or the in rather,members of the mdc informed him of the threat on his life.nothing came of the one came looking for him at his uncle house,where nzeve stayed for a few weeks,or at his house,where his family continued to live.and nzeve was able to continue supporting the mdc for several years without incident.so while we examine the totality of nzeve experiences,the threat simply does not contribute much to his case.
the heart of nzeve claim for past persecution is the assault he suffered in.past persecution may be shown through even a single episode of detention or physical abuse,if it is severe enough.nakibuka gonzales,cir.while it is distasteful to have to quantify suffering for the purposes
