stacy lewis appeals the district court decision upholding the social security administration denial of her application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.because the administrative law judge alj did not give appropriate weight to the opinions of lewis treating physicians and failed to adequately explain his decision to deny her benefits,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
on october,lewis filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income with the acting social security commissioner the commissioner,alleging a disability beginning on march,due to obesity,degenerative disc disease,degenerative joint disease thoracic outlet syndrome,diabetes mellitus,lupus,and depression with complaints of anxiety.because the commissioner denied lewis initial application and request for reconsideration,lewis requested a hearing before an alj.the hearing was granted,but the alj denied lewis applications.lewis then requested review by the appeals council,which was denied.at that point,the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner.
subsequently,lewis filed a complaint in district court against the commissioner pursuant to g.considering the parties for summary judgment,a united states magistrate judge issued a letter opinion observing that lewis is correct that,if the alj had credited her testimony,he likely would have concluded that she is unable to work.nevertheless,the magistrate judge ultimately denied lewis motion,granted the commissioner motion,and affirmed the commissioner final decision denying benefits.
lewis timely appealed,and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to and g.
to provide context for our consideration of this case,we begin with an overview of the sequential evaluation that aljs must follow when making disability determinations.the relevant social security administration regulations set forth a comprehensive process 
t he alj asks at step one whether the claimant has been working at step two,whether the claimant medical impairments meet the regulations severity and duration requirements at step three,whether the medical impairments meet or equal an impairment listed in the regulations at step four,whether the claimant can perform her past work given the limitations caused by her medical impairments and at step five,whether the claimant can perform other work.
mascio colvin,cir.see also a,a.the claimant bears the burden to make the requisite showing during the first four steps.monroe colvin.cir.if the claimant fails to carry that burden at any step,she is determined not to be disabled.if the claimant does meet her burden of proof,the burden then shifts to the commissioner at step five.id.at.the commissioner does not contest that lewis met her burden as to steps one and two,so we focus on steps three through five as those are most relevant to the issues before us.
if the claimant fails to demonstrate she has a disability that meets or medically equals a listed impairment at step three,the alj must assess the claimant residual functional capacity rfc before proceeding to step four,which is the most the claimant can still do despite her physical and mental limitations that affect h er ability to work.a,a.that determination requires the alj to first identify the individual functional limitations or restrictions and assess his or her abilities on a basis,including the functions listed in the regulations.mascio,at internal quotations omitted see also ssr,wl,at july.once the analysis is complete,an alj may define the claimant rfc in terms of the exertional levels of work,sedentary,light,medium,heavy,and very heavy.ssr,wl,at.see generally,defining sedentary,light,medium,heavy,and very heavy exertional requirements of work.
when assessing the claimant rfc,the alj must examine all of the claimant medically determinable impairments of which the alj is aware,a,a,including those not labeled severe at step two.mascio,at.in addition,he must consider all the claimant symptoms,including pain,and the extent to which her symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence,a,a.when the medical signs or laboratory findings show that the claimant has a medically determinable impairment s that could reasonably be expected to produce her symptoms,such as pain,the alj must then evaluate the intensity and persistence of the claimant symptoms so that the alj can determine how her symptoms limit her capacity for work.c,c.
after assessing the claimant rfc,the alj continues with the fourth step,where the claimant must establish she is unable to perform past work.mascio,at.if she meets her burden as to past work,the alj proceeds to step five.
at step five,the burden shifts to the commissioner to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the claimant can perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy,considering the claimant residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience.id.quoting a v,c.the commissioner typically offers this evidence through the testimony of a vocational expert responding to a hypothetical that incorporates the claimant limitations.id.if the commissioner meets this burden,the claimant is deemed not disabled and her benefits application is denied.id.
following this regulatory assignment of the burden of proof and evidentiary standards,we summarize the evidence before the alj as it relates to this appeal,including testimony and medical records,and then describe the alj reasoning in denying lewis benefits.
at the time of the alj hearing on august,lewis was years old.she testified that she has a in criminal justice and an employment history that included residential counselor at maryland sherriff youth ranch,deli worker,and store clerk.she reported that she stopped working as a residential counselor on march,when she was slated to be switched to an afternoon shift that would have exacerbated her diabetes.she claims she has been unable to work since then because of her combined medical impairments.
lewis reports a myriad of severe medical impairments,which include diabetes,with no neuropathy or failure,as well as lupus for which she takes prednisone as she experiences symptom flares,though it has been in remission since august.she has a bulge on one of her lumbar disks,which causes her to walk with a limp at times and to experience tingling and numbing down the back of her left leg.in addition,lewis has autoimmune anemia,which is generally under control.she further experiences pain in her left arm from thoracic outlet syndrome that causes her left hand to have tremors and to go numb.lewis describes the pain as stabbing,burning,tingling pain and throbbing pain in her back,as well as pain that is constant in her arm,and prevents her from sleeping at night.she also has mental impairments,including depression and anxiety,for which she takes medication.
these severe medical impairments significantly limit her ability to do basic work activities.lewis stated she can lift approximately five pounds with her left hand and fifteen to twenty pounds with her right,but can sit for no more than thirty minutes before experiencing pain in her shoulder and the back of her neck.she has a driver license and her own car,which she can drive short distances,about five to miles at least five times per week,but she can only go grocery shopping with assistance.
in addition to lewis testimony,the alj called a vocational expert ve to testify at the administrative hearing.in questioning the ve,the alj described a hypothetical individual possessing the same limitations as lewis.the ve testified that such a hypothetical person could not perform any of lewis past relevant work.however,the ve testified that there were jobs in the national economy that such a person could perform and specifically identified jobs of operator,surveillance monitor,and charge account clerk.
when questioned by lewis attorney,the ve testified that if the hypothetical person needed to walk away from her work station and be off task for more than ten percent of the time then she would not be able to maintain employment.the alj then inquired as to whether a hypothetical person could maintain employment if they had lewis ailments and must rest ten minutes every two hours.the ve stated that under those circumstances the hypothetical individual would not be able to maintain employment.
in addition to the testimonial evidence,the administrative record contains medical records from several of lewis treating physicians,including shahid mahmood,who has treated lewis since.mahmood medical opinion noted that lewis could sit for up to two hours and for three hours in a normal competitive work environment.he further opined that she can rarely lift ten pounds,that her condition impairs her ability to keep her neck in a constant position,that she can not,can tolerate only low stress work,and would need to be absent from work three times per month.mahmood further stated that the diagnosis and prognosis of lewis pain is unknown,that she reports her pain as ten out of ten,and that she is not a malingerer.mahmood also noted that she was taking medications that included lidoderm patches,fentanyl patches,and oxycodone.
evidence from lewis treating rheumatologist,ashok jacob,is also in the administrative record.jacob noted lewis has bilateral arthritis in her hands,wrists,and shoulders pericarditis pleuritic,hemolytic anemia leukopenia and systemic lupus.he noted she can sit for two hours and for up to one hour in a competitive work environment,and she can occasionally lift or carry up to five pounds,but she experiences constant pain that interferes with her attention and concentration.he further stated that she is incapable of performing even low stress jobs,as stress increases frequency of flares.jacob noted lewis would need to be absent from work more than three times per month,but is not a malingerer,and she will experience severe pain,swelling,stiffness and fatigue throughout her body making daily functions very difficult for the rest of her lifetime.
lewis underwent additional examinations with state agency medical and psychological consultants,who concluded that she was limited to light work activity with postural,manipulative,environmental,and mental restrictions.
the alj decision was issued in august and determined that lewis was not disabled during the relevant period.the alj found that lewis met her burden at step one to show she had not been working since the onset of the disability.at step two,he found that lewis had the following severe,medically determinable impairments obesity,degenerative disc disease,degenerative joint outlet syndrome,diabetes mellitus,lupus,and depression with complaints of anxiety.
at step three,the alj determined that none of lewis impairments,alone or in combination,met or medically equaled any of the listed impairments.the alj then assessed lewis rfc and determined she could perform light work,except that 
t he claimant can lift pounds frequently and occasionally with her dominant right upper extremity,but she can lift five pounds frequently and occasionally with her left upper extremity.the claimant can push and pull with her bilateral upper extremities five pounds frequently and occasionally.the claimant is limited to jobs with no overhead work with her left arm,and her reaching ability with left arm,both laterally and in front,is limited to occasionally.furthermore,she is limited to no more than occasional fine and gross dexterity with the left arm and hand.lewis is limited to work in an inside environment without excessive heat,cold,or humidity.she requires jobs that allow her to change positions once per hour.finally,lewis is limited to simple routine tasks,with positions that allow her to be off task about of the time,rest for minutes every two hours,and miss eight days of work per year.
this assessment conflicted with lewis testimony regarding her symptoms and resulting functional limitations.while the alj found lewis claimed symptoms reasonably could be expected to be caused by her impairments,the alj nevertheless determined that lewis statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible because the objective findings of the claimant treating and examining sources do not support the severity of assessed restrictions that lewis has alleged.
the alj analysis regarding lewis chronic pain in her upper left extremity bears particular relevance to the issues on appeal.as to that impairment,the alj stated 
t he medical evidence documents the claimant long history of shoulder and upper extremity pain.lewis has undergone several surgical procedures in the course of her treatment regimen including a carpal tunnel release,left de quervain tenosynovitis release,and decompression of the left ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel.in late,the claimant underwent several procedures to treat thoracic outlet syndrome,including a left first rib resection.in early,she was diagnosed with lupus and prescribed medications to control the acute symptoms.however,the record reflects that the claimant recovered from her procedures without incident or acute complication.the claimant testified that her lupus has been in remission since august of.physical examinations noted ongoing complaints of pain however,there was muscle strength in all major muscle groups,normal sensation and reflexes,and no evidence of acute range of motion irregularities.
the state agency consultants concluded that the claimant is limited to light work activity with postural,manipulative,environmental,and mental restrictions.the undersigned gives these opinions limited weight,because the longitudinal record supports additional exertional and restrictions.
the alj then summarized the findings of mahmood and jacob described above.the undersigned gives these opinions partial weight,because the severity of assessed exertional and limitations is not entirely consistent with the longitudinal conservative treatment record,the documented clinical and examination findings,and lewis stated ongoing capabilities.
with regard to the functional limits resulting from lewis obesity,degenerative disc disease,diabetes mellitus,lupus,and,the alj found that they were consistent with her rfc.
at step four,taking into account lewis rfc,the alj determined she was unable to perform her past work.however,relying on the testimony of the ve,the alj found that jobs did exist in the national economy for a person with lewis age,education,work experience,and rfc.accordingly,the alj concluded that lewis was not disabled and denied her application for benefits.
section g of title of the united states code provides judicial review of the social security commissioner denial of social security benefits.when examining a disability determination,a reviewing court is required to uphold the determination when an alj has applied correct legal standards and the alj factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.g bird comm r of soc.sec,cir.
on appeal,lewis contends the alj failed to satisfactorily explain his decision not to credit her subjective complaints of chronic,pain in her upper left extremity.disputes over the role of subjective evidence in proving pain are nothing new.this circuit has battled the commissioner for many years over how to evaluate a disability claimant subjective complaints of pain.mickles shalala,cir.hall,concurring.under the regulations implementing the social security act,an alj follows a analysis when considering a claimant subjective statements about impairments and symptoms.b c,b c.first,the alj looks for objective medical evidence showing a condition that could reasonably produce the alleged symptoms.id.b,b.second,the alj must evaluate the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of the claimant symptoms to determine the extent to which they limit the claimant ability to perform basic work activities.id.c,c.the second determination requires the alj to assess the credibility of the claimant statements about symptoms and their functional effects.id.c,c.
the parties agree that the alj properly found that lewis met the requirements of the first step in the analysis,that lewis medically determinable
