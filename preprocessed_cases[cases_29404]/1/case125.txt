background 
there are two major political parties in puerto rico the pdp and the new progressive party npp.when control of the government changes parties,e ntirely too often,the political party assuming office terminates the employment of public employees who are affiliated with the party going out of power and then fills those vacancies with its own members.sanchez lopez fuentespujols,cir.similarly,the outgoing party attempts to secure the continued tenure of its members in public jobs through a variety of devices,such as reclassifying appointments as career positions or making appointments in violation of puerto rico law.id.
reyes pérez is a pdp activist,from a family of,former public figures in that party.following his graduation from law school,he went to work as a legal advisor to pdp member sila calderón,of puerto rico.in march,immediately after working for calderón,reyes pérez accepted a trust position as the contracting director of the sifc.this was his first job with responsibilities in contracting for goods and services.
in february,as part of a larger restructuring of the sifc under a pdp administration and in advance of a november election,reyes pérez position was reclassified from a trust to a career position.reyes pérez position was one of three that were reclassified from trust to career positions during this reorganization 
in the november elections,the npp gained control of the executive branch of government in puerto rico.in january,zoimé álvarez rubio,an npp activist,was appointed as the new sifc administrator.on january,with the approval of the sifc board of directors,álvarez rubio undertook several investigative audits to determine whether her predecessor reorganization conformed with the new administration view of local laws 
álvarez rubio ordered a comprehensive audit of all of the sifc personnel transactions that took place during.the stated purpose of this investigation was to ensure that all of the relevant personnel actions complied with applicable rules and regulations.in particular,the investigation focused on compliance with the merit principle,which is mandated by puerto rico law,laws ann.tit.the merit principle is expressed in various forms in the sifc employee manual,and is intended to ensure open competition for positions at the sifc.
saúl rivera rivera,then the director of the human resources department,headed the investigation.after a review of the personnel files of sifc employees,the investigation concluded that files chronicled personnel transactions that violated article of the employee manual.under article,which reflects the merit principle,the sifc is required to fill available positions through open competition that allows individuals from outside the sifc to compete for the jobs.the sifc internal investigation found that these cases violated article because positions were filled via internal job announcements rather than public postings.
also in,the sifc undertook a second evaluation of personnel actions,this time focusing on the three reclassifications including plaintiff from trust to career positions this type of reclassification is governed by article of sifc employee manual,which states that in order to preserve the merit principle,reclassification of a trust position to a career position is only authorized when there is a change in the position functions or when there is a change in sifc organizational structure.further,if an occupied position is reclassified,the current holder of that position must meet several requirements,including meeting the established qualification requirements for the position class receiving a certification from the administrator or his authorized representative certifying that the employee qualifications and services are adequate and passing or having passed the exam required for the position class.as it is relevant here,the career position of director of contracting requires,inter alia,five years of experience in the contracting area.
this audit investigation,which was conducted by an external human resources consultant,josé miguel álvarez,concluded that all three reclassifications from trust to career positions,including plaintiff,violated the merit principle for failing to comply with any of the requirements of article.as to the experience requirement,plaintiff only experience in contracting was during his tenure at the sifc,which began on march.at the time his position was reclassified in,he plainly did not have the five years of experience that the employee manual required as to the other qualifications,álvarez audit report found that plaintiff personnel file contained no evidence that he had received the required certification from the administrator nor that he had taken or passed the required exam.
the audit report recommended annulling each of the three reclassifications for failure to comply in any way with article.following administrator álvarez rubio approval of the audit report recommendations,the sifc human resources department began notifying those who would be affected.to this end,on march,plaintiff received a letter notifying him of álvarez rubio intent to nullify the reclassification and to return the contracting director role to a trust position.the letter further explained that because plaintiff had held what was properly characterized as a trust rather than a career position,he had no right to reinstatement.
plaintiff requested and received an administrative hearing to contest this determination.in late april,the official examiner agreed with the sifc determination that the reclassification violated the merit principle,and accordingly agreed that the nullification of that reclassification was proper.álvarez rubio adopted this finding,and notified reyes pérez of this conclusion in a letter dated april.because he had no right to reinstatement,plaintiff was dismissed from his position the letter from álvarez rubio informed plaintiff of his right to appeal this outcome to the sifc board of appeals.he did not appeal.
procedural history 
on january,reyes pérez filed this suit in the district of puerto rico against sifc and several defendants in their individual and official capacities,alleging that he was terminated from his position at sifc because of his political association in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments 
the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that there was no evidence in the record that supported a prima facie case of political discrimination,and that even if plaintiff could make a prima facie showing,his claim fails under the healthy doctrine.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.
the district court assumed arguendo that plaintiff made a prima facie showing of political discrimination,but concluded that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the basis of their healthy defense in any event reyes perez state ins.fund,wl,at.plaintiff then filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the district court had committed clear legal error.the district court summarily denied that motion,reyes perez state ins.fund,wl,and plaintiff now appeals.
it is axiomatic that the first amendment protects nonpolicymaking public employees from adverse employment actions based on their political affiliation or opinion.vélez rivera agosto alicea,cir quoting gonzálezpiña rodríguez,cir.we evaluate political discrimination claims using a approach.
first,the plaintiff must show that his political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.padilla garcía guillermo rodriquez,cir.once made,the defendant may then rebut that showing with what is commonly referred to as the healthy defense by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the governmental agency would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected conduct.díaz bigio santini,cir quoting guilloty perez pierluisi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the healthy defense is rooted in causation even after plaintiff makes a prima facie case,it is insufficient to establish discrimination as a matter of law because the plaintiff case at that point does not distinguish between a result caused by a constitutional violation and one not so caused.sanchez lopez fuentes pujols,cir alteration in original quoting healthy,at.
we assume dubitante that plaintiff has set forth an adequate prima facie case.we proceed to defendants healthy defense,and conclude that they are entitled to summary judgment on that basis.
first,plaintiff plainly lacked the required years of experience in the contracting sector for the career position of contracting director.his attempts to argue to the contrary fall flat at the time the reclassification of his position occurred,the record is clear that he had not been employed there for five years,and that was his first formal employment experience working in contracting.chats about contracting at family barbeques with his uncle do not fill the gap.on that basis alone,plaintiff elevation to a career position was plainly in violation of puerto rico merit principle,as expressed in article of the employee manual.sanchez lopez,at describing illegality of an appointment as a neutral basis on which to base an employment action.
we have said that simply showing that an appointment was illegal under local law does not suffice to meet defendants healthy burden,id.at,so our inquiry continues.here,defendants put forward sufficient other evidence to show that regardless of plaintiff political affiliation,they would have reclassified his contracting director position and would have done so for a legitimate reason.that is sufficient to establish a healthy defense.see soto padró pub.bldgs,cir.
the larger reversion of the sifc organizational structure to its status was not spearheaded by administrator álvarez rubio acting independently.rather,it was approved by the sifc board of directors.see id.affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants in a political discrimination case where a government entity governing board had greenlighted the restructuring plan.
additionally,the accompanying audit of the sifc was not one that was targeted exclusively at plaintiff particular corner of the organization,but rather was an investigation that included the review of well over employment files to ensure compliance with the merit principle.there is no evidence that this audit targeted individuals from a particular party.see sanchez lopez,at.
both audits were geared toward positions,not persons.soto padró,at.the second investigation was targeted at all three of the positions that had been reclassified from trust to career positions in.at the close of his investigation,álvarez,the external consultant,provided the sifc administrator with a detailed report as to each position lack of compliance with article,and likewise recommended that all three position reclassifications be annulled.plaintiff has not proffered any evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the audit report findings were based on political considerations,or that there was differential treatment of the individuals that held the other two improperly reclassified positions.
the record is quite clear that during,the sifc underwent a comprehensive organizational restructuring,which included the identification and correction of various employmentrelated transactions that violated puerto rico merit principle.
if the defendant succeeds in carrying its burden of persuasion as to its healthy defense,the plaintiff may then discredit the proffered nondiscriminatory reason,either circumstantially or directly,by adducing evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor.padilla garcía,at.here,plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that undermines defendants proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for his reclassification and later termination.see cepero rivera fagundo,cir.defendants healthy defense ends the matter.
the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants is affirmed.
the other two positions were associate director of education and development and special assistant 
plaintiff attempted to refute the fact of this reorganization,in part by alleging that because plaintiff was not formally informed of the organizational change,it did not take place.we agree with the district court that this attempt to deny the fact of the reorganization fails,and so we do not credit it.
this investigation was undertaken in part because there had been various complaints filed before the sifc board of appeals by sifc managerial employees protesting these reclassifications.
plaintiff initially attempted to argue that he had previously provided legal advice in matters relating to the contracting of goods and services to pediatrix medical group following his graduation from law school in.however,both plaintiff and pediatrix representative ultimately admitted that plaintiff was never officially employed in that capacity,and that any legal advice provided was given in an unofficial capacity during family reunions and other social events,since pediatrix president was plaintiff uncle.
plaintiff relies heavily on an august,letter signed by former administrator carlos ruiz nazario and former head of human resources louis villahermosa that stated that plaintiff met all the position requirements,in addition to complying with article of the sifc employees manual.this reliance is misplaced.even if we were to credit plaintiff assertion that this letter met the certification requirement of article,the letter can not undermine defendants showing that plaintiff in fact did not possess the required five years of argument that his substantive qualifications are disputed issues of fact because there were certain documents missing from his personnel file fails for largely the same reason.as the district court correctly observed,t he fact that a piece of paper is missing from a file does not controvert defendants statement that plaintiff lacked the requisite experience for the position.reyes perez state ins.fund,wl,at.
following the nullification,the position of contract director was returned to its original classification as a trust position.
reyes pérez also alleged a due process claim,along with several pendent state law claims under puerto rico law.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion as to those claims,and plaintiff does not renew them on appeal.
the district court repeatedly voiced its frustration with plaintiff fail ure to comply with the applicable rules governing summary judgment practice in this district.reyesperez,wl,at see also id.at.in several instances,the plaintiff failure to properly controvert defendants factual assertions led the district court to deem cer
