in this erisa action,ashton haus haus sued the,bechtel jacobs company,llc.bechtel jacobs,seeking to enforce and clarify his rights under four employee benefit plans the health and welfare plan for employees of bechtel jacobs company,llc and subcontractors plan i,the bechtel jacobs company,llc pension plan for grandfathered employees plan ii,the bechtel jacobs company,llc severance plan for grandfathered employees plan iii,and the management and integration plan plan iv in his suit,the alleged that the court should clarify his rights to future benefits under the four plans by deeming him eligible to receive certain pension plan benefits only made available to a limited group of employees classified by bechtel jacobs as grandfathered employees.
the district court ultimately found in favor of the,holding that haus is entitled to grandfathered employee status.the court reached this conclusion,however,only after first finding that the bechtel jacobs plan administrator acted reasonably in interpreting the plans eligibility requirements so as to deny the the status of a grandfathered employee.specifically,the district court held that the was eligible notwithstanding the plan administrators reasonable determination to the contrary because the relied on conflicting summary plan descriptions spd.
with this appeal,bechtel jacobs seeks reversal of this decision,arguing that no conflict exists between the summary plan descriptions and the plans,and the is not entitled to benefits based purely upon a violation of the summary plan description disclosure requirements contained in erisa.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the district court.
background 
prior to the spring of,the worked for lockheed martin energy systems lockheed,which held an operating contract with the united states department of energy to perform environmental management and enrichment facilities work at the paducah gaseous diffusion plant.upon the department of energy switching the operational structure of the diffusion plant,bechtel jacobs took over as the primary contractor for the plant on april.as part of this operational transition,the doe contract required bechtel jacobs to develop a transition plan which,among other things,would provide transitioned employees with the opportunity to participate in a pension plan and a health and welfare plan.
haus left his job with lockheed on march,and began work with entech corporation,a subcontractor to bechtel jacobs,on april.haus continued to work at entech through july,at which point he transitioned to another bechtel jacobs subcontractor,camp dresser mckee federal programs.on july,haus began direct employment with bechtel jacobs.
beginning with a december,letter sent to bechtel jacobs human resources department,haus repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought to confirm his status as a grandfathered employee eligible for the benefit plans created by the.on march,the then initiated the instant action,arguing that he is a grandfathered employee and therefore is eligible for the benefit plans.each of the four plans describe their qualification requirements for grandfathered status somewhat differently,but both parties agree that e ach plan shares a common first requirement which includes employment by lmes lockheed on march and that the satisfies that requirement.the parties dispute therefore revolves around the plans second requirement all four plans require an individual to have worked for bechtel jacobs or one of its first or subcontractors between,and april.additionally,plan i contains language that suggests that eligibility requires employment with a first or subcontractor engaged in specific workforce transition areas.
in its brief to the district court,the argued that the decision to deny him grandfathered status was arbitrary and capricious and that the plan did not sufficiently apprise haus of his rights under the relevant benefit plans.in response,bechtel jacobs disputed the claims,saying that the plan administrator eligibility determination was not arbitrary and capricious and both the plans and their corresponding summaries amply apprised haus of his rights.finding in favor of the,the district court held that although bechtel jacobs plan administrator acted reasonably in interpreting the plans eligibility requirements,haus was nonetheless entitled to benefits because the relied on conflicting summary plan descriptions.
ii.legal standard 
under firestone tire rubber bruch,d,a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.here,the district court found bechtel jacobs plans gave its administrators such fiduciary discretion.we review a district court determination regarding the proper standard to apply in its review of a plan administrator decision de novo.hoover provident life accident ins,cir.neither party suggests the plans do not give discretion to the plans administrators.
when plans give discretion,we apply the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.borda hardy,lewis,pollard,page,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.a plan administrator decision will not be deemed arbitrary and capricious so long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome.davis.fin.ret.plan,cir noting that t he arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review.
iii.analysis 
with this appeal,bechtel jacobs argues that the district court erred in finding that the is entitled to benefits under the relevant benefit plans notwithstanding the fact that bechtel jacobs contrary interpretation of plan eligibility requirements was reasonable.specifically,the argues that the district court erred in holding that the was entitled to benefits based upon conflicting language in the summary plan descriptions,arguing that no conflict exists between the summary plan descriptions and the plans,and the is not entitled to benefits based purely upon a violation of the summary plan description disclosure requirements contained in erisa.we address the basis for the district court decision and the arguments below.
validity of interpretation of plan eligibility requirements 
as an initial matter,we consider whether the district court erred in grudgingly determining that the interpretation of the four plans eligibility criteria was reasonable under the applicable arbitrary and capricious standard of review.haus claimed entitlement to retirement benefits under four bechtel jacobs plans.the dispute here revolves around the eligibility requirements under the plans,which are only available to grandfathered employees.each plan describes the qualification requirements for grandfathered status differently,but neither party disputes that e ach plan shares a common first requirement which includes employment by lmes lockheed on march,nor that the satisfies this requirement.accordingly,the issue before the court here revolves around the second requirement for grandfathered status.
with respect to this second eligibility prong,the language contained in each plan differs somewhat,although the requirements in plans are extremely similar.textually the plans all require an individual to have worked for bechtel jacobs or one of its first or subcontractors between,and april.additionally,plan i contains language that suggests that eligibility requires employment with a first or subcontractor engaged in specific workforce transition areas.neither plan ii,plan iii,nor plan iv contain comparable language.nonetheless,the has interpreted each plan to include this more restrictive second eligibility prong.
in evaluating the creative interpretation of plans eligibility criteria,the district court clearly articulated its belief that such an interpretation strained the plain meaning of such plans text.nonetheless,the district court ultimately found that the interpretation was reasonable since extrinsic evidence in the record indicated that the narrower definition found in plan i was the one bechtel and the department of energy meant to employ when dealing with the various subcontractors.although the court agrees that an erisa administrator interpretations are entitled to substantial deference,we find that the interpretation of the eligibility requirements in plans are unreasonable.
even in plan i,the requirement that grandfathered status requires employment with a subcontractor in specific workforce transition areas is less than clear.plan i text does specify,however,that an employee must be employed for work in a regular staffing plan position,which in turn is defined as a regular,position identified on an eligible subcontractor staffing plan,exhibit h,c form b appendix 
plans contain no similar language,requiring at most that an employee be employed for work under the doe contract and appellant nowhere disputes that haus worked under the doe contract specifically,plan ii states that a grandfathered employee is an individual who is employed,after march,and before april,by a company under department of energy contract.plan iii also requires employment with a first or subcontractor for work under the contract prior to april,and defines contract as simply the doe contract with no other relevant definitions.similarly,plan iv only requires employment during the relevant time period by either bechtel jacobs company llc or its or subcontractors for work under this contract.
in arguing that plan i eligibility criteria applies to all four plans,the says that the eligibility requirements contained in plans are somewhat ambiguous and that its administrator interpretation resolving that ambiguity is entitled to substantial deference.see wulf quantum chemical,cir the language is ambiguous if it is subject to two reasonable interpretations.we agree that erisa administrators are entitled to substantial deference,but find that no ambiguity exists regarding the eligibility requirements conveyed by the text in plans.no language in any plan other than plan i mentions specific workforce transition areas.indeed,no language in plans even hints at such a requirement.accordingly,we find that the application of plan i stringent eligibility requirements to each any text that even remotely supports such a arbitrary and capricious.
the dissent disagrees with this determination and says that the court review of the eligibility determination in this case is more searching than is allowable under the applicable standard of review.given that the documents for each separate plan completely fail to support bechtel contention that haus employment with entech and cdc did not fall under the doe contract,we can only assume that the dissent would object to any review failing to the plan administrator eligibility determination.we would respectfully suggest that some meaningful review is not only allowable,but required.
the dissent particularly objects to our observation,based in part upon statements made at oral argument,that the concedes that haus performed work under the blanket doe contract,identified in the plan materials as.specifically,the dissent points to an exchange during rebuttal argument to support the proposition that haus may have performed work at the paducah,kentucky site not covered by the blanket doe contract.at best,however,the exchange cited by the dissent makes clear that there is no evidence in the record to refute the assertion that the blanket doe contract covered the work he performed.it is possible that work not covered by the blanket doe contract took place at the paducah,kentucky site,but if it did the record is silent on that point.
moreover,this issue is largely beside the point as the crux of bechtel argument has never been that haus was working under either some mysterious contract or a distinct but unidentified doe contract.rather,the any support in the eligibility under all four plans requires a showing that an individual performed a specific type of work under the blanket doe contract.the dissent considers this interpretation valid.we disagree and therefore find the interpretation of plans eligibility requirements arbitrary and capricious.
conflict between summary plan descriptions and plans 
in challenging the district court judgment,bechtel jacobs argues that no conflict exists between the relevant benefit plans and their corresponding summary plan descriptions.because the interpretation of plans was arbitrary and capricious,we need not discuss whether a conflict did in fact exist between those plans and their respective summary plan descriptions.the accuracy of the argument is nonetheless significant with respect to plan i because this court has previously held that where statements made in summary plan descriptions conflict with statements made in the plans themselves,the summary plan descriptions are controlling.edwards state farm mutual automobile insurance,cir see also helwig,cir.in edwards,the defendant sought to deny an employee disability benefits through a relatively straightforward application of the eligibility criteria contained in the actual plan.because that criteria directly conflicted with the eligibility information contained in the summary plan description,however,we held that the defendant could not deny the plaintiff disability benefits because statements in a summary plan are binding and if such statements conflict with those in the plan itself,the summary shall govern.at.
the principle underlying our decision in edwards,and the summary plan disclosure obligations contained in erisa,is ultimately one of pragmatic fairness.when an employer distributes a document that purports to summarize an employee benefit information,a lay beneficiary should logically be able to rely on that summary rather than combing through the often nearly incomprehensible plan itself.accordingly,a summary plan must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.a.where an employer fails to satisfy the disclosure obligations contained in section,such that the information contained in a summary plan description is in conflict with that of the plan itself,it is logical that the courts enforce the terms of the summary plan.moreover,such a rule comports with the legislative intent underlying erisa,which makes clear that,i t is grossly unfair to hold an employee accountable for acts which disqualify him from benefits,if he had no knowledge of these acts,or if these conditions were stated in a misleading or incomprehensible manner in the plan booklets,reprinted in cong.
with this appeal,bechtel jacobs contends that edwards is inapplicable here because no conflict exists between the relevant benefit plans and their corresponding summary plan descriptions.specifically,bechtel jacobs argues that although textual conflicts do exist between the four plans,no conflict exists between any individual plan and its corresponding summary plan description.the court need not address the efficacy of the argument with respect to plans,given that the administrator interpretation of those plans was arbitrary and capricious in this case,but we nonetheless note that on its face such an argument appears misplaced.where one interprets plans to include plan i more stringent eligibility is necessary for the to exclude the from participation in the clear conflict exists between each plan as interpreted and its summary plan description.moreover,such a conflict implicates the same concerns as those addressed by this court in edwards.
erisa explicitly requires that employers craft summary plan descriptions so as to reasonably apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.a.moreover,although a summary need not include every detail of the thing it summarizes,the underlying plan should include all important items in the summary.coleman aegon insurance group,d,quoting sprague general motors,cir en banc see also layaou xerox,cir employees are entitled to rely on the spds as their primary source of information about their benefits.here,the summaries for plans seemingly fail to meet these requirements given the sharp conflict between their language and the interpretation of the plans.as we noted in edwards,where a conflict exists between the information contained in a summary plan description and the plan itself,the resulting ambiguity severely disadvantages plan participants.indeed,in edwards we noted that the defendant should have realized that the explicit language of the summary could or would have caused the plaintiff and similarly situated unsophisticated lay employees to rely upon the employer inadvertant sic misrepresentation to their detriment.edwards,at.
although the instant case differs somewhat from edwards in that the language contained in plans and their respective summaries are similar,the conflict between the plans as interpreted and their corresponding summaries presents the same dangers described above.just as in edwards,the should have realized that lay beneficiaries such as haus would rely on the language contained in the plan summaries distributed by bechtel jacobs.moreover,as in edwards haus did indeed rely on the summary plan descriptions to his determent both in agreeing to terminate his employment with lockheed on march,and in failing to investigate whether his employment with a bechtel jacobs subcontractor would qualify him for benefits under the respective plans.as such,even if the administrator interpretation with respect to plans had not been arbitrary and capricious,the likely would have prevailed based upon the conflict between those plans as interpreted and their respective summary plan descriptions.
with respect to plan i,we find no indication that the spd for plan i was included in the appendix in this appeal or was included in the record before the district court.because this precludes us from determining whether a conflict existed between plan i eligibility requirements and its summary descriptions,the court vacates and remands to the district court for review of plan i spd to determine whether it conflicts with that plan.
finally,the argues that this court should reverse the district court holding that a violation of erisa disclosure obligations can serve,in and of itself,as the basis for awarding an employee plan benefits.we reject this argument first because the district court simply never articulated such a rule.to the contrary,the district court explicitly relied on edwards as the basis for its decision,although it did note that the ambiguity between the respective plans made the injury to the even more grievous.the ambiguity between the four plans respective definitions of the term grandfathered employee undoubtedly did create confusion for the and other lay beneficiaries,but did not serve as the basis for the district court decision.additionally,this argument is also without force as to plans in light of this court holding that the plan administrator interpretation of those plans was arbitrary and capricious.as such,we again reject the argument.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,this court affirms in part and reverses in part the decision of the district court.
i write separately because i view the record differently than the majority does,and with due adherence to the law,i conclude that the district court was in error and that error warrants reversal.accordingly,i must respectfully dissent.
until march,ashton haus worked for lockheed martin energy systems lmes,which operated the paducah kentucky gaseous diffusion plant under a contract with the department of energy doe.on april,the contract expired and bechtel jacobs company llc replaced lmes as the primary contractor under environmental management contract no.doe,the contract.according to the excerpts in the record,this contract describes the specific environmental services that bechtel would provide to doe at several of its facilities,including the paducah gaseous diffusion plant.
on april,haus began work with a subcontractor to bechtel,and therefore,was not transferred to bechtel payroll,as his coworkers had been.haus worked for one contractor entech and then another camp dresser mckee before gaining direct employment with bechtel on july.bechtel has asserted,repeatedly and from the very outset of this dispute with haus,that entech did not perform any work,particular environmental projects under this doe contract and,although cdm did assume and perform certain projects,haus did not actually work on those projects himself.
when bechtel took over from lmes,the contract required bechtel to develop and implement a transition plan by which lmes incumbent workforce would be transferred to bechtel or its subcontractors,effective april.these employees were entitled to continuation of accumulated benefits,grandfathering under certain pension,healthcare,severance,or k plans.this grandfathered status meant that when these transitioned employees began employment with their new employers,bechtel or its subcontractors,such as entech and cdm these transitioned employees would participate in the transition plans,rather than a plan or plans offered by the new employer their accumulated service time with lmes would be credited toward those transition plans and they would continue to accumulate benefits under the transition plans as if there had been no discontinuation of employment with lmes,they would not start accumulating benefits at zero or be forced into a new plan.
by his own admission,haus voluntarily resigned from lmes on march,to take a preferred position with entech,and he was,therefore,not part of the transition program.during his two years at entech and cdm april,to july,haus did not work on projects and was not part of the transition program,and therefore,he never sought to participate in the transition plans,to accumulate time towards those plans,or to be classified as an lmes grandfathered employee.haus stated in an email to bechtel 
i was eligible for transition on.i then worked for a bjc st tier subcontractor,and now for bjc.i do not understand why i can not receive credit for time spent with lmes prior to and the subsequent time now spent employed by bjc.i am not asking for time credit earned while working with tier subcontractors,i am only asking for the years employed with lmes and now the months and counting spent with bjc.
emphasis added.this undermines the supposition that haus was working under the contract while employed by entech and cdm,or that bechtel could not prove that haus was not working under the contract,or that,as an unsophisticated lay employee,he might have mistakenly assumed that he was working under the contract.haus was neither unsophisticated,nor confused,nor misled into thinking he was working under the contract.while others have suggested otherwise,haus knew all along that his employment with entech and cdm did not count as work under the contract.moreover,bechtel has insisted consistently and continuously since the very beginning of the dispute that haus employment with entech and cdm did not fall under the contract.
on july,haus began direct employment with bechtel,and later circa december,he sought for the first time to be classified as a grandfathered employee under the employee benefit plans arising from the transition.there are four separate plans,and as a practical matter,haus was actually seeking grandfathered status as to only one plan,the pension plan.as evidenced by the correspondence in the record,haus really just wanted his time with lmes,or cdm to be aggregated with his time at bechtel,and all of it applied toward his total pension benefits under a pension plan.bechtel disagreed with his claim to grandfathered status and explained to him that the doe contract also prevented his attaining such status.
in an effort to overrule this decision by bechtel plan administrator,haus sued bechtel in federal district court,pursuant to erisa a b,a b.in his complaint,he urged the court to declare him a grandfathered employee in some unspecified defined benefit plan,based on the definition of grandfathered employee contained in bechtel employee handbook,which he quoted in his complaint and appended thereto.haus basically claimed that bechtel decision to deny him grandfathered status was arbitrary and capricious,and bechtel plan s did not sufficiently apprise him of his rights.
ultimately,the district court denied the former,but agreed with the latter.in reaching its decision,the district court acknowledged that each plan expressly granted the bechtel plan administrator the discretion to determine eligibility and construe the plan terms,which meant that the court was bound to a very limited standard of review whether the plan administrator decision was arbitrary or capricious.based on that review,the district court concluded that the administrator decision was not arbitrary or capricious.however,rather than respect such decisions as it had promised,the district court continued on and ruled that haus was in fact entitled to be instated into all four plans as a grandfathered employee on the theory that bechtel had violated a certain erisa reporting provision.the district court concluded 
i t is abundantly clear that bechtel has violated erisa requirement that plan descriptions be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations.a.in this case the harm to haus is all the more grevious sic because the conflict is not just between the summary plan and the plan itself,but among various plans offered by bechtel bechtel has consciously or unconsciously issued conflicting plan descriptions and definitions of grandfathered employees.haus fits some of those definitions,but not all.in such circumstances,bechtel can not rely on the ambiguity it created in order to deny him a benefit to which he is,under most of the plans they issued,clearly entitled.
although haus prevailed in the district court,his theory on appeal is different from the district court theory,and the majority theory in affirming the decision is different from both.i believe all three are in error,and while i would affirm the district court finding that the administrator decision was not arbitrary or capricious,i would vacate the rest as beyond the court prescribed role.
if an erisa plan grants the plan administrator the discretion to determine eligibility and construe the plan terms,then the reviewing court is limited to reviewing that administrator decision to ensure that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.a plan administrator decision will not be deemed arbitrary or capricious so long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome.davis.fin.ret.plan,cir.under the established law,we may not simply interject our own view or preference in place of the plan administrator.see henry ford health shalala,cir citing motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
each of the bechtel plans granted the plan administrator the discretion to determine eligibility and construe the plan terms.furthermore,the district court found that the administrator decision was not arbitrary or capricious.having made this decision,the district court was not at liberty to engage in further review so as to obtain a different outcome.this alone is a sufficient basis to reverse,and for this same reason i must disagree with the majority analysis.
the majority renewed the inquiry into the plan administrator decision despite the absence of any claim of error in this regard on appeal,found the district court factual determination to be incorrect,and concluded that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.in its analysis,however,the majority plainly identified the administrator reasoned explanation,which was that the plan administrator had applied a narrow interpretation of the transition plan,as intended by bechtel and the doe,and even noted that this explanation was supported by the record.i would hold that such a reasoned explanation is all that is necessary to overcome a claim that a decision is arbitrary or capricious.see davis,at.i would also decline to proceed any further and refuse to interject my own preferences into this case.see henry ford,at.
the majority,however,unabashedly interjects its own views,deeming the administrator interpretation unreasonable and imposing its own preferred interpretation.central to the majority interpretation is its that bechtel nowhere disputes that haus worked under the contract.on the contrary,bechtel position all along has been that haus employment with entech and cdm did not fall under the contract.bechtel explains 
given the language of the underlying doe contract,it was reasonable for bechtel jacobs to interpret work under the contract as meaning transition scope of,work formerly by lmes transitioned to bechtel jacobs and then in most instances to its subcontractors.that is the work that was shifting from one employer to another as a result of the doe contract transition and it was the incumbent workers performing that work who were the subject of the workforce transition provisions in the contract.
in assessing the reasonableness of bechtel jacobs interpretation,it is significant that the doe agreed with that interpretation.as noted above,when haus appealed to the doe,the doe responded that haus did not satisfy the requirements for grandfathered employee status because neither entech,nor cdm were first or work force transition subcontractors.
appellant br.at,quoting a doe letter to haus,dated march.as explained previously,even haus had conceded that his work at entech and cdm was not under the contract.
on appeal,haus has not argued that he worked under the contract.instead,he contends that the bechtel employee handbook is the spd for all of bechtel benefit plans,haus insists that the individual spds for each of the individual plans are not the actual spds,but rather the employee handbook is.he quoted the grandfathered employees provision repeatedly in his brief,at one point quoting it in full,but elsewhere quoting just the pertinent parts 
grandfathered employees shall mean individuals who meet both of the following conditions 
a the individual was an employee of lockheed martin energy systems,lockheed martin utility services,or lockheed martin energy research collectively,lm on march,
b the individual was either subsequently employed by the contractor or its or subcontractors for work under the contract prior to april,
appellee br.at,quoting the bechtel your employee handbook,emphasis by appellee.the contract is,of course,the environmental management contract.purporting to rely on this employee handbook description,haus argued 
the primary characteristics that qualified haus for grandfathered status were that he was employed with lockheed on march,and he was employed by a bechtel or subcontractor before april.
appellee br.at emphasis in original.
by omitting the under the contract requirement,he deems himself entitled to grandfathered status merely because he was employed at the time in question by a company that was also a bechtel subcontractor.to give this some perspective,note that he could make the same argument if he had left lmes to become the night security guard at cdm boston headquarters or for an entech office in europe.the argument would be fine if not for the under the contract language.
as stated above,haus quotes the entire employee handbook provision in his brief,and even includes the under the contract phrase in his emphasized portions,but after doing so he retreats back to his excised version,arguing 
haus was a lockheed employee on march,and haus was also thereafter employed by bechtel subcontractors before april.consequently,haus believed that he met the definition of a grandfathered employee under the summary plan description in the employee handbook.
appellee br.at.the structure of this argument speaks volumes in that,rather than arguing that he was doing work under the contract,haus crafts his entire theory around the argument that it was not necessary for him to have actually done work under the contract.according to haus theory,all that was necessary was that he be a lockheed employee on march,and also thereafter employed by bechtel subcontractors before april.
in its footnote,the majority asserts that,at oral
