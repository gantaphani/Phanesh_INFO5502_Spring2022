factual and procedural background 
on january,river street filed a petition with the cis seeking to legally employ mohamed,a foreign national,as a skilled worker under section b i of the immigration naturalization act the act,b pursuant to river street petition,mohamed wage would consist of per hour equivalent to per week or annually.on july,the cis denied river street petition because after reviewing river street and tax returns,it determined that river street did not have the financial ability to pay mohamed salary.specifically,the cis noted that river street tax return showed a loss of and current liabilities greater than current assets.the cis further noted that the tax return showed an ordinary income of and current liabilities again greater than current assets.in both returns,large amounts had been deducted for depreciation in and in.
on august,river street appealed the cis decision to the aao.on september,river street submitted its brief arguing that its depreciation deductions were only paper losses and should be added back to its net income to demonstrate its ability to pay mohamed wage.river street did not submit additional evidence at that time.on december,months after filing its brief,however,river street filed additional evidence in the form of bank records and an audited cpa statement.river street did not explain this late filing or seek leave to submit this additional evidence.on january,the aao denied river street appeal.in its opinion,the aao first recognized that river street had submitted a brief and additional evidence and then proceeded to explain its holding that river street failed to establish its ability to pay mohamed wage.the aao conclusion was based on its analysis of the and tax returns submitted by river street.the aao determined that the net income and net current assets in both returns were less than the proposed wage for mohamed.in addition,it found unconvincing river street argument that the depreciation deduction in both returns should be included in the calculation of its ability to pay mohamed wage.the aao stressed that,even though a depreciation deduction does not reflect an actual cash expenditure,neither does it represent cash that would be otherwise available to pay wages because it is a systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset.
on march,river street filed a complaint in the district court arguing that the aao decision not to add back depreciation was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and not supported by substantial evidence in the record in the complaint,river street did not refer to the additional evidence submitted to the aao bank statements and cpa statement nor did it claim that the aao had not considered this additional evidence.river street only vaguely and perfunctorily requested the court in its third alternative prayer for relief to remand the case for further proceedings.the government moved to affirm the aao decision and to dismiss the complaint filed by river street.the district court granted the government motion and dismissed river street complaint.river street timely appealed the district court decision.
river street brings two claims for relief before this court.first,river street requests that the district court order be vacated and the entire case remanded to the aao for review of additional evidence because the aao never considered the accountant and bank statements it submitted months after it filed its brief.alternatively,river street seeks reversal of the district court order by challenging the aao refusal to add the depreciation expense in its and tax returns to net income when determining whether it can pay mohamed wage.
