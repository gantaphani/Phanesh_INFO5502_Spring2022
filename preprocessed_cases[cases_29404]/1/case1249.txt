opinion of the court 
this opinion addresses a petition by public citizen health research group public citizen to review the inaction of the united states department of labor,specifically the occupational safety and health administration osha,and to require osha to commence a rulemaking that would lower the permissible exposure limit for hexavalent chromium.it is not disputed that hexavalent chromium,which is widely used in various industries and which has been classified as a carcinogen,can have a deleterious effect on worker health.the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has for several decades recommended that osha adopt a far more stringent permissible exposure limit pel for hexavalent chromium than the consensus standard it promulgated in.in response to a petition for rulemaking,osha agreed that there was clear evidence that exposure to hexavalent chromium at the consensus level can result in excess risk of lung cancer and other illnesses,and announced that it was initiating a rulemaking that it expected would conclude in.however,nearly a decade after this announcement,nothing has happened,evincing a clear pattern of delay.
this matter was before us once before,in oil,chemical atomic workers union osha,cir.in that case,we declined public citizen request to compel agency action,for we concluded that the facts did not yet demonstrate that osha inaction is unduly transgressive of the agency own tentative deadlines.at.at that time,osha represented that it intended to issue a proposed rule by september,and we found such a deadline permissible in light of alleged competing policy priorities,including the clinton administration ergonomics initiative.yet,at the time of oral argument in this case,which was nine years after osha initially announced its intention to begin the rulemaking process,no rulemaking had yet been initiated,and it appeared that none would be in the foreseeable future.indeed,at oral argument,osha counsel admitted the possibility that osha might not promulgate a rule for another ten or twenty years,if at all.
we concluded that the delay had become unreasonable,and that while competing policy priorities might explain slow progress,they could not justify indefinite delay and recalcitrance in the face of an admittedly grave risk to public health.we therefore determined to grant the petition and to direct osha to proceed expeditiously with its hexavalent chromium rulemaking process.this opinion was drafted on an expedited basis and was circulating to the panel when we received osha announcement that it had instituted the rulemaking process,stating that the health risks associated with occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium are serious and demand serious attention we are committed to developing a rule that ensures proper protection to safeguard workers who deal with hexavalent chromium.osha news release of,available at.
this notice appears to have been prompted by the displeasure clearly evidenced by the panel during oral argument,especially the question posed to counsel whether they would be receptive to mediation regarding the timeframe for a rulemaking.notwithstanding osha long delay,we salute the agency upon its recent action and accompanying recitation,and trust that it will have a good result.that said,it does not moot this proceeding because the agency action does not resolve an important facet of the case,namely public citizen request that we order osha to issue a proposed rule within days and supervise osha progress.
accordingly,we will publish the opinion that had been prepared to resolve the remedy issue,and will direct that public citizen and osha submit to a course of mediation for sixty days before the honorable walter stapleton.if the parties can not agree to a workable timetable during that period,the panel will issue and enforce a schedule of its own device.we note in this regard that the recitation of this case history and our ratio decidendi,which provided the impetus for osha commendable action,will inform the proceedings to follow.
facts and procedural posture 
hexavalent chromium is a compound found only rarely in nature but used widely in chrome plating,stainless steel welding,alloy production,and wood preservation.the dangers of exposure to it have long been recognized,and include ulceration of the stomach and skin,necrosis,perforation of the nasal septum,asthma,and dermatitis.more significantly,there is strong evidence that inhaled hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic.since,the department of health and human service national toxicology program has designated various hexavalent chromium compounds as human carcinogens.the environmental protection agency has been in accord since,and it confirmed its carcinogenic classification of the compound in a review of the toxicological data in.epa,toxicological review of hexavalent chromium,available at.disturbingly,the primary evidence of hexavalent chromium carcinogenicity comes not from animal studies,but from epidemiological studies of workers exposed to it in short,as public citizen states,the principal evidence is actual human body counts.pet.br.at.
soon after the occupational safety and health act took effect in,osha established a μg permissible exposure limit pel for inhalation exposure to hexavalent chromium that level did not reflect osha independent judgment about the appropriate standard,but rather constituted a lowest common denominator consensus standard to provide workers some measure of protection pending osha consideration of the optimal standard,sess,reprinted in.the standard remains in effect.however,although today foremost health concern regarding hexavalent chromium is its carcinogenicity,osha did not take that into account when promulgating the standard rather,it was based on a recommendation by the american national standards institute,which in turn was based on reports generated in the,none of which considered chromium carcinogenic effects.
shortly after osha promulgated the consensus standard,niosh,the agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations to osha for the prevention of occupational disease and injury,urged osha to adopt a pel of μg,a level of the existing standard.at that time,niosh concluded that the evidence of the carcinogenicity of a few specified hexavalent chromium compounds was lacking,but that all other forms were carcinogenic.lurie.subsequently,however,niosh concluded that all forms of hexavalent chromium should be considered carcinogenic,and it recommended that the μg standard be applied to all such compounds.id.
in,public citizen petitioned osha to issue an emergency temporary standard that would set a pel of μg as an weighted average.the occupational safety and health act requires osha to issue an emergency temporary standard without the usual procedures if it finds that such action is needed to protect employees against grave danger.c.osha denied the petition because it contended that the extremely stringent judicial and statutory criteria for issuing an emergency standard were not met.dear letter at.it did,however,acknowledge that its existing standard was inadequate osha agrees that there is clear evidence that exposure to crvi at the current pel of μg can result in an excess risk of lung cancer and other illnesses.id.it therefore announced that 
osha is beginning a section b rulemaking for occupational exposure to crvi.we are preparing the necessary health and economic impact assessments to support this regulatory action.we anticipate that notice of proposed rulemaking will be published in the federal register not later than march.
this timetable was.only a month after its response to public citizen rulemaking petition,osha reported that the date for issuance of a proposed standard had slipped from march to may,and by may the anticipated issuance date had been pushed back again to december.thus began a pattern of november agenda reset the date to july the may agenda moved it to june and the november agenda moved it again,to september.
amidst this ongoing delay,osha commissioned a comprehensive risk assessment of hexavalent chromium.this assessment,which became known as the crump report,concluded that exposure at the current pel μg over a working lifetime could be expected to result in between and excess cancer deaths per thousand workers.moreover,the crump report concluded that significant numbers of excess cancer deaths could be expected even at much lower levels of exposure.for example,exposure at μg could be expected to result in between and excess cancer deaths per thousand workers,while exposure at μg would yield to excess cancer deaths per thousand workers 
osha november semiannual regulatory agenda endorsed the crump analysis,and osha explicitly acknowledged that t here appears to be no dispute that the current pel is too high and must be greatly reduced.lure.accordingly,osha stated that it was considering a new standard to times lower than the existing one osha is preliminarily considering a new twa average pel in the range of μg,measured and reported as chromium vi.id.even at that level,it noted,there would be significant risk of excess cancer deaths.id.
addressing these events in its present brief,osha contends that it was then concerned with methodological imperfections in the available data.for example,the crump report did not control for the effects of smoking or asbestos,factors obviously related to lung cancer incidence if the studied populations of workers smoked more than the general population,smoking could have accounted for some of the excess deaths.industry groups therefore pressured osha to wait for the results of the johns hopkins study,which,in the industry view,was expected to be the most accurate and complete database on chromium exposure and mortality available.id.at.osha also represents that budget cuts,government shutdowns,and new responsibilities under the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of limited the resources available for hexavalent chromium rulemaking.in august,osha explained to public citizen that work on the rule was continuing,but that these considerations had delayed progress and prevented it from expediting the rulemaking.letter of greg watchman to sidney wolfe.
public citizen,discouraged by what it viewed as a pattern of inaction,urged osha in march to commit to a timetable for rulemaking.lurie.instead,in its april agenda,osha announced that the expected issuance of a proposed standard had been delayed a full year,to september,id.at,and in a letter to public citizen declined to commit to a more concrete timetable.watchman letter at.
in late,public citizen filed a petition in this court for review of osha allegedly unreasonable delay.see oil workers,at.it contended that expedited action on a new rule was needed because,as osha itself had stated in,the sooner pels are reduced,the sooner the risk of death from lung cancer will be reduced.lurie,citing osha agenda.however,osha disputed this urgency by referencing the crump report failure to control for smoking and asbestos exposure,and intervenors chrome coalition and color pigment manufacturer association,who have also intervened in the current case,argued that the existing risk assessments failed to distinguish among the various compounds of hexavalent chromium.
we declined public citizen request to compel agency action,for we concluded that the facts did not yet demonstrate that inaction is unduly transgressive of the agency own tentative deadlines.oil workers,at.key to our decision was our observation that the secretary of labor has quintessential discretion to allocate osha resources and set its priorities,id.at,and while we recognized that delays that might be altogether reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human lives are at stake,we determined that osha and the intervenors raise d serious questions about the validity of the data and assumptions underlying public citizen calculations.id.citations omitted.given these scientific questions,osha superior technical expertise,and its professed plan to issue a deadline for proposed rulemaking in september,we concluded that osha delay was not yet unreasonable.id.
following our ruling,osha adhered to its september pledge in each of its regulatory agendas published through april.but it in fact issued no proposed rule in september,and in its november agenda it announced that its new target date was june.lurie.osha explains that this was not a period of inactivity rather,it completed a number of rulemaking projects,most of which had been pending when public citizen filed its first petition in.for example,in,osha promulgated a final standard regulating occupational exposure to methylene chloride,a chemical it found to be carcinogenic.see.likewise,in,it issued a final rule on respirators,and another requiring adequate training for operators of powered industrial trucks.osha further explains that in and,it focused most of its rulemaking resources on issuing an ergonomics standard before the end of the clinton administration term.a proposed rule was issued on november,and a final rule was issued less than a year later,a timetable that required tremendous agency resources.osha br.at citations omitted.
meanwhile,august saw the release of the johns hopkins study on hexavalent chromium in comparison to previous studies,it 
had a larger cohort,more lung cancer deaths,and had smoking information for most of the cohort.many of the exposure estimates of the current study are from direct measurements a portion were from models using contemporary data.more important,however,the ambient measures or estimates of exposure were concurrent with the work history and are of hexavalent chromium directly,not derived from other measures.furthermore,the cumulative exposure groups in the current study represent lower exposures than those in a prior study,providing better risk estimates at these lower levels of exposure,an important consideration for quantitative risk assessment.

although the hopkins study explicitly sought to address the shortcomings in previous empirical research,namely the lack of controls for smoking,asbestos,and other environmental factors,its release did not spur osha into action.the study was released in august,but osha november agenda pushed the date for a proposed rule back to september.lurie.osha agenda,issued december,reflected another,more radical departure from previous plans for the first time since,the hexavalent chromium rulemaking was denominated a action,and the timetable for action stated that the date for a proposed rule was to be determined.lurie.
osha offers a number of explanations for the delay that has now become indefinite.it notes that t he day the bush administration took office,it instructed the agencies that any new regulatory actions must be reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed after january.osha br.at,citing andrew card,memorandum for the heads and acting heads of executive departments and agencies.as it was not headed by a presidential appointee until august,osha contends that it could not begin to set its new regulatory priorities until that time.even then,it asserts,two extraordinary unforeseen attacks on the world trade center and pentagon and the anthrax it immediately to divert significant resources to safety efforts.see testimony of john henshaw,assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health,before the house subcommittee on labor,health,and human services,wl.
even amidst these distractions,osha represents,it has continued to evaluate the need for a new hexavalent chromium rule.it claims that from through the present,it has engaged outside organizations to work on pertinent aspects of the and feasibility issues that would arise in an osha rulemaking.osha br.at.for example,toxichemica international has worked on evaluating an update of an epidemiological study of workers exposed to hexavalent chromium,and niosh has investigated the mechanistic relationship between hexavalent chromium and cellular events related to lung carcinogenesis.osha has also conducted more than twenty visits to worksites where hexavalent chromium is present to determine patterns of employee exposure,specific routes of exposure,and types and costs of engineering controls and personal protective equipment used in particular industries.
in osha submission,the problem is that it believes that the information now available is inconclusive on important issues,such as whether the epidemiological studies apply to all cr vi compounds and the utility of the data to establish a relationship.id.although the hopkins study was a step forward,osha points out that its authors acknowledged certain limitations,particularly in estimating the cumulative exposure for the different individuals in the cohort.id.at.the study also did not resolve the dispute over whether all hexavalent chromium compounds present the same degree of risk.id.at.because osha has decided that it would benefit from public input and expert criticism on these issues,it has published a request for information rfi in its august regulatory agenda.after the time for response,osha states,it will evaluate all of the information available and decide how to proceed.see,may.
public citizen brought the present petition for review alleging that d eference to an agency priorities and timetables only goes so far,and arguing that,at some point,a court must tell an agency that enough is enough.public citizen br.at.the administrative procedure act,creates a right of action by an aggrieved party to compel unreasonably delayed agency action.when the action sought is the promulgation of an occupational exposure standard under,the federal courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction under f,which we have interpreted to provide jurisdiction to conduct judicial review over the health and safety standards issued by the secretary of labor,as well as over claims in which the secretary has not yet acted but where her delay is allegedly unreasonable.oil workers,at.
ii.discussion 
in denying public citizen earlier petition to compel a hexavalent chromium rulemaking,we acknowledged the quintessential discretion of the secretary of labor to allocate osha resources and set its priorities.oil workers,at.at the same time,however,we recognized that the secretary discretion is not unbounded,and noted our obligation under the apa to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.id.quoting.our polestar is reasonableness,and while in we found reasonable osha delay in the face of scientific uncertainty and competing regulatory priorities,we now find ourselves further from a new rule than we were then.we examine each of osha justifications in turn 
has osha delay been excessive 
in,osha acknowledged that the existing hexavalent chromium standard is inadequate and that there is clear evidence that exposure to cr vi at the current pel of μg can result in an excess risk of lung cancer and other illnesses.dear letter at.that was fully nine years ago,and its first target date for a proposed now more than seven years past.osha has missed all ten of its deadlines,including the september target it offered to this court in oil workers.far from drawing closer to a rulemaking,all evidence suggests that ground is being lost.osha december regulatory agenda demoted the rulemaking from a high priority to a long term action with a timetable to be determined.in fact,at oral argument,osha counsel admitted the possibility that another ten or even twenty years might pass before it issues a rule,if it ever does.
osha responds that public citizen concerns about the missed deadlines and recent reclassification are misconceived.it explains that under the regulatory flexibility act,agencies must publish regulatory agendas that include all rules the agency intends to propose or promulgate that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.a rule inclusion in an agency agenda does not,however,require the agency to consider or act on that item.see d.the secretary of labor has recently stated her belief that it is inappropriate to routinely set target dates that the agency can not meet and intends to list only realistic target dates in future regulatory agendas,daily labor report bna,but osha represents that this is an act of grace,not necessity b ecause an item listing in the regulatory agenda does not mean that the agency must consider or act on that item,the listing of unrealistic or unachieved target dates can not be a basis for compelling the agency to act.osha br.at.
regarding hexavalent chromium recent downgrade to a project,osha clarifies that this is a reflection of whether the rulemaking will be completed in a short period of time and represents that the designation carries no implication about a rulemaking relative importance to other matters osha is considering.osha br.at.the items listed as high priority in the december agenda,it says,were simply those on which osha intended to take action in fiscal.see.it therefore contends that the priority downgrade was more a clarification than a change in the agency priorities.
we find neither of these explanations satisfactory.we agree with osha insofar as its failure strictly to follow its published agenda is not actionable,but this defense misses the point osha persistent failure to meet deadlines is not the disease itself,but rather a symptom of its dilatory approach to the hexavalent chromium rulemaking process.similarly,even if osha decision to downgrade the project priority truly represents a clarification rather than a change,it still gives clear evidence that at least another year will pass before osha takes even the first formal step toward promulgating a rule.incidentally,we are skeptical of osha reassurance that the reclassification has no substantive implications,for five years ago it represented to this court that it intended to issue a proposed rule in september.not only did it fail to issue a rule in,it concedes even now that it is far from doing so.
section b of the occupational safety and health act requires the secretary of labor to set the standard which most adequately assures,to the extent feasible,on the basis of the best available evidence,that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life.b.the supreme court has found that this language compels action b oth the language and structure of the act,as well as its legislative history,indicate that it was intended to require the elimination,as far as feasible,of significant risks of harm.industrial union department,american petroleum institute,d.as such,the agency priorities are judicially reviewable,and this court and others have compelled osha to take action to address significant risks.see,united steelworkers of america pendergrass,cir in re international chemical workers union,public citizen health research group brock.indeed,osha itself does not seriously contest the existence of a private cause of action compelling it to proceed with a rulemaking.
we find extreme osha and counting delay since announcing its intention to begin the rulemaking process,even relative to delays other courts have condemned in comparable cases.indeed,in no reported case has a court reviewed a delay this long without compelling action.in chemical workers union,at,for example,petitioners had first requested that osha promulgate a rule for cadmium in.similar to this case,the court had denied an initial petition to compel osha to act,based in part on osha prediction that it would issue a proposed rule later that year.when it failed to issue a proposed rule until and estimated that a final rule would not be forthcoming until,the court said 
e ven if finally completed by august,the cadmium rulemaking will have taken over six years.this is an extraordinarily long time,in light of the admittedly serious health risks associated with the current permissible levels of cadmium exposure under the standards still in place under the circumstances,we do not see how any further delay resulting in continued exposure of workers to dangerous levels of be excusable.
id.at citations omitted.it therefore granted petitioner motion to impose a deadline for completion of the cadmium rulemaking.id.the length of the delay here is already years longer than the delay the circuit found unacceptable,and no proposed rule is in sight.
similarly,in public citizen health research group auchter,osha had been petitioned in for a new exposure standard for ethylene oxide eto,a carcinogenic substance to which an estimated hospital workers were exposed.as in the case at bar,the agency refused to issue an emergency temporary standard,but acknowledged the current standard insufficiency and began the rulemaking process.it issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in,but it had not issued the proposed rule as of,and it estimated that a final rule would not be issued until the fall of.the court found the anticipated delay unacceptable,stating that 
three years from announced intent to regulate to final rule is simply too long given the significant risk of grave danger eto poses to the lives of current workers and the lives and of their offspring.delays that might be altogether reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human lives are at stake this is particularly true when the very purpose of the governing act is to protect those lives.
id.at.see also brock,at,with lives hanging in the balance,six years is a very long time,and any delay whatever beyond the proposed schedule is unreasonable.oil,chemical atomic workers international union zegeer,addressing a delay of over five years in issuing a proposed rule for exposure to radioactive gases,and stating that a reasonable time may encompass months,occasionally a year or two,but not several years or a decade.
osha contends that among these cases,only in auchter did a court compel the agency to issue a proposed rule the others dealt with situations where the agency had issued a proposed rule but was allegedly dilatory in issuing a final regulation.it further notes that the circuit later characterized auchter as one of the exceptionally rare cases where this court has actually issued an order compelling an agency to press forward with a specific project.in re barr laboratories.osha also points out that in auchter,the court had been persuaded,largely by agency concessions,that the project backed by plaintiff was plainly than any that the project acceleration might retard,and it emphasizes that no similar concession exists here.
while we acknowledge that auchter,chemical workers union,and the other cases are in some ways distinguishable from this one,we nonetheless regard them as valuable precedent.for example,in auchter,even though osha admitted that the plaintiff project was the most urgent on its agenda,the case at bar is not ultimately distinguishable because the extremity of delay more than overcomes the fact that hexavalent chromium does not dominate osha list of priorities.we also note that although the circuit termed cases in which courts order agencies to press forward with a specific project exceptionally rare,the initial decision to make hexavalent chromium a high priority came from osha itself,not this court.it was also osha decision to announce in that it was beginning a rulemaking for occupational exposure to cr vi,and that it anticipate d that notice of proposed rulemaking will be published not later than.lurie.at all events,we think it exceptionally rare that an agency would for years classify an action as a high priority,only to demote it to a long term project upon the release of a study that provides more convincing evidence of the danger than had previously existed.
we are satisfied that osha delay in this case is objectively extreme,and we find its regression alarming in the face of its own statement that t here appears to be no dispute that the current pel is too high.we therefore conclude that,absent a scientific or justification for its delay,we must compel it to act.
does scientific uncertainty justify osha delay 
in oil workers,the first installment of this case,public citizen relied upon the crump report finding that between and out of every workers exposed to hexavalent chromium will die from cancer attributable to that exposure.at.we recognized,however,that there were serious questions about the validity of the data and assumptions underlying petitioner calculations.id.for example,as the intervenors noted,it was wrong to assume that all workers in industries dealing with chromium in some way or another are exposed to μg hexavalent chromium,every working day for years.id.we likewise observed that some workers breathe through respirators that protect them from exposure to chromium,and that public citizen calculations failed to distinguish between lead chromate and other hexavalent chromium compounds with potentially different carcinogenicities.id.at.finally,and most importantly,we were troubled by the crump report failure to control for smoking and asbestos inhalation,two factors likely related to lung cancer incidence.id.
based on this imperfect science and our recognition that osha possesses enormous technical expertise we lack,we concluded that we were not in a position to tell the secretary how to do her job.id.osha offers several reasons for us to continue that deferential posture.first,osha allegedly has not yet completed its evaluation of the hopkins study.osha br.at.it points out that the study authors acknowledged certain limitations of their data,particularly in estimating the cumulative exposure for different individuals in the cohort,and also that the study did not address the previous dispute over whether all hexavalent chromium compounds present the same degree of risk.id.at.osha summarizes that,even assuming the hopkins study is the most useful single study available,it does not answer all of the technically complex questions about carcinogenicity and other health effects that osha would need to resolve in developing a cr vi rule.id.at.
second,osha alleges that public citizen virtually ignores the other critical components of a cr vi rulemaking.id.one of osha requirements is that a standard must be technologically feasible,and given that one governing hexavalent chromium would apply to numerous industries,the feasibility analysis is quite complex.while it admits that it has successfully addressed issues of comparable complexity in the past,it notes that these efforts have not been successful where courts have found insufficient rigor in the agency analysis of scientific and economic issues.id.at see,industrial union dep t,at.invalidating benzene standard afl cio osha,cir vacating standard setting new exposure limits for over substances.the bottom line,osha states,is that t he belief that a chemical may be carcinogenic does not lead easily to the appropriate pel for that chemical,and forcing it to issue a rule prematurely will likely result in that rule being overturned in court.osha br.at.
we agree with osha that the evidence may be imperfect,that the feasibility inquiry is formidable,and that premature rulemaking is undesirable.but given the history chronicled above,we find these concerns insufficient to justify further delay in regulating hexavalent chromium.first,while it is true that the hopkins study authors recognized certain limitations of their data,
the epidemiological data as of the were sufficient for epa,atsdr,niosh,the national toxicology program,and the international agency for research on cancer to find hexavalent chromium carcinogenic for osha to commence a rulemaking proceeding and for osha contractor to estimate that exposures at a fraction of the current pel would result in significant excess cancer deaths.
public citizen reply br.at.moreover,osha based its delay on its professed desire to consider that study because of its superior data and ability to control for smoking.it was released in august,more than two years ago,but it has hardly facilitated the rulemaking process osha now offers it as a justification for further inaction,claiming that it has not completed its evaluation of the study findings and that the study conclusions can be much better assessed when experts in the field have had the opportunity to review and criticize it.osha br.at.
we are unconvinced.public citizen points out that,as the study was published in a journal,experts in the field have already had the opportunity to criticize it.id.at.notably,in the two years since its publication,no response or letter criticizing it has been published.id.especially since many of the study findings have been available since,see supra at note,the time for examining it has passed we also note that,if further professional criticism is absolutely necessary,the process will provide an ample opportunity.
nor do we find persuasive osha broad assertion that the hopkins study does not answer all of the technically complex questions that osha would need to resolve in developing a cr vi rule.osha br.at emphasis added.this is obviously true,but without more it is irrelevant,for the occupational safety and health act does not require scientific certainty in the rulemaking process.indeed,read fairly,the act virtually forbids delay in pursuit of requires regulation on the basis of the best available evidence,b emphasis added,and courts have warned that osha can not let workers suffer while it awaits the godot of scientific certainty.united steelworkers of america marshall.
osha points to one specific shortcoming of the hopkins it did not address the previous dispute over whether all hexavalent chromium compounds present the same degree of risk.osha br.at that is indeed a question it did not resolve,and this uncertainty is the principal topic of intervenor cpma brief,which argues that the lead chromate used in pigments is not as carcinogenic as other hexavalent chromium compounds.the hopkins study casts no light on this issue because its test population did not work in the pigment industry,but even without better data than that which existed in oil workers in,we find this uncertainty insufficient to delay rulemaking further.even if the chromate in pigments is not carcinogenic,an argument that,tellingly,osha itself does not offer,requiring concrete findings on this distinction would effectively hold hostage the thousands of workers who are exposed to hexavalent chromium.we will not sanction that result when,even though osha acknowledges that this issue was flagged in the prior litigation over four years ago,osha does not claim to have done anything to resolve it.public citizen reply br.at.
finally,while we are sympathetic to osha claim that a thorough feasibility analysis is both highly important and quite difficult,we can not allow an imperfect analysis to justify indefinite delay.osha first announced a rulemaking nine years ago,and by its own account it has been examining the issue through niosh for at least four years.osha does not explain why this particular feasibility determination requires an extreme length of time,and it does not offer even a projection of how much time it might ultimately require.in such a situation,our traditional agency deference begins to resemble judicial abdication,and we conclude that scientific uncertainties and technical complexities,while no doubt considerable,can no longer justify delay.judges on this court are not paid to decide the easy cases,and neither is osha.difficult challenges go with the territory,and courts and agencies regularly surmount them.the process should itself provide a fertile forum for gathering information on feasibility.
do competing priorities justify osha delay 
although osha insists that since oil workers it has continued to work on and feasibility issues relating to an eventual hexavalent chromium rulemaking,it admits that the project has not been a priority.in oil workers,of course,we noted the quintessential discretion of the secretary of labor to allocate osha resources and set its priorities,at,and osha contends that it simply exercised its discretion to concentrate its resources elsewhere.for example,in early,it promulgated a final standard regulating occupational exposure to methylene chloride,a chemical it found to be carcinogenic.see.shortly thereafter,in early,it issued a final rule on respirators,see,and later that year it issued a final rule requiring adequate training for operators of powered industrial trucks.see.during that period,osha also completed a revision to its safety standards for longshoring and marine terminals.see.july.
in and,osha submits that it focused most of its rulemaking resources on issuing an ergonomics standard before the end of the former administration term.osha br.at.because the clinton administration placed such great emphasis on quickly finalizing those standards,the process was remarkably compressed osha issued a proposed rule on november,and a final rule less than a year later,on november,a timetable that required tremendous agency resources.id.it explains that in addition to the ergonomics standard,the former administration gave high priority to completing a steel erection standard,see,and a recordkeeping rule designed to improve the quality of information about the causes of occupational injuries and illnesses.see.
osha represents that the delays became worse when the bush administration took office,for it instructed the agencies that any new regulatory actions must be reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed after january.see andrew card,memorandum for the heads and acting heads of executive departments and agencies,available at http.as osha was not headed by a presidential nominee until august,it alleges that it could not begin in earnest to set its new regulatory priorities until that time,osha br.at,and that even then,unforeseen incidents such as the september attacks and anthrax mailings demanded that it immediately divert significant resources to help ensure that the rescue and cleanup efforts did not result in further loss of life.id.at citation omitted.
osha lastly represents that,while these competing priorities have admittedly delayed the hexavalent chromium rulemaking,it is now pressing forward on that project.it published a request for information rfi in the federal register in august posing specific questions that would be relevant to a rulemaking and inviting the public to submit any other evidence it feels might be helpful to osha.following the rfi,it pledges that it will evaluate all of the information available on cr vi and decide how to proceed.id.at.
we do not lightly discount these admittedly significant competing priorities,especially those relating to the events of september,but when we view the rulemaking progress over the past nine years,we reach the ineluctable conclusion that hexavalent chromium has progressively fallen by the wayside.this is unacceptable,for as the circuit stated,w here the secretary deems a problem significant enough to warrant initiation of the standard setting process,the act requires that he have a plan to shepherd through the development of the he take pains,regardless of the press of other priorities,to ensure that the standard is not inadvertently lost in the process.national congress of hispanic american citizens marshall.
osha chose in to begin the rulemaking process,announcing its agree ment that there is clear evidence that exposure to cr vi at the current pel can result in an excess risk of lung cancer,and its anticipation that notice of proposed rulemaking would be published in the federal register not later than march.lurie.however,came and went without any sign of formal action,only for osha in again to declare that t here appears to be no dispute that the current pel is too high and must be greatly reduced.id.in fact,in osha declared to this court its intention to promulgate a proposed rule by september.oil workers,at.that deadline,like the others,passed without action.now,nine years after the rulemaking process began,we find ourselves without even a hint as to when osha might issue a proposed rule,much less a final rul
