this dispute over the location and height of a proposed cellular phone tower has been ongoing since and is now before us for the second time.in a nutshell,appellant green mountain realty gmr originally sought to erect a foot cell phone tower between interstate route south i and the by exit in milton,massachusetts.the tower asserted purpose was to fill a significant gap in the wireless coverage provided by t mobile and metropcs networks.milton board of appeals boa and conservation commission mcc the two local entities whose approval gmr needed before it could begin construction rejected the foot proposed tower.gmr turned to the federal courts,asserting the denials were preempted by federal law and naming as defendants the boa,the mcc,the individual members of both,and the town of milton itself collectively,milton.the district court granted summary judgment to milton,finding that the boa and mcc decisions were supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record,and gmr appealed to us.
addressing this matter the first time,we upheld the substantial evidence findings but remanded to the district court with instructions to consider whether the local authorities denials resulted in an effective prohibition of personal wireless services in contravention of the federal telecommunications act of,b i ii.the parties filed for summary judgment upon their return to the district court.after holding a hearing,the district court learned that tmobile and metropcs had merged into a single company usa and ordered the parties to brief whether and how the merger affected the pending.
gmr then submitted evidence indicating that,as a result of the merger,a shorter tower would suffice to eliminate the coverage gap in t mobile network.milton took the position that gmr must file a brand new application,as the original request was for a foot tower only.the district court denied gmr motion for summary judgment and granted milton,thereafter entering judgment in favor of milton and triggering gmr second appeal to this court.
having carefully reviewed the record,we conclude the district court erred when it granted milton motion for summary judgment.based on the summary judgment record and the supplemental materials bearing on the effective prohibition claim,a reasonable finder of fact could have found that the boa and mcc denials rejected the only feasible plan for remedying the coverage gap and,therefore,constituted an unlawful effective prohibition of t mobile provision of wireless services unless gmr was allowed to build a cell phone tower that was somewhere between and feet tall.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of gmr motion for summary judgment,reverse its grant of summary judgment in favor of milton,vacate the judgment in milton favor,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we previously set forth many of the background facts in green mountain realty leonard,cir.in order to provide context to the instant appeal,we sketch the outline of what has already transpired,at least insofar as is relevant here.curious readers seeking additional details and they are myriad should refer directly to our opinion.
a.the initial proposal 
gmr is not a telecommunications provider.instead,it owns and manages personal wireless communications facilities pwcfs,known in common parlance as cell phone towers.it makes money by leasing space on those towers to wireless carriers,who in turn place antennas on the towers to provide wireless coverage for their customers.since,gmr has leased from the commonwealth of massachusetts an unzoned,undeveloped,triangular plot of land approximately square feet in area and located between i south and the at exit the site.the site is located close to the blue hills reservation and the carisbrooke road neighborhood in the town of milton.
gmr leased the site with the intention of putting up a cell phone tower to improve wireless coverage in the area around exit.wireless carriers t mobile and metropcs had given assurances to gmr,in the form of letters of intent,that they would place antennas on the new tower.both companies were desirous of this location because it would allow them to improve their wireless coverage around exit,an area in which each had identified a significant coverage gap that resulted in dropped calls when customers entered the area and an inability to reliably place calls from within the area of inadequate service.in order to begin construction,however,gmr needed to win approval from both the boa and the mcc.
gmr applied to the boa in may of for permission to build a foot cell phone tower on the site.according to its application,the height was necessary to accommodate video equipment from the massachusetts highway department,along with five antenna mounts to be used by up to five different wireless carriers.gmr also submitted evidence tending to show that both tmobile and metropcs had significant coverage gaps in the area near exit and that the site was the only feasible location on which a cell phone tower could be placed to fill in the gaps.there was some community opposition to the proposal that appears to have been based primarily on aesthetic concerns the objectors were upset that the tower would have been visible from multiple locations in the blue hills reservation,as well as from within the carisbrooke road neighborhood.
the boa held several public hearings through the summer of,with objectors maintaining that the need for the tower did not outweigh the significant negative aesthetic effects.green mountain realty,at.on august,the boa voted to deny the application and issued a written opinion on september,which emphasized the public opposition to the proposed tower and the importance of protecting the character and aesthetic beauty of the blue hills reservation.id.in a similar vein,the boa found the proposed foot tower could be seen from the carisbrooke road neighborhood and would substantially detract from the character of the neighborhood.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the boa further found that existing wireless coverage while not perfect is reasonable and adequate under all of the circumstances.id.internal quotation marks omitted.finding that gmr failed to demonstrate its desired tower would promote the safety,welfare,or aesthetic interests of the town of milton,the boa concluded the proposal was not in harmony with the zoning bylaw and denied gmr application.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
while all this was going on,gmr was also attempting to win approval from the mcc,another necessary prerequisite to construction because the site is considered to be in a riverfront area given its proximity to the blue hills river.green mountain realty,at.the mcc ultimately denied gmr application on september,finding that it could not approve the proposal given gmr failure to provide it with any information about potential alternative sites.id.at.like the boa,the mcc also cited aesthetic reasons reiterating that it has a role in preserving aesthetics,the mcc explicitly stated that the height of the tower was,and remains,an important factor for consideration.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the mcc further called gmr to task for supposedly failing to provide requested data about whether a shorter tower would solve the coverage gap.id.it noted that because the site was already in a degraded condition as a result of i,the wetlands there are in greater need of protection,rather than less.id.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,and like the boa before it,the mcc denied gmr application to build a foot cell phone tower.id.
federal litigation begins 
gmr appealed to the district court,arguing that the boa and mcc decisions violated various provisions of the telecommunications act.green mountain realty,at.first,gmr argued that the two denials were not based on substantial evidence in contravention of the requirement that a ny decision to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be supported by substantial evidence contained in the written record.id.at quoting c b iii internal quotation marks omitted.gmr further argued that the denials ran afoul of the act ban of local decisions that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.id.quoting c b i ii internal quotation marks omitted.finally,gmr claimed the boa denial exceeded its authority and was arbitrary and capricious,all in violation of state law.id.
after the parties conducted discovery,the district court denied gmr motion for summary judgment and granted milton motion for summary judgment.id.the court found that both denials were supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.with respect to the boa,the district court found that gmr failed to show that existing service was inadequate and did not adequately explore alternative sites,that the boa was justified in denying the application due to aesthetic concerns,and that gmr had not demonstrated that its proposal was the only feasible plan.id.the court upheld the mcc decision on the grounds that substantial evidence supported its conclusion that the proposed construction would adversely affect the surrounding wetlands.id.the court did not separately address gmr claims that the mcc decision also constituted an effective prohibition of wireless service and that the boa decision should be overturned on state law grounds.id.
on appeal,we upheld the district court finding that substantial evidence supported the boa and mcc denials.green mountain realty,at.however,this did not end the matter.even though supported by substantial evidence,the denials could violate the telecommunications act if they resulted in the effective prohibition of the provision of wireless services.see id.at.after reviewing the record,we concluded that the district court did not adequately consider gmr federal claims,and remanded for further proceedings,leav ing it to the discretion of the district court whether to evaluate the claims on the current record or allow the parties to submit additional evidence.id.at.
further action in the district court 
taking up the matter again,the district court provided the parties with an opportunity to submit additional evidence with respect to the effective prohibition claim.the parties developed additional evidence and for summary judgment.the court heard oral arguments on may,and took the matter under advisement before issuing its decision,the district court became aware that t mobile and metropcs had merged into a single company,t mobile us,t mobile us,in or around may the court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs and,if necessary,documentary evidence on how this merger should affect the pending summary judgment motions.
gmr submitted its supplemental brief on august.although gmr took the position that the question should be decided on the facts supported by the affidavits as they existed in,it conceded the district court had discretion to take into account new facts described herein,gmr supplemental brief to fashion an appropriate remedy.in that regard,gmr maintained that,even,t mobile continues to have a coverage gap in the area around exit,that the site was the only available and technically feasible site,and that to close this significant gap,t mobile us needs to mount its antenna no lower than feet.
gmr submitted an august,affidavit of its owner and president,victor drouin,to support the claims that t mobile continues to have a significant coverage gap near exit and that t o close this significant gap,t mobile us antenna can not be any lower than foot centerline on the proposed tower.gmr further provided an august,letter written on t mobile letterhead confirming that the merger closed on may.the letter went on to state that there was still a significant gap in t mobile wireless coverage at and around the site and that,according to radio frequency testing,its antenna must be mounted no lower than feet in order to remedy the gap.
gmr also resubmitted earlier affidavits from drouin describing the site and explaining that gmr reviewed possible alternative solutions and sites,but that there are no feasible alternatives to constructing a cell phone tower at the site.the affidavits also indicated that in order to obtain a lease on the site,gmr had to agree to install a camera which must be mounted at a height of feet for the massachusetts highway department.gmr concluded with a request for an injunction requiring milton to issue all permits necessary to construct a pwcf on gmr site at the height necessary to close the existing coverage gaps.
the summary judgment record contained additional evidence relevant to the tower required height.gmr had previously submitted an undated expert report authored by a radio frequency engineer,scott heffernan,which opined to the existence of a very significant gap in t mobile wireless coverage in the area around the site.gmr expert indicated that a propagation analysis had been performed,and it confirmed that mounting an antenna at a height of feet would eliminate the significant gap in tmobile coverage the district court also had available for its consideration excerpts of heffernan deposition,at which he testified that an antenna mounted at feet would be high enough to eliminate the coverage gap.finally,one of drouin affidavits described a crane test done to determine the tower visibility from nearby locations,which showed that only the top twenty feet of the proposed foot tower would be visible around the tree line from the surrounding areas.
milton submitted its own supplemental brief as well.milton did not specifically contest any of the factual representations that we just mentioned.milton took a different tack instead,arguing that metropcs no longer had a significant gap in its coverage in light of the merger and the anticipated migration of metropcs customers to the t mobile network.with respect to t mobile us,milton argued that there was no longer any need for a foot tower,as the requested height had been dictated entirely by metropcs requirements.milton position was that the foot tower was no longer necessary to close the coverage gap,meaning that the boa and mcc denials did not effectively prohibit t mobile from providing wireless service in milton 
both parties submitted their supplemental briefs and attached exhibits on august.the district court issued its written decision approximately one week later and without further hearing.
of significance for this appeal,the district court first concluded that gmr has shown as a matter of law that in fall,there were significant gaps in metropcs and t mobile us coverage in the affected area,and no feasible alternative existed for resolving the metropcs coverage gap other than a foot tower at the site.the district court reasoned that if its effective prohibition analysis took into account only those facts in existence at the time the boa and mcc denied gmr application,gmr would be entitled to summary judgment against both boards.
the district court did not end its inquiry there,but instead determined it should also consider subsequent developments to decide whether milton had effectively prohibited wireless services.the court first found that even after the merger,a significant gap remained in t mobile us coverage around the site.it further found that there are no feasible alternative locations for the proposed tower apart from the site.the court felt,though,that gmr no longer needed to rectify metropcs coverage gap thanks to the merger.it recounted the evidence in the record indicating that t mobile us gap could be solved with a foot or foot tower,ultimately concluding that a shorter tower at the site is a reasonable alternative to the original foot proposal.the court then found that the existence of this alternative necessarily meant that the boa and mcc denials did not effectively prohibit the provision of wireless services.finally,the court noted that there was no evidence showing the boa or mcc would be predisposed to refusing a new application for a shorter tower.
when all was said and done,the court denied gmr motion for summary judgment,granted milton motion,and entered judgment in favor of milton.this timely appeal followed.
