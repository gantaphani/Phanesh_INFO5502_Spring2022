the clean air act requires the environmental protection agency to object to an permit if any person demonstrates to the epa that the permit is not in compliance with the act requirements.b.in august,the sierra club petitioned the epa administrator to object to a permit issued by the kentucky division of air quality to the east kentucky power cooperative,claiming it had demonstrate d because the epa previously had issued a notice of violation to the same company about the same plant in january and had filed a complaint against the same company about the same plant in january.the epa declined to object.because it reasonably interpreted b to mean that the agency may alter its position about a power plant compliance with the act based on intervening events and because the sierra club does not challenge the impact of these intervening events on the power plant compliance with the act,we deny the petition for review.
under title v of the clear air act,every major source of air pollution must obtain an operating permit from a state agency that identifies each restriction that applies to the source.see id.a,a.the permit must contain a compliance schedule,listing the act requirements with which the source already complies,will comply once the permit goes into effect and does not comply along with a schedule of remedial measures designed to bring the source into compliance.c iii a c see also.admin.regs.b.several reporting,monitoring and other duties apply to each requirement.see c.
as a form of cooperative federalism,the act gives both the states and the epa a role in administering the title v program.after a state gives the public an opportunity to comment on a proposed permit,id.b,but before it goes into effect,the state must submit the permit to the epa,which has days to review it,id.d b.if the epa concludes that the permit does not comply with federal requirements,it shall object to the permit issuance.id.but if the epa takes no action within the period,any person may petition the agency to object.id.b.and if the petitioner demonstrates to the administrator that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements of the act,t he administrator shall issue an objection,requiring the state to modify the permit.id.emphasis added.
one obligation that often comes up during the permitting process is the prevention of significant deterioration psd requirement,which applies to all attainment areas in the that already have met the act baseline national standards.see id.in an effort to prevent backsliding,the act requires sources from these parts of the country to satisfy additional standards.every new major emitting facility constructed in an attainment area,as well as every existing facility that undergoes a major modification,must obtain a special permit identifying specific emissions limitations,id.a,c,and must employ the best available control technology for each regulated pollutant it emits,id.a see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d.instead of establishing universal standards,the act directs the states to determine the best technology for each source on a basis,taking into account energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs.
the act creates several enforcement options.in addition to setting out enforcement procedures,see,id,and authorizing citizen suits,see id,the statute allows the epa to address violations on its own,see id.whenever,on the basis of any information available to it,the agency finds that any person has violated or is in violation of any requirement or prohibition of an applicable state implementation plan or permit,the act directs the epa to issue a notice of violation apprising the source and the state of its findings.id.a see also id.a.after days,the agency may pursue one of three options issue an order directing the source to comply with its existing obligations,impose an administrative penalty on the source after a formal administrative hearing or file a federal lawsuit against the source.see id.a,a,d.
this case arises from the power company request for a renewal of its title v permit for one of the steam generators,known not so descriptively as unit,at the spurlock station power plant in maysville,kentucky.the company first obtained a permit for unit when it built the plant in the late.the company later made several changes to the plant.in august,it began supplying steam from unit to a nearby factory,even though its original application said that unit would use steam only to generate electricity.and in january or so,the company increased the plant rate,allegedly operating above the level specified in its original permits.when the company applied for a title v permit for unit in,it did not identify the psd requirements stemming from these changes and did not propose a psd compliance schedule.the kentucky agency granted the permit in.
in,apparently after discovering these changes to the plant,the epa issued a notice of violation,informing the company that its unit permit failed to address the psd requirements stemming from these modifications.a year later,the epa filed an enforcement lawsuit in federal court premised on the same allegations.in response,the company denied that the changes amounted to modifications triggering new psd and obligations.
in,while this litigation was pending,the company sought to renew its title v permit,once again without mentioning the psd requirements stemming from its modifications.in january,after reviewing the submission and requesting additional information,the state agency invited public comment on whether to grant the permit.after receiving comments from the sierra club,the epa and others,the state agency proposed the draft permit to the epa for its review.the epa did not object to it within the window,and the state agency issued the permit on july.
in august,the sierra club petitioned the epa to object to the permit,see id.b,arguing as it did in its comments to the state agency that the proposed permit was deficient because it failed to address the psd requirements.in support,the sierra club relied solely on the fact that the epa previously had issued a notice of violation and had filed a action based on the same allegations.
the epa and the power company,meanwhile,reached a settlement in the enforcement lawsuit in july and proposed a consent decree to the district court.under the proposed decree,the company preserved the position that it had not violated the act,but it agreed to pay a civil penalty and perform several remedial measures,including installing pollution controls that carried a price tag of over million according to the government.
in august,while the parties waited for the district court to approve the consent decree,the epa reached a decision on the sierra club petition.although it granted the petition in part on an unrelated issue,it declined to object to the power company failure to address the psd requirements.acknowledging its prior notice of violation and enforcement action,the epa explained that they were initial steps in the enforcement process and did not reflect the agency final position as to whether the title v permit for unit needed to include a psd compliance schedule.ja.in september,the district court approved the consent decree.see united states.power.and in december,the sierra club petitioned this court for review of the epa refusal to object to the power company failure to address the psd requirements.
the question is this does the act require the epa to object to a permit request when the agency previously has filed a notice of violation and enforcement action regarding the same allegations about the same plant the answer turns on the meaning of a statute that the epa administers and thus turns on an application of the familiar chevron framework.unless the statute terms directly address the precise question at issue,chevron says that we must defer to the epa reasonable interpretation of the provision.chevron,usa,natural res.def.council,d.and if the epa construction of the statute is a reasonable one,we must accept its application of that interpretation to the sierra club petition unless it is arbitrary or capricious.see a ohio pub.interest research group,whitman,cir.
the terms of b do not directly answer the statutory question.the administrator,it says,shall issue an objection within such period if the petitioner demonstrates to the administrator that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.b emphases added.in one sense,yes,this language is clear and supports the sierra club position the provision imposes a mandatory duty to object to a draft title v permit if the petitioner demonstrates that the permit falls short of federal requirements.once the petitioner makes that that showing epa has no leeway to withhold an objection.see sierra club johnson sierra club ii,cir see also sierra club johnson sierra club i,cir pub.interest research group whitman i,cir.
but that is just half of the clarity that the sierra club needs to establish.even though b compels the epa to object whenever a petitioner demonstrates noncompliance,it does not say what demonstrates means.how much and what kinds of proof must the petitioner provide neither the statute nor the regulations define the term,and dictionary definitions of demonstrate suggest a range of possibilities.perhaps merely point ing out a potential defect in a permit will do,webster third new international dictionary,suggesting a burden satisfied by allegations unlike requirements.perhaps a petitioner must manifest clearly,certainly,or unmistakably that the permit falls short in a material way,a threshold that comes closer to a standard.or perhaps the requisite showing falls somewhere in between,such as illustrat ing or explain ing in an orderly and detailed way with many examples,specimens,and particulars,id.that the petitioners must demonstrate these things to the epa suggests a role for the agency expertise and judgment to play.see sierra club ii,at nypirg i,at.but how widely that discretion ranges and what role,if any,the epa prior allegations play in the equation are left unspecified.the terms of the provision do not directly answer this question.see sierra club ii,at citizens against ruining the env t epa,cir.
context does not clear things up.the rest of b tells us a bunch of things that the timeline for the epa to issue an objection is short,that a petitioner generally may seek an objection only on a ground it raised during the permit period,that filing a petition does not affect a permit already issued until the epa decides to object,that the administrator can not delegate the decision whether a petitioner has made a demonstration and that the epa decision is subject to judicial review.see b.but none of these things clarifies the answer to this question.the neighboring provisions give us little more to go on.section b says that,before private persons and groups may force the agency hand,the epa gets the first crack at the petition and must object if it determine s that the petition does not comply with the act.id.b.and b explains the effect of the epa objection if the state permitting agency has not yet issued the permit,it may not do so until it addresses the epa concern if the state agency has issued the permit,the epa must step in and modify,terminate,or revoke it to bring it into compliance with federal law.id.b.these provisions do not say or even suggest whether b is satisfied solely by relying on a prior notice of violation and civil complaint issued by the epa.
that leaves us with an ambiguous provision,one that chevron empowers the agency to interpret definitively so long as it does so reasonably.in exercising that authority,the epa administrator construes b to mean this although the agency prior notice of violation and enforcement action are relevant factor s,ja,in assessing a petitioner subsequent efforts to demonstrate permit,they do not necessarily make the showing by themselves to the exclusion of other considerations,such as the kind and quality of information underlying the agency original finding that a prior violation occurred,the information the petitioner puts forward in addition to the agency enforcement actions,the types of factual and legal issues that remain in dispute,the amount of time that has lapsed between the original decision and the current one and the likelihood that a pending enforcement case could resolve some of those issues.that,we think,is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.just as these types of intervening developments may prompt the agency to revisit a prior decision to issue a notice of violation,so they may prompt the agency to revisit a prior decision not to issue a notice of violation.
the eleventh circuit reached the same conclusion in sierra club ii.the sierra club asked the epa to object to a title v permit,relying solely on allegations that the epa had made in a notice of violation and civil complaint that the same source was subject to psd obligations.see at.the epa declined to grant the objection for the same reason it gave here,and the eleventh circuit upheld the decision,accepting the agency interpretation of b as a reasonable construction of the statute.see id.at.the notice of violation and the complaint,the court reasoned,were merely initial steps in the enforcement process that did not prove the facts alleged,id.at,and the ensuing enforcement suit had done nothing to bolster the agency allegations the source had contested them,and the district court had administratively closed the case without reaching a decision on the merits,id.at.the epa thus reasonably interpreted the statute,the court concluded,to require the petitioners to point to something more than the agency own prior allegations.
in resisting this conclusion,the sierra club raises several arguments.first,it invokes a,which explains when the epa may file a notice of violation or a related enforcement action 
whenever,on the basis of any information available to the administrator,the administrator finds that any person has violated or is in violation of any requirement or prohibition of an applicable implementation plan or permit,the administrator shall notify the person and the state in which the plan applies of such finding.at any time after the expiration of days following the date on which such notice of a violation is issued,the administrator may bring a civil action 
a emphases added.no matter how one construes the requirement,the sierra club argues,a prior finding of a violation by the same federal agency about the same plant concerning the same requirements of the act necessarily satisfies it.a prior finding of a violation by the epa,true enough,will bear on,and customarily provide support for,a subsequent effort to demonstrate the same kind of violation by the same plant.but what is often true is not necessarily always true.that the epa must premise an enforcement action on a finding of a violation at a given point in time does not bind the agency for all time.f inds in this setting refers to an initial tentative,sometimes certain,but always subject to revision based on new information.the term simply does not suggest a definitive,determination by the agency that estops it from arriving at a different conclusion in a different factual or legal setting.the epa is no more bound by a prior violation finding than by a prior finding.
the statute says what it takes to make this initial finding,moreover,and it is not much.the statute authorizes the agency to make a finding based on any information available,which suggests a low evidentiary standard,see sierra club ii,at,one perhaps satisfied by no more than a staff report,newspaper clipping,anonymous phone tip,or anything else that would constitute any information,tva whitman,cir.when additional information materializes,as for example through discovery during an enforcement action,the epa initial factual and legal premises of the finding may be thwarted,which surely permits a modification of its enforcement stance when a later b petition is filed.congress no doubt could have required the agency to go through a formal factual adjudication before making an initial finding,and it has done so in a similar context.see d a requiring a formal hearing when the epa tries to impose civil penalties without filing an enforcement suit.
