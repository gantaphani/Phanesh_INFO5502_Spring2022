in united states halper,d,abrogated by hudson united states,d,the supreme court adopted a broad reading of the double jeopardy clause which made it substantially easier to attack repetitive punishments as violative of the clause.the halper court began by noting that the double jeopardy clause protects against three distinct abuses a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction and multiple punishments for the same offense.id.at.citing north carolina pearce,d.rather than examining whether multiple criminal punishments were involved in the case before it,the halper court suggested that in a particular case a civil penalty may be so extreme and so divorced from the government damages as expenses as to constitute punishment.id.at.the court interpreted the double jeopardy clause to prohibit not only successive criminal punishments,but merely punishing twice,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,and proceeded to hold that a civil sanction that can not fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose,but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes,is punishment,and under the double jeopardy clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial,but only as a deterrent or retribution.id.at.the court found that in the case before it,sanctions levied under the civil false claims act were entirely disproportionate to the real injury to the government and could only be explained as a punitive sanction.the court announced that its holding was a rule for the rare case,the case such as the one before us,where a provision subjects a prolific but offender to a sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he has caused.id.at.
eight years later,in hudson united states,d,the court substantially curtailed the halper approach,expressing concerns about the wide variety of novel double jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of halper,id.at,and concluding that halper deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered,id.at.rejecting halper emphasis on whether repetitive punishment exists irrespective of whether such punishment is civil or criminal in nature,the hudson court stated,w e have long recognized that the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit the imposition of all additional sanctions that could,in common parlance,be described as punishment.the clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense.id.at.internal citations omitted.rather than making the existence of punishment determinative,the hudson court focused on the criminal or civil character of the sanction,noting that halper marked the first time we applied the double jeopardy clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature.id.at.this determination is,at least initially,a matter of statutory construction.id.at.however,the intent of the legislature to denominate a punishment as civil is not determinative the hudson court stated that courts should inquire further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,as to transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in determining whether a punishment labeled as civil is in reality criminal for double jeopardy purposes,the hudson court applied the test adopted by kennedy,d,the vitality of which had been called into question by halper more direct analytical approach.the test asks 
w hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of and deterrence whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.
