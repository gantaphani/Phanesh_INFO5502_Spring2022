we here consider cross appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joanna seybert,judge,granting in part and denying in part a motion for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of three local laws restricting operations at a public airport located in and owned and operated by the town of east hampton,new york the town and the airport.see friends of the hampton airport,town of hampton,supp.plaintiffs,who sought the injunction,represent various aviation businesses that use the airport and representative entities.the district court enjoined the enforcement of only one of the challenged laws imposing a weekly flight limit concluding that it reflected a likely unreasonable exercise of the town reserved proprietary authority,which is excepted from federal preemption by the airline deregulation act of ada,b.
the town challenges the district court rejection of this proprietor exception with respect to the weekly law.plaintiffs defend the district court decision as to that law,and,on cross appeal,argue that enforcement of all three challenged laws should have been enjoined.specifically,plaintiffs contend that none of the challenged laws falls within the ada proprietor exception to federal preemption because the town failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the airport noise and capacity act of anca,see,in enacting them.the town counters that plaintiffs can not invoke equity jurisdiction to enforce anca procedural requirements,and that compliance with these procedures is not required because the town is willing to forgo future federal funding for its airport.
we identify merit in plaintiffs anca argument and resolve these cross appeals on that basis without needing to address the town proprietor exception challenge.specifically,we conclude that plaintiffs can invoke equity jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of the challenged laws and are likely to succeed on their preemption claim because it appears undisputed that the town enacted all three laws without complying with anca procedural requirements,which apply to public airport operators regardless of their federal funding status.
we affirm the district court order insofar as it enjoins enforcement of the weekly law,but we vacate the order insofar as it declines to enjoin enforcement of the other two challenged laws.in so ruling,we express no view as to the wisdom of the local laws at issue.we conclude only that federal law mandates that such laws be enacted according to specified procedures,without which they can not claim the proprietor exception to federal preemption.accordingly,we remand the case to the district court for the entry of a preliminary injunction as to all three laws and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the east hampton airport 
the town of east hampton,located approximately miles east of new york city,is a popular summer vacation destination on the south shore of long island.its population of approximately more than quadruples to approximately in the months of may through september the season.this results in increased traffic,including air traffic,and attendant noise.
the town owns and operates east hampton airport the airport,which is a public use,general aviation facility servicing domestic and international flights.the federal aviation administration faa has designated the airport as a regional facility significant to the national aviation system.although the airport provides no scheduled commercial service,it serves a range of private and chartered helicopters and aircraft.in,the airport supported operations,takeoffs or landings,by such aircraft.on the busiest day of that calendar year,friday,july,the airport supported operations between and 
b.the town efforts to control airport noise 
for more than a decade before the enactment of the laws at issue in this action,town residents had expressed concern about airport noise.counsel for the town,however,repeatedly advised the town that federal law placed significant limitations on its ability to restrict airport access to reduce noise.
federal limitations on local noise regulation 
a.the town receipt of aip grants 
the town was advised that its obligation to comply with federal law derived,in part,from its receipt of federal funding under the airport and airway improvement act of the aaia,pub,stat.recodified at et.the aaia established the airport improvement program the aip,which extends grants to airports that,in return,provide statutorily mandated assurances to remain publicly accessible and to abide by federal aviation law and policy.see a,a.
the town most recent aip grant,received on september,was for million to rehabilitate the airport terminal apron.in the grant agreement,the town certified that for a period of twenty years,through september,it would comply with certain specified assurances.see pacific coast flyers,county of san diego,faa dkt,wl,at july,upon acceptance of an aip grant,the grant assurances become a binding contractual obligation between the airport sponsor and the federal government.these included assurances to make the airport available for public use on reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination to all types,kinds and classes of aeronautical activities,grant assurance a,and to comply with all applicable federal laws,regulations,executive orders,policies,guidelines,and requirements as they relate to the application,acceptance and use of federal funds including but not limited to title,subtitle vii,id.at grant assurance a.
anca procedural requirements for local laws limiting access to public airports 
subtitle vii referenced in grant assurance a,at part b,chapter,subchapter ii encompasses the airport noise and capacity act of anca,pub,stat.recodified at.this statute,which is at the core of plaintiffs preemption claim,directs the department of transportation which has delegated its authority to the faa to establish a national aviation noise policy,a,including a national program for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage and stage aircraft,id.a and outlines the requirements of that program.acting under the authority delegated by the department of transportation,the faa promulgated a national aviation noise policy through part,the notice,review,and approval requirements,which apply to all airports imposing noise or access restrictions.a,c emphasis added.
anca requirements vary based on the type of aircraft at issue.aircraft are classified roughly according to the amount of noise they produce,from stage for the noisiest to stage for those that are relatively quieter.city of naples airport auth.faa,cir.in anca,congress states that airport operators may impose noise or access restrictions on stage aircraft only upon days notice and an opportunity for comment.b local restrictions on stage aircraft may become effective only if they have either been agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or submitted to and approved by the secretary of transportation after an airport or aircraft operator request for approval.id.c.
federal preemption of local police power to regulate airport noise 
the town was further advised that,even after expiration of the aaia compliance period indeed,even if it had never accepted any aip grants the airport would not be free to operate as it wishes because the federal statutory limitations applied regardless of whether an airport is subject to grant assurances.see also id.at stating that town does not now have local control and seeking faa grants does not fundamentally change that legal reality,and that o nly way to achieve local control is to close airport.
such limitations were first acknowledged by the supreme court more than years ago in city of burbank lockheed air terminal.referencing the supremacy clause,see const.art.vi,cl,the court there concluded that the pervasive nature of the scheme of federal regulation of aircraft noise manifested by the federal aviation act of,pub,stat,as amended by the noise control act of,pub,stat,and faa regulations promulgated thereunder had completely preempted the states traditional police power to regulate noise in that area.id.at see id.at reasoning that pervasive control vested in federal agencies under the act seems to us to leave no room for local curfews or other local controls.
d.the ada codifies a proprietor exception to preemption 
in city of burbank,the supreme court specifically did not consider whether the same preemption that applied to local police power also applied to local proprietary authority.see id.at observing that authority that a municipality may have as a landlord is not necessarily congruent with its police power.since city of burbank,federal courts,including our own,have concluded that municipalities retain some proprietary authority to control noise at local airports,although that role is extremely limited.british airways bd.port auth.of concorde ii,cir.we reasoned that,because an airport proprietor controls the location of the facility,acquires the property and air easements and can assure compatible land use,it might be liable to other property owners for noise damage and,thus,has a right to limit its liability by restricting the use of its airport.british airways bd.port auth.of concorde i,cir.citing griggs allegheny.that right,however,is narrow,vesting the proprietor only with the power to promulgate reasonable,nonarbitrary and regulations that establish acceptable noise levels for the airport and its immediate environs.id.at.moreover,such regulations must be consistent with federal policy other,noncomplementary exercises of local prerogative are forbidden.id.at.
congress codified the proprietor exception in the airline deregulation act of ada,pub,stat.codified at b.at the same time that the ada expressly preempts all state and local laws or regulations related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier,id.b,it clarifies that such preemption does not limit a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states that owns or operates an airport served by federally certified air carriers from carrying out its proprietary powers and rights,id.b.
litigation challenging the town aip grants 
in,an unincorporated association of town residents living near the airport sued the faa and department of transportation but not the town in the eastern district of new york,challenging the legality of aip grants to the town on the ground that,in the absence of a current layout plan,such grants violated the aaia,specifically a.the litigation concluded in an april,settlement agreement,wherein the faa stipulated that it would not enforce grant assurance a which provides for nondiscriminatory access to the airport on reasonable terms past december,unless the town received additional aip funding thereafter.the settlement agreement also provided,however,that with three exceptions not relevant here,all other grant assurances,including grant assurance a,requiring compliance with federal law,shall be enforced in full.
the faa response to the bishop inquiry 
on december,then united states representative timothy bishop,whose district included the town,submitted questions to the faa concerning the effect of the settlement agreement on the town ability to adopt noise and access restrictions at the airport.
in an unsigned response,the faa represented that after december,it would not initiate or commence an administrative grant enforcement proceeding in response to a complaint from aircraft operators or seek specific performance of grant assurance unless and until the award of a new aip grant to the town.id.at.the faa further stated that its agreement not to enforce meant that,unless the town wished to remain eligible for future federal grants,it was not required to comply with the requirements under anca,as implemented by title cfr,part,in proposing new airport noise and access restrictions.id.counsel for the town received a copy of this communication from the faa on february,remarking to an faa attorney that news reports construing the faa response as relieving the town from anca compliance certainly c ame as a surprise.id.at.
the town enactment of the challenged legislation 
by,the town had concluded that its attempt to develop voluntary procedures for aircraft operators had failed,and that airport noise was becoming increasingly disruptive relying on the faa response to the bishop inquiry,the town decided to take official action.
in the late summer of,the town began to hold public meetings and to collect and analyze data with a view toward adopting regulations to address airport noise.at an october town meeting,a joint team presented the results of a phase i study on airport operations,which indicated that helicopter noise generated the majority of complaints compliance with voluntary procedures at was low and complaints peaked during the summer,on weekends,and in response to nighttime operations.a phase ii study by a private firm confirmed these conclusions and prompted a phase iii analysis of possible regulatory solutions.the results of the phase iii analysis,reported on february,indicated that three restrictions would address the cause of more than of noise complaints while affecting less than of airport operations a mandatory curfew on all aircraft traffic,an extended curfew for certain noisy aircraft,and a weekly limit on noisy aircraft.following a period of public comment,as well as communications with various industry constituencies,faa officials,and members of new york congressional delegation,the town,on april,codified the three recommended restrictions on the stage,and aircraft operations that are at issue in this case the local laws.see town of east hampton,code town code.
the local laws establish a curfew prohibiting all such aircraft from using the airport between and the mandatory curfew an extended curfew on noisy aircraft starting at and continuing through the extended curfew and a,one round trip limit on noisy aircrafts use of the airport during the season the limit.see id.b c.the local laws address violations through escalating fines,enforcement costs,injunctive relief,and bans on airport use.see id.b e.
the town does not dispute that,in enacting the local laws,it did not comply with anca procedural requirements.specifically,although the laws restrict stage aircrafts airport access,the town did not conduct the requisite analysis set forth in b much less make such analysis available for public comment at least days before the laws took effect.nor did the town seek aircraft operator or faa approval for laws restricting stage and stage aircrafts airport access,as required by c.
district court proceedings 
on april,five days after the local laws were enacted,plaintiffs filed this declaratory and action to prohibit enforcement of and of the town code in their amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that the local laws violate the ada,aaia,anca,and these statutes implementing regulations,and,thus,are preempted under the supremacy clause and constitute an unlawful restraint on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause,see const.art.i,cl.
on april,plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order,relying exclusively on the preemption prong of their claim.they argued that the local laws violate anca,see,insofar as the town failed to comply with that statute procedural requirements for the adoption of local noise and access restrictions affecting stage and stage aircraft the aaia,see id,insofar as the local laws fail to comply with three of the town grant assurances and the ada,see id.b,because they are unreasonable.
the district court conducted a hearing on may,after which,with the parties consent,it decided to treat the motion as a request for a preliminary injunction.the town agreed to delay enforcement of the challenged laws until the court ruled on the motion 
on june,the district court preliminarily enjoined the town enforcement of its limit law,but declined to enjoin enforcement of the mandatory and extended curfew laws.in so ruling,the court observed,first,that neither the aaia nor anca created a private right of action,and plaintiffs could not rely on the supremacy clause as an independent source of such an action nevertheless,the district court concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to invoke equity jurisdiction to enjoin the challenged laws to the extent the exercise of that jurisdiction was not explicitly or implicitly prohibited by congress.the court located congressional intent to foreclose equitable enforcement of the aaia in that statute comprehensive administrative enforcement scheme.but nothing in the text or structure of anca supported a similar conclusion as to that statute.friends of the hampton airport,town of hampton,supp.at.accordingly,the district court ruled that plaintiffs could invoke its inherent equity jurisdiction to bring a preemption claim based on anca,but not on the aaia.
second,the district court found that,absent a preliminary injunction,the local laws would cause plaintiffs to suffer irreparable harm 
third,the district court concluded that plaintiffs preemption claim was likely to succeed on the merits with respect to the limit law,but not the mandatory and extended curfew laws.in reaching that conclusion,the district court reasoned that anca did not necessarily preempt local laws enacted in violation of its procedures because the statute enforcement provision mandated only the loss of eligibility for further federal funding and for imposition of certain charges thus,an anca violation did not defeat the ada proprietor exception to preemption,and a municipal proprietor restrictions on airport access remained permissible to the extent they were reasonable,and.id.at on the record presented,the district court determined that the mandatory and extended curfew laws satisfied that standard,but that the limit law did not because it had a drastic effect on plaintiffs businesses,and there was no indication that a less restrictive measure would not also satisfactorily alleviate the airport noise problem.id.at.
the parties timely filed these interlocutory cross appeals,which we have jurisdiction to review pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
when,as here,a preliminary injunction will affect government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme,the moving party must demonstrate irreparable harm absent injunctive relief,a likelihood of success on the merits,and public interest weighing in favor of granting the injunction.red earth llc united states,cir.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.although we review a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,see oneida nation of cuomo,cir,we must assess de novo whether the court proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law,chevron naranjo,cir.see drake lab.of am.holdings,cir.reviewing federal aviation act preemption de novo windstream commc ns,cir.reviewing jurisdiction de novo.
b.the town challenge to equity jurisdiction 
the town contends that the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs could invoke equity jurisdiction to enjoin the challenged laws as preempted by anca.on de novo review,we identify no error.
the doctrine of ex parte young supports equity jurisdiction in this case 
the supreme court has long recognized that where individual s claim federal law immunizes them from state regulation,the court may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preempted.armstrong exceptional child.the principle is most often associated with ex parte young,which held that the eleventh amendment does not bar federal courts from enjoining state officials from taking official action claimed to violate federal law.since then,the supreme court has consistently recognized federal jurisdiction over declaratory and actions to prohibit the enforcement of state or municipal orders alleged to violate federal law.see,verizon,pub.serv.comm of,authorizing suit by telecommunications carriers asserting federal preemption of state regulatory order crosby foreign trade council,enjoining state statute barring certain foreign transactions in face of federal statute imposing conflicting sanctions city of burbank lockheed air terminal,at upholding injunction barring municipal aircraft curfews as subject to federal preemption.our own court has followed suit.see,air transp.ass of,cuomo,cir.granting airline trade organization declaratory and injunctive relief against preempted state regulatory statute united states state of new york,cir.relying on equitable power recognized in ex parte young to uphold preliminary injunction against nighttime ban on airport use.
in such circumstances,a plaintiff does not ask equity to create a remedy not authorized by the underlying law.rather,it generally invokes equity preemptively to assert a defense that would be available to it in a state or local enforcement action.see,virginia office for prot.advocacy stewart,kennedy,concurring invoking ex parte young involves nothing more than the assertion in equity of a defense that would otherwise have been available in the state enforcement proceedings at law fleet bank,ass burke,cir.noting that it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits that seek injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail emphasis in original quoting shaw delta air lines.a party is not required to pursue arguably illegal activity or expose itself to criminal liability before bringing suit to challenge a statute alleged to violate federal law.knife rights,vance,cir.citations omitted.
plaintiffs,who are here threatened with escalating fines and other sanctions under the local laws,thus seek to enjoin enforcement on the ground that the laws were enacted in violation of anca procedural prerequisites for local limits on airport noise and access.such a claim falls squarely within federal equity jurisdiction as recognized in ex parte young and its progeny.
anca does not limit equity jurisdiction 
a federal court equity power to enjoin unlawful state or local action may,nevertheless,be limited by statute.see armstrong exceptional child,at seminole tribe of florida.the town does not indeed,can not argue that anca expressly precludes actions in equity relying on its statutory requirements.instead,the town relies on armstrong to urge us to recognize anca implicit foreclosure of equitable relief.the argument is not persuasive.
in armstrong,the supreme court construed a different statute part of the the medicaid act implicitly to preclude healthcare providers from invoking equity to enjoin state officials from reimbursing medical service providers at rates lower than the federal statute required.the court located congress intent to foreclose such equitable relief in two aspects of the statute.first,federal statutory authority to withhold medicaid funding was the sole remedy congress provided for a state failure to comply with medicaid requirements.armstrong exceptional child,at citing see id.recognizing that express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others quoting alexander sandoval.second,even if the existence of a provision authorizing the secretary of health and human services to enforce the statute by withholding funds might not,by itself,preclude the availability of equitable relief,it did so when combined with the judicially unadministrable nature of the statutory text.id.emphasis in original see id.it is difficult to imagine a requirement broader and less specific than a mandate that state plans provide for payments that are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,all the while safeguard ing against unnecessary utilization of care and services.citation omitted.in sum,t he sheer complexity associated with enforcing a,coupled with the express provision of an administrative remedy,shows that the medicaid act precludes private enforcement of a in the courts.id.
anca can not be analogized to the medicaid statute in either of the two ways prompting jurisdictional concern in armstrong.first,as to the identification of an exclusive remedy,there is no textual basis to conclude that the loss of federal funding is the only consequence for violating anca.the town highlights as the district court did,which states that an airport may not receive aip grants or collect passenger facility charges u nless the secretary of transportation is satisfied that,insofar as the airport imposes any noise or access restrictions,those regulations comply with the statute.the town assertion that this is the sole available remedy for violating anca,however,is defeated by,which states that,e xcept as provided by section of this title,this subchapter does not affect the authority of the secretary of transportation to seek and obtain legal remedies the secretary considers appropriate,including injunctive relief.as already noted,provides only limited exceptions to the secretary authority to bring suit as against local stage aircraft restrictions if the airport proprietor complies with b process and as against local stage and aircraft restrictions agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or approved by the faa,id.c.thus,confirms that congress did not intend to be the only means of enforcing anca procedural requirements.the faa can employ any legal or equitable remedy necessary to prevent airports from enacting or enforcing restrictions on stage aircraft without utilizing the b process,and on stage and aircraft without securing either the c consent of all airport operators or the faa own approval.the fact that congress conferred such broad enforcement authority on the faa,and not on private parties,does not imply its intent to bar such parties from invoking federal jurisdiction where,as here,they do so not to enforce the federal law themselves,but to preclude a municipal entity from subjecting them to local laws enacted in violation of federal requirements.see air transp.ass of,cuomo,at challenge to state law presented no barriers to justiciability citing ex parte young,at.
further support for the conclusion that congress did not intend for funding ineligibility to be the sole means of enforcing the b and c requirements can be located in the compliance assurance that airport proprietors must give in return for aip grants.such grants,unlike medicaid funding,involve transfers.thus,if,as the town argues,the sole remedy for a proprietor failure to comply with the requirements for local laws is the loss of eligibility for future funding,the proprietor could give a assurance of compliance to obtain an aip grant on one day and,on the next day,promulgate laws,relinquishing eligibility for future grants.we can not conclude that,in those circumstances,congress intended to foreclose legal or equitable actions to enforce either the statutorily mandated assurances or anca procedural prerequisites for local legislation.see generally corley united states,stating that courts must construe statute so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,makes plain that congress did not so intend.
second,unlike the medicaid claim at issue in armstrong,plaintiffs challenge to the town local laws would not require application of a judicially unadministrable standard.in urging otherwise,the town relies on c,the statutory section detailing various factors that can inform an faa decision to approve local noise restrictions on stage aircraft.the town argues that anca compliance is,thus,so much a matter of agency discretion as to signal congress intent that the faa alone not private individuals should enforce the statute terms.the argument fails because c sets forth a simple rule that airports seeking to impose noise restrictions on stage aircraft must obtain either the consent of all aircraft operators or faa approval.it is difficult to imagine more straightforward requirements.armstrong exceptional child,at.a federal court can evaluate the town compliance with these obligations without engaging in the sort of review that the supreme court in armstrong concluded evinced congress intent not to permit private enforcement of of the medicaid act id.indeed,at oral argument before this court,the town acknowledged that this case does not implicate the same kind of judicial administrability problem as armstrong.see oral argument,june,at.
in sum,because the denial of eligibility for federal funding is not the exclusive remedy for an airport proprietor failure to comply with anca procedural requirements,and those requirements plainly are judicially administrable,we conclude that congress did not intend implicitly to foreclose plaintiffs from invoking equitable jurisdiction to challenge the town enforcement of local laws enacted in alleged violation of anca.accordingly,the town jurisdictional challenge is without merit.
plaintiffs preemption claim 
plaintiffs fault the district court conclusion that they are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their preemption challenge to the local laws.they argue that anca procedural requirements for local restrictions on airport access apply to all public airport proprietors regardless of their federal funding status.thus,plaintiffs maintain,the town disavowal of future federal funding can not insulate the local laws from anca procedural requirements.and enactment of the local laws without such procedures can not be deemed reasonable so as to support a proprietor exception to federal preemption under the ada.we agree and,therefore,conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of all three local laws.
anca text and context establish procedural requirements for local noise and access restrictions applicable to all public airport proprietors 
in considering de novo whether anca procedural requirements for local noise and access restriction laws apply to all public airport proprietors,or only to those receiving federal funding as the town contends,we begin with the statute text because we assume that the ordinary meaning of the statutory language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.marx revenue,brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.in deciding whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case,roberts,internal quotation marks omitted,we consider the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole,greathouse jhs sec,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent the inquiry ceases.kingdomware,united states,internal quotation marks omitted.that is the case with respect to the relevant provisions of,which employ comprehensive and unmistakably limiting language in affording airport proprietors some authority to regulate noise.
subsection b states that a local airport noise or access restriction may include a restriction on the operation of stage aircraft only if the airport operator publishes the proposed restriction and prepares and makes available for public comment at least days before the effective date of the proposed restriction the analysis outlined therein.b emphasis added.similarly,subsection c states that an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage aircraft may become effective only if the restriction has been agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or has been submitted to and approved by the faa after an airport or aircraft operator request for approval.id.c emphasis added.the phrase only if is unambiguously limiting,identifying procedures that airport proprietors must follow in order to impose any noise or access restrictions on air operations at the same time,no statutory language cabins these procedural requirements to proprietors receiving or maintaining eligibility for federal funds.thus,the plain statutory text is fairly read to mandate the identified procedural requirements for local noise and access restrictions on stage and aircraft at any public airport.see city of naples airport auth.faa,at stating that airports must comply with b to impose stage aircraft restrictions,and that subsection c requirement of faa approval is not tied to grants grants or not,no airport operator can impose a stage restriction unless the faa gives its approval.
statutory context further compels this construction.first,the only textual limitation on the aforementioned procedural requirements is that referenced in d,a grandfather provision that generally exempts local noise restrictions existing prior to anca effective date.
second,shifts liability for noise damages from local airport proprietors to the federal government when a taking has occurred as a direct result of the faa disapproval of a proposed restriction.insofar as the proprietor exception to federal preemption rests on an airport operator potential liability for and,thus,right to mitigate noise damage by restricting the use of his airport,concorde i,at citing griggs allegheny,at,the federal government assumption of that liability not only undermines the rationale for the exception,but also offsets the extent to which anca constrains local authority.moreover,no language limits this federal acceptance of liability to airports whose proprietors have received or are eligible for aip grants.thus,the general assumption of liability under reinforces the conclusion that congress intended for the requirements of b and c to apply generally to all proprietors wishing to impose noise or access restrictions on stage,or aircraft at public airports.
third,places no limits and certainly no funding eligibility condition on the faa statutory authority to enforce the b and c procedural requirements.
the town nevertheless urges us to construe in light of and to conclude from that funding ineligibility provision that congress intent was to encourage,but not require,compliance with the former procedures.town br.citing friends of the hampton airport,town of hampton,supp.at.we are not persuaded.as explained supra at part,provides for loss of funding eligibility as a consequence of noncompliance with procedures.nothing in signals that funding ineligibility is the only consequence of such a procedural violation the same conclusion obtains with respect to the funding ineligibility effected by e with particular reference to c violations.
in sum,anca text and context unambiguously indicate congress intent for the procedural mandates to apply to all public airport proprietors regardless of their funding eligibility.
congress intent for anca procedures to apply comprehensively and mandatorily is confirmed by statutory findings,legislative history,and implementing regulations 
even if text and context did not speak unambiguously to the question,statutory findings,legislative history,and implementing regulations would confirm the conclusion that b and c apply comprehensively and mandatorily to all public airport proprietors.
congress promulgated anca based on findings that community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system and,therefore,noise policy must be carried out at the national level.emphasis added.such findings,which are particularly useful in determining congressional intent,dole united steelworkers of,accord,fcc,cir.and which themselves speak in mandatory terms undermine the town argument that congress intended for the b and c procedures to apply only to noise and access restrictions at some public airports,those whose proprietors wished to maintain federal funding eligibility.it was by mandating local restriction procedures for all public airport proprietors that congress could prevent uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions at the national level,while still allowing local interest in aviation noise management to be considered in determining the national interest.congress recognition that revenues controlled by the federal government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system,id,does not undermine this conclusion.congress can certainly regulate commerce both by providing monetary incentives for voluntary compliance by some actors,while at the same time allowing for enforcement actions more generally.nor are we persuaded by the town contention that the reference to noise problems in the quoted excerpt from refers to noise restrictions,as opposed to problems created by airport noise.in any event,the finding states only that such revenue control can help resolve those problems,which comports with a view of funding eligibility as a means but not the only means of executing anca policy objectives.id.emphasis added.
that conclusion is consistent,moreover,with anca legislative history.anca was adopted after congress determined that voluntary financial and legal incentives established by the aviation safety and noise abatement act of,pub,stat.recodified at,had proved insufficient to secure airport conformity to federal aviation policy respecting noise.notwithstanding these incentives,and the federal funding scheme established by the aaia in,congress perceived that a patchwork quilt of local noise restrictions continued to stymie the airport development required for the nation aviation.see cong.rec,statement of ford thus,it was to resolve a problem that persisted despite federal financial incentives that congress enacted regulatory legislation permitting local noise and access restrictions at public airports only if the restrictions conformed to the procedural mandates of b and c.
indeed,many of the legislators who opposed anca enactment objected to the statute mandatory nature precisely because it meant that local noise restrictions not enacted under the specified procedures would be preempted by federal law.see,cong.rec,statement of durenberger this legislation would have far reaching consequences for the millions of americans living beneath the landing and takeoff flight paths of our nation airports.in many communities,the pending aviation noise legislation would effectively preempt existing local aviation noise controls.id.at statement of sarbanes t his legislation has ramifications for cities and towns throughout the country.many of these communities have already been through the long,and often painful process of developing comprehensive noise standards for their airports balancing the economic development interests of those communities and the desire to provide a healthy environment free of noise pollution.this belies the suggestion that in anca,congress was,yet again,seeking only to give incentives for compliance by those seeking federal funding.rather,it confirms mandated procedures applicable to all proprietors seeking to impose noise or access restrictions at public airports.
finally,even if text,context,findings,and history did not speak so plainly,any ambiguity would be resolved by the faa interpretation of to mandate procedural compliance regardless of funding status.see chevron,nat.res.def.council,we have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.the faa part regulations state that notice,review,and approval requirements set forth in this part apply to all airports imposing noise or access restrictions affecting stage or stage airport operations.c,emphasis added.they admit no exception for airports not maintaining federal funding eligibility.rather,they employ comprehensive and mandatory language.see id.a each airport operator proposing a noise or access restriction on stage aircraft operations shall prepare the specified analysis and make it available for public comment emphases added,a each airport operator or aircraft operator proposing a stage restriction shall provide public notice and an opportunity for public comment,as prescribed in this subpart,before submitting the restriction to the faa for review and approval.emphases added.further,the faa regulations state,in no uncertain terms,that the procedures to terminate eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges for an airport operator failure to comply with anca may be used with or in addition to any judicial proceedings initiated by the faa to protect the national aviation system and related federal interests.id.a emphasis added.
in sum,the statutory findings,legislative history,and implementing regulations accord with what we have identified as the plain meaning of anca text.we therefore construe b and c to mandate procedures for the enactment of local noise and access restrictions by any public airport operator,regardless of federal funding status.because these procedures are mandatory and comprehensive,we further conclude that local laws not enacted in compliance with them which the town concedes the local laws challenged in this case were not are federally preempted.see hillman maretta,state law is to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.internal quotation marks omitted in re tribune.fraudulent conveyance,cir.recognizing that such conflict occurs when,inter alia,state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their preemption claim and are entitled to an injunction prohibiting the town enforcement of each of the three challenged local laws.
national helicopter warrants no different preemption conclusion 
national helicopter of america city of new york,cir,relied on by the town as well as the district court,does not warrant a different conclusion on preemption.
in that case,the parties cross appealed the partial grant and partial denial of an injunction barring new york city from restricting operations at manhattan east street heliport.plaintiff helicopter operator national argued that the regulation of airports is a field preempted by federal law,id.at,while the city maintained that its restrictions represented a lawful exercise of its power as the heliport proprietor,id.at 
the town urges us to conclude from the fact that national helicopter found certain of the challenged restrictions to fall within the proprietor exception despite the city apparent failure to comply with anca procedures that this court has necessarily,if not explicitly,decided that anca procedures do not limit the scope of the ada proprietor exception to federal preemption,thereby foreclosing a contrary decision in this case.the argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.
first,a sub silentio holding is not binding precedent.getty petroleum bartco,cir.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states hardwick,cir.explaining that government concession in prior appeal that certain evidence should not be considered in evaluating sufficiency did not bind later panel because first panel did not independently analyze whether this was the proper course united states johnson,cir.en banc reasoning that court is not bound by earlier statement of law uttered in passing without due consideration of the alternatives,or where it is merely a prelude to another legal issue that commands the panel full attention.
second,national helicopter is distinguishable from this case in that the court there understood national not to dispute the viability of the proprietor exception.national helicopter of am.city of new york,at.rather,it understood national to argue that the exception did not apply because the city challenged actions were taken under its police power rather than its proprietary authority.see id.in resolving that dispute favorably to the city,this court did not address whether and to what extent anca procedural requirements cabined the reasonable exercise of a municipality proprietary authority over airport noise,much less did it decide whether local restrictions imposed in the absence of anca procedures were federally preempted.indeed,the court mentioned anca only in passing,at the end of a string cite comparing the ada with other acts implying preemption of noise regulation at airports.id.at 
what the court did acknowledge,however,was that the role preserved for local airport proprietors in regulating noise levels is a limited one.id.to the extent local restrictions must be reasonable,nonarbitrary,and nondiscriminatory,id.internal quotation marks omitted,nothing in national helicopter suggests that an airport proprietor can satisfy these criteria if he fails to comply with mandated procedures of federal law such as anca for the enactment of such restrictions.to the contrary,actions taken in violation of legal mandates are,by their nature,unreasonable and arbitrary.see generally austin parole comm n,cir.noting that committing procedural error effects result that is unreasonable and therefore in violation of law rodriguez holder,cir.observing that factual findings made without following regulations constitute error of law sierra club van antwerp,cir.a n agency failure to follow its own regulations and procedures is arbitrary and capricious.
accordingly,we conclude that national helicopter does not support the conclusion that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their preemption claim.
a preemption conclusion does not transform federal aviation law contrary to congress intent 
the town further argues that construing anca to preempt the challenged local laws would effectively invalidat e the proprietor exception to preemption expressly reserved by congress in the ada.town reply br.our ruling does no such thing.
in,congress itself cabins airport operators proprietary authority by mandating certain procedures for the enactment of local noise and access restrictions.by,congress had concluded that,at the same time that local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest,the exercise of proprietary authority could not be allowed to produce a patchwork of uncoordinated and inconsistent airport restrictions that impede the national transportation system,cong.rec,statement of ford.thus,anca procedural requirements are properly understood to refine what can constitute a reasonable exercise of the proprietary authority reserved by the ada.see national helicopter of am.city of new york,at recognizing ada to reserve a complementary though more limited role for airport proprietors in regulating noise levels at their airports by promulgating reasonable,nonarbitrary,and nondiscriminatory regulations for noise and other environmental concerns internal citations and quotation marks omitted.local laws not enacted in compliance with anca procedures can not claim to be a reasonable exercise of such authority and,therefore,the federal preemption of such laws does not invalidate reserved proprietary authority contrary to congress intent.
nor does such a preemption conclusion dramatically enlarge the faa role in a manner that congress never intended.town reply br.indeed,the town has failed to demonstrate that events since anca enactment have belied the faa prediction that the statute would not impose substantial burdens on small public airports.see notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions,fed.reg,codified at pt.insofar as the town asserts that the reason only one proprietor has applied for faa approval to impose noise restrictions on stage aircraft is because of the agency vigorous opposition to any airport use restrictions,emphasis in original,the assertion is conclusory and hardly demonstrates that,if more applications were filed,the agency would arbitrarily withhold consent,or that courts would fail to correct any abuse.no more convincing is the town assertion that concerns of time and cost have resulted in only one airport successfully imposing restrictions on certain aircraft operations.see id.to the extent the process is inherently burdensome,that decision was,in the first instance,congress,and not a reason for courts to excuse a party from preemption.to the extent a party considers itself unduly burdened by faa implementation of anca procedures,its remedy is an action to curb agency excess,not relief from preemption.
thus,we reject the town contention that deeming local laws enacted in violation of anca procedural mandates in b and c to be preempted would radically transform federal aviation law by invalidating the proprietor exception reserved in the ada.rather,we conclude that anca establishes what congress thought were necessary procedures for a reasonable exercise of proprietary auth
