the petitions for review in this case challenge orders of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that have the effect of reinstituting an earlier installed capability icap deficiency by electric utilities in new england who fail to meet certain reserve capacity requirements.this court stayed implementation of all but a small portion of the charge pending judicial review.the background is complicated but can be summarized as follows.
in new england,as in other regions of the country,electrical power is furnished through a grid of interconnected intercity transmission lines and local distribution lines within each city or town.power is generated within the region,or purchased from outside,from canada.some utilities engage in all three functions generation,intercity transmission,local distribution but many are local retailers who own only the local distribution facilities within a town and purchase all of their needs from generating utilities that have surplus power 
regulation is divided between ferc and state regulatory commissions,but generally speaking,ferc regulates wholesale transactions,between a utility with a surplus and a local municipal utility that retails power.b fpc conway,d.in the past,power was provided largely on a basis with regulated rates based upon costs but,as in other industries like telecommunications,some power regulators,including ferc,have been moving in recent years toward more reliance upon competition.town of norwood ferc,cir,cert.denied,d.
an abiding concern in regulating electricity supply is the need for adequate reserve capacity.the demand for electricity varies,depending on weather,economic growth,and other factors supply is constrained by the time needed to build new generating plants and by unexpected breakdowns in generation or transmission facilities and electricity can not economically be stored for future use in large quantities.to avoid the extraordinary disruption of blackouts,regulators and utilities calculate reserve requirements based on estimates of how much generating capacity will be needed at the highest point of the peak load.
our case concerns the mechanism for assuring that utilities will have the reserve power needed to satisfy peak demand.because the system as a whole must be built to satisfy peak demand,a good deal of generating capacity is destined to lie idle at least some of the time.a prudent utility that retails power to local customers will purchase from a generating utility a certain amount of reserve effect,capacity that is reserved for that retailer but may be used only rarely.but it is not certain that under present industry conditions the retailer has adequate economic incentive to purchase all the reserve capacity that it needs.and if reserve capacity is not purchased in sufficient amounts,generating utilities may lack the incentive to build as much capacity as is needed to supply peak demand.
the incentive structure in the industry is immensely complicated and economists take different views on how best,cheaply and reliably to secure adequate reserves.but,for a number of years prior to,ferc and the new england utilities under its supervision used the icap deficiency charge as a device to assure that purchasing utilities would buy adequate reserve capacity to cover projected peak load plus a reserve margin.iso new,ferc,at,wl see also municipalities of groton ferc.
in new england,beginning some time before,wholesale tariffs specified that load serving entities lses crudely,electricity to pay a charge if they did not purchase enough reserve capacity.from onward,the charge was per thus,if during a particular period the reserves purchased by an lse fell below its allocated share of all needed reserves,the lse paid the specified charge times the amount of its deficiency.through a complicated arrangement,most of the money went as extra compensation to utilities,supplementing the amounts they earned by selling electrical power and committing reserve capacity.
the theory underlying the figure,which prevailed in new england from to,was that it approximated the cost appropriately amortized to construct a of new generating capacity available for peak demand conditions,plus an additional penalty.the penalty theoretical basis is not crystal clear,but the existence and value of the penalty are not issues in this case.the key issue is whether ferc,after allowing the charge to be abandoned in new england in and,could reinstate it in in the way that it did.
in,new england utilities obtained ferc approval to abandon the flat icap deficiency charge in favor of a auction market for buying additional reserve capacity,that is,required capacity over and above that acquired through bilateral contracts which are common and often.however,the auction market appears not to have been other things,the prices were thought to have been subject to manipulation.in march,iso new england,the independent system operator that manages power transactions on behalf of the utilities in the new england power ferc consent to an end to the auction regime.
on june,ferc released a lengthy order the june order that largely addressed other issues but which toward its end addressed the icap issue in a few paragraphs,iso new,ferc,at.in the order,ferc agreed with that the auction did not work,but,because had not proposed an alternative means to ensure that lses would purchase adequate reserve capacity,ferc said that although it would permit an end to the auction as of august,it would also require the iso to revert to sanctions for failure of lses to meet the existing icap requirement,the projected reserve capacity requirement.id.at.was directed to file tariffs proposing an appropriate icap deficiency charge within days.id.
responded with a filing that proposed a charge of fraction less than percent of the charge that had prevailed from to this figure was proffered as an average price paid for power during on the now abandoned auction market.various utilities who supply surplus power protested bitterly they not only challenged the proposal as unsupported but said that if adopted this minimal figure would become a de facto cap on prices in the market in which much of the reserve capacity is purchased,further reducing incentives for generating utilities to construct new plant.
on december,ferc issued a order the december order rejecting the proposed charge.ferc brushed aside this figure as a token payment,saying that use of the auction average was not appropriate.iso new,ferc,at,wl.ferc then ordered reinstatement of the original figure,effective august,until proposed some other adequate regime.ferc said that represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking unit and represents a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent the construction of new generation.id.at.
petitions for rehearing followed,and ferc deferred the charge pending their disposition.on march,ferc issued a decision on reconsideration the march order,rejecting the petitions with one qualification.iso new,ferc,at,wl.after elaborating on its reasons for disallowing the charge and requiring a return to the level,ferc said that it would make the higher charge effective only from april,onward because of intervening reliance on the figure,it would be used for payments from august,through march.id.
various utilities then petitioned for review in this court,and other utilities intervened on both sides.b.this court then granted petitioners motion to stay the charge pendente lite and expedited briefing.as the stay order permitted,ferc then ordered the charge to continue in effect pending this court review.briefing and oral argument in this court followed.in this court,petitioners and others who support them principally attack the adoption of the charge and,secondarily,the rejection of proposed charge.the standard of review varies,of course,with the particular claim of error 
on review,petitioners main assault is on ferc imposition of the charge.they do not contest ferc statutory power to adopt an icap charge pursuant to its authority to set just and reasonable rates for wholesale power,b,a but they say that the charge is not supported by substantial evidence.we begin with this claim and consider,in later sections,related claims that ferc failed to consider reasonable alternatives and that the orders are procedurally flawed above all,by the lack of an evidentiary hearing.
the basis for the charge.although petitioners caption refers to a lack of substantial evidence for adopting the charge,their attack is actually a challenge to ferc reasoning,substantive judgments,alleged misstatements and asserted failures to discuss issues or evidence.there is,indeed,a good deal to criticize in ferc orders,and we conclude that further proceedings are necessary.however,the criticisms can be understood and assessed only against the background of ferc basic rationale for adopting the charge,and it is useful to set forth at the outset our understanding of what ferc did and why it did it.
as already noted,ferc long ago approved an icap charge for the new england area to cope with what it conceives to be a need to assure adequate plant construction and margin of reserves.such icap charges are used in the new york region and in the area how the matter is handled away from the east coast is less clear.see note below.ferc has been moving federal energy regulation toward more competition,but the transition is far from complete,and no one knows for certain whether special incentives will be needed indefinitely or what kind would work best.
against this background,ferc has insisted that reserve requirements be maintained but,in and,it allowed to substitute a auction market as an enforcement device.that scheme,it appears,did not work and petitioners do not contend otherwise.so ferc simply restored the icap charge for the time being while making clear that it was open to other proposals from or others for a better way to assure adequate reserves.in the abstract,there is nothing in this rationale that is startling,let alone irrational but the devil,as usual,is in the details.
first,petitioners attack ferc statement that represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking generating unit.in fact,say petitioners,ferc has not cited even one iota of evidence in support of this assertion and the highest figure that even the proponents of the charge could muster in affidavits was.petitioners may be correct on the numbers,but the problem is with ferc verbal sloppiness rather than any more fundamental defect.
as petitioners know perfectly well,the figure was,even when adopted years ago,an overstatement of the cost of a peaking unit the record before ferc in these proceedings established that in the peaking unit cost was estimated at about and the balance,and certainly the balance above,see note above,therefore represented a further penalty charge with a different rationale,see new eng.power pool agreement,fpc,wl,petition for denied sub nom.municipalities of groton ferc,petitioners do not even explicitly address,let alone challenge,the rationale for the additional penalty charge.
thus,it is apparent that when ferc called the charge the cost of a peaking unit,it was adopting the original rationale as well as the original figure,but carelessly simplifying the rationale.this is a venial sin except so far as it symbolizes ferc broader failure to address carefully and fully objections to a rate forced of the original might increase local electrical rates in new england by many millions of dollars annually.
admittedly,the actual impact of the charge on retail electric rates in new england is not dire predictions from retailing utilities.the icap charge is paid only if an lse fails to buy adequate reserve capacity in advance the charge,including the penalty,is the spur to do so.so if lses comply with their obligations through bilateral contracts,there remains a question as to how much the background icap charge will drive up retail prices in new england.in any event,ferc description of as an approximation of generation costs is not a serious problem,unless actual peaking costs are shown to have fallen an issue to which we return below.
petitioners second claim of error is more basic.petitioners point to ferc central determination that represents a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent,create the incentive for the construction of new generation.they then say that showed that there was enough planned construction in new england to provide adequate reserves without the charge that ferc did not respond to affidavit showings by opponents that the charge was unnecessary that there is nothing to show that a charge above is needed and that merely to point to the prior charge is insufficient given the lapse in time and changes in the industry.
these contentions have more force than ferc admits but less than petitioners pretend.as to whether any charge is needed,ferc says on appeal that this issue is not properly presented because it was decided by ferc in its june order and judicial review from that order has not been sought.but the reason review has not been sought is that petitions for rehearing were filed at ferc and ferc has still not acted upon them.we doubt that an agency can use a prior order as a premise for a drastic second possibly multimillion dollar rate insulate the premise from review by failing to act on rehearing petitions.competitive telecomms.ass fcc.
in all events,the question whether any charge is needed overlaps with the further questions whether a substantial charge is needed and whether,or some other figure should be used.this last question,at least,was not decided in the june order indeed,it arose in response to that order.nor did ferc make in the june order any detailed findings of a kind that might control at the second stage,the setting of an interim charge.in short,ferc jurisdictional objection to our consideration of the claimed error is hollow.
on the other hand,petitioners own claims on the merits are overstated.that says reserves are adequate without a charge proves little it appears that most of the utilities served by are net buyers and have a incentive to object to a charge.and even if present plans promise ample new construction,ferc orders bolstered by affidavits presented below apparently reflect the reasonable view that plans are only that and can easily be affected by the prospect that reserve requirements for buyers will or will not have teeth.if a buying utility can purchase below its reserve requirement without penalty,it may find it worthwhile to do so most of the counting on the system to bail it out in a crisis.
the more difficult question concerns ferc failure to discuss in any detail the extensive affidavit filings by objectors who claim the current state of the industry and conditions in new substantial charge or at least none greater than is needed.some of these filings are by recognized experts and are substantial and detailed and although there are from utilities who are presumably net sellers,this is the kind of material that one would normally expect an agency to analyze seriously in its decision before making drastic changes,especially where millions of dollars may ride on the outcome,noram gas transmission ferc,k n energy,ferc.
yet this case is not the typical one in which something drastic is being done for the first time.the reserve requirements have long existed in new england and are not directly challenged by petitioners.and enforcement through a substantial icap charge indeed,from on with the precise figure had been standard practice in new england for over a decade before the temporary use of an auction in and which was either a failure as ferc found or at least not successful enough for petitioners to defend in this court.so ferc best answer is that the real status quo ante is the figure and that the burden was really upon petitioners to justify a departure,no charge or something less than.
no one has cited any case law closely in point,but common sense suggests the answer.ferc did not in the first instance have to provide additional justification either for the need for a substantial charge or for the figure but given the detailed arguments in opposition and the possible dollar impact of reinstatement of the charge,it owed petitioners and the public who will likely pay some of any icap charge through retail rate increases some explanation as to why ferc was not persuaded by petitioners efforts to discredit the notion of a substantial charge in general or the charge in particular.
undoubtedly ferc was annoyed,perhaps rightly,when its direction to to reinstitute an administrative charge was met by a proposal that ferc regarded as risible a figure that was a tiny fraction of the prior charge and of the icap charges prevailing elsewhere on the atlantic coast and given the impact of any widespread power shortage,ferc has every reason to want effective enforcement of reserve requirements,even if enforcement comes at a high price.still,ferc is not therefore excused from explaining its actions.addressing contrary arguments is part of establishing public acceptability and,in any event,is part of ferc own responsibility.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
what we have said applies as much to the specific choice of the figure as to the need for a substantial charge.absent evidence of significant change in construction costs,ferc was entitled to revert to the figure rather than justify it afresh in the first instance.area rate cases fpc,cir,cert.denied,d but it was not entitled to ignore claims that the cost of peaking facilities is less than it was in the past.such claims have been made in this case perhaps they can be easily answered or,if lengthy proceedings would be needed to do so,ferc may be able to justify restoring the charge on a provisional basis while making the evaluation.but some response from ferc is required.
an agency expert judgments are entitled to deference,especially where safety concerns are on one side of the balance,as they are here,chem.waste,epa,k n energy,at.if ferc had provided even a semblance of serious discussion as to why a substantial icap charge was still required and why the figure was the best solution on short notice,quite probably the charge would be sustained outright.california recent experience is likely irrelevant as to immediate causes but not as to consequences.but this is all the more reason for ferc to write a decision reflecting a serious look at objections.
alternatives.in addition to attacking the charge as unsupported,petitioners make a series of further arguments,beginning with the claim that ferc failed to consider reasonable alternatives to the charge,which it was obligated to do under reasoned principles.petitioners say that ferc only response was that it was inappropriate to consider these alternatives when proposed in a rehearing request,and they contend that this response is inadequate because rehearing was the first time in which parties opposed to the charge could propose alternatives.
petitioners have markedly overstated any legitimate grievance.broadly speaking,agencies are expected to consider reasonable alternatives to proposed actions,farmers union cent,ferc,cert.denied,d but here ferc did not refuse to consider alternatives or rest only on the failure to present the alternatives earlier.it said that the record did not provide a basis to sustain the main alternative urged,using bilateral contract prices to construct an icap charge and that was welcome to formulate alternatives and support them in a new filing.iso new,ferc,at.
furthermore,the sense that agencies should address alternatives before acting is not hard and fast if prompt action is necessary and delay would be harmful,agencies sometimes do need to take interim action,deferring to further proceedings other facets of the problem or alternative solutions that may take more time to develop.see competitive telecomms.ass n,at air carrier ass civil aeronautics.and,for multiple reasons in this case,there is nothing unreasonable in ferc demand that proponents furnish the proposed alternatives with adequate support.
it is quite true that ferc should have said more to explain why it concluded that the record in this proceeding does not contain adequate information to support a just and reasonable icap deficiency charge based on prices in the bilateral market.iso new,ferc,at.this is so even if we assume,with ferc,that petitioners could have pointed to such alternatives before the december order,knowing that protests to the earlier compliance filing had urged that the charge be.but ferc did address the main alternative and found it wanting even if ferc explanation was too cryptic the alternative was not rejected simply because it was belatedly offered.
in all events,on remand ferc should explain why,on this record,the prices are not an adequately supported substitute.if other substantial alternatives were presented,ferc should also address them.but we harbor some doubts about the strength of petitioners claim as to other alternatives it is hard in their briefs to find any substantial discussion of what the alternatives were and why absent the charge they might be expected effectively to enforce the reserve obligations that already exist.
the charge.this brings us to petitioners next objection,which is superficially quite different because it focuses on the rejection of the charge rather than the adoption of the charge.although petitioners do not contest ferc general authority to review the charge,they say that under established case law,ferc had no power to reject proposal without a hearing because it was not procedurally deficient or substantively a nullity,mun.light bds.fpc,cert.denied,d.petitioners also say that the reasons given by ferc for the rejection were unsound or unsupported.
there is a body of case law,not entirely consistent in rhetoric or substance,that limits the power of federal ratemaking agencies like ferc summarily to reject new tariffs except as to narrow grounds the case law is a gloss on statutory procedures designed to allow carriers to institute rate changes on their own initiative and,subject both to temporary delay or suspension and to refund of obligations,to place new rates into effect during agency investigation and hearing,at t fcc,cir.but the charge was not just a typical rate charge but was purportedly filed in compliance with ferc june order.
here,ferc says that the rate was inconsistent with its june order and that that order can not be attacked in this proceeding.the two propositions are quite different.we have already explained why the premises of the june order can not be insulated from criticism insofar as those premises are used to support ferc later actions.however,the fact that the june order is still before ferc on rehearing petitions does not prevent ferc from relying upon it in evaluating a purported compliance filing,which is just what the proposal constituted.the june order was effective unless stayed,and no stay was secured either from ferc or from a reviewing court.
according to ferc december order rejecting the proposal,the charge was a nominal rather than a plausible response to the june directive.if ferc was correct,it was entitled to reject the filing as patently inconsistent with an existing,unstayed directive.a utility is not entitled to a hearing before the portion of its rate filing is rejected or when it challenges an established policy,jersey cent.power light ferc,internal citations omitted see also anr pipeline ferc.ferc certainly did make a determination of,and in this determination it enjoys a favorable standard of review,pepperell assocs.epa,cir whether ferc adequately explained the determination is a different question.
in critiquing the determination,petitioners focus on a terse and arguably confusing statement by ferc that the was merely an average derived from the now abandoned auction market and was not useful.yet,fairly read,ferc june order clearly envisaged a return to a substantial icap charge and the core concept of such a charge has long been in new england,and still is in other atlantic coast regions,the cost of adding new peak load generating capacity not excluding a possible penalty as well.that cost is far above and probably lies in the range.on this premise,the proposal was plainly,and ferc rejection of the proposal was therefore well justified.
procedural matters.petitioners final argument on
