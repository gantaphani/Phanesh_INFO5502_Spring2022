opinion of the court 
tonin pllumi pllumi is a native and citizen of albania who entered the united states illegally and has been found removable pursuant to a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i.pllumi has filed a petition for review based on the denial by the board of immigration appeals bia of his motion asking the bia to reopen his immigration proceedings and reconsider its decision declining to grant him asylum.the bia denied his motion as untimely and chose not to exercise its authority to reopen the case sua sponte.pllumi claims that the decision not to reopen requires remand because the bia abused its discretion in determining that he had failed to demonstrate changed country conditions,and because the bia predicated its refusal to reopen on the erroneous belief that healthcare concerns can not be a basis for asylum.although we conclude that the first of those arguments is meritless,there may be merit in the second.because the basis upon which the bia declined to exercise its authority to reopen sua sponte is unclear,we will grant the petition for review and remand so that the bia can clarify its decision.
background 
pllumi filed his original application for asylum and withholding of removal on june.in,he supplemented that application and added a claim under the convention against torture cat.in support of his application,pllumi asserted that he had suffered persecution because of his active support of albania democratic party and because he is catholic.further,pllumi alleged that he feared he would again be persecuted for his political and religious beliefs if he were returned to albania.ultimately,the immigration judge ij denied him all relief,holding that pllumi had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution 
pllumi appealed that decision and,on june,the bia upheld the ij decision,concluding that,even if pllumi were credible,he had not established a fear of persecution and thus had failed to establish his eligibility for relief.in its decision,the bia also determined that pllumi was ineligible for humanitarian asylum under either subsection a or b of b iii because,first,any persecution he had suffered in the past was not so severe as to constitute a compelling reason under subsection a for pllumi to be unwilling or unable to return to his home country and,second,he had failed to establish that,as required by subsection b,he would be subject to other serious harm upon removal.because pllumi had not established asylum eligibility,it followed that he had also failed to satisfy the higher burden of proof required for withholding of removal.ar at.additionally,the bia held that pllumi did not qualify for cat protection because he had failed to establish that it was more likely than not he would be tortured upon return to albania.
on september,pllumi filed the motion that is the subject of this petition for review.he argued that,based upon evidence that he would suffer serious harm upon removal,the bia should reopen his immigration proceedings and reconsider its prior decision.specifically,pllumi argued that he is entitled to humanitarian asylum because,regardless of whether he showed he had been or would be persecuted,he would suffer other serious harm if he were sent back to albania because he would have to rely on albania healthcare system,which he says is poorer than the united states system and insufficient to treat severe injuries he sustained in a car accident.he contended that the harm he faced from substandard medical care warranted the bia exercise of its authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings,even if his motion to reopen was deemed untimely.pllumi also argued that the bia should reopen his proceedings based on changed country conditions in albania 
on october,the bia denied pllumi motion to reopen and reconsider,holding that it was untimely as to pllumi argument of harm from substandard healthcare,the bia said 
pllumi concerns about his future healthcare on his return to albania are not relevant to his persecution claim.we separately note that the respondent may address a request for humanitarian parole for medical treatment to the dhs,as requests for deferred action are within the jurisdiction of dhs,not the immigration courts or this board.
ar at.the bia concluded that pllumi had not presented an exceptional situation which would warrant reopening and declined to exercise its authority to reopen his case sua sponte.
pllumi has petitioned for review of the bia decision that he failed to demonstrate changed country conditions such that he would be eligible for reopening under c ii.alternatively,he contends that his petition should be granted because the bia refusal to sua sponte reopen his proceedings is predicated on an error of law.
ii.standard of review 
in immigration cases,we review a denial of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion,regardless of the underlying basis of the alien request for relief.ins doherty,ezeagwuna ashcroft,cir.we give the bia decision broad deference and generally do not disturb it unless it is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.filja gonzales,cir citation and quotation omitted.
however,motions that ask the bia to sua sponte reopen a are of a different character.because such motions are committed to the unfettered discretion of the bia,we lack jurisdiction to review a decision on whether and how to exercise that discretion calle vujiles ashcroft,cir.nevertheless,in mahmood holder the united states court of appeals for the second circuit suggested that there is jurisdiction to remand to the bia for reconsideration when the bia decision to decline to exercise its sua sponte authority is based on a misperception of the relevant law,cir.in mahmood,the petitioner,a native of pakistan,filed for an adjustment of status after his marriage to a citizen.id.at.the department of homeland security dhs found that the marriage had been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws and,as a result,declined to adjust mahmood status.id.at.mahmood was then granted a day voluntary departure period with an alternative order of removal to pakistan.id.during that period,mahmood divorced his first wife and,shortly thereafter,married another citizen and filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.id.he also sought to stay his voluntary departure,saying,he would not have agreed to it had he understood the terms.id.the ij held that mahmood motion was untimely and that sua sponte reopening would be futile because mahmood was barred from adjustment of status for a period of ten years because of his prior failure to depart.id.mahmood then filed an appeal,which the bia dismissed for essentially the same reasons.id.at.
later,the supreme court in dada mukasey,held that an alien could unilaterally withdraw from voluntary departure so as to pursue a motion to reopen.mahmood,at.that meant that mahmood stated desire to retract his decision to voluntarily depart would not have resulted in a bar to an adjustment of his status,as the bia and ij had thought when denying the motion to reopen.in light of dada,the second circuit determined that it was error for the ij and bia to assume that mahmood failure to timely depart from the united states conclusively barred an adjustment of his status and thus sua sponte reopening was not necessarily futile.id.at.recognizing that it generally lacked jurisdiction to review the bia decision to deny sua sponte reopening,the second circuit nevertheless remanded the case so that the bia could reconsider it in light of dada.id.at.the court decided it could exercise jurisdiction where the agency may have declined to exercise its sua sponte authority because it misperceived the legal background and thought,incorrectly,that a reopening would necessarily fail.id.at.
we have not previously had occasion to consider whether a question of law arising in the context of a request for sua sponte reopening,as was implicated in mahmood,gives rise to our jurisdiction.as noted earlier,we typically can not review a bia decision to deny sua sponte reopening.that jurisdictional limitation is a product of precedent noti
