iwan mandycz challenges the district court determination that he illegally procured his naturalization as an american citizen by failing to acknowledge his service as a prison guard in two concentration camps during world war ii.see a.in bringing this challenge,he argues that the denaturalization order is not supported by the evidence,that the trial violated his due process rights,that laches barred the government from bringing this action and that the court erred in admitting certain evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule.we affirm.
on january,iwan mandycz was born in,a small village located in what was then poland,for a time was nazi germany,for a longer time was the soviet union and is now ukraine.in the summer of,as part of operation barbarossa,nazi germany took control of poland and,with it.
as the war began to turn against germany in and,the country committed increasing numbers of troops to the eastern and western fronts,forcing it to recruit eastern europeans to fill positions vacated by the mobilized germans.from february to april,various ss units schutzstaffel or protection squads,ja recruited men from the area to work as guards wachmann at german concentration and camps.mandycz was one such recruit.
on april,mandycz arrived by train at an ss training camp in trawniki,poland,where the germans assigned him a unique identification.all guards at trawniki signed a declaration that they were subject to the disciplinary code of police troops and not to the jurisdiction of local or german civil courts.ja expert testimony.all guards received rifles and live ammunition.ja.all guards received service pay,free food,medical care,shelter and clothing,ja.and all guards were eligible for both an informal type of leave that might last an afternoon or for a single day,or more formally issued leave that would run anywhere from one week to three weeks.ja.the germans did not treat the guards as part of the german army but as part of the german police ap p aratus.ja.
adjacent to the training camp was a camp in which the ss and police authorities incarcerated up to jewish prisoners and compelled them to work in industries.ja.as part of their training,the trawniki enrollees guarded the camp.
a german transfer roster,dated may,indicates that the germans transferred wachmann,identified as iwan manditsch,to another polish labor camp,poniatowa.ja.on november,while mandycz worked as a guard at poniatowa,the nazis massacred approximately prisoners held at the labor camp.during the massacre,guards cordoned off the camp while german ss troops forced jewish men,women and children to stand in long,wide trenches,where the ss troops shot them with machine guns.the shooting lasted all day long until the early evening,ja,after which the ss troops burned the victims bodies.
a second transfer roster indicates that on november,the germans transferred wachmann,identified as iwan manntitsch,from poniatowa to trawniki.ja.a third transfer roster created three days later indicates that the germans reassigned wachmann,identified as iwan mandytsch,from trawniki to the ss death head guard battalion,sachsenhausen.ja.it is not clear whether guard actually reached sachsenhausen.op.at,and his whereabouts from this point until the end of the war remain unclear.
in,the united nations established the international refugee organization to care for the approximately remaining world war ii refugees in europe.ja see fedorenko united states,d.consistent with this goal,it assisted refugees and displaced persons in returning to their countries of origin or resettling in different countries.ja.two years later,in,congress enacted the displaced persons act to enable european refugees driven from their homelands by the war to emigrate to the united states without regard to traditional immigration quotas.fedorenko,at.
in,mandycz sought to emigrate from salzburg,austria to the united states.to receive an immigrant visa under the displaced persons act,he had to show that he was the concern of the international refugee organization.displaced persons act of,b,stat.defining a displaced person as any displaced person or refugee who is the concern of the international refugee organization.the constitution of the international refugee organization excluded from this category any person who could be shown to have assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations.fedorenko,at.relying on a questionnaire completed by mandycz,the international refugee organization certified to the displaced persons commission that mandycz had not engaged in persecution.
the commission in turn referred the case to the army counterintelligence corps,which interviewed mandycz to determine whether he was admissible into the united states under authority of the displaced persons act of.ja.mandycz informed the corps that from to he had worked as a forced laborer for the seuring company in vienna.ja.he also produced a birth certificate dated july.the investigators did not have access to the records that would have implicated mandycz as a prison guard because the three rosters identifying iwan mandycz as guard were held behind the iron curtain.ja.the corps also did not receive cooperation from local authorities or security agencies in countries under soviet occupation such as poland and ukraine,so it was difficult to verify the background of applicants from these countries.ja report of mario decapua,head of investigations for the commission after world war ii.in such cases,the corps and commission were forced to rely more heavily on full disclosure and honesty by the applicants.id.at.relying on mandycz representations,the corps reported to the commission that the investigation disclosed no evidence that the subject is or has been a member of,or a participant in,any movement which is or has been hostile to the united states.ja.
on december,while still in austria,mandycz received his visa.he sailed from bremerhaven,germany,later that month,and on december,he entered the united states.on may,he applied for naturalization as a united states citizen with the immigration and naturalization service on june,the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan granted his petition for naturalization.mandycz settled in detroit,where he has lived to this day.beginning in or so,he began working at chrysler,first as a janitor and then as an auto worker,and remained employed there until his retirement from the company in.
after the dissolution of the soviet union,the united states gained access to archives that implicated a number of immigrants in assisting nazi germany.in march,the office of special investigations osi,a division of the department of justice that detects and investigates individuals who took part in acts of persecution abroad before and during world war ii,osi website,available at last visited may,received materials from soviet interrogations indicating that an iwan mandycz had served as a guard at the trawniki and poniatowa camps.on september,after additional information implicated mandycz in acts of persecution,osi requested a voluntary interview with him to discuss the materials it had gathered.ja.mandycz declined to be interviewed.id.in march,osi attempted to confirm mandycz birth date with ukrainian authorities.after a couple of years and some prodding by osi,the procurator general of ukraine certified in august that mandycz was born on january,exactly six months earlier than the birth date he had given during the immigration process.
on april,osi filed a complaint in the eastern district of michigan under a to revoke mandycz citizenship,alleging that he had illegally procured it.at some point between and the filing of the complaint,mandycz began to suffer from alzheimer disease.on january,following an examination by osi doctors,the court appointed a guardian under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure to represent mandycz throughout the proceedings.after several pretrial proceedings including a june appeal that this court dismissed as an impermissible interlocutory appeal,see united states mandycz,cir,the district court held a bench trial from june to june.on february,the court determined that mandycz had participated in acts of persecution and revoked his citizenship.
the constitution authorizes congress to establish a uniform rule of naturalization art.i,cl,and naturalization remains a privilege to be given or withheld on such conditions as congress sees fit.schneiderman united states.in exercising this authority,the national legislature has provided for the revocation of illegally procured certificates of naturalization.a naturalized citizen failure to comply with the statutory prerequisites for naturalization renders his certificate of citizenship revocable as illegally procured under a.fedorenko,at.the statutory prerequisite for naturalization in place at the time of mandycz naturalization the immigration and nationality act of,a and required that the individual possess a valid unexpired immigrant visa.id.at.whether mandycz possessed a valid visa turns on the requirements of the displaced persons act.because it is by now well established that service as a guard at a nazi training camp,and subsequent concentration camps,would make him ineligible for a visa under the displaced persons act,united states demjanjuk,cir,the question comes down to this did iwan mandycz serve as a guard at trawniki and poniatowa or,put another way,was he guard if he was,he agrees that he would not have been eligible for a visa in.and if he was,he agrees that he illegally procured his naturalization and that it must be revoked today.
in challenging the district court conclusion that mandycz and guard are one and the same,mandycz makes one substantive argument and three procedural arguments the district court erred in finding he was guard the due process clause prohibited the government from undertaking this denaturalization proceeding once it learned he was suffering from alzheimer disease laches barred the government from bringing this denaturalization proceeding and the district court erred in admitting certain evidence.in resolving these disputes,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,id.at,its conclusions of law for error,id.at,and its evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,id.at.
mandycz begins by contending that osi evidence did not meet the unusually high burden of proof required in denaturalization proceedings.mandycz br.at capitalization removed.the government,it is true,faces a rigorous burden of proof in this setting.schneiderman,at.to set aside such a grant of citizenship the evidence must be clear,unequivocal,and can not be done upon a bare preponderance of evidence which leaves the issue in doubt.internal quotation marks omitted.but in our view,clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence supports the district court finding that mandycz was guard and that he assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations.fedorenko,at.quoting the int l refugee org,annex i,part ii,stat.
the government proof rested on a collection of german rosters,which identified mandycz as guard,and evidence corroborating that identification.first,the three rosters identify guard as having the same first name as iwan mandycz and as having a last name that phonetically matches mandycz last name.the rosters variously describe guard as iwan manditsch,ja,iwan manntitsch,ja,and iwan mandytsch,ja.each spelling of the last name,sure enough,does not match mandycz letter for letter,but the differences are fairly explained.as the evidence showed,german clerks processing eastern european guards repeatedly faced challenges in transliterating unfamiliar names.the name mandycz was no exception his last name ends with a sound that is rendered sh in english,cz in polish,ch in russian and sch in german.ja expert testimony.a similar problem plagued the clerks in trying to reduce the initial sound of the second syllable of mandycz name to variations from dy to di to ti.ja expert testimony see also id.as a result of haphazard transliteration decisions and general difficulties with foreign names,the german clerks spelled names inconsistently throughout their records.because guard had the same first name as mandycz and the same phonetic last name as mandycz,the transfer records support the district court decision.see generally grannis ordean.but,even in names,due process of law does not require ideal accuracy.in the spelling and pronunciation of proper names there are no generally accepted standards and the doctrine of idem sonans the same sound is a recognition of this.united states emuegbunam,cir emuegbunem argument that the misspelling of his name vitiates the indictment is likewise unavailing.a name need not be correctly spelled in an indictment,if substantially the same sound is preserved.internal quotation marks omitted.
second,in addition to matching mandycz first name exactly and his last name phonetically,the rosters identify his acknowledged place of birth and the only ascertainable date of birth for him.the third roster identifies iwan mandytsch,as being born on january in oliwa koroliwka,horodenka.ja.this birthplace matches mandycz admitted birthplace and represents the birth date of the only iwan mandycz for whom the ukrainian government has a record of birth in.the parents listed on his ukrainian birth certificate dmytro mandych and mariya skits ko,ja match the names admitted by mandycz to be those of his parents dmytro mandycz and maria skidzka,ja.and the evidence supported the district court conclusion that no other iwan mandycz was born in in.mandycz,it is true,proffered a birth certificate dated july in connection with his application for an immigration visa.ja.but forensic analysis revealed that the date on this birth certificate,exactly six months after the date listed on the certificate and the transfer roster,could not be trusted because the authenticating stamp on the document had been hand retouched.ja.this evidence led the forensic expert and the district court to determine that the birth certificate should not be considered an authentic document when it comes to the july birth date listed there.ja.
third,the numbers further eliminate the possibility that the transfer rosters identify someone other than the defendant.in each instance,the roster lists mandycz name next to the same.expert testimony,credited by the district court,showed that these numbers were specific to the individual guard and were never changed as long as he belonged to the guard forces of the ss.ja.trawniki officials never or recycled the identification numbers of discharged men.ja.nor were these numbers reassigned after a man left the guard forces or was killed.ja.the repeated correlation of the same name mandycz with the same number,in combination with the biographical information listed on the third roster,provides compelling evidence that there was one and only one iwan mandycz who was born in and who served as guard.
fourth,still other evidence corroborates the information contained in the transfer rosters.statements made by other trawniki guards during postwar soviet interrogations identified mandycz as a guard at trawniki and poniatowa and correctly remembered his birth date,birthplace,rank,nationality and itinerary.guard stepan perig remembered ivan dmitrievich mandych and remembered that his year of birth was,that his place of birth is in,that h e enrolled in the ss police training camp in travniki in april,that h e underwent special training and guarded prisoners and that h e guarded prisoners in the camp of ponyatovo.ja.ivan sidorak also remembered ivan dmitrievich mandych and remembered that his year of birth was approximately,that h is place of birth is in the village of olievo korolivka,that h e is ukrainian by nationality,that h e was drafted with me to serve in the ss and that h e served as a wachmann in the ss police training camp in travniki from april until october,after which he was sent to the death camp in ponyatovo.ja.
perig and sidorak recollection of the middle name dmitrievich further ties mandycz to guard.as a patronymic,a name derived from one father,the middle name of dmitrievich connects mandycz to his father,whose name mandycz concedes is dmytro.
still another individual,vasilij gajdich,recalled that mandich and i arrived at the ss police training camp at travniki at the same time,that h e swore an oath and gave a commitment of voluntary service for the german punitive organs,that h e underwent a specialized course of training,after which he served as an ss wachmann and guarded prisoners and that u pon completing training,he and i were sent to the ss camp in ponyatovo.ja see.
fifth,mandycz postwar relationship with petro perih,another guard at trawniki,corroborates the district court identification finding.during the postwar interrogations,perig and sidorak stated that petro perih had served at trawniki.see ja perig perih arrived at the ss training camp in travniki with me.ja sidorak from april,perih served at the ss police training camp in travniki.he performed the duties of an ss wachmann.they also gave similar estimates of perih date of birth or and remembered that he came from the same hometown.perih canadian immigration documents tie him to the perih remembered by perig and sidorak,as they state that he was born in in.after the war,perih attended the wedding of mandycz daughter.mandycz telephone records also reveal that shortly before the government filed the complaint in this case,someone used his telephone to place three calls to perih home.mandycz also listed petro perih during discovery in this case as a person who would have knowledge or information concerning your whereabouts,employment or activities in europe between or including and.ja.as the district court permissibly found,mandycz contacts with petro perih corroborate mandycz identification with guard.op.at.
while considerable direct and corroborating evidence links mandycz to guard,little evidence supports his contrary account of activities between and his arrival in this country.in one version of events,recounted in his october visa application,mandycz claimed to work for a seuring company located in vienna,austria.ja.yet neither mandycz nor anyone else has produced any evidence showing that such a company existed.r esearch has not turned up any record that a firm by the name of seuring or seyring ever existed in vienna,ja expert testimony,and mandycz stated in his deposition that he had never worked in vienna and did not think that he had worked at seuring.
in another version of events,recounted by mandycz and confirmed by his daughter based on what mandycz has told her throughout her life,mandycz did not work in vienna,but resided in a camp in the linz austria area and was assigned out frequently to different farmers to work as an agricultural laborer.ja.yet the account of mandycz as a forced agricultural worker has no documentary support and conflicts with other evidence.see ja noting that no extant account depicts living in a camp with others and being picked up as needed by local farmers ja noting that a gricultural laborers typically lived on the farms where they worked because german labor authorities realized significant cost savings by shifting the costs onto individual farmers ja f orced laborers who were forced to reside in camps together were generally deployed at industrial concerns or in rural processing factories.austria also created records for forced laborers in the event the laborer destroyed property of the employer,but the austrian government search for records verifying that mandycz served as a forced laborer during world war ii produced no evidence that iwan mandycz resided as a forced laborer or was employed as a forced laborer in austria between and.ja.in the face of considerable evidence that mandycz was guard and in the absence of competing evidence that he was not,we credit the district court amply supported finding that that is who he was.
trying to fend off this conclusion,mandycz points out that the government did not produce evidence that it has produced in similar denaturalization,a trawniki personnel file that would have contained mandycz photograph and fingerprint as well as other biographical information.doubtless,the district court and we would have preferred the record to contain this highly probative evidence.but just out of trawniki guard files survived the war.so the absence of such a file does not prove that one never existed.the question rather is whether the evidence produced clearly and unequivocally showed that mandycz was guard.the government evidence satisfied that burden,and other courts have credited similar forms and amounts of evidence in reaching similar conclusions.see,united states szehinskyj,cir united states hajda,cir united states tittjung,aff,cir.
mandycz also questions whether the district court should have relied on the soviet interrogations,noting that they contain inconsistencies in his physical description.perig described mandycz as tall,full build,blond hair,ja,while gajdich described him as tall in height,thin build,elongated face,hair,ja.the district court held that i n light of the documentary and corroborating evidence,the variance s in physical descriptions of iwan mandycz provided in the interrogations are factually insignificant and unpersuasive.op.at.
given the considerable documentary and corroborating evidence connecting guard name,birth date,birthplace and parents to mandycz,these modest in two pieces of corroborative,otherwise consistent evidence and concerning shades of hair color and not undermine the district court identification finding.the statements were given in,five years after these two individuals served with mandycz over the course of a period from april to november.p hysical descriptions,as the record confirmed,are often relative and often depend on the of the individual who is describing the person in question.ja.and even if the two men accurately recollected and assessed these physical features,no evidence shows that the two men perceived mandycz at the same time.summer of course may give brown hair a blond appearance,and it would hardly be unusual for guard service during a war to convert a full build into a thin one in a matter of months.in the end,these alleged discrepancies do not undermine the district court other courts have found in similar circumstances.see,hajda,at t here are many explanations for the difference in height and,in any event,the perfect matches in the other categories more than made up for this rather minor difference.the discrepancy in hair color is in the same minor variance.see also,neal acevedo,cir the minor discrepancies in the victim descriptions of neal were brought before the jury by defense counsel.the jury could have rationally discounted these discrepancies in light of the victim positive identification of neal at trial,the other circumstantial evidence connecting neal to the crime,and the problems with neal alibi defense.
mandycz,more generally,contends that the district court should not have credited the soviet interrogation records,noting that in in the district court words three men told canadian authorities that soviet investigators coerced or falsified confessions from them in the.op.at.but in choosing not to credit these recantations,the district court observed that the three statements contradict reliable historical evidence indicating that each individual participated in nazi service and that the three individuals made the statements to avoid implicating themselves in atrocities and other bad acts.id.at.under these circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining categorically to reject the use of any and all soviet interrogation records.see,united states kungys,cir w e reject the suggestion that all depositions taken in the soviet union should be automatically excluded from evidence,rev on other grounds,d.
nor,more specifically,has mandycz shown that the interrogation records used in this instance were of dubious value.the three cited individuals have no connection to mandycz,and the transfer records corroborate the interrogation records that the district court considered.on this record,we can not say that the district court committed reversible error in considering these records.
mandycz next argues that the government violated his due process rights by bringing this denaturalization proceeding against him while he was mentally incompetent.the incompetence of any party to a denaturalization suit,he argues,operates as an absolute bar to the action,and even if that is not the case,the circumstances of his incompetency should have required the district court to halt this proceeding.we disagree.
in september,osi doctors examined mandycz and determined that alzheimer had taken a sufficient toll on him such that he was no longer of sound mind.had the district court found that mandycz was incompetent based on these examinations,that finding would have precluded the government from proceeding against him in a criminal proceeding.as the supreme court has repeatedly and consistently recognized,the criminal prosecution of an incompetent defendant violates due process.cooper oklahoma,d internal quotation marks omitted.a criminal defendant must have sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.dusky united states,d see also cooper,at.the test for competence to stand trial is whether the defendant has the present ability to understand the charges against him and communicate effectively with defense counsel.
the problem is that a denaturalization suit is not a criminal proceeding,schneiderman,at.it is a civil case,addington texas,d see united states joudis,cir denaturalization and deportation are civil proceedings.criminal cases offer many due process,jury trial,indictment,burden of proof,right to civil proceedings,including denaturalization proceedings,do not.see,united states schellong,cir united states koreh,see also ins,d nelson ins,cir.
all of this remains true even when the case involves an incompetent party.see doe city of lafayette,cir nee hao wong ins,cir united states weinstein,cir see also mohamed tebrake,d,united states bonanno organized crime family of la cosa nostra.
so while the commencement of a civil case does not suspend the due process clause,it does alter the fairness requirements of the clause.whereas due process protects incompetent criminal defendants by imposing an outright prohibition on trial,it protects incompetent civil parties by requiring the court to appoint guardians to protect their interests and by judicially ensuring that the guardians protect those interests.see.c the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.see also ferrelli river manor health care,cir t he district judge should be aware that due process considerations attend an incompetency finding and the subsequent appointment of a guardian ad litem.salomon smith barney,harvey,cir,vacated on other grounds,d neilson,cir garrick weaver,cir genesco,cone mills,cir.independent of the court duty to appoint a guardian to look after his interests,mandycz of course also is entitled to the other basic protections of due process in a civil setting.see united states kairys,cir b ecause denaturalization is civil and equitable in nature,due process is satisfied by a fair trial before an impartial decisionmaker.
in mandycz earlier appeal in this case,our court suggested a similar resolution of this issue.soon after osi doctors determined that he was incompetent,mandycz filed an interlocutory appeal seeking to halt the denaturalization proceeding because it was sufficiently akin to a criminal proceeding.in denying leave to appeal,the court noted that d enaturalization proceedings are technically considered suits in equity,not criminal actions.united states mandycz,cir.in civil cases,it added,the competency of a defendant is not irrelevant,of course.incompetent and infant civil defendants are entitled to the appointment of a guardian ad litem.however,a civil defendant mental incompetence does not trigger an abatement of trial as it does in the criminal context.id.citations omitted.whether these earlier statements were necessary to the resolution of the earlier appeal and therefore bind us as part of the law of the case,see moss united states,cir,or represent footnoted dicta unnecessary to the court determination that it lacked jurisdiction over mandycz interlocutory appeal need not detain us.the salient point is that we independently reach the same conclusion today.
perhaps appreciating this entrenched distinction between the civil and criminal due process protections for incompetent individuals,mandycz has filed a supplemental brief indicating that he is not arguing for due process protection for all civil defendants but only for protection for denaturalization defendants facing his unique circumstances.mandycz supp.br.at see id.recognition of such a due process right is only reasonable in light of the extraordinarily unique posture of this case.while we need not decide today whether there could be a denaturalization proceeding in which due process requires more protection than this civil defendant received,mandycz has not convinced us that his circumstances warrant an exception to the rule.in one sense,the district court exceeded the requirements of due process as it appointed a guardian for mandycz without making a finding that he was incompetent the court apparently determined that the examination results of osi doctors sufficed to make the appointment of a guardian appropriate.nor has anyone alleged that the guardian failed to look after mandycz interests or that mandycz otherwise failed to receive a fair trial before an impartial decisionmaker.kairys,at see mandycz supp.br.at conceding that the denial of other criminal procedure,jury denaturalization cases was appropriate because of the assurance that one will still receive a fair trial.
in another sense,the district court was presented with a party who,despite his illness,was able to offer considerable assistance to his defense,a feature of this case that will not invariably be replicated in other civil proceedings involving incompetent parties.keep in mind that the government first notified mandycz of its investigation in when it asked to interview him about whether he had been a guard at nazi labor and concentration camps.and the government filed this complaint in.mandycz first complained about memory loss in,and no one contends that he was unable to assist his defense in when he first learned about this inquiry.indeed,the district court found that mandycz exhibited lucidity at his deposition in may.op.at,as he recounted that he was taken from his home to work on a farm in linz during world war ii,a story that was the same one he told his adult daughter throughout her life and to which she was permitted to testify,id.at.he told this story in considerable detail,giving his attorneys ample opportunity to verify his claims and substantiate them with from immigration records,from his family or from acquaintances.
mandycz,notably,has not challenged the district court finding that he exhibited lucidity at his deposition or the court finding that his daughter independent recollections corroborated his version of events.compare ja,mandycz agreeing that in the germans were recruiting young men in,and remembering that he was taken t o austria to work,to linz in austria,and that after the war ended,he went t o salzburg with donna christina depo.at daughter he said linz was where he stayed i know he was at home,olijewa korliwka,and then he was in linz.then he went to salzburg i think it was and then the war was over.compare also ja mandycz trucks came and they were taking us somewhere to camps and we were told you going to live here.and from here you will be taken to farms.with christina depo.at daughter h e worked on the farm during the summer and stayed in some kind of area where the workers lived.even if we were to acknowledge the possibility of granting an exception to the traditional civil rules for denaturalization proceedings,mandycz has not shown that this is an appropriate case for doing so.
mandycz,finally,points out that an incompetent person may not,as a matter of law,voluntarily renounce his or her citizenship.mandycz br.at.that ma
