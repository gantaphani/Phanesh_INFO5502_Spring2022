this tax administration case presents the question of whether the appellant,christopher iames,may contest his tax liability in a collection due process cdp hearing under section of the internal revenue code.iames unsuccessfully challenged his liability in a preassessment hearing before the office of appeals of the internal revenue service irs.he later sought to raise the same issue before the same administrative unit in his cdp hearing.the office of appeals concluded that section prohibited him from disputing his liability a second time,and the tax court agreed.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the tax court and hold that iames is barred from contesting the issue of his tax liability in the cdp hearing.
we first set forth the statutory framework on cdp hearings before turning to the particulars of this case.
section provides a set of procedural safeguards for taxpayers facing a potential levy action by the irs notice,an administrative hearing,and judicial review.see goza comm r.congress enacted section as part of its broader efforts to reform the irs tax collection process and to protect taxpayers from abusive or arbitrary collection practices.see internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of,pub,b,stat.
before collecting a delinquent tax through a levy on a taxpayer property,the commissioner must notify the taxpayer of his right to a hearing at least thirty days in advance.a.the taxpayer may then contest the levy in an administrative forum known as a collection due process hearing.b.at the taxpayer request,the office of appeals is obligated to furnish an i mpartial officer to hear the taxpayer challenge.b.the officer must verify that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure have been met.c.the hearing itself is informal it may consist of written or oral communications,and a transcript is not required.d.after the office of appeals makes its determination,the taxpayer may petition the tax court for judicial review.d.
in general,cdp hearings may address a broad array of challenges.the taxpayer may raise any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy.c a.permissible issues,the statute notes,include classic matters such as spousal defenses,challenges to the appropriateness of collection actions,and offers of collection alternatives.id.
section also limits the consideration of certain topics.two restrictions on tax liability challenges and issues already raised in prior proceedings are relevant here.section c b authorizes a taxpayer to challenge the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability so long as the taxpayer did not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.c b.this case involves the opportunity to dispute portion of the provision.the statute does not define this term,but the irs has interpreted it to include a prior opportunity for a conference with appeals that was offered either before or after the assessment of the liability.e.in other words,according to the irs,a taxpayer who could have appealed to the office of appeals can not later challenge his tax liability in a cdp hearing.the tax court upheld the irs regulation as a reasonable interpretation of section in lewis commissioner.
section c bars review of any issue that was raised and considered in any previous administrative or judicial proceeding if the person seeking to raise the issue participated meaningfully in the proceeding.c.the commissioner formerly interpreted the provision not to apply to liability issues in light of section c b explicit discussion on that point.see office of chief counsel,internal revenue,notice,at.but the commissioner current interpretation simply restates the statutory language.see office of chief counsel,internal revenue,notice,at.
although the record in this case is sparse,the relevant facts are undisputed.the commissioner proposed a civil penalty of approximately against iames for a reporting violation.before the commissioner assessed the tax,however,iames pursued an administrative appeal.he filed a protest with the office of appeals,challenging the imposition and amount of the penalty.the appeals officer reviewed the file and conducted a telephone conference with iames counsel.during the call,iames counsel requested particular documents the officer agreed to look into the request and hold another conference.the officer followed up by letter a month later to schedule a second phone call.hearing nothing in reply for three weeks,the officer sustained the penalty and closed the case.
the commissioner initiated its administrative collection process and proceeded to assess the penalty.the commissioner also notified iames of the irs intent to levy and informed him of his right to a cdp hearing under section.
iames requested a cdp hearing to challenge his tax liability.he did not request or propose an alternative collection method in lieu of the levy.following two telephone conferences with iames counsel,the office of appeals sustained the commissioner collection action.the notice of determination explained that iames was barred from disputing his tax liability in the cdp proceeding because he was given the opportunity to raise any relevant issues relating to the unpaid tax in the earlier hearing.
undeterred,iames petitioned the tax court to review the notice of determination.the commissioner moved for summary judgment,arguing that section c b and c barred iames from disputing his underlying liability in light of his first appeal.the tax court agreed that liability was and granted summary judgment in the commissioner favor.relying on the text of section c b,the associated regulation,and the lewis decision,the court concluded that iames had a prior opportunity to challenge the existence and the amount of the underlying liability and he may not do so here.after two unsuccessful motions for reconsideration,iames now appeals.
courts of appeals review decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a.accordingly,we review de novo the tax court grant of summary judgment.ripley comm r,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where,as here,no material facts are disputed and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.dreamstreet investments,midcountry bank,cir.
this case implicates both subsections c b and c of section iames seeks to dispute his tax liability in a cdp proceeding despite having already raised the issue in an earlier administrative appeal because the tax court grounded its decision in section c b,we begin with that provision and then consider section c.both subsections,we hold,preclude cdp review of iames tax liability 
section c b,titled underlying liability,allows a taxpayer to challenge his tax liability unless one of two exceptions applies.as noted,the statute provides that the person may raise at the hearing challenges to the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability for any tax period if the person did not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.c b.there is no suggestion that iames received a notice of deficiency.
whether section c b bars iames from disputing his tax liability in his cdp hearing thus depends on whether his chance to request an administrative hearing before the office of appeals qualifies as an opportunity to dispute his tax liability.iames interprets the statute to preclude cdp review only where the taxpayer had a chance to contest his liability in court.he claims that an administrative opportunity such as a hearing before the office of appeals does not activate the bar on cdp liability review.the pertinent regulation,as mentioned above,provides that the availability of a preassessment conference with the office of appeals qualifies as an opportunity to dispute one tax liability.see e.considering the text and structure of section c b as well as the purpose of the cdp provisions more generally,we conclude that such hearings activat
