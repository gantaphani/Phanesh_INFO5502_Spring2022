the bring this suit challenging the validity of an internal revenue service irs final rule implementing the premium tax credit provision of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca or act.the final rule interprets the aca as authorizing the irs to grant tax credits to individuals who purchase health insurance on both insurance exchanges and exchanges created and operated by the department of health and human services hhs.the plaintiffs contend that the irs interpretation is contrary to the language of the statute,which,they assert,authorizes tax credits only for individuals who purchase insurance on exchanges.for reasons explained below,we find that the applicable statutory language is ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.applying deference to the irs determination,however,we uphold the rule as a permissible exercise of the agency discretion.we thus affirm the judgment of the district court.
in march of,congress passed the aca to increase the number of americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.fed of indep.bus.sebelius,nfib.to increase the availability of affordable insurance plans,the act provides for the establishment of exchanges,through which individuals can purchase health care coverage.see aca.critically,the act provides a federal tax credit to millions of low and americans to offset the cost of insurance policies purchased on the exchanges.see.the exchanges facilitate this process by advancing an individual eligible tax credit dollars directly to health insurance providers as a means of reducing the upfront cost of plans to consumers.
section of the act provides that e ach state shall,not later than january,establish an american health benefit exchange.aca b.however,of the act clarifies that a state may elect to establish an exchange.section c further provides that if a state does not elect to establish an exchange by january,or fails to meet certain federal requirements for the exchanges,the secretary of hhs shall establish and operate such exchange within the state aca c.only sixteen states plus the district of columbia have elected to set up their own exchanges the remaining states rely on exchanges.
eligibility for the premium tax credits is calculated according to.this section defines the annual premium assistance credit amount as the sum of the monthly premium assistance amounts for all coverage months of the taxpayer occurring during the taxable year.id.b.a coverage month is one in which the taxpayer is enrolled in a health plan through an exchange established by the state under section.id.c a i see also id.b a b calculating the premium assistance amount in relation to the price of premiums available and enrolled in through an exchange established by the state under.
in addition to the tax credits,the act requires most americans to obtain minimum essential coverage or pay a tax penalty imposed by the irs.id.nfib.at.however,the act includes an unaffordability exemption that excuses individuals for whom the annual cost of health coverage exceeds eight percent of their projected household income.e a.the cost of coverage is calculated as the annual premium for the least expensive insurance plan available on an exchange offered in a consumer state,minus the tax credit described above.id.e b ii.the tax credits thereby reduce the number of individuals exempt from the minimum coverage requirement,and in turn increase the number of individuals who must either purchase health insurance coverage,albeit at a discounted rate,or pay a penalty.
the irs has promulgated regulations making the premium tax credits available to qualifying individuals who purchase health insurance on both and exchanges.see b k health insurance premium tax credit,may,collectively the irs rule.the irs rule provides that the credits shall be available to anyone enrolled in one or more qualified health plans through an exchange,and then adopts by an hhs definition of exchange that includes any exchange,regardless of whether the exchange is established and operated by a state or by hhs.b.individuals who purchase insurance through exchanges are thus eligible for the premium tax credits under the irs rule.in response to commentary that this interpretation might conflict with the text of the statute,the irs issued the following explanation 
the statutory language of section and other provisions of the affordable care act support the interpretation that credits are available to taxpayers who obtain coverage through a state exchange,regional exchange,subsidiary exchange,and the exchange.moreover,the relevant legislative history does not demonstrate that congress intended to limit the premium tax credit to state exchanges.accordingly,the final regulations maintain the rule in the proposed regulations because it is consistent with the language,purpose,and structure of section and the affordable care act as a whole.
the plaintiffs in this case are virginia residents who do not want to purchase comprehensive health insurance.virginia has declined to establish a exchange and is therefore served by the prominent exchange known as.without the premium tax credits,the plaintiffs would be exempt from the individual mandate under the unaffordability exemption.with the credits,however,the reduced costs of the policies available to the plaintiffs subject them to the minimum coverage penalty.according to the plaintiffs,then,as a result of the irs rule,they will incur some financial cost because they will be forced either to purchase insurance or pay the individual mandate penalty.
the plaintiffs complaint alleges that the irs rule exceeds the agency statutory authority,is arbitrary and capricious,and is contrary to law in violation of the administrative procedure act apa.the plaintiffs contend that the statutory language calculating the amount of premium tax credits according to the cost of the insurance policy that the taxpayer enrolled in through an exchange established by the state under precludes the irs interpretation that the credits are also available on national exchanges.b a,c a i emphasis added.the district court disagreed,finding that the statute as a whole clearly evinced congress intent to make the tax credits available nationwide.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,and the plaintiffs timely appealed.
we must first address whether the plaintiffs claims are justiciable.the defendants make two arguments on this point that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the availability of a action acts as an independent bar to the plaintiffs claims under the apa.
we review de novo the legal question of whether plaintiffs have standing to sue.wilson dollar general,cir.article iii standing requires a litigant to demonstrate an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.lujan defenders of wildlife,quoting whitmore arkansas.the plaintiffs premise their standing on the claim that,if they were not eligible for the premium tax credits,they would qualify for the unaffordability exemption in and would therefore not be subject to the tax penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential coverage.thus,because of the credits,the plaintiffs argue that they face a direct financial burden because they are forced either to purchase insurance or pay the penalty.
we agree that this represents a concrete economic injury that is directly traceable to the irs rule.the irs rule forces the plaintiffs to purchase a product they otherwise would not,at an expense to them,or to pay the tax penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate,also subjecting them to some financial cost.although it is counterintuitive,the tax credits,working in tandem with the act individual mandate,impose a financial burden on the plaintiffs.
the defendants argument against standing is premised on the claim that the plaintiffs want to purchase catastrophic insurance coverage,which in some cases is more expensive than subsidized comprehensive coverage required by the act.the defendants thus claim that the plaintiffs have acknowledged they would actually expend more money on a separate policy even if they were eligible for the credits.regardless of the viability of this argument,it rests on an incorrect premise.the defendants misread the plaintiffs complaint,which,while mentioning the possibility that several of the plaintiffs wish to purchase catastrophic coverage,also clearly alleges that each plaintiff does not want to buy comprehensive,coverage and is harmed by having to do so or pay a penalty.the harm in this case is having to choose between coverage and the penalty,both of which represent a financial cost to the plaintiffs.that harm is actual or imminent,and is directly traceable to the irs rule.the plaintiffs thus have standing to present their claims.
the defendants also argue that the availability of a action bars the plaintiffs claims under the apa.the defendants assert that the proper course of action for the plaintiffs is to pay the tax penalty and then present their legal arguments against the irs rule as part of a action brought under either a no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed,or the little tucker act,granting district courts jurisdiction to hear a ny civil action against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws the defendants do not,nor could they,assert this as a jurisdictional bar,but instead point to general equitable principles disfavoring the issuance of federal injunctions against taxes,absent clear proof that available remedies at law are inadequate.bob jones simon.the defendants argue that a tax refund action presents an adequate remedy that the plaintiffs must first pursue before challenging the irs rule directly under the apa.see agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.
the defendants arguments are not persuasive.first,they fail to point to a single case in which a court has refused to entertain a similar suit on the grounds that the parties were required to first pursue a action under a or.moreover,the plaintiffs are not seeking a tax refund they ask for no monetary relief,alleging instead claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in an attempt to forestall the choice in their minds of purchasing a product they do not want or paying the penalty.section a does not allow for prospective relief.instead,it bars suit for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.a emphasis added see also cohen,at section a does not,at least explicitly,allow for prospective relief.similarly,t he little tucker act does not authorize claims that seek primarily equitable relief.berman united states,cir citing richardson morris,bobula united states dep t of justice.
it is clear,then,that the alternative forms of relief suggested by the defendants would not afford the plaintiffs the complete relief they seek.this is simply not a typical tax refund action in which an individual taxpayer complains of the manner in which a tax was assessed or collected and seeks reimbursement for wrongly paid sums.the plaintiffs here challenge the legality of a final agency action,which is consistent with the apa underlying purpose of remov ing obstacles to judicial review of agency action.bowen massachusetts.requiring the plaintiffs to choose between purchasing insurance and thereby waiving their claims or paying the tax and challenging the irs rule after the fact creates just such an obstacle.we therefore find that the plaintiffs suit is not barred under the apa.
turning to the merits,we review questions of statutory construction de novo.orquera ashcroft,cir.because this case concerns a challenge to an agency construction of a statute,we apply the familiar analytic framework set forth in chevron,natural res.def.council.at chevron first step,a court looks to the plain meaning of the statute to determine if the regulation responds to it.chevron,at.if it does,that is the end of the inquiry and the regulation stands.id.however,if the statute is susceptible to multiple interpretations,the court then moves to chevron second step and defers to the agency interpretation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
at step one,i f the statute is clear and unambiguous that is the end of the matter,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.bd.of governors of the fed.reserve dimension fin,quoting chevron,at.a statute is ambiguous only if the disputed language is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.passenger atchison topeka santa fe ry.the objective of chevron step one is not to interpret and apply the statute to resolve a claim,but to determine whether congress intent in enacting it was so clear as to foreclose any other interpretation.grapevine imports,united states.courts should employ all the traditional tools of statutory construction in determining whether congress has clearly expressed its intent regarding the issue in question.chevron,at mfrs.ass dep t of energy,cir.
in construing a statute meaning,the court begin s,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan walker.as described above,provides that the premium assistance amount is the sum of the monthly premium assistance amounts for all coverage months for which the taxpayer is covered during a year.a coverage month is one in which the taxpayer is covered by a qualified health plan enrolled in through an exchange established by the state under of the act.b a.similarly,the statute calculates an individual tax credit by totaling the premium assistance amounts for all coverage months in a given year.id.b.the premium assistance amount is based in part on the cost of the monthly premium for the health plan that the taxpayer purchased through an exchange established by the state under.id.b.
the plaintiffs assert that the plain language of both relevant subsections in is determinative.they contend that in defining the terms coverage months and premium assistance amount by reference to exchanges that are established by the state under,congress limited the availability of tax credits to individuals purchasing insurance on state exchanges.under the plaintiffs construction,the premium credit amount for individuals purchasing insurance through a federal exchange would always be zero.
the plaintiffs primary rationale for their interpretation is that the language says what it says,and that it clearly mentions exchanges under.if congress meant to include exchanges,it would not have specifically chosen the word state or referenced.the federal government is not a state,and so the phrase exchange established by the state under,standing alone,supports the notion that credits are unavailable to consumers on federal exchanges.further,the plaintiffs assert that because state and federal exchanges are referred to separately in and,the omission in of any reference to federal exchanges established under represents an intentional choice on behalf of congress to exclude federal exchanges and include only state exchanges established under.
there can be no question that there is a certain sense to the plaintiffs position.if congress did in fact intend to make the tax credits available to consumers on both state and federal exchanges,it would have been easy to write in broader language,as it did in other places in the statute.see d d i ii referencing exchanges established under this act.
however,when conducting statutory analysis,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.rather,t he meaning or ambiguity of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.with this in mind,the defendants primary counterargument points to aca and,which,when read in tandem with,provide an equally plausible understanding of the statute,and one that comports with the irs interpretation that credits are available nationwide.
as noted,provides that e ach state shall,not later than january,establish an american health benefit exchange referred to in this title as an exchange.it goes on to say that a n exchange shall be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a state,apparently narrowing the definition of exchange to encompass only exchanges.aca d.similarly,the definitions section of the act,b,provides that t he term exchange means an american health benefit exchange established under,further supporting the notion that all exchanges should be considered as if they were established by a state.
of course,directive that each state establish an exchange can not be understood literally in light of,which provides that a state may elect to do so.section c provides that if a state fails to establish an exchange by january,the secretary shall establish and operate such exchange within the state and the secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to implement such other requirements.emphasis added.the defendants position is that the term such exchange refers to a state exchange that is set up and operated by hhs.in other words,the statute mandates the existence of state exchanges,but directs hhs to establish such exchanges when the states fail to do so themselves.in the absence of state action,the federal government is required to step in and create,by definition,an american health benefit exchange established under on behalf of the state.
having thus explained the parties competing primary arguments,the court is of the opinion that the defendants have the stronger position,although only slightly.given that congress defined exchange as an exchange established by the state,it makes sense to read c directive that hhs establish such exchange to mean that the federal government acts on behalf of the state when it establishes its own exchange.however,the court can not ignore the appeal of the plaintiffs argument a literal reading of the statute undoubtedly accords more closely with their position.as such,based solely on the language and context of the most relevant statutory provisions,the court can not say that congress intent is so clear and unambiguous that it foreclose s any other interpretation.grapevine imports,at.
we next examine two other,less directly relevant provisions of the act to see if they shed any more light on congress intent.food and drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,u,a court must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into a harmonious whole.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.first,the defendants argue that reporting provisions in f conflict with the plaintiffs interpretation and confirm that the premium tax credits must be available on exchanges.section f titled reconciliation of credit and advance credit requires the irs to reduce the amount of a taxpayer premium tax credit by the amount of any advance payment of such credit.see f the amount of the credit allowed under this section for any taxable year shall be reduced but not below zero by the amount of any advance payment of such credit.to enable the irs to track these advance payments,the statute requires e ach exchange or any person carrying out or more responsibilities of an exchange under section f or c of the act to provide certain information to the department of the treasury.id.f emphasis added.there is no dispute that the reporting requirements apply regardless of whether an exchange was established by a state or hhs.the exchanges are required to report the following information 
a the level of coverage described in section d of the patient protection and affordable care act and the period such coverage was in effect.
b the total premium for the coverage without regard to the credit under this section or reductions under section of such act.
c the aggregate amount of any advance payment of such credit or reductions under section of such act.
d the name,address,and tin of the primary insured and the name and tin of each other individual obtaining coverage under the policy.
e any information provided to the exchange,including any change of circumstances,necessary to determine eligibility for,and the amount of,such credit.
f information necessary to determine whether a taxpayer has received excess advance payments.
the defendants argue,sensibly,that if premium tax credits were not available on exchanges,there would be no reason to require such exchanges to report the information found in subsections c,e,and f.it is therefore possible to infer from the reporting requirements that congress intended the tax credits to be available on both state and exchanges.the plaintiffs acknowledge that some of the reporting requirements are extraneous for exchanges,but note that the other categories of reportable information,subsections a,b,and d,remain relevant even in the absence of credits.the plaintiffs suggest that congress was simply saving itself the trouble of writing two separate subsections,one for each type of exchange,by including a single comprehensive list.
the second source of potentially irreconcilable language offered by the defendants concerns the qualified individuals provision under aca.that section sets forth provisions regarding which individuals may purchase insurance from the exchanges.it provides that only qualified individuals may purchase health plans in the individual markets offered through the exchanges,and explains that a qualified individual is a person who resides in the state that established the exchange.aca.the defendants argue that unless their reading of is adopted and understood to mean that the federal government stands in the shoes of the state for purposes of establishing an exchange,there would be no qualified individuals existing in the states with exchanges because none of those states is a state that established the exchange.this would leave the federal exchanges with no eligible customers,a result congress could not possibly have intended.
the plaintiffs acknowledge that this would be untenable,and suggest that the residency requirement is only applicable to exchanges.they note that states that a qualified individual with respect to an exchange is one who resides in the state that established the exchange.aca f a emphasis added.accordingly,because exchange is defined as an exchange established under,the provision directing states to establish exchanges,the residency requirement only limits enrollment on state exchanges.
having considered the parties competing arguments on both of the sections,we remain unpersuaded by either side.again,while we think the defendants make the better of the two cases,we are not convinced that either of the purported statutory conflicts render congress intent clear.both parties offer reasonable arguments and counterarguments that make discerning congress intent difficult.additionally,we note that the supreme court has recently reiterated the admonition that courts avoid revising ambiguously drafted legislation out of an effort to avoid apparent anomal ies within a statute.michigan bay mills indian,slip op.at may.it is not especially surprising that in a bill of this size titles stretch ing over pages and contain ing hundreds of provisions,nfib.at,there would be one or more conflicting provisions.see bay mills,at truth be told,such anomalies often arise from statutes,if for no other reason than that congress typically legislates by parts.wary of granting excessive analytical weight to relatively minor conflicts within a statute of this size,we decline to accept the defendants arguments as dispositive of congress intent.
the act legislative history is also not particularly illuminating on the issue of tax credits.see philip morris usa,vilsack,cir considering legislative history at chevron step one.but see mfrs.ass n,at noting that,in consulting legislative history at step one of chevron,we have utilized such history only for limited purposes,and only after exhausting more reliable tools of construction.as both parties concede,the legislative history of the act is somewhat lacking,particularly for a bill of this size several floor statements from senators support the notion that it was well understood that tax credits would be available for low and americans nationwide.for example,senator baucus stated that the tax credits will help to ensure all americans can afford quality health insurance.cong.rec.he later estimated that percent of those who are getting insurance in the individual market on the exchange will get tax credits cong.rec.similarly,senator durbin stated that half of the million americans today who have no health insurance will qualify for tax credits to help them pay their premiums so they can have and afford health insurance.cong.rec.these figures only make sense if all financially eligible americans are understood to have access to the credits.
however,it is possible that such statements were made under the assumption that every state would in fact establish its own exchange.as the district court stated,congress did not expect the states to turn down federal funds and fail to create and run their own exchanges.king sebelius,cv,wl,at.the senators statements therefore do not necessarily address the question of whether the credits would remain available in the absence of exchanges.the plaintiffs argue extensively that congress could not have anticipated that so few states would establish their own exchanges.indeed,they argue that congress attempted to coerce the states into establishing exchanges by conditioning the availability of the credits on the presence of state exchanges.the plaintiffs contend that congress struck an internal bargain in which it decided to favor exchanges by incentivizing their creation with billions of dollars of tax credits.according to the plaintiffs,however,congress plan backfired when a majority of states refused to establish their own exchanges,in spite of the incentives.the plaintiffs thus acknowledge that the lack of widely available tax credits is counter to congress original intentions,but consider this the product of a congressional miscalculation that the courts have no business correcting.
although the plaintiffs offer no compelling support in the legislative record for their argument it is at least plausible that congress would have wanted to ensure state involvement in the creation and operation of the exchanges.such an approach would certainly comport with a literal reading of text.in any event,it is certainly possible that the senators quoted above were speaking under the assumption that each state would establish its own exchange,and that they could not have envisioned the issue currently being litigated.although congress included a fallback provision in the event the states failed to act,it is not clear from the legislative record how large a role congress expected the federal exchanges to play in administering the act.we are thus of the opinion that nothing in the legislative history of the act provides compelling support for either side position.
having examined the plain language and context of the most relevant statutory sections,the context and structure of related provisions,and the legislative history of the act,we are unable to say definitively that congress limited the premium tax credits to individuals living in states with exchanges.we note again that,on the whole,the defendants have the better of the statutory construction arguments,but that they fail to carry the day.simply put,the statute is ambiguous and subject to at least two different interpretations.as a result,we are unable to resolve the case in either party favor at the first step of the chevron analysis.
finding that congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we move to chevron second step.at.at step two,we ask whether the agency action is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.we will not usurp an agency interpretive authority by supplanting its construction with our own,so long as the interpretation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.a construction meets this standard if it represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute.philip morris,at quoting chevron,at.we have been clear that r eview under this standard is highly deferential,with a presumption in favor of finding the agency action valid.ohio vall.envt l coalition aracoma coal,cir.
as explained,we can not discern whether congress intended one way or another to make the tax credits available on exchanges.the relevant statutory sections appear to conflict with one another,yielding different possible interpretations.in light of this uncertainty,this is a suitable case in which to apply the principles of deference called for by chevron.see scialabba cuellar de osorio,slip op.at june,i nternal tension in a statute makes possible alternative reasonable constructions,bringing into correspondence in one way or another the section different parts.and when that is so,chevron dictates that a court defer to the agency choice plurality opinion mfrs.ass n,at w e have reached chevron second step after describing statutory language as susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions.quoting.dep t of health and mental hygiene centers for medicare and medicaid,cir 
what we must decide is whether the statute permits the irs to decide whether the tax credits would be available on federal exchanges.in answering this question in the affirmative we are primarily persuaded by the irs rule advancement of the broad policy goals of the act.see vill.of barrington surface transp,w hen an agency interprets ambiguities in its organic statute,it is entirely appropriate for that agency to consider policy arguments that are rationally related to the statute goals.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.pub.serv.epa,a s long as the agency stays within congress delegation,it is free to make policy choices in interpreting the statute,and such interpretations are entitled to deference.quotation marks omitted.there is no question that the act was intended as a major overhaul of the nation entire health insurance market.the supreme court has recognized the broad policy goals of the act to increase the number of americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.nfib.at.similarly,title i of the aca is titled quality,affordable health care for all americans emphasis added.
several provisions of the act are necessary to achieving these goals.to begin with,the individual mandate requires nearly all americans to have health insurance or pay a fine.increasing the pool of insured individuals has the intended of increasing revenue for insurance providers.the increased revenue,in turn,supports several more specific policy goals contained in the act.the most prominent of these are the and provisions.in short,these provisions bar insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because of an individual health status.see aca.however,these requirements,standing alone,would result in an adverse selection scenario whereby individuals disproportionately likely to utilize health care would drive up the costs of policies available on the exchanges.
congress understood that one way to avoid such price increases was to require participation in the insurance marketplace via the individual mandate.in combination with the individual mandate,congress authorized broad incentives totaling hundreds of billions of dollars to further increase market participation among low and individuals.a congressional budget office report issued while the act was under consideration informed congress that there would be an an influx of enrollees with spending for health care,who would purchase coverage because of the new subsidies to be provided and the individual mandate to be imposed.the report further advised congress that t he substantial premium subsidies available in the exchanges would encourage the enrollment of a broad range of people and that the structure of the premium tax credits,under which federal subsidies increase if premiums rise,would dampen the chances that a cycle of rising premiums and declining enrollment would ensue.as the defendants further explain,denying tax credits to individuals shopping on federal exchanges would throw a debilitating wrench into the act internal economic machinery 
insurers in states with exchanges would still be required to comply with and rules,but,without premium tax subsidies to encourage broad participation,insurers would be deprived of the broad base required to make those reforms viable.adverse selection would cause premiums to rise,further discouraging market participation,and the ultimate result would be an death spiral in the individual insurance markets in states with exchanges.
br.of appellees,at see also amicus br.of america health insurance plans,at amicus br.for economic scholars,at 
it is therefore clear that widely available tax credits are essential to fulfilling the act primary goals and that congress was aware of their importance when drafting the bill.the irs rule advances this understanding by ensuring that this essential component exists on a sufficiently large scale.the irs rule became all the more important once a significant number of states indicated their intent to forgo establishing exchanges.with only sixteen exchanges currently in place,the economic framework supporting the act would crumble if the credits were unavailable on federal exchanges.furthermore,without an exception to the individual mandate,millions more americans unable to purchase insurance without the credits would be forced to pay a penalty that congress never envisioned imposing on them.the irs rule avoids both these unforeseen and undesirable consequences and thereby advances the true purpose and means of the act.
it is thus entirely sensible that the irs would enact the regulations it did,making chevron deference appropriate.confronted with the act ambiguity,the irs crafted a rule ensuring the credits broad availability and furthering the goals of the law.in the face of this permissible construction,we must defer to the irs rule.see scialabba,at whatever congress might have meant in enacting the statute,it failed to speak clearly.confronted with a,ambiguous provision in a complex statutory scheme,the board chose a textually reasonable construction consonant with its view of the purposes and policies underlying immigration law.were we to overturn the board in that circumstance,we would assume as our own the responsible and expert agency role.mfrs.ass n,at w e defer at chevron step two to the agency interpretation so long as the construction is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make.second alteration in original.
tellingly,the plaintiffs do not dispute that the premium tax credits are an essential component of the act viability.instead,as explained above,they concede that congress probably wanted to make subsidies available throughout the country,but argue that congress was equally concerned with ensuring that the states play a leading role in administering the act,and thus conditioned the availability of the credits on the creation of state exchanges.the plaintiffs argue that the irs rule exceeds the agency authority because it irreconcilably conflicts with congress goal of ensuring state leadership.for the reasons explained above,however,we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs coercion argument and do not consider it a valid basis for circumscribing the agency authority to implement the act in an efficacious manner.
the plaintiffs also attempt to avert chevron deference by arguing that aca and are administered by hhs and not the irs,and that as a result the irs had no authority to enact its final rule.however,the relevant statutory language is found in,which is part of the internal revenue code and subject to interpretation by the irs.see.at describing the irs rule as a valid interpretation of.although the irs rule adopts by an hhs definition of exchange,b k,the act clearly gives to the irs authority to resolve ambiguities in the secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.this clear delegation of authority to the irs relieves us of any possible doubt regarding the propriety of relying on one agency interpretation of a single piece of a statute.
finally,the plaintiffs contend that a rule of statutory construction that requires tax exemptions and credits to be construed narrowly displaces chevron deference in this case.however,while the supreme court has stated that tax credits must be expressed in clear and unambiguous terms,yazoo.valley thomas,the supreme court has never suggested that this principle displaces chevron deference,and in fact has made it quite clear that it does not.see mayo found.for medical educ.and research united states,t he principles underlying our decision in chevron apply with full force in the tax context.see also id.at collecting cases in which the supreme court has applied chevron deference interpreting irs regulations.
rejecting all of the plaintiffs arguments as to why chevron deference is inappropriate in this case,for the reasons explained above we are satisfied that the irs rule is a permissible construction of the statutory language.we must therefore apply chevron deference and uphold the irs rule 
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i am pleased to join in full the majority holding that the patient protection and affordable care act the act permits the internal revenue service to decide whether premium tax credits should be available to consumers who purchase health insurance coverage on exchanges.op.at.but i am also persuaded that,even if one takes the view that the act is not ambiguous in the manner and for the reasons described,the necessary outcome of this case is precisely the same.that is,i would hold that congress has mandated in the act that the irs provide tax credits to all consumers regardless of whether the exchange on which they purchased their health insurance coverage is a creature of the state or the federal bureaucracy.accordingly,at chevron step one,the irs rule making the tax credits available to all consumers of health insurance coverage,b k,may,is the correct interpretation of the act and is required as a matter of law.chevron,natural resources defense council.
although the act expressly contemplates exchanges,aca b,congress created a contingency provision that permits the federal government,via the secretary of health and human services,to establish and operate such exchange within the state and take such actions as are necessary to implement such other requirements.id.c.this contingency provision is triggered when a state elects not to set up an exchange,when a state is delayed in setting up an exchange,or when a state exchange fails to meet certain statutory and regulatory requirements.id.c.
enter the premium tax credits,essentially a tax subsidy for the purchase of health insurance.the amended tax code,b,sets forth the formula for calculating the amount of a consumer premium tax credit.in general,the credit is equal to the lesser of two amounts the monthly premium for a qualified health plan enrolled in through an exchange established by the state,or the excess of the adjusted monthly premium for a certain type of health plan over a percentage of the taxpayer household income.id.b.
appellants contend that the language enrolled in through an exchange established by the state precludes the irs from providing premium tax credits to consumers who purchase health insurance coverage on federal exchanges.to them,established by the state in the premium tax credits calculation subprovision is the sine qua non of this case.an exchange established by the state is not an exchange established by the federal government,they argue thus,the equation for calculating the amount of the premium tax credit is wholly inapplicable to all consumers who purchase health insurance coverage on exchanges the amount would be zero,according to appellants.
i am not persuaded and
