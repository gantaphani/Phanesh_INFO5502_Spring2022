when petitioner stephen walker immigrated from jamaica to the united states in,his biological grandparents claimed him as their child.in,petitioner was convicted of crimes,after which the united states government initiated removal proceedings.at that time,petitioner was in the custody of his naturalized biological mother.petitioner now petitions for judicial review of the final order of the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed the decision of an immigration judge ij denying petitioner claim of derivative citizenship and ordering petitioner removed from the united states to jamaica.petitioner had argued before the bia that removal proceedings should be terminated on the ground that he qualifies for derivative citizenship through his naturalized biological mother under the child citizenship act of cca,stat,which is codified at section of the immigration and nationality act ina.after careful consideration,we affirm the bia ruling.
background 
in an affidavit executed on april,petitioner stated that he was born in jamaica,west indies,on april,which is also reflected on his birth certificate.petitioner also claimed to have always known anne marie walker wynter wynter as his birth mother but that he had never known his birth father,everton anderson anderson.
in an affidavit executed on may,petitioner grandmother,vashtie eugenie walker vashtie,stated that a midwife handled walker delivery.vashtie also stated that she and her husband,ernest stephen walker ernest collectively the walkers,adopted petitioner shortly after his birth,and that the midwife,who reportedly informed vashtie that the procedure she followed was appropriate and absolutely legal,gave the walkers a birth certificate to that effect.that birth certificate lists the walkers as petitioner parents.vashtie claimed that the reason she and ernest adopted petitioner 
was because shortly after petitioner was conceived by wynter,the man who wynter named as his father refused to acknowledge him.this was of course extremely humiliating for myself and my husband because we are baptized christians and my husband was a minister at the time.we did not want petitioner to be bastardized and so we agreed to adopt him with the consent of his mother wynter,our daughter.
just how consensual that adoption was,however,is a matter of contention.in an affidavit executed on april,wynter states,s hortly after petitioner was born,my parents informed me that they adopted petitioner and told me that i had no rights to petitioner 
petitioner states that the walkers immigrated to the united states in.on february,at the embassy in kingston,jamaica,the walkers listed petitioner as their son on their visa applications.
on november,vashtie filed a visa petition for petitioner,claiming that he was the walkers son.the same day,vashtie filed a visa petition for wynter,which lists three of wynter children but omits petitioner.
on march,marcia walker,petitioner maternal aunt,completed an immigrant visa application on petitioner behalf that identified the walkers as his parents.as a result,petitioner himself immigrated to the united states via miami,florida as a purportedly lawful permanent resident lpr on april.
on may,at the embassy in kingston,wynter submitted an immigrant visa application,on which she listed four children but omitted petitioner.wynter then immigrated to the united states four days later.
in,the walkers returned to jamaica without having been naturalized in the united states.
on april,wynter,in her application for naturalization,listed petitioner as one of her six children.wynter became a naturalized citizen on november.
on october,after petitioner initial immigrant visa expired,he successfully applied for a new visa,listing the walkers as his parents.
procedural history 
we review the procedural history of this case,from the date of petitioner criminal conviction until his appeal to this court.
petitioner criminal conviction 
on july,petitioner pled guilty to five counts of cocaine distribution in suffolk superior court in boston,massachusetts,resulting in a suspended sentence and probation.in,petitioner violated the terms of his probation and the state court imposed yet a further term of probation.
dhs removability charge against petitioner 
on january,the department of homeland security dhs issued petitioner a notice to appear,or form,placing him into removal proceedings.three days later,the dhs charged petitioner with being deportable pursuant to section a a iii of the ina,a a iii,for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section a b of the ina,a b.
on march,an ij in boston,massachusetts,ordered petitioner to file a written brief on or before april,with respect to the facts and the law regarding his claim that he was a citizen,particularly the claim that he had derived citizenship.the ij warned petitioner that he must make a written request before april,for any extension to that date for the brief,and that any extension granted would only be for a few days.
on april,fourteen days after the stated deadline,petitioner filed a brief in support of his petition to review the removal proceedings pending against him and requested a stay of deportation.in that brief,petitioner argued that he qualified for exemption from removal proceedings because he had derived national status through wynter,his natural mother,who was a naturalized citizen,under section a of the ina,a.
immigration judge first decision 
on may,the ij issued an oral decision concerning walker removability.the ij denied petitioner requests for a stay and continuation of proceedings and also rejected petitioner application for cancellation of removal under section a of the ina.the ij further ordered that petitioner be removed from the united states to jamaica based upon the charge of removability set forth in petitioner notice to appear.the ij observed that petitioner was not eligible for any other form of relief because he had not asserted such eligibility nor had he requested to apply for any other form of relief.
the ij found that petitioner abandoned his claim of derivative citizenship.the ij noted that,although petitioner ultimately filed his brief on the matter on april,petitioner did not submit a brief on or before april,nor did he request a continuation or an extension of the date to file that brief.in response to petitioner arguments about why his derivative citizenship claim should not be found to be abandoned,the ij stated that none of petitioner arguments constituted good cause because petitioner had sufficient time since he was detained and brought before the ij on january,to explore this case.
the ij also responded to the merits of petitioner argument that he is not removable from the united states as one convicted of an aggravated felony.petitioner argued that his conviction does not meet the definition of an aggravated felony as set forth in a b because he was not sentenced to imprisonment.the ij responded that petitioner argument failed because the statute does not require a specific sentence.petitioner further argued that he was not removable because he had been an lpr for more than seven years he was the father of a citizen who suffers from a medical condition and he intended to marry a citizen.the ij responded that all of these arguments fail because petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony,which made him ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal under section a of the ina,a,which explicitly requires that in order for the attorney general to consider cancellation of removal,the deportable alien must show that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a.
petitioner application for certificate of citizenship 
the same day that the ij found petitioner removable as charged,may,petitioner filed an application,dated april,the same day that petitioner filed a brief in support of his petition to review the removal proceedings pending against him and requested a stay of deportation,for a certificate of citizenship,or form,with the citizenship and immigration services uscis of the dhs.on the form,petitioner claimed citizenship through a citizen parent naming wynter as his citizen mother and that he had not been adopted.
on may,the uscis denied petitioner application because,under the nationality laws,a child,under the age of eighteen on february,may not automatically derive citizenship through his biological mother who naturalized,where the child maternity,viability of his lawful permanent resident status,and legal and physical custody have not been definitively established.
the uscis observed that the walkers officially and under oath listed you as their child when they immigrated to the united states.the uscis further noted that,contrary to claims found in the rest of the uscis records that antedate petitioner indictment and conviction,only one such naturalization wynter as petitioner mother.moreover,the uscis observed 
it is only now that we receive a concerted effort and explanation to establish that your listed parents were really your grandparents and your real mother is a naturalized citizen.you now argue that your grandparents effected an illegal informal adoption to which your mother acquiesced,despite the fact that no court or governmental requirements of any kind were complied with in jamaica,massachusetts,or any other jurisdiction 
knowing a in jamaica,they conspired to falsely register themselves as your biological parents,despite the fact that your grandmother was then years of age and had already had her ovaries uterus removed in jamaica for medical reasons shortly after the birth of her last actual child in despite the efforts of your mother,and now of your counsel,the walkers still explicitly maintain in an affidavit dated february,that they are your natural parents and only granted custody of you to your mother in.
the uscis found that petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof concerning section a of the ina,considering t he pattern of deceit surrounding what you now assert was a false birth certificate and the complicated and intertwined issues with your mother and grandparents.the uscis concluded that,because petitioner did not possess a viable,lawful permanent residence,we believe that you lack the fundamental statutory prerequisite for automatic derivative citizenship.
on july,petitioner filed a notice of appeal with the uscis administrative appeals office aao challenging the uscis decision to deny petitioner application for certificate of citizenship.the aao dismissed petitioner appeal.
bia first decision 
on may,petitioner filed a timely appeal of the ij decision to the bia contending that the ij erred in finding that petitioner abandoned his derivative citizenship claim.on appeal,petitioner submitted the following new evidence to establish derivative citizenship an amended birth certificate dated june,indicating that wynter,not vashtie,was petitioner mother dna results from july,comparing petitioner and wynter and concluding that,based on specimens taken from both of them on july,t he relative chance of maternity,assuming a prior chance,is as compared to an untested,unrelated woman in the black population and the form that petitioner had filed on may.
on september,the bia,citing the new evidence on appeal,remanded the case to the ij for further proceedings.
dhs additional removability charge against petitioner 
on march,the dhs filed an additional charge of,separate from the january charge that contended that petitioner was deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.the new charge asserted that petitioner was removable pursuant to section a a of the ina,a a,because,at the time of his entry,petitioner was inadmissible pursuant to section a a i i of the ina,a a i i,as an immigrant who is not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa.the dhs specifically charged that petitioner was admitted as the child of an lpr based upon a visa petition filed by vashtie,in which vashtie claimed to be petitioner parent but in fact was not.
immigration judge second decision 
on may,in an oral decision,the ij found that petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing that he had been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence as required by section a of the ina.based upon the dhs charges in january and march,the ij ordered that petitioner be removed from the united states to jamaica.on june,petitioner timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.
bia second decision 
on october,the bia dismissed petitioner appeal,affirming the ij denial of petitioner claim of derivative citizenship.the bia made two rulings.first,the bia held that the ij correctly found that petitioner could not meet the requirements of section a of the ina to establish citizenship because his residence in the united states prior to the age of was not pursuant to a lawful admission.second,the bia held that the ij correctly deemed that petitioner had abandoned his application for cancellation of removal because,at a hearing on may,petitioner explicitly declined to pursue that argument,deciding instead to proceed only with his claim of derivative citizenship.
petitioner filed a timely petition for judicial review of this bia decision to this court.in this proceeding,petitioner argues that he qualifies for derivative citizenship under section a of the ina.petitioner bases his claim on two grounds at the time of his admission,he was eligible for an immigrant visa since he was the adopted child of an lpr,and when he was admitted,he possessed such a valid,unexpired immigrant visa.petitioner also argues that,if he is deemed removable,such a ruling would constitute a retroactive revocation of his permanent residence card without a formal proceeding,in violation of due process of law under the fifth amendment to the constitution.
ii.discussion 
when,as here,the bia issues its own opinion,we review the bia decision and not the ij.touch holder,cir.
petitioner claim that he was residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence for purposes of his derivative citizenship claim under the cca raises a pure question of law.we review the bia legal conclusions de novo,with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.gailius ins,cir citing ipina ins,cir see also gonzales,cir we accord chevron deference to the bia interpretation.citing chevron,nrdc,d bocova gonzales,cir rulings of law engender de novo review.even in that realm,however,courts must defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of the statutes and regulations relating directly to immigration matters.emphasis added and citations omitted.
we also review de novo whether an immigration procedure comports with due process.see santana holder,cir citing teng mukasey,cir.
