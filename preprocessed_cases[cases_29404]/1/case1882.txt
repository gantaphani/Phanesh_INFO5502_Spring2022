procedural and factual background 
frank littriello was the owner of several business entities,including kentuckiana healthcare,llc pyramid healthcare.i,llc and pyramid healthcare.ii,llc.each of these businesses was organized as a limited liability company under kentucky law,with littriello as the sole member.he did not elect to have them treated as corporations for federal tax purposes and,as a result,none of the llcs was subject to corporate income taxation.for the tax years in question,littriello reported his income from the three businesses on schedule c of his individual income tax schedule on which the profits and losses of a sole proprietorship are reported.because the llcs were disregarded entities under the pertinent tax regulations,and not corporate entities,the irs assessed littriello for the full amount of the unpaid employment taxes for.
in january,the internal revenue service informed littriello that it intended to enforce the liens that had been filed against his property as security for the unpaid taxes.in response,littriello requested a hearing,which produced a determination by the irs appeals office that littriello was individually liable as a sole proprietor under treasury regulation b ii,as a result of his failure to elect to be treated as a corporation.

discussion 
the treasury regulations at the heart of this litigation,were issued in to clarify the rules for determining the classification of certain business entities for federal tax purposes,replacing the kintner regulations.the earlier regulations had been developed to aid in classifying business associations that were not incorporated under state incorporation statutes but that had certain characteristics common to corporations and were thus subject to taxation as corporations under the federal tax code.corporate income is,of course,subject to double taxation once at the corporate level under a and again at the level,pursuant to a.in contrast,partnership income benefits from is taxed once,not at the business level but only after it passes through to the individual partners and is taxed as income to them,pursuant to.a sole which a single individual owns all the assets,is liable for all debts,and operates in an individual also taxed only once.
the kintner regulations built on an even earlier standard,set out by the supreme court in morrissey,in which the court addressed the tax code provision that included an association within the definition of a corporation,in order to determine whether a business trust qualified as an association for federal tax purposes.at.morrissey identified certain characteristics as those typical of a corporation,including the existence of associates,continuity of the entity,centralized management,limited personal liability,transferability of ownership interests,and title to property.id.at.however,the court did not hold that a specific number of those characteristics had to be present in order to establish the business entity as a corporation,nor did it address the consequence of a partnership having some of those characteristics,leaving the distinctions between and among the various defined entities less than clear.
meant to clarify some of the confusion created in the wake of morrissey,the kintner regulations developed four essential characteristics of a corporate entity and provided that an unincorporated business would be treated as an association and,therefore,as a corporation rather than a it had three of those four identifying characteristics.see former reg.a and.the kintner regulations,adequate to provide a measure of predictability at the time of their promulgation in and for several decades afterward,proved less than adequate to deal with the new hybrid business liability companies,limited liability partnerships,and the in the last years of the last century under various state laws.these unincorporated business entities had the characteristics of both corporations and partnerships,combining ease of management with limited liability,and were increasingly structured with the kintner regulations in mind,in order to take advantage of whatever classification was thought to be the most advantageous.the kintner exercise required skillful lawyering by business entities and review by the irs it quickly came to be seen as squandering of resources on both sides of the equation.
as a result,the irs undertook to replace the kintner regulations with a more practical scheme,consistent with existing tax statutes and with a new provision in treating entities as corporations,regardless of their structure or status under state law.as to the unincorporated business associations not covered by,including the newly emerging hybrid entities,the irs proposed to allow an election by the taxpayer to be treated as a corporation or,in the absence of such an election,to be disregarded,deemed a partnership for entities with multiple members or a sole proprietorship for those with a single member.after a period for notice and comment,the new regulations were issued and became effective on january,implementing the definitional provisions of a and.the regulations were particularly helpful with regard to the tax status of the new hybrids,because the hybrid entities were not,and still are not,explicitly covered by the definitions set out in.what was avoided by the resulting provisions was the necessity of forcing those hybrids to jump through the kintner regulation hoops in order to achieve a perfectly for federal tax purposes.
the district court noted that littriello unincorporated businesses had not elected to be treated as corporations under the new regulations and were,therefore,deemed by the irs to be sole proprietorships.this result provided littriello with a major
