this case requires us to resolve a novel question regarding the application of g,the provision added to the in forma pauperis ifp statute by the prison litigation reform act plra.the rule,in an effort to lessen the crush of frivolous prisoner filings in the federal courts,precludes they face imminent danger of serious physical proceeding ifp if they have had three prior cases dismissed as frivolous,malicious,or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.plaintiff dennis pointer appeals the district court denial of his motion to proceed ifp based on the district court counting of one of his prior suits as a strike.in this prior suit,six of pointer eight claims were dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim,and two were dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.we conclude that the district court properly characterized this type of dismissal as a strike,and we also reject pointer constitutional challenge to g.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
pointer is an inmate at the warren correctional institution wci in lebanon,ohio.prior to initiation of the instant suit,pointer had three cases dismissed,each of which were filed in the southern district of ohio.pointer does not dispute the classification of two of his prior dismissals as strikes,pointer lyon,aff,cir,and pointer brown williamson tobacco,july.in his third prior dismissal,pointer,the district court dismissed all eight counts of pointer complaint.however,of the eight counts,the district court dismissed only six of them with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.two counts were dismissed without prejudice to refiling because pointer had failed to exhaust all available prison administrative remedies.
pointer filed the instant action and a motion for leave to proceed ifp in the southern district of ohio on january.pointer complaint asserts several claims pursuant to against the director of the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction,the wci warden,other wci officials,various unknown parole board members,and prosecutors in cuyahoga county,ohio.he asserts violations of his rights stemming from his november parole board hearing,a may meeting with a wci official,and a july disciplinary action and local control placement hearing.
on the same day that the complaint and ifp motion were filed,january,chief judge sandra beckwith entered an order denying pointer ifp motion and ordering him to pay the full filing fee within days or face dismissal of his action.the district court concluded that pointer three prior dismissals counted as strikes under g,and the statutory exception to the rule did not apply the district court further certified that an appeal of the court order would not be taken in good faith.see a an appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.
on february,pointer moved for reconsideration of chief judge beckwith order and subsequently moved to extend the time to pay the filing fee and to amend his complaint to name additional defendants.the district court denied pointer motions in an order dated march.pointer contended in his motion for reconsideration that because the dismissal of his complaint in was not entirely with prejudice,it should not have been counted as a strike.the district court,relying on clemons young,d,rejected pointer argument,agreeing with clemons that a complaint dismissed in part with prejudice for failure to state a claim and in part without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies qualifies as a strike under g the district court thus denied the motion for reconsideration and again certified that an appeal would not be taken in good faith.
pointer filed a notice of appeal of the denial of his ifp motion with this court on march.magistrate judge timothy hogan entered a deficiency order dated march,requiring pointer to apply for ifp status on appeal,because pointer failed to pay the appeal filing fee.while pointer appeal was pending,the district court entered an order dismissing pointer complaint for failure to pay the district court filing fee,and the district court yet again certified that any appeal would not be taken in good faith.
pointer moved this court for leave to file ifp,and his motion was granted and counsel was appointed.pointer challenges both the classification of the dismissal in as a strike and the constitutionality of g.the only brief in opposition to pointer comes from the united states as intervenor.the government takes no position on the question whether an action that was dismissed without prejudice as to some claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies constitutes a strike within the meaning of g.gov t br.at.rather,the government devotes the entirety of its brief to defending the constitutionality of g and arguing that wilson yaklich,cir,in which this court held that g is constitutional,is controlling.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to to hear pointer action brought under.this court has jurisdiction over pointer timely appeal pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court did not err in denying pointer motion to proceed ifp.
this court reviews a district court denial of pauper status for abuse of discretion.phipps king,cir.the ifp statute allows prisoners to bring suit without court fees,thus ensuring they have some meaningful access to the federal courts.wilson,at quoting neitzke williams,d the plra provision at issue,g,states 
in no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has,on or more prior occasions,while incarcerated or detained in any facility,brought an action or appeal in a court of the united states that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,malicious,or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.
g.pointer argues that the dismissal in should not have been counted by the district court as a strike because two of the claims in that case were dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust.neither this court nor any other court of appeals has directly addressed whether a dismissal counts as a strike where some claims were dismissed for failure to state a claim and some for failure to exhaust.
the district court below relied upon clemons young,in which a court in the eastern district of michigan held that an action dismissed entirely without prejudice is not a strike but that a complaint dismissed in part as frivolous and in part without prejudice due to failure to exhaust should be counted as a strike.d at emphasis added citing snider melindez,cir.the court in clemons recognized that if some claims were dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust and other claims were found to have merit,then the dismissal of other frivolous claims would not render the dismissal a strike.yet in the situation presented there,where several claims in the plaintiff complaint were dismissed as frivolous,and there was no finding that any of the other claims arguably had any merit,then the addition of claims not properly before the court because they are not exhausted fails to excuse the decision to advance frivolous and meritless claims in the same complaint.id.emphasis in original.the court persuasively reasoned that t he entire purpose of g would be subverted if prisoners could skirt its procedural bar merely by appending unexhausted claims to a complaint otherwise subject to summary dismissal on the merits.id.at.
we find the clemons court reasoning in this regard to be compelling,and that the district court properly applied clemons in determining that the dismissal counts as a strike pointer arguments to the contrary are unavailing.pointer first seizes on the statement in clemons that if any of the claims were found to have merit,the presence of frivolous claims would not by themselves draw the action into the circle traced by section g.clemons,d at.pointer argues that here,his prior claims dismissed without prejudice were not found to be frivolous,and therefore clemons is distinguishable.however,pointer misreads clemons.clemons did not depend on a finding that the claims were frivolous rather,the court in clemons stated that several claims in the prior complaint were dismissed as frivolous,and others were dismissed for failure to exhaust.id.the text of b draws no distinction between claims dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim both types of dismissals count as a strike.the court in clemons found with regard to frivolity dismissals that t here is no indication in the statute that including unexhausted claims in an otherwise frivolous complaint will inject merit into the action and render it.id.similarly here,inclusion of unexhausted claims in a complaint in which all other counts fail to state a claim will not inject merit into the action and transform counts that do not state a claim into ones that do.
indeed,in,although some claims were dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust,none of the claims were found to have merit or to state a claim.section g contemplates that such a meritless filing will be deemed a strike.the same reasoning offered in clemons applies here the congressional purpose of g would be subverted if,by adding unexhausted claims to a complaint that otherwise does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted,a prisoner could repeatedly escape imposition of a strike and thus evade the bar imposed by the rule.
pointer also relies on this court decision in williams newell.cir,and characterizes that opinion as one in which this court declined to award a strike where a prisoner complaint was dismissed without prejudice.pointer br.at.a panel of this court indeed declined to impose a strike in williams,and followed the second circuit opinion in snider melindez in so holding.williams.at citing snider,at.yet williams involved a prior dismissal without prejudice in its entirety for failure to exhaust,and,contrary to pointer suggestion,the panel did not conclude that a dismissal without prejudice is not a strike.the defendant in williams asked the panel to hold that the appeal was frivolous and to declare that the plaintiff had received a strike for the underlying dismissal.williams.at.the panel declined to do so,relying on the second circuit advice in snider that a court should not impose a strike at the time that a case is dismissed.id.citing snider,at.rather,according to the second circuit in snider and the panel in williams,a strike should only be imposed by a later court in the event that the prisoner attempts to file another suit and proceed ifp.snider,at williams.at.thus,the panel in williams expressed no view on whether the dismissal should count as a strike,but instead left that decision to a future court if the prisoner filed another complaint.williams.at.the panel did conclude that the appeal was frivolous but it did not take the next step and impose a strike on the plaintiff.id.williams,therefore,is both and inapposite.
pointer also finds support in snider itself.the second circuit in snider,in addition to providing guidance regarding the timing of the imposition of a strike,held that a dismissal of a complaint in its entirety without prejudice is not a strike.snider,at.other courts have followed this approach and held that a complete dismissal without prejudice does not count as a strike relying on the reasoning in snider that g contemplates that a strike shall be imposed only for a dismissal that finally terminates the action because of a determination that it ultimately can not succeed,id.at,pointer claims that counting the dismissal as a strike penalizes him because the court in did not make a final ruling on the merits of the entire case and also runs afoul of the principle that pro se claims should be liberally construed.but snider provides no support for pointer argument that a dismissal in part without prejudice and in part with prejudice is not a strike.snider addresses the status of a dismissal entirely without prejudice,whereas was only dismissed in part without prejudice.we conclude that for a mixed dismissal such as,the rule adopted in clemons accords more closely with the purposes of g by discouraging prisoners from endlessly claims,and by not giving prisoners an incentive to include unexhausted claims so that the case will not count as a strike if dismissed.clemons,d at.indeed,the court in clemons expressly agreed with snider holding that an action dismissed entirely without prejudice is not a strike,but applied a different rule to a mixed dismissal.id.at.
furthermore,the second circuit reasoning in snider depends on the notion that f ailure to exhaust administrative remedies is often a temporary,curable,procedural flaw,and therefore a strike should not be imposed upon a prisoner who suffers a dismissal because of the prematurity of his suit but then exhausts his administrative remedies and successfully reinstitutes it.snider,at.if pointer instant complaint merely reasserted the previously unexhausted claims he raised in,his argument would be stronger.but such a case is not before the court.as the district court explained in denying pointer motion for reconsideration,the unexhausted claims in arose from actions that occurred in,while the claims in the instant case arose from occurrences in and.thus,the two cases are not related.pointer did not simply exhaust his administrative remedies on the claims dismissed without prejudice in and then them in the instant complaint.rather,he presents new claims wholly unrelated to the prior claims dismissed without prejudice.at t he instant case is neither a nor a continuation of his previous case.
more fundamentally,pointer repeatedly misconstrues the basis for the dismissal.pointer brief describes that dismissal as simply a dismissal without prejudice and attempts to downplay the fact that six of the eight claims were dismissed on the merits for failure to state a claim.pointer br.at dismissal without prejudice of a prior civil lawsuit id.at recognizing that six of the claims were dismissed with prejudice but nonetheless describing entire dismissal as dismissal without prejudice and thus subject to being id.at was dismissed without prejudice.pointer counsel made similar contentions at oral argument.crucially,however,the dismissal was not entirely without prejudice it was a mixed dismissal,and six claims were dismissed without the possibility of being.pointer argument depends on the notion that dismissals without prejudice make no determination on the merits of the case and as such,should not be treated as a strike.id.at.but the court in did make a determination on the merits as to many of the claims presented in the complaint.it is the very nature of a mixed dismissal such as that in that strongly supports application of the clemons approach.if was solely dismissed for failure to exhaust,pointer would have a more compelling argument that a strike should not be assessed but where an entire complaint is dismissed,in part for failure to exhaust and in part for one of the grounds stated in g,the dismissal should count as a strike.see,smith duke,d,reading the whole act in context,i simply can not find failure to exhaust administrative remedies,without more,within the scope of g.emphasis added see also id.at a dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies alone,without a finding of maliciousness,frivolousness,or failure to state a claim,is not a baseless claim.
at oral argument,our attention was directed to thompson dea,in which the circuit very recently addressed the status of complete dismissals for failure to exhaust under the rule.in thompson,the circuit focused its inquiry on whether the dismissal was expressly made for the reasons stated in g.id.at deciding whether actions and appeals defeated by a failure to exhaust count as strikes.because judicial practices differ as to whether a dismissal for failure to exhaust counts as dismissal for failure to state a claim,the court refused to give any categorical answer to this question.id.at quoting jones bock,d whether a particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dismis
