the district court granted atf motion for summary judgment,concluding

valley gun,a firearms dealer in baltimore,maryland,began as a sole proprietorship in and was incorporated in.in when his father died,sanford abrams took over as president of the corporation.
a little less than a year after abrams took over,in february,atf cited the corporation for violations of the gun control act of,stat,as amended by the firearms owners protection act of,stat.it notified valley gun that valley gun had provided incorrect or incomplete information on atf forms which valley gun was required to complete in every firearms transaction to demonstrate that the person purchasing the firearm was qualified to be a purchaser that nine firearms in inventory could not be traced to the bound recordbook of acquisitions and dispositions the a d book that firearms recorded in the a d book as present in inventory were in fact missing from inventory and that valley gun failed accurately to record dispositions of firearms transferred to other dealers.by letter dated july,atf warned valley gun that your federal firearms license is conditioned upon your compliance with federal firearms laws and regulations.repeat violations of those listed above will be viewed as willful,and may result in the revocation of your license.
at a second inspection of valley gun in october,atf officials again discovered that valley gun improperly completed fourteen atf forms and failed to record the transfer of seven firearms in the a d book.atf officials met with abrams to communicate the seriousness of such violations and provided abrams with a warning letter stating,as the result of these violations,we are contemplating revocation of your federal firearms license.
when atf officials inspected valley gun operations for the third time in september,they again discovered numerous,indeed an increasing number of violations.valley gun had made mistakes on no fewer than four hundred nineteen atf forms,and firearms were missing from the inventory reflected in valley gun a d book.additionally,valley gun transferred three firearms after the related checks for the purchasers had expired.valley gun also neglected to complete nineteen atf forms,which required information in connection with the sales to purchasers of multiple firearms.atf again provided valley gun a letter warning that as the result of these violations,we are contemplating the revocation of your federal firearms license.atf officials also took the unusual step of holding a second warning conference with abrams and his management,during which abrams acknowledged valley gun legal obligations under the gun control act.abrams told the atf official that he would take a more approach toward making the records more accurate,and he promised to comply in the future.
atf conducted a fourth and final inspection of valley gun premises in may,when it discovered yet an increased number of violations of the gun control act.atf forms contained mistakes,and valley gun had transferred a firearm to a purchaser after the purchaser check had expired.more significantly,however,comparing valley gun inventory with its a d book revealed that firearms were missing.in addition,the a d book failed to include dispositions of three weapons subject to the special registration requirements of the national firearms act regulating especially dangerous weapons such as machine guns and silencers,see.in view of these violations,atf charged valley gun in five counts with violating g a and t and e,c,and c,and gave valley gun notice,dated may,that its license was revoked,subject to a revocation hearing.atf alleged that all five counts involved repeat and willful violations.
at the revocation hearing,held on october,abrams gave various explanations for the violations,although he did not dispute the violations themselves.he testified that he did not clearly recollect some of the prior meetings with atf officials,and he denied having read some of the applicable regulations.with respect to each of the violations charged,however,abrams admitted he knew valley gun obligations under the regulations.abrams admitted he understood the importance of filling out atf forms accurately and completely and of maintaining an acquisition and disposition record in the a d book for every firearm.he had been in the firearms business for more than ten years,and he had been president of valley gun most of that time.he had attended four to six atf seminars,and indeed,he had actually run a few of the seminars himself.he indicated that he relied on employees and had no idea about their documentary failures.he stated that he had no reason to believe the errors were due to anything other than human error.abrams expressed that he was extremely frustrated by the violations but believed that they resulted merely from human error.at bottom,his defense was that the violations were not willful as required for revocation of a license.
after considering the evidence,the hearing officer found on the first count 
abrams kept repeating that he thought his employees were doing things correctly and basically placed all blame on the employees without accepting any responsibility or blame for his own actions as president.abrams could not remember or provide even one instance where he had a meeting with his employees and specifically went over the exact requirements in the regulations.
i do not find licensee reasoning that this violation was not willful as the errors that repeatedly occurred were due to human error and not due to some sort of bad intent by the licensee to be acceptable.
the hearing officer made similar findings on each other count,noting that valley gun had been repeatedly advised of its violations and warned that it could lose its license.addressing specifically his finding of willfulness with respect to all counts,the hearing officer wrote 
the standard of willfulness in federal firearms license revocation hearings includes plain indifference or intentional disregard.that is the licensee knew what was required but failed to do it either through plain indifference or intentional disregard.the standard does not require the government show the licensee acted with a bad purpose.i found all of the counts listed to meet the standard of willfulness.
the record made by the hearing officer was reviewed by arthur herbert,atf director of industry operations,baltimore division,who thereafter gave valley gun final notice that its license was revoked,effective march.
valley gun commenced this action in the district court to review atf action de novo,pursuant to f.on atf motion,the district court entered summary judgment on february,based on the agency record,affirming atf revocation order.the district court subsequently denied valley gun motion to suspend the effective date of its order pending appeal.this appeal followed.
as its principal argument on appeal,valley gun claim
