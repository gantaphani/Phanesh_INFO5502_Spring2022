the plaintiffs,who are lessees the lessees under offshore federal lease,assert that the united states department of the interior interior,minerals management service mms,regulations implementing the deep water royalty relief act of rra conflict with the act itself and are unlawful.the lessees also challenge the interior final agency decision denying the lessees royalty relief under the rra for their lease.the district court ruled in favor of the lessees on the parties for summary judgment.we affirm.
as stated above,the lessees brought this action facially challenging both the regulations promulgated by the interior pursuant to the rra and the interior order denying royalty relief to the lessees.cross motions for summary judgment were filed.the lessees motion sought a declaration that the interior regulations at violated the rra and that the lease is automatically entitled to royalty relief as set forth in the rra.the interior simply requested judgment in favor of itself.
on january,the district court entered judgment in favor of the lessees.however,this judgment was issued two days before the interior deadline to file its reply brief.on january,within business days of the issuance of the january judgment,the interior timely filed a motion to amend the judgment and memorandum in support thereof.the motion was based on the fact that the district court had entered a decision without the benefit of the interior reply brief and set forth the arguments that would have been made in the reply brief.
on march,the district court denied the january motion,and stated the memorandum ruling and judgment issued on january,will remain in effect as issued for the reasons previously stated.the lessees contend that the interior appeal period began to run from this ruling and the interior had until may,to file a notice of appeal.
on march,the interior filed a motion for reconsideration of the reformation remedy and for presentation of additional evidence pertaining thereto.the interior stated that the motion was brought under.e.interior argued in this motion that the january judgment declaration that the lease was entitled to suspension of royalties resulted in a reformation of the lease.this motion was filed within business days from the entry of the march,ruling on the motion to amend the judgment,but more than days after the entry of the january judgment.
on april,the district court denied the interior march,motion.it treated the motion as a second rule e motion and denied it on the basis that it was untimely because it was filed more than days after the entry of the january judgment and because it raised issues that the interior could have raised but did not raise before the entry of summary judgment on january.
in a motion transmitted on april,and filed on april,the interior asked the district court to vacate the january judgment and issue an order recognizing the march order as the date of initial judgment in the case.the motion noted that,without the requested order,the docket sheet could be read so that march,would mark the date of final judgment so that the interior would be required to file a notice of appeal by may.at the time of filing this motion the interior was not aware that the district court had already ruled on its march,motion and was concerned that if it was forced to file a notice of appeal,the district court would no longer have jurisdiction over the case to rule on that motion.the purpose of its april motion was to put the interior in the position it would have been in had the district court not ruled prematurely on the motion for summary judgment.
on may,the district court granted the interior april motion.the district court noted the confusion that was created by its premature entry of judgment and treated the january,motion as a reply brief not a rule e motion,declared the march,judgment as final judgment,and the march motion as a timely rule e motion.the march motion was denied,not for untimeliness,but because it raised new issues.interior appeals.
the lessees argue first that interior appeal is untimely and that we have no jurisdiction over this appeal.lessees contend that the only motion that extended the time for appeal was interior january motion for reconsideration under rule e.lessees argue that the interior time for appeal began to run from march,date the court denied interior january motion.under lessee analysis of the docket sheet,interior notice of appeal was required to be filed no later than may,days after the court march denial of interior january motion.thus lessees argue that the notice of appeal filed on june was untimely.
although this argument has some technical appeal,it rests entirely on the premise that the district court was without authority to correct its docket sheet as it did in its may ruling.the interior argues that the district court has the authority under rule b to vacate its own judgment for reasons stated in the rule and correct its own docket.we agree.under rule b,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.the mistake referred to in the rule can apply to the court own error.oliver home indem,cir.the district court may memorandum ruling was clearly directed to correct the court own administrative error in ruling prematurely on january,creating some confusion as to how to interpret the procedural history that has occurred in this case after that date.
according to moore federal practice,the district court undoubtedly has the power to vacate a judgment in appropriate circumstances and rehear the case,and the judgment entered after rehearing is appealable in due course,although it may be in substance the same as the first.moore federal practice.the ruling on rehearing will delay the time for taking an appeal if the reason for the ruling goes to the propriety of the initial judgment and is not entered simply to give the parties a second chance to file a timely notice of appeal.id.although the district court did not explicitly vacate the premature january ruling,it effectively did so by granting the interior motion and ordering that march,shall be deemed to be the date on which summary judgment was granted in favor of the plaintiffs.the district court may ruling did address the propriety of its january ruling as well as the propriety of its subsequent rulings entered in the case.as noted above,the may ruling acknowledged that the january ruling was entered as a result of the court own error.as a result of vacating the january ruling,the interior march motion was a timely rule e motion as measured from the march final judgment date.although the district court again refused to consider interior contract reformation arguments raised in that motion based on its conclusion that the interior should have raised them earlier in the litigation,the may ruling clearly allowed the district court to consider the interior arguments without the impediment of a finding that the motion was untimely.
the lessees argue that this decision effectively and improperly extended the time for the interior to file a notice of appeal.the lessees are correct that a motion under rule b does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.b.if the district court had entered its may ruling after the time for appeal had run on the original january judgment,then the district court could not have used this procedure to enter a ruling that would extend the deadline for appeal or give the interior a second chance to file its notice of appeal.in re air crash at worth airport.however,assuming that the january judgment was the final judgment in the case,before the notice of appeal was due as calculated from that date,the district court took action to correct the mistake in its own docket sheet that it had caused by ruling prematurely on the parties for summary judgment.under the peculiar facts of this case,this action was within the district court authority under rule b.it did not give the interior a renewed right to file a notice of appeal.it simply clarified which ruling to use as a starting point for determining when the notice of appeal would be due.because the interior filed its notice of appeal timely as calculated from april,the date the district court denied interior march rule e motion,we have jurisdiction over this appeal and the lessees motion to dismiss is denied.
the substantive issue in this case involves the interpretation of sections and of the deep water royalty relief act of.the rra was enacted in november.the rra provides royalty relief for two categories of production from deep water for leases in existence at enactment,november,existing leases,and one for leases issued in any lease sale during the five years after november,new leases.
existing leases 
section of the rra,a c,governs royalty relief for existing leases.a lessee under an existing lease must apply for royalty relief which may be granted or denied in the discretion of the interior.royalty relief is only authorized for new production.a c i.in addition,the lessee must demonstrate that new production from such lease or unit would not be economic in the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay royalties.a c ii 
new leases 
sections and of the rra provide royalty relief for new leases.section added a new subparagraph h to the leasing methods authorized by ocsla section a a h 
the secretary is authorized to grant to the highest responsible qualified bidder or bidders by competitive bidding,under regulations promulgated in advance,any oil and gas lease on submerged lands of the outer continental shelf which are not covered by existing leases the bidding shall be by sealed bid and,at the discretion of the secretary,on the basis of 
h cash bonus bid with royalty at no less than and per centum fixed by the secretary in amount or value of production saved,removed or sold,and with suspension of royalties for a period,volume,or value of production determined by the secretary,which suspension may vary based on the price of production from the lease.
section not codified applies this bidding system to lease sales of new leases and sets the minimum amount of the royalty suspension volumes.
for all tracts located in water depths of meters or greater in the western and central planning area of the gulf of mexico,including that portion of the eastern planning area of the gulf of mexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying west of degrees,minutes west longitude,any lease sale within five years of the date of enactment of this title,shall use the bidding system authorized in section a h of the outer continental shelf lands act,as amended by this title subsec.a h of this section,except that the suspension of royalties shall be set at a volume of not less than the following 
million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in water depths of to meters 
million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in to meters of water and 
million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in water depths greater than meters.
the interior promulgated regulations for administration of the rra in january.the regulation,published in et,made suspension of royalties only available to eligible leases.the definition of eligible leases encompasses all new leases the regulation defined the term field to 
mean an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on,or related to,the same general geological structural feature stratigraphic trapping condition.there may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata,or laterally by local geologic barriers,or by both.
under the regulations,when production occurs from an eligible lease,the interior determines from what field the lease is producing and what royalty suspension volume if any applies to the lease.lessees have a right to appeal the decision designating a lease as part of a particular field.if the field to which the eligible lease is assigned produced oil or gas before the enactment of the rra,then no royalty suspension is granted the new production requirement.the interior concluded that under these circumstances,congress certainly recognized that it is not necessary to encourage production through the use of royalty suspensions.a.if the field to which the eligible lease is assigned did not produce oil or gas before the enactment of the rra,the regulations detail how the suspension volumes are determined and allocated to the eligible leases in the field.thus,under the interior regulations,new leases only received the benefit of royalty suspension if the lease was determined to be in a field that had not produced prior to the enactment of the rra.
the lessee lease 
the interior offered lease on mississippi canyon block as part of an lease sale held on march.given the location,the water depth in which the lease is located,and the date of the lease sale,the lease qualifies as a new lease under the rra.consistent with the regulations described above,the notice of sale specified that any lease issued would receive royalty suspension only if it is in a field where no currently active lease produced oil or gas other than test production before the enactment of the rra.the notice also specified that any royalty suspension volumes would apply to fields,not individual leases.
plaintiff shell offshore was the successful bidder for the lease.the terms of the lease mirrored the terms of the notice of sale and the regulations and set a royalty rate,but noted that the lease was eligible for suspension of royalty payments specified that royalty suspension would only be available if the lease was in a field where no currently active lease produced oil or gas other than test production before the enactment of the rra and specified that royalty suspension,if available,would apply to the field where the lease was located,not to the particular lease.shell signed the lease and paid a cash bonus bid price of.
on june,the lessees informed the interior that they had drilled a well on the lease and requested confirmation that the lease was in a new field.after a preliminary ruling and a response by the lessees,in february,the interior assigned the lease to mississippi canyon field,which field contained leases that had produced prior to the enactment of the rra.this ruling meant that under the regulations the well would not receive the benefit of royalty suspension.the lessees appealed and requested reconsideration by the mms.on june,the director affirmed.this litigation followed.
the lessees challenge the interior interpretation of the rra as set forth in various rules and regulations implementing the provision.under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,as applied by the fifth circuit,the analysis of the interior interpretation involves two steps.
in step one,we determine whether congress has directly spoke to the precise question at issue.if congress has done so,we must give effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent.if we find that the statute is ambiguous with respect to the question at issue,we proceed to step two and the question for us is whether the agency answer is based upon a permissible construction.

the question at issue is whether section of the rra unambiguously provides that the royalty suspensions apply in full to each new lease qualifying under its terms.the interior argues that the statute does not unambiguously answer this question.the interior points to the use of the words all tracts and any lease sale and leases as creating ambiguity as to how the royalty suspensions should apply.section establishes the royalty suspension program for new deep water leases.it states 
for all tracts located in water depths of meters or greater in the western and central planning area of the gulf of mexico,including that portion of the eastern planning area of the gulf of mexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying west of degrees,minutes west longitude,any lease sale within five years of the date of enactment of this title,shall use the bidding system authorized in section a h of the outer continental shelf lands act,as amended by this title subsec.a h of this section,except that the suspension of royalties shall be set a
