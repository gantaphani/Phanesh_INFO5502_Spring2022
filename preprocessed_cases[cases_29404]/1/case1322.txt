appellants are medical providers who seek to open facilities in virginia similar to those they operate in other states.they are hindered by virginia requirement,which they challenged in the court below under a variety of constitutional theories.that court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we reverse the dismissal of appellants commerce clause claims,affirm the dismissal of their fourteenth amendment claims,and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.
in order to launch a medical enterprise in the state of virginia,a firm is required to obtain a certificate of public need.ann.et.admin.code et.virginia program governs most medical capital expenditures undertaken in the state,including the construction of new facilities and the addition of new equipment or services to an existing facility.it does not,however,apply to the replacement of existing equipment.at its core,the program mandates that an applicant demonstrate,within the relevant region,a public need for the service that it seeks to offer.ann.a.the primary purposes of the requirement are to preclude the development of excess capacity,to ensure proper geographical distribution of medical facilities,to protect the economic viability of existing providers,and to promote the provision of medical services.appellees br.at.
in determining whether a particular applicant has demonstrated a sufficient public need for its proposed services,the state health commissioner is required to consider a variety of factors.ann.b.no single factor is dispositive.the commissioner must consider,for instance,t he extent to which the proposed service or facility fosters institutional competition that benefits the area to be served,in addition to t he relationship of the project to the existing health care system of the area to be served,including the utilization and efficiency of existing services or facilities.id.b.
firms that desire to obtain a certificate of need are required to navigate a potentially lengthy,costly,and unpredictable application process.the cost of applying is pegged at one percent of the proposed expenditure,with a cap of.in the review scheme,different types of submissions are grouped into subcategories for simultaneous review in a process referred to as batching.the statute facially requires the review process to be completed within days of the start of the relevant batching cycle.
following the submission of an application,the appropriate regional health planning agency must complete its initial investigation within days.this stage of review includes a public hearing in proximity to the site of the proposed expenditure.affected persons are permitted to submit data to assist the agency in its task.subsequent to this preliminary examination,the agency must provide the department of health with its recommendation regarding the disposition of the application.
the department is then required to determine whether an informal conference is warranted.such a conference will be held if the department independently determines that it is necessary or if an intervening party demonstrates that good cause exists to hold such a hearing.good cause exists if i there is significant relevant information not previously presented at and not available at the time of the public hearing,ii there have been significant changes in factors or circumstances relating to the application subsequent to the public hearing,or iii there is a substantial material mistake of fact or law in the department staff report on the application or in the report submitted by the health planning agency.id.g see also.admin.code a.
the date on which the record closes varies depending on whether an informal conference is conducted.an application is deemed approved if the commissioner fails to issue a decision within days of the closing of the record.appellants allege that w ithout an informal conference,the entire application process and review can take six to seven months to complete.if an informal conference is requested by any person,the process can take significantly longer.compl.in their brief before this court,appellants elaborate on this claim by asserting that the process can take literally years.appellants br.at.
appellants,colon health centers and progressive radiology,are medical providers who seek to avoid the purportedly onerous burdens imposed by the certificate application process.each desires to offer potentially valuable services in the virginia market.colon health combines the advantages of the two prevailing screening methods in a shop that screens,diagnoses,and treats colon cancer.compl.traditional screening involves an invasive procedure referred to as optical colonoscopy.the alternative,virtual colonoscopy,relies on noninvasive computed tomography ct scans but,unlike optical colonoscopy,does not permit the treating physician to immediately remove any detected polyps.instead,a second visit is typically required.
colon health circumvents this problem by exporting the images captured via virtual colonoscopy to a team of radiologists,who immediately scan the images for polyps.they report their conclusions within an hour to an gastroenterologist,who is able to perform the necessary surgery without recalling the patient for a second visit.this streamlined approach reduces the cost and inconvenience of colonoscopy,thus encouraging a higher percentage of individuals to undergo screening.
colon health currently provides joint virtual colonoscopy and treatment services at offices in delaware and new jersey.its attempts to enter the virginia market,however,were stymied after potential competitors intervened to oppose its application.id.it alleges that,in the absence of the certificate requirement which covers ct scanners,it would open virginia facilities offering its unique package of services.
progressive radiology specializes in using magnetic resonance imaging mri to diagnose neurological and orthopedic injuries.id.progressive currently maintains radiology facilities in maryland and the district of columbia.it formerly operated a radiology business in virginia,but ceased to do so when the facility which had contracted for its services was purchased and the contract subsequently terminated.like colon health,progressive alleges that the certificate requirement,which covers mri machines,deters it from providing its specialized services in the commonwealth.progressive estimates that it would serve approximately patients per month if it were permitted to reenter the market.
notably,virginia does not contend that either colon health or progressive is unqualified to render the services that each seeks to offer in the state,nor does it deny that the firms respective facilities would be financed entirely by private sources of funding.it also makes no attempt to contest appellants assertion that the proffered services are medically uncontroversial and would be performed by physicians.id.
appellants challenged the certificate program in the district court,alleging that it violates the dormant commerce clause in addition to the fourteenth amendment equal protection,due process,and privileges or immunities clauses.the court concluded,with respect to the dormant commerce clause,that the program was nondiscriminatory,served legitimate local purposes,and imposed negligible burdens on interstate commerce.with respect to appellants fourteenth amendment challenges,the district court held that the statute was supported by a rational basis.id.at.in an opinion that reproduced,almost verbatim,appellees memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss,the court dismissed the entire suit under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.id.at.this appeal followed.
appellants most serious challenge to the requirement is predicated on the dormant aspect of the constitution commerce clause.the commerce clause authorizes congress p t o regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.by its terms,the clause does not explicitly restrain the conduct of the states.it is,however,that this affirmative grant of authority implies a negative or dormant constraint on the power of the states to enact legislation that interferes with or burdens interstate commerce.brown hovatter,cir citing dennis higgins,d.as relevant here,t he dormant commerce clause is implicated by burdens placed on the flow of interstate commerce the flow of goods,materials,and other articles of commerce across state lines.id.at.
modern dormant commerce clause jurisprudence is motivated primarily by a desire to limit economic protectionism that is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.dep t of revenue of davis,d internal quotation marks omitted.by invalidating statutes that unlawfully impede interstate commerce,courts effectuate the framers desire to prevent the economic balkanization that had plagued relations among the colonies and later among the states under the articles of confederation.id.at quoting hughes oklahoma,d.
as the court concern with economic protectionism suggests,t he principal objects of dormant commerce clause scrutiny are statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce.cts dynamics of,d emphasis added.d iscrimination simply means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.oregon waste,dep t of envtl.quality,d.a statute may discriminate facially,in its practical effect,or in its purpose.envtl.tech.council sierra club,cir citing wyoming oklahoma,d.
the discrimination test thus has an empirical as well as a formal dimension merely noting a law facial neutrality is insufficient under this analysis.the principal focus of inquiry must be the practical operation of the statute,since the validity of state laws must be judged chiefly in terms of their probable effects.lewis bt inv.managers,d see also yamaha motor jim motorcycle,cir.in order to prove discriminatory effect,for instance,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the challenged statute,if enforced,would negatively impact interstate commerce to a greater degree than intrastate commerce.waste mgmt.holdings,gilmore,cir.
in conducting the discrimination inquiry,a court should focus on discrimination against interstate commerce not merely discrimination against the specific parties before it.see exxon governor of,d noting that the commerce clause protects the interstate market,not particular interstate firms.the district court opinion here appeared to contravene this principle at various points.see declining to find a substantial burden on interstate commerce in part because appellants are two relatively small businesses.focusing exclusively on discrimination against individual firms,however,improperly narrows the scope of the judicial inquiry and has the baneful effect of precluding certain meritorious claims.for while the burden on a single firm may have but a negligible impact on interstate commerce,the effect of the law as a whole and in the aggregate may be substantial.
state laws that discriminate against interstate commerce in any of the three ways identified by this court facially,in practical effect,or in subject to a virtually per se rule of invalidity.wyoming,at internal quotation marks omitted.under this variant of strict scrutiny analysis,waste mgmt.holdings,at,a court must invalidate the challenged law unless the state demonstrates both that the statute serves a legitimate local purpose,and that this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.yamaha,at quoting maine taylor,d internal quotation marks omitted.
here,appellants concede that virginia law is not facially discriminatory.appellants br.at.the statute applies to all firms that seek to engage in the covered activities,expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new one,regardless of their geographical location.
appellants do,however,allege discrimination in both purpose and effect.compl.with respect to purpose,they declare that t he primary goal of virginia program is to provide current healthcare providers with a shield from competition.id.more concretely,they point to an implementing regulation which states that the certificate requirement is intended,at least in part,to discourage the proliferation of services that would undermine the ability of essential community providers to maintain their financial viability.id.quoting.admin.code.under this theory,since current medical providers are by definition entities,a major purpose of the certificate requirement is to protect them at the expense of new entrants,such as colon health and progressive.id.
appellants allegations of discriminatory effect are rooted in the administrative process prescribed by the statutory text.as noted,the relevant code sections include a proviso authorizing individuals to request an informal conference to further examine the implications of a particular application.ann.see also.admin.code a.appellants assert that the default process requires between six and seven months to complete,but that the addition of an informal conference can result in the process taking significantly longer.compl.such a prolonged delay may occur in part because,d espite the informal label,conferences can resemble litigation,involving attorneys,adversarial parties,and expert witnesses.id.appellants further allege that,u pon information and belief,conferences are almost exclusively requested by entities that would be in economic competition with the applicant.id.
according to this characterization,virginia program grants established,economic interests the power to obstruct the market entrance of new,primarily competitors in two ways.first,by requesting conferences,established interests can dramatically lengthen the application process,thus increasing the costs and uncertainty borne by the applicant.second,objecting firms may influence the substantive outcome of the process through an effective adversarial presentation at the conference.apart from these practical advantages,the intervention proviso also grants a structural edge to local firms if an established,facility desires to expand its operations,it will necessarily face one fewer objector than would an firm that seeks to enter the market de novo itself.
all these allegations raise practical questions of fact.it is entirely possible that interests frequently commandeer the process to derail the applications of firms,but whether this outcome actually obtains can not be resolved without examining the functioning of the statute in practice.similarly,it may be that the commissioner,although charged with considering a variety of factors,focuses exclusively on protecting existing businesses.see walgreen rullan,cir t he act discriminates against interstate commerce by permitting the secretary to block a new pharmacy from locating in its desired location simply because of the adverse competitive effects that the new pharmacy will have on existing pharmacies.whether this actually occurs,however,can not be ascertained in the absence of proper.
thus,determining whether virginia law discriminates in either purpose or effect necessarily requires looking behind the statutory text to the actual operation of the law.this conclusion is confirmed by a host of precedents which have repeatedly emphasized the factual nature of the dormant commerce clause inquiry.the supreme court has observed,for instance,that when considering the purpose of a challenged statute,courts are not bound by t he name,description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the state,but will determine for themselves the practical impact of the law.hughes,at internal quotation marks omitted.in this respect,the court has consciously eschewed formalism for a sensitive,analysis of purposes and effects.west lynn creamery,healy,d.
the quality of the substantive inquiry assumes heightened importance when considered in light of the procedural posture of the instant dispute.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must merely contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atlantic twombly,d.rule b does not countenance dismissals based on a judge disbelief of a complaint factual allegations.n
