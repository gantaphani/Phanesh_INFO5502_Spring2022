juan larin,a native and citizen of el salvador,petitions for review of i the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia that he is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,see a a iii and ii the bia denial of his motion to reopen his appeal.because we find that the record does not establish that larin was convicted of an aggravated felony,as that term is defined at a,we grant larin petition,vacate the order of removal,and remand the case to the bia for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
larin was admitted to the united states in,and he became a lawful permanent resident in.in,larin pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated battery under kansas law.kansas aggravated battery statute contains multiple sections and subsections,each of which defines one or more types of conduct that violates the statute.the statute.stat.ann,provides,in pertinent part 
a aggravated battery is 
a intentionally causing great bodily harm to another person or disfigurement of another person or 
b intentionally causing bodily harm to another person with a deadly weapon,or in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted or 
c intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude,insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon,or in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted 
b aggravated battery as described in subsection a a is a severity level,person felony.aggravated battery as described in subsections a b and a c is a severity level,person felony 
stat.ann.precisely which branch of this statute provided the basis for larin conviction is an issue of particular importance to his petition for review.
the bill of information under which larin originally was charged tracked the language of subsection a a.it charged that larin unlawfully,intentionally cause d great bodily harm or disfigurement to another person,to wit isarael rosas contrary to kansas statutes annotated a a,aggravated battery,severity level,person felony.prior to larin guilty plea,however,the state amended the bill of information,by handwritten interlineation,to charge that larin unlawfully,intentionally in a manner whereby illegible could have illegible cause great bodily harm or disfigurement to another person,to wit isarael rosas contrary to kansas statutes annotated a a,aggravated battery,severity level,person felony.although the amended bill of information still referred to subsection a a of the statute and notwithstanding its grammatical shortcomings,the language of the amended information,as well as the corresponding amendment to the charged severity level suggests that the state intended to charge larin with a violation of either subsection a b or a c.indeed,larin written guilty plea recited that he was pleading guilty to one count of aggravated battery in violation of subsection a b.
despite the changes to the amended bill of information,the journal entry that recorded the judgment against larin stated that he was convicted under subsection a a.the state court then sentenced larin to months probation,with an underlying suspended prison term of months.
in,the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against larin.the ins alleged that larin was removable because his kansas aggravated battery conviction was a crime of violence and,therefore,an aggravated felony that rendered larin removable under a a iii.at a hearing before the immigration judge,larin counsel conceded that larin had been convicted under subsection a a of the kansas aggravated battery statute,but asserted that a conviction under that section was not a crime of violence for purposes of removal.the immigration judge held that larin conviction was for a crime of violence and found that he was removable on that basis.on appeal to the bia,larin new counsel argued primarily that the confused and ambiguous bill of information failed to validly charge larin with any crime.the bia rejected this challenge and found that larin aggravated battery conviction was a crime of violence regardless of whether he was convicted under subsection a a as reflected in the journal entry recording the judgment and as larin conceded before the immigration judge or subsection a b as reflected by larin written guilty plea of the kansas statute.the bia noted that subsections a a and a b both contain as an element that the defendant intentionally cause the victim bodily harm,and,relying on the panel decision in united states,cir,vacated on reh g en banc,cir,held that this element of intentionally causing bodily harm was sufficient to render a conviction under either subsection a crime of violence.
after the bia decision,larin moved to vacate his conviction in kansas state court on the ground that the amended bill of information did not charge all of the elements of any subsection of the kansas aggravated battery statute.the kansas court did not vacate larin conviction,but instead issued a judgment nunc pro stating that larin conviction actually was based on subsection a c of the kansas aggravated battery statute.
larin then filed a motion with the bia to reopen his appeal and terminate the proceedings against him on the ground that his conviction under subsection a c was not for a crime of violence and he was therefore not removable for having committed an aggravated felony.as noted above,aggravated battery under section a c is intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude,insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon,or in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted.stat.ann.a c.thus,subsection a c defines two separate crimes intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude,insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon and intentionally causing physical contact with another person in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted.larin argued that he was convicted of violating the second part of subsection a c and that a conviction under that portion of the statute was not a crime of violence under.
the bia denied larin motion to reopen.in its decision,the bia apparently considered the judgment nunc pro tunc as valid,but concluded that,like the original judgment,the judgment nunc pro tunc established that larin was convicted of a crime of violence.the bia noted that the state court journal entry form,on which the rendition of the judgment nunc pro tunc was recorded,also contained a notation regarding larin sentence that suggested that the sentencing judge had been informed that the offense was committed with a firearm.the bia inferred from that notation that larin had been convicted of violating the first part of subsection a c of the kansas statute the bia explained its decision as follows 
t he judgment nunc pro tunc clearly reflects that the respondent committed the aggravated battery with a firearm.see matter of sweetser,bia court may look to conviction records when statute is divisible.thus,the respondent conviction falls under the part of the statute stating that intentionally causing physical contact with another when done in a rude,insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon.use of a deadly weapon while intentionally causing physical contact clearly involves a substantial risk that physical force against another person may be used.consequently,the respondent conviction constitutes an aggravated felony as defined under section a f of the act and he is removable pursuant to section a a iii of the act.
larin timely petitioned this court for judicial review of the question of law raised by the bia final order of removal and its denial of his motion to the bia correctly determined that larin aggravated battery conviction was a crime of violence under,thus rendering larin removable under a a iii.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction in this case is governed by.although section a c generally prohibits judicial review of any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain designated criminal offenses,including an aggravated felony under a,the real id act of,stat,amended section a to provide that section does not bar judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d.this amendment applies retroactively to cases that were already pending on the date of its enactment.see gonzales,cir.because the question of whether larin aggravated battery conviction is a crime of violence is a purely legal one,we have jurisdiction to review larin petition.see id.holding that whether an alien conviction involves a crime of moral turpitude is a question of law 
moreover,even if the real id act did not provide us with jurisdiction,we have long held that we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction,to determine whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.see,omari gonzales,cir citing reno,cir.finally,that larin seeks review of the bia denial of a motion to reopen does not alter our jurisdictional analysis.see zhao gonzales,cir.
although we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion,a denial based on an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion,and we review the bia resolution of questions of law de novo gonzales,cir see also kaweesa gonzales,cir sotelo gonzales,cir.
iii.the effect of the judgment nunc pro tunc 
the first question we must answer is which of the two kansas original judgment of conviction or the judgment nunc pro the operative judgment of conviction for determining whether larin is subject to removal.in denying larin motion to reopen,the bia appears to have considered the judgment nunc pro tunc as the operative judgment of conviction for immigration purposes,as it addressed the merits of larin argument that his conviction under subsection a c of the kansas aggravated battery statute was not for a crime of violence.we find no reason to depart from the bia apparent conclusion that the judgment nunc pro tunc is the operative judgment for determining whether larin was convicted of a crime of violence.
this is not a case in which the petitioner has persuaded a state court to vacate a conviction or otherwise mitigate its severity in order to avoid the immigration consequences of the conviction.here,it is clear that the kansas court judgment nunc pro tunc simply corrected an error in what was otherwise an inconsistent and judgment.as described above,the kansas state court documents in this case are wholly lacking in clarity.larin originally was charged with violating.stat.ann.a a,a severity level four,person felony.the bill of information was later amended by hand,and the amended information contained charging language that seems to have been intended to charge petitioner with violating either subsection a b or a c,but which does not completely match either of those subsections.the amendment also changed the severity level of the charged offense to level seven,which is consistent with a charge under subsection a b or a c,but inconsistent with a charge under subsection a a.see id.b stating that a violation of subsection a a is a severity level four offense,but that a violation of subsection a b or a c is a severity level seven offense.nevertheless,the amended bill of information still referred to subsection a a as the basis for the charge.to compound the confusion,larin written plea acknowledgment recited that he had agreed to plead guilty to a violation of subsection a b.finally,the journal entry that recorded the original judgment was internally inconsistent,as it,like the amended bill of information,stated that petitioner was convicted of violating subsection a a,but also stated that the crime was a severity level seven offense.the only change effected by the kansas court judgment nunc pro tunc was to correct the original judgment to clarify that larin conviction actually fell under subsection a c,rather than subsection a a.under such circumstances,we find that it is appropriate to give effect to the judgment nunc pro tunc.
that the judgment nunc pro tunc was issued solely to correct an error in the original judgment,and not to amend the substance of the original judgment,is further shown by the limited circumstances under which kansas courts are permitted to issue nunc pro tunc orders.kansas courts have long held that the proper function of a nunc pro tunc order is to correct a clerical error or omission,so that the journal entry recording a judgment accurately reflects the judgment that was actually issued.see state lyon,a court possesses inherent power to enter judgments,orders and decrees nunc pro tunc for the purpose of correcting its records,and where a journal entry fails to reflect accurately the judgment which was actually rendered,it becomes the duty of the court to make it speak the truth.see also state thomas,noting availability of nunc pro tunc orders to correct clerical mistakes,including typographical errors,incorrect statute numbers,or failure to include the statute number.it is equally clear that kansas courts may not use a nunc pro tunc order to alter the substance of the judgment that was actually issued.see state mebane,a ny complaint regarding the parole board computation of parole eligibility is not properly brought via a motion for nunc pro tunc order,the purpose of which is to correct actual clerical errors or errors arising from oversight or omission.state vanwey,finding that trial court had no jurisdiction to grant nunc pro tunc order when order did not correct any omission or clerical error,but instead altered a properly entered sentence.insofar as it is clear from the record and from kansas law that the judgment nunc pro tunc in this case simply corrected a clerical error concerning the statutory basis for larin conviction in the original journal entry,the bia correctly considered the judgment nunc pro tunc in connection with larin motion to reopen.ashcroft,cir holding that bia was bound by state court order classifying conviction as a misdemeanor rather than a felony.
this court decisions in ins,cir,and moosa ins,cir,are not to the contrary.in and moosa,we held that a conviction that is later vacated by the sentencing court remains a conviction for immigration purposes under a a.see,at vacated federal conviction moosa,at state deferred adjudication procedure.here,by contrast,the judgment of conviction has not been vacated,deferred or altered.instead,the judgment nunc pro tunc was entered to make the record conform to the true judgment of the kansas court.accordingly,we conclude that the bia correctly considered the judgment nunc pro tunc as the operative judgment of conviction for determining whether larin was convicted of a crime of violence.
iv.is larin conviction under.stat.ann.a c necessarily an aggravated felony 
we next consider whether larin conviction under subsection a c qualifies as an aggravated felony.to determine whether an alien guilty plea conviction constitutes an aggravated felony for removal purposes,we apply a categorical approach,under which we refer only to the statutory definition of the crime for which the alien was convicted rather than attempt to reconstruct the concrete facts of the actual criminal offense and ask whether that offense necessarily fits within the ina definition of an aggravated felony.see omari,at citing,at nguyen ashcroft,cir.
this methodology has its roots in the categorical approach adopted by the supreme court in taylor united states,d,to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a predicate offense under the sentence enhancement provisions of the armed career criminal act,e.among the considerations that led the taylor court to conclude that a categorical approach to prior convictions was necessary were concerns about the practical difficulties and fairness problems that would arise if courts were permitted to consider the facts behind prior convictions the court noted that a approach to prior convictions would potentially require federal courts to relitigate a defendant prior conviction in any case where the government alleged that the defendant actual conduct fit the definition of a predicate offense.taylor,at.see also tokatly ashcroft,cir noting fundamental principle that in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a predicate offense,we must avoid the enormous problems of past convictions,especially in cases where the defendant pleads guilty and there is no record of the underlying facts quoting united states,cir.the taylor court also recognized the unfairness that could result if a factual approach was applied to prior guilty plea convictions 
i n cases where the defendant pleaded guilty,there is often no record of the underlying facts.even if the government were able to prove those facts,if a guilty plea to a lesser,nonburglary offense was the result of a plea bargain,it would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty to burglary.
the categorical approach is not absolute,however.if the statute of conviction defines multiple offenses,at least one of which does not describe an aggravated felony,we apply a modified categorical approach,under which we may also examine certain additional documents if contained in the record framing the guilty plea conviction to determine whether the conviction was necessarily for a particular crime defined by the statute that meets the aggravated felony criterion.see shepard united states,d omari,at see also dickson ashcroft,cir in reviewing a conviction under a divisible statute,the categorical approach permits reference to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.in the case of guilty plea convictions under such a divisible statute,we may consider,in addition to the language of the statute,the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.omari,at quoting shepard,at.the use of these documents is permitted because they are considered sufficiently conclusive and reliable to establish the facts to which the alien actually pleaded guilty.see shepard,at.stating that evidence of facts should be confined to records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction.documents not of that kind,including police reports and complaint applications,may not be considered.omari,at.
if the documents that we may consider under the modified categorical approach are insufficient to establish that the petitioner was necessarily convicted of an aggravated felony,we must find that the government has not met its burden of proving that the conduct for which the petitioner was convicted constitutes a predicate offense,and the conviction may not be used as a basis for removal.tokatly,at see omari,at same.
that a categorical approach is appropriate to determine whether an alien prior conviction is for a crime of violence is confirmed by the statutory definition of a crime of violence.provides 
the term crime of violence means 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
emphasis added.as the supreme court noted in leocal ashcroft,d,t his language requires us to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner crime.id.at.emphasis added see also united states,cir t he words by its nature require us to employ a categorical approach when determining whether an offense is a crime of violence.
as we noted earlier.stat.ann.a c prohibits two,distinct types of conduct i intentionally causing physical contact with another person in a rude,insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon and ii intentionally causing physical contact with another person in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted.we consider each part in turn to determine whether it describes a crime of violence.
categorical approach 
intentional physical contact with a deadly weapon in a rude,insulting or angry manner 
in its denial of larin motion to reopen,the bia found that the first part of section a c was a crime of violence under b because intentionally causing physical contact with another person with a deadly weapon in a rude,insulting or angry manner clearly involves a substantial risk that physical force against another person may be used.we agree 
the relevant question for determining whether a crime is categorically a crime of violence under section b is whether the crime inherently involves a substantial risk that intentional physical force may be used in the commission of the crime.see leocal,at.while the inquiry under section a is limited to looking at the elements of the offense,section b sweeps more broadly to encompass those crimes that can perhaps be committed without the use of physical force,but that nevertheless always entail a substantial risk that physical force may be used.id.as it is used in section,the term physical force is synonymous with destructive or violent force.united states,cir see also leocal,at.section emphasis on the use of physical force against another person suggests a category of violent,active crimes.to illustrate the intended reach of section b,the leocal court explained how that section applies to the crime of burglary a burglary would be covered under b not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured,but because burglary,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.leocal,at.
we have little difficulty concluding,as did the bia,that intentional physical contact made with a deadly weapon in a rude,insulting or angry manner is a crime of violence under section b.although the mere act of intentionally causing physical contact with a deadly weapon under these circumstances might not always involve a use of physical force an issue we do not decide,the prohibited conduct is by its very nature provocative,and it invites a response from the victim of the offense.one who violates this part of section a c therefore necessarily creates a substantial risk that the confrontation may escalate to physical violence,thus requiring the perpetrator to use physical force against the victim.see id.accordingly,we find that the first part of section a c is categorically a crime of violence.
intentional physical contact in any manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted 
our next inquiry is whether the second part of section a c also qualifies as a crime of violence under a or b.because the bia concluded that larin was convicted under the first part of subsection a c,it did not address this issue.
the second part,or crime definition,in section a c does not require that the defendant use physical force in order to support a conviction.rather,it requires only that the defendant intentionally caus e physical contact with another person under circumstances where great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can result.stat.ann.a c.as numerous cases have recognized,physical contact is not the equivalent of physical force.see united states,cir finding that state statute prohibiting sexual intercourse did not have force as an element applying united states sentencing guidelines united states,cir stating that crime of indecent sexual contact with a child did not have use of force as an element applying singh ashcroft,cir stating that use of force was not an element of state harassment statute prohibiting offensive physical contact flores ashcroft,cir discussing distinction between physical contact and physical force.
the second part of section a c also,however,contains the element that the physical contact be made in a manner whereby great bodily harm,disfigurement or death can be inflicted.stat.ann.a c.this element of risk of harm to the victim certainly opens up the possibility t
