the journey of petitioner alma rita malagon de fuentes,from mexico to the united states,then to mexico and back again brought her to an odd legal intersection.while petitioner would not have been deportable had she stayed in the united states,her leaving rendered her inadmissible upon return.and,because petitioner returned when she did,relief was not available.for the reasons that follow,the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia is affirmed.
petitioner,a native and citizen of mexico,claims she first came to the united states in.she married,and her husband filed an petition on her behalf in august.the ins approved the petition in september,and petitioner became a lawful permanent resident lpr on december.she had four children,all born in the united states.
on july,petitioner was convicted of theft of property between and in a welfare fraud.she received five years of deferred adjudication for the felony.
in august,petitioner traveled to mexico for a day.she did so with permission from her state probation officer.on august,she requested admission to the united states as a returning lpr.the immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear charging petitioner as an arriving alien inadmissible under section a a i i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i i,for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude.on october,an immigration judge determined petitioner was removable as an arriving alien and ineligible for a waiver of admissibility under h.the immigration judge ordered her removed from the united states.
petitioner appealed.on december,the bia adopted and affirmed the immigration judge decision.petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.on february,a magistrate judge recommended transferring the case to this court for direct review.on september,the district court transferred the case and stayed petitioner claims in habeas.
we have jurisdiction to review petitioner constitutional claims.a d see hadwani gonzales,cir.
the first question is whether the bia erred in upholding the immigration judge determination that petitioner was seeking admission to the united states as defined in a c v.the statute provides that a n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien has committed an offense identified in section a of this title.there is no dispute as to whether petitioner crime is such an offense.she argues she can not be considered an arriving alien under the fleuti doctrine,see rosenberg fleuti,d,and that considering her one raises constitutional concerns.the government responds that the doctrine was superseded by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,and that petitioner case does not raise constitutional concerns.
iirira and fleuti 
before iirira passage,a defined entry as 
a ny coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession,whether voluntarily or otherwise,except that an alien having a lawful permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as making an entry into the united states for the purposes of the immigration laws if the alien proves to the satisfaction of the attorney general that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or in an outlying possession was not voluntary.
fleuti,at.the fleuti doctrine refers to the supreme court determination that a resident alien did not effect an entry returning from an innocent,casual,and brief excursion outside the united states instead such an alien effects an entry only if he intended to depart in a manner meaningfully interruptive of the alien permanent residence.ins,cir quoting fleuti,at.petitioner argues this doctrine continues to apply,and that she can not be considered to be entering the united states because she did not intend to meaningfully interrupt her residence.
despite the innocent and brief nature of her trip to mexico petitioner can be considered an arriving alien.iirira superseded the fleuti doctrine and its intent test when the act replaced the provision with the current a c the plain language of the statute does not allow for the exception found by the court in fleuti see ashcroft.cir per curiam fleuti has been superceded by the enactment of certain iirira provisions in cases involving suspension of deportation.our conclusion regarding iirira effect on the fleuti doctrine is consistent with those of our sister circuits.see,tapia ashcroft,cir the fleuti doctrine has been superseded by the iirira tineo ashcroft,cir congress has also set forth six scenarios under which a returning lawful permanent resident may not retain that status.in those scenarios,where congress has deemed fleuti doctrine irrelevant,a can not be read to permit an inquiry into the alien intent.see also ins,cir noting absence of brief,casual,and innocent and did not meaningfully interrupt the continuous physical presence provision for calculating residence period in iirira.
even if the effect of iirira on the fleuti doctrine were not so plain,the deference we accord the bia regarding its construction of immigration law yields the same result.in in re collado,the bia concluded that the fleuti doctrine did not survive iirira passage,wl bia under chevron,natural resources defense council,we subject the bia construction of the law it administers to a deferential review.trominski,cir citing chevron,d.this review involves a inquiry.first,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if congress intent is clear,the agency and the courts are bound to give effect to it.id.at quoting moosa ins,cir.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we ask the second question,whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.as discussed above,we find the statute language to be clear.even were it not,petitioner the placement of the word unless allows for the logical possibility of an lpr who has committed one of the listed offenses not being deemed to seek not render the bia reading of the statute impermissible.the statute command that an lpr shall not be regarded as seeking admission unless she has committed a crime of moral turpitude certainly permits the determination of an lpr who has committed such a crime as seeking admission.even if we agreed with petitioner reading,to hold otherwise would be to simply impose this court own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.id.at.chevron commands we not go so far.
constitutional objections 
petitioner raises constitutional objections to the determination of her as an arriving alien.these take a variety of forms but boil down to an argument that her treatment violates a nebulous constitutional core of fleuti and the fifth amendment due process clause guarantees of equal protection and due process 
petitioner argues that fleuti,while nominally based on statutory grounds,in fact reaffirmed a constitutional core of fair treatment of immigrants that courts had applied prior to a enactment in.in tracing the congressional intent behind the statute,the fleuti court did indeed review the caselaw preceding the ina enactment,in particular the definition of entry.fleuti,at.in several instances,judges had endeavored to ameliorate the rather harsh definition adopted by the court in united states ex rel volpe smith,which excluded even resident aliens who left only briefly.id.at.citing carmichael delaney,cir yukio chai bonham,cir delguercio delgadillo,cir and di pasquale karnuth,cir.the fleuti court discussion of these opinions,which preceded congress passage of a,does not evince any constitutional core.in di pasquale and delgadillo,the primary cases discussed in fleuti,the judges looked to congress and its intent to ameliorate a judicial rule.fleuti,at.nowhere in this fleuti discussion is the constitution even mentioned fleuti is properly read as a case of statutory interpretation,and the statute it interprets has been amended.no constitutional core has been violated in this case.
with respect to equal protection,petitioner claims that a is unconstitutional because there is no rational basis to distinguish between lprs who have committed offenses under a and left the country briefly and those who have also committed the offenses but have not left.having left the country renders the former category inadmissible even though they might not be deportable under a 
we subject the classification at issue to rational basis review.because petitioner claim attacks a distinction among aliens,our equal protection review is necessarily narrow for over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens,at quoting fiallo bell,d punctuation omitted see also gonzales,cir per curiam congress may make classifications of aliens as long as it has a facially legitimate reason for making the distinction.indeed,the federal government can enact legislation that would be invalid under the fourteenth amendment if enacted by a state,particularly if the legislation relate s to immigration.id.at.we thus apply rational basis review to petitioner claims.ashcroft,cir.
rational basis review begins with a strong presumption of constitutional validity.gonzales,cir citing heller doe,d.it is petitioner burden to show that the law,is arbitrary and not the government to establish rationality.kite marshall,cir.under rational basis review,differential treatment must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification,at quoting fcc beach commc ns,d.petitioner argues that congress has proffered no reason to distinguish between an lpr not subject to deportation who leaves the united states briefly for innocent purposes and one who did not leave.
the lines drawn here by congress separate lprs who have committed violations from those who have not,and those who remain in the country from those who do not.congress choice to disfavor the admission of aliens who have committed offenses is not irrational.see giusto ins,cir upholding c making discretionary relief unavailable to alien who has committed certain crimes against equal protection challenge.nor is its decision to make getting into the united states more difficult than remaining.see,gisbert att y,cir noting a liens subject to deportation generally are granted greater substantive rights than are excludable aliens ashcroft,cir determining equal protection not denied where excludable alien required to undergo sundry procedures for admission where deportable alien claims would be considered in deportation hearing but see chuang att y,cir upholding against equal protection attack antiterrorism and effective death penalty act bar against discretionary relief for deportable aliens and allowance for such relief for excludable aliens.that petitioner,by dint of her decisions to commit welfare fraud and leave the country,finds herself doubly disadvantaged does not mean her constitutional rights have been violated.her innocent reason for departing the united states does not affect the constitutionality of congress law,or its application.
petitioner likens her case to francis ins,cir.in francis,the second circuit determined that the bia interpretation of the ina deprived the petitioner of equal protection where it rendered him ineligible for discretionary waiver by virtue or vice of his conviction for a marijuana offense.because of the piecemeal way waiver had been applied to certain deportation proceedings,francis would have been eligible had he left,and then,the united states.id.at.fundamental fairness dictates,the court wrote,that permanent resident aliens who are in like circumstances,but for irrelevant and fortuitous factors,be treated in a like manner.id.at.francis concerned a distinction drawn between aliens in deportation proceedings.although the plain language of the provision at issue,c of the ina,was limited to exclusion proceedings,several decisions had extended its application to certain deportation contexts the second circuit saw no reason to distinguish those deportation contexts from francis.even if francis were on point statutorily and retained its force in light of subsequent amendments,the case is of no aid to petitioner.first,this circuit has refused to extend the meaning of francis to the distinction between aliens being deported and those being excluded,which is at issue here.see pasquarell,cir.second,petitioner case is the obverse of francis.she is disadvantaged because she left,not because she stayed.the case reasoning,equating not departing with a strong tie to the united states meriting better treatment,francis,at,does not apply here.where immigration is concerned,it is hardly irrational to attach legal detriment to leaving the country.
petitioner also raises a substantive due process challenge to her designation as an arriving alien.she argues that her liberty interests in staying in the united states and being with her children have been violated,and that her designation as arriving is fundamentally unfair.to establish a substantive due process violation,a plaintiff must first both carefully describe that right and establish it as deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.washington glucksberg,d quoting moore east cleveland,d.if the right is so deeply it is subject it to more exacting standards of review.if it is not,we review only for a rational basis.brennan stewart,cir.
petitioner has no right to be admitted to the united states.united states,cir.and while parents do have certain fundamental rights with respect to their children beyond keeping her from the united states,petitioner does not claim that the government has interfered with any such right.she is welcome to take her children with her to mexico.petitioner predicament does not constitute a deprivation of substantive due process.see,mccurdy dodd,cir t he supreme court has protected the parent only when the government directly acts to sever or otherwise affect his or her legal relationship with a child.the court has never held that governmental action that affects the parental relationship only incidentally is susceptible to challenge for a violation of due process quoting valdivieso ortiz burgos,cir.to find a substantive due process violation of parental rights here would subject to strict scrutiny any attempt by the government to incarcerate or bar from entry into the country a parent with children,or child with parents,in the united states.this can not be the proper rule.what petitioner seeks is admission,and the government needs only a rational basis to enforce a law that bars her admission.as discussed above,it has one.
petitioner fundamental unfairness argument is nothing more than her equal protection argument recast in substantive due process terms,and we reject it.
the second question is whether the bia erred in concluding fuentes was ineligible for a waiver of admissibility under h petitioner main argument is that her ineligibility deprives her of equal protection.as discussed above,we conduct only rational basis review.petitioner makes two arguments that her ineligibility for waiver violates equal protection.first,she asserts that,by requiring lprs,but not,to reside lawfully for seven years in order to be eligible for a h waiver,the statute denies her equal protection.petitioner asserts it is irrational to make lprs ineligible for a waiver for which,who enter the country illegally,are eligible.every one of our sister courts to have addressed this question have upheld h apparent favoring of against equal protection attack.see de ashcroft,cir,cir lukowski,cir moore ashcroft,cir,cir umanzor,cir table.in doing,they have identified several different rationales that might underlie the distinction.we agree with them that the law has a rational basis.
second,and chiefly,petitioner challenges the operation of the statute,arguing there is no basis to deny the waiver to lprs inadmissible un
