plaintiffs albert and regina davidson are guardians of year old marilyn davidson whom we refer to as marilyn,who is in state care.they appeal from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction in an action purported to be brought under the federal medicaid act and various implementing regulations.davidson howe,cv wgy.plaintiffs sought to enjoin marilyn transfer from the fernald developmental center,her home since and which was being closed,to her new home at the wrentham developmental center.both are intermediate care facilities icfs for the intellectually disabled operated by the massachusetts department of developmental services dds.
on appeal,the davidsons argue in their briefs that the district court erred in denying the injunction and in holding that the statutory and regulatory provisions cited in their complaint.a and,do not create a private right of action.
the commonwealth argues that plaintiffs case should be dismissed because the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief have been rendered moot by marilyn completed transfer to wrentham,and that plaintiffs claim for money damages is barred by the eleventh amendment.we agree that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief in the case are moot.the case does not raise issues which fall into an exception for mootness.we also hold that the damages claim is barred by the state eleventh amendment immunity.we do not reach the question of whether there is a private right of action under the statute and accompanying regulations.
marilyn is intellectually disabled and has been in dds care for most of her life.marilyn was first admitted to fernald at age six in.at age sixteen,marilyn was transferred to metropolitan state hospital.other than a short period when she lived in westborough state hospital,she remained at metropolitan state hospital until,at which time she was transferred back to fernald.in,the commonwealth announced that it would close fernald,described as by far the most costly of the icfs to run and the most seriously noncompliant with the americans with disabilities act of,et.ex rel.davidson dep t of developmental servs.davidson i,review denied.in,after protracted litigation,this court held that the commonwealth could close fernald without the landmark consent decree,see ricci okin ricci iii,that brought to an end more than two decades of institutional reform litigation concerning the intellectually disabled in massachusetts ricci patrick ricci v,cir.
under the ricci consent decree,certain disputes about treatment of class members are submitted to the state system.see id.at.there were extensive state administrative and judicial proceedings leading up to marilyn transfer from fernald.following this court decision in ricci v,dds began to plan marilyn transfer from fernald.dds discussed with plaintiffs various alternative placements including at the two icfs that would remain in operation wrentham and the hogan regional center as well as at state and facilities.davidson i.at,at.plaintiffs made plain that they opposed marilyn transfer from fernald.id.in may,dds gave plaintiffs notice of its specific plan to transfer marilyn from fernald to wrentham.id.at,at see.laws ch.plaintiffs objected and dds referred the matter to the massachusetts division of administrative law appeals.davidson i.at,at see.laws ch.chapter,of massachusetts general laws is a state law providing an administrative due process mechanism for review of agency decisions,followed by a mechanism for judicial review in the state courts.an evidentiary hearing was held before an administrative magistrate.the magistrate approved the transfer,concluding that marilyn transfer to wrentham would result in improved services and quality of life and was in her best interest.davidson i.at,at see.laws ch.

dds continued to plan for marilyn transfer.on august,dds held a meeting with plaintiffs and fernald and wrentham staff members to update marilyn individual transition plan itp.under the updated itp,marilyn was scheduled to move to wrentham on october.
on october,plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that the itp for marilyn transfer violated the federal medicaid statute and various implementing regulations see a.that same day,plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,seeking to delay marilyn transfer from fernald to wrentham until such time as dds adopted an appropriate transition plan.
the district court held an initial hearing on october,during which it directed the parties to file additional briefing on whether the various federal regulations cited in the complaint created a private right of action and,if so,what legal standard the court was to use to adjudicate plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on october.on october,the district court held a second hearing,during which the court denied plaintiffs request for injunctive relief on the ground that the regulations cited in the original complaint did not create a private right of action,but nonetheless allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint the court held further that marilyn transfer could proceed on october absent a stay from this court.plaintiffs appealed and asked this court for a stay pending appeal.this court denied plaintiffs request for a stay on october,reasoning that,even if plaintiffs had a private right of action,the court ha d no confidence at this stage that staying the transfer would do marilyn more good than harm.marilyn was transferred the next day to wrentham and has continued to reside there.
we take up the question of mootness.in their briefs,plaintiffs took the position the case was not moot because they say they have ongoing claims for declaratory and injunctive relief as to marilyn care and so fall under an exception to the mootness doctrine,and because they have a remaining claim for damages from the transfer.at oral argument,counsel for plaintiffs agreed that the declaratory and injunctive relief originally sought,both regarding marilyn itp,are now moot.
the doctrine of mootness enforces the mandate that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.am.civil liberties union of conference of catholic bishops aclu,cir quoting mangual rotger sabat,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if events have transpired to render a court opinion merely advisory,article iii considerations require dismissal of the case.mangual,at.the burden of establishing mootness rests with the party invoking the doctrine aclu,at.
here,the transfer from fernald to wrentham has been completed and the administrative plan under which the transfer was effectuated is no longer in effect as to marilyn.absent a cognizable claim for damages,when a challenged plan goes out of effect,there is literally no controversy left for the court to case is no longer live.aclu,at quoting powell mccormack.more still,a court can provide no meaningful relief to the challenging party since,once the plan ceases to be operative,there is no plan left to enjoin,new eng.reg l council of carpenters kinton,cir,and,w ith limited exceptions,issuance of a declaratory judgment deeming past conduct illegal is also not permissible as it would be merely advisory.aclu,at.
plaintiffs maintain that their original complaint is not moot,first because their case nonetheless fits an exception to the mootness doctrine,and second because they have a cognizable claim for damages.both arguments fail.
capable of repetition,yet evading review 
plaintiffs argue that the issues presented are capable of repetition,yet evading review.pac.terminal interstate commerce comm n,see,in re grand jury proceedings,cir aclu,at.this exception to the mootness doctrine applies only in exceptional situations.city of los angeles lyons.plaintiffs must show that the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.weinstein bradford.
the davidsons can not meet those standards.in fact,they litigated in the state administrative and judicial systems the questions about the appropriateness of marilyn transfer for over three years.their state litigation ended in june they filed this federal suit four months later.
in any event,plaintiffs have done nothing to show a reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability,aclu,at quoting murphy hunt,per curiam,that marilyn will again be subjected to the alleged illegality as to her transfer,id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting lyons,at.dds insists that it has no plan to transfer marilyn again.plaintiffs make no contrary allegation.fernald has now been closed.
instead,plaintiffs try to reshape their case.they now contend that dds,is likely to afford marilyn inadequate care,in contravention of unspecified medicaid regulatory requirements.in their original complaint,plaintiffs alleged that adherence to the itp for marilyn transfer from one icf to another would result in undue harm to marilyn by requiring her to transition without adequate precautions.this is the only alleged illegality at issue,and the transfer has been completed.if plaintiffs have new complaints based on marilyn care,they must utilize their state remedies.see ricci v,at the disengagement order and state regulations provide a procedure and a place where individual disputes about adequacy of the services resulting from the isp process may be heard again,the disengagement order commits these disputes to resolution in a state forum and under state law and thus provides no basis for federal court intervention.ricci iii.at individual isp disputes shall be enforced solely through the state isp process.
claim for damages 
plaintiffs claim for damages is squarely foreclosed by the commonwealth eleventh amendment immunity from suit for damages in federal court though the district court did not reach this issue,we deal with it because plaintiffs have directly argued the issue to us as part of mootness,in the interest of efficiency,and because the record makes the issue manifest.see,in re keeper of records grand jury subpoena addressed to xyz,cir.as one commentator has noted,a damages claim suffices to avoid mootness only if viable.wright miller,federal practice procedure ed emphasis added.
a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the eleventh amendment.edelman jordan.this is true whether the named defendant is the state itself or,as here,a state official in her official capacity.rosie ex rel.john swift,cir as a general matter,the eleventh amendment bars suits in federal courts against unconsenting states including official capacity suits against state hierarchs.see also will.dep t of state police,a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official office.as such,it is no different from a suit against the state itself.citation omitted.
