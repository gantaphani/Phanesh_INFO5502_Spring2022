petitioner kelechi gerald nwozuzu was born in nigeria and came to this country when he was four years old.when he was seventeen,his parents were naturalized as united states citizens.the question presented is whether nwozuzu failure to become a lawful permanent resident before turning eighteen years old bars him from claiming derivative citizenship from his parents.we hold it does not.
statement of the case 
in considering nwozuzu claim,this court must apply the law in effect when petitioner fulfilled the last requirement for derivative citizenship.ashton gonzales,cir.here,the law in effect when old nwozuzu applied for lawful permanent residence status after his parents were naturalized was former section a of the immigration and nationality act the ina,a repealed section a section a provided in pertinent part 
a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon fulfillment of the following conditions 
the naturalization of both parents 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a petitioner could satisfy the requirements of section a in two ways.under the first clause,a minor who was a lawful permanent resident automatically became a citizen at the time the last parent was naturalized.under the second clause,a minor could derive citizenship if,after the last parent naturalized,he beg an to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.id.it is this second clause upon which nwozuzu claim is based.
the facts are undisputed.nwozuzu was born on march,in nigeria.in,he entered the united states as the child of f nonimmigrant students.in,his father filed an immediate relative visa petition,form i,on nwozuzu behalf,which was approved in march.in,both his parents were naturalized as citizens.on february,at the age of seventeen,nwozuzu applied for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.his application was not decided at that time 
five months later,nwozuzu filed a form i application for travel document to visit his ailing grandmother in nigeria,but he left for nigeria before that application was approved.on august,nwozuzu was denied readmittance because he had left the country without obtaining a travel document.he was readmitted on december,after becoming a lawful permanent resident at the age of.
on january,nwozuzu was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,involving a loaded firearm,in violation of penal law criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree,involving a loaded firearm,in violation of penal law and unlawful possession of marijuana,in violation of penal law.
procedural history 
on june,the department of homeland security dhs filed a notice to appear charging nwozuzu with removability under section a c of the ina,a c,based on his convictions for possession of a firearm 
nwozuzu applied for citizenship in august and april,but his application was not approved.
on october,the immigration judge the ij held that dhs failed to meet its burden to establish alienage and terminated proceedings against nwozuzu.dhs appealed the decision to the board of immigration appeals the bia.on september,the bia issued its decision the september decision,sustaining dhs appeal and remanding the case to the ij to complete removal proceedings.see matter of nwozuzu,bia.
in the september decision,the bia read the phrase begins to reside permanently in section a to require nwozuzu to have become a lawful permanent resident before turning eighteen to derive citizenship from his naturalized parents.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,the bia considered the definition of the words residence,permanent,and lawfully admitted for permanent residence.id.at.the bia also noted that the residing permanently language in the ina definition of lawfully admitted for permanent residence in section a closely tracks the language begins to reside permanently in section a.id.at.it therefore concluded that this similarity strongly suggests that congress intended to impose a requirement that an alien must obtain lawful permanent residence before the age of to acquire derivative citizenship.id.the bia also held that failing to read reside permanently to require lawful permanent resident status would effectively negate the lawful permanent resident requirement of the first clause,rendering it surplusage.id.at.
after additional proceedings before the ij and the bia,on november,the bia dismissed nwozuzu appeal of the ij denial of his request to terminate the proceedings.in re nwozuzu,no.bia,aff g no.imm.june.the bia relied primarily on the reasoning in its september decision concluding that nwozuzu did not derive citizenship from his parents because he did not become a lawful permanent resident before turning eighteen.
the bia issued a final order of removal on november,and nwozuzu timely filed this petition for review on december.
discussion 
as a general matter,this court reviews bia determinations of law de novo.iavorski ins,cir.agency interpretations of statutes are reviewed under chevron,u,natural res.def.council,d.under the first prong of chevron,this court determines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter id.if,however,there is ambiguity,the second prong of chevron requires that this court defer to an agency interpretation of the statute if that interpretation is reasonable.id.at.
we conclude that,both in the text of the statute and its legislative history,congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue.section a provided that a child whose parents were naturalized and who beg an to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years could obtain derivative citizenship.a see also ins cardoza fonseca,d w hether congress intended the two standards to be identical is a pure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide.as we discuss below,this was true even for a child who was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence before turning eighteen.
a.the statutory text 
when interpreting a statutory provision,we begin with the language of the statute.saks franklin covey,cir every exercise in statutory construction must begin with the words of the text.if the statutory terms are unambiguous,we construe the statute according to the plain meaning of its words.see rubin united states,d greenery rehab,hammon,cir.the plain meaning is best discerned by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.saks,at.if,however,the terms are ambiguous or unclear,we may consider legislative history and other tools of statutory interpretation.greenery,at aslanidis lines,cir.applying these general rules of statutory construction,we conclude that congress intended for the two clauses in section a to mean different things.
first,the two clauses use different words 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a emphasis added.this alone is instructive,for w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.cardoza fonseca,at quotation and alteration omitted see also barnhart sigmon coal,d.
second,these phrases have plainly different meanings.l awfully admitted for permanent residence is a term of art.see,reprinted in,see also gooch clark,cir.as defined by the ina,it means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.a.that phrase that term of art does not appear in the second clause.rather,section a employs the generic phrase reside permanently,which is not defined by the ina.but see id.a defining permanent as a relationship of continuing or lasting nature,as distinguished from temporary,but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the united states or of the individual,in accordance with law.
our conclusion that these two phrases are not coextensive is further reinforced by other sections of the ina,in which the phrases lawfully admitted for permanent residence and reside permanently are used in a manner that suggest their meanings are distinct.for example,before it was revised in,section allowed parents to request a certificate of citizenship for a child if,among other requirements,the child was residing permanently in the united states with the citizen parent,pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.a a emphasis added amended.if one could only reside permanently in the united states as a lawful permanent resident,then the phrase pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence would have been superfluous.see duncan walker,d a statute must be construed to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word quotation omitted.
similarly,section provides that,in the case of former citizens who lost their citizenship by fighting for other countries during world war ii,the former citizen shall not be naturalized unless he has been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence and intends to reside permanently in the united states.b emphasis added.as used in section,lawfully admitted for permanent residence and reside permanently are clearly separate clauses that must carry different meanings.see sosa alvarez machain,d where congress uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
third,our precedent has already established that to reside permanently in section a requires something less than a lawful admission of permanent residency.see ashton gonzales,cir in ashton,the government sought to exclude a petitioner who was not a lawful permanent resident at the time his parent was naturalized.the government argued that to reside permanently,an alien must be a lawful permanent resident of the united states.see id.at.we,however,rejected the arguments advanced by the government and concluded that,apart from actually being lawfully admitted for permanent residency,some lesser official objective manifestation of beginning to reside permanently would satisfy the requirements of section a.see id.at but finding that petitioner subjective intent alone did not meet that threshold.
finally,this interpretation of section a provides meaning to both of its clauses without rendering either superfluous.the first clause addresses the class of minors who were lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the second parent was naturalized they automatically derived citizenship upon the parent naturalization.by contrast,the second clause addresses minors who,at the time the second parent was naturalized,either lived abroad or lived in the united states but had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.these minors did not derive citizenship automatically upon the parent naturalization rather,they derived citizenship automatically,but only after they resided in the united states and garnered some official objective manifestation of their intent to reside permanently.see id.at rejecting notion that subjective intent alone satisfies section a,but suggesting that applying for permanent resident status would meet the requirement.
thus,under section a,a minor derived citizenship if the second parent was naturalized and he thereafter beg an to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years irrespective of whether he had been lawfully admitted for permanent residence before turning eighteen.
legislative history 
to the extent there is any ambiguity in the words of the statute,the legislative history of section a lends further support to our interpretation,in two respects.first,the history of the laws governing the derivative naturalization of children demonstrates clearly that congress intended lawful admission for permanent residence and reside permanently to mean different things.second,the legislative history also makes clear congress intent to preserve the family unit and to keep families intact.
derivative citizenship laws 
the first statute allowing children to derive citizenship from their parents naturalization was enacted as part of the naturalization act of.see ch,stat.this provision,amended slightly by subsequent naturalization acts,was eventually codified as section of the revised statutes of the united states 
the children of persons who have been duly naturalized under any law of the united states,being under the age of years at the time of the naturalization of their parents,shall,if dwelling in the united states,be considered as citizens thereof 
stat.repealed emphasis added,quoted in united states ex rel.patton tod,cir see also zartarian billings.noting section was largely unchanged since the.for more than a century,the derivative citizenship statute simply required that the foreign child be dwelling within the united states,but did not explicitly require that such dwelling be permanent or even lawful.indeed,at the time of its original enactment,there were no federal immigration laws with which aliens had to comply.see patton,at.based on the plain language of section,it became that a child dwelling within the united states at the time her parents were naturalized automatically became a citizen.see id.at.
it was also generally presumed that section granted citizenship to children who were living abroad at the time their parents were naturalized and later began dwelling in the united states,but the statutory language was ambiguous in this regard.see id.at charles gordon et,immigration law procedure f ed.it was unclear when these children had to begin dwelling in the united states and when they would be deemed citizens.see zartarian,at noting that section raised these questions,but they were not before the court.to clarify these issues,congress enacted section of the citizenship act of the act,which provided 
a child born without the united states of alien parents shall be deemed a citizen of the united states by virtue of the naturalization of the parent provided,that such naturalization or resumption takes place during the minority of such child and provided further,that the citizenship of such minor child shall begin at the time such minor child begins to reside permanently in the united states.
ch,stat,repealed see also patton,at.thus,the reside permanently requirement was first introduced in section of the act section,until it was repealed in,continued to require merely dwelling in the united states.moreover,neither statute used the term lawful.
because of the ambiguity surrounding stat,courts construed that provision and section of the act as addressing two separate situations 
under,a minor child dwelling in the united states at the time of the naturalization of the parent automatically becomes an american citizen.under section of the act of march,a child,not in the united states when the parent is naturalized,becomes a citizen only from such time as,while still a minor,it begins to reside permanently in the united states.
patton,at see also gordon,supra,although it dealt with the same subject matter as section of the revised statutes,the act used variant terminology and did not mention,modify,or repeal the former statute.congress finally combined these two separate provisions into section of the nationality act of 
a child born outside of alien parents,becomes a citizen of the united states upon fulfillment of the following conditions 
a the naturalization of both parents
