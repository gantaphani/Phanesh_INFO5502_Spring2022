petitioner,dhanvir toora,proceeding pro se,raises on appeal the question of whether the departure bar,b,applies to an alien who departs the united states after receiving notice of his deportation proceeding,but before the proceeding is completed and the immigration judge ij enters a deportation order.we find the departure bar does apply in this situation and divests the ij of jurisdiction to hear the alien motion to reopen his deportation proceeding.
toora is a native of india.he illegally entered the united states in february without being inspected by an immigration officer.the day after his entry,toora was personally served with an order to show cause why he should not be deported for entering the united states without inspection pursuant to then a b now a b.toora was detained at the port isabel service processing center pispc in los fresnos,texas.
on march,a notice to appear nta was sent to toora,care of pispc,notifying him that his deportation hearing was scheduled for april.the notice also stated that if toora failed to appear at the scheduled deportation hearing,he could be ordered deported in absentia.
also on march,toora posted bond and was released from custody.toora reported that he was moving to a new york address.toora left the united states on march,and returned to india without notifying ins of his departure.
on april,toora deportation proceeding was held.toora was not in attendance and the ij ordered toora deported in absentia.the ij determined that the record showed by clear and convincing evidence that toora was provided with a written nta and that he could be deported.
on august,toora the united states under a different name.he did not disclose his prior entry or the april deportation proceedings of which he had received notice.upon his,toora applied for asylum.unaware of toora prior entry and deportation,an ins asylum officer granted toora asylum.
in march,dhs informed toora of its intention to rescind the august grant of asylum.dhs stated that the ins asylum officer had been without jurisdiction to grant asylum because of toora earlier deportation proceedings.according to the dhs,b now b gives immigration judges exclusive jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by aliens who are in deportation proceedings.dhs asserted that toora had been ordered deported in april,but that the order was never executed.dhs reasoned,therefore,that the deportation proceedings remained pending and thus the ij retained exclusive jurisdiction over toora asylum application,to the exclusion of the ins officer.based on this reasoning,dhs concluded the august grant of asylum by the ins asylum officer was void ab initio.
toora did not challenge the dhs position that the asylum officer had been without jurisdiction.instead,toora responded by filing a motion to reopen and rescind the april in abstentia deportation order.toora argued that he never received the nta for the april,deportation hearing.the ij first determined that toora received written notice of the april deportation hearing.the ij further found that under b referred to as the departure bar,he lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion to reopen and denied the motion.alternatively,the ij determined that assuming he did have jurisdiction,toora motion should be denied because it was pursuant to b iii a,which requires that a motion to reopen a deportation order entered in absentia must be filed within days after the order of deportation is entered.
toora appealed the ij order to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia dismissed toora appeal.first,the bia affirmed the ijs finding that toora received notice of the april deportation hearing.the bia concluded,however,that the ij did have jurisdiction to hear toora motion to reopen because the departure bar was inapplicable.the bia,nonetheless,agreed with the ij that toora motion was and that no equitable tolling excused the late filing because toora failed to exercise due diligence in seeking a rescission of the april deportation order.the bia then affirmed the denial of the motion to reopen.
toora timely appealed the bia order.

iii.analysis 
the threshold issue on appeal is whether the ij had jurisdiction over toora motion to reopen toora argues on appeal that the ij correctly held that he lacked jurisdiction to consider toora motion to reopen the april deportation proceeding because toora was subject to deportation proceedings when he departed the united states.toora bases his argument on his interpretation of the regulation establishing the departure bar,which states in pertinent part that a motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal,deportation,or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states b.toora argues that this regulation divested the ij of jurisdiction to hear his motion to reopen and reconsider his april deportation 
the government argues that the bia was correct in determining that the ij had jurisdiction to hear toora motion.the government contends that the departure bar applies only when an alien departs the united states after an order of deportation is entered.
toora argues first that the ij and the bia erred in finding that toora received the nta before he departed the country on march.our review of the record reveals that substantial evidence supports that finding,and we see no basis to disturb this finding of fact.because toora received notice of his deportation proceeding and he was deportable based on his entering the united states without inspection,the original ij had the authority pursuant to to hold a deportation hearing and enter a valid deportation order in absentia.
because a valid deportation order was entered against toora,the question in this case narrows to whether the departure bar applies to an alien who departs the united states after receiving notice of his deportation proceeding,but before the actual proceeding concludes and an ij enters a valid deportation order.this court has considered the application of the departure bar when the alien departs the united states after termination of removal proceedings.in ovalles holder,cir,an alien was convicted of a felony and removed from the united states following a removal hearing before an ij and an appeal to the bia.three years after his removal,the alien filed a motion with the bia to reopen and reconsider his removal proceedings in light of a united states supreme court case decided after he was deported.we held that the departure bar applies to aliens who depart the united states after the termination of their removal proceedings,and that the ij lacked jurisdiction to hear the alien motion to reopen his case.see also matter of,i n,bia holding that the departure bar prohibited an alien from invoking bia jurisdiction to consider his motion to reopen when the motion was filed after the alien departure from the united states following a final administrative order of removal.
the ninth circuit has examined the application of the departure bar to an alien who departs the united states before removal proceedings are initiated.in singh gonzales,cir,an alien remained in the united states past the time authorized on his visitor visa.the alien initially applied for asylum,but then wrote a letter withdrawing his asylum application and departed the united states the asylum office was not aware that the alien had departed the united states and served a nta on the
