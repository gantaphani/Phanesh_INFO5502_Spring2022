orbain owens filed a complaint pursuant to alleging that various officials employed by the tennessee department of correction tdoc,george keeling,charles szostecki,joel leegon,jane doe weston,john doe sarago,and charles traughber,and tennessee board of probation and parole tbopp violated his rights to free speech,due process,and equal protection of the laws,as well as the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the constitution.const.amends.i,viii,xiv.the district court dismissed his complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act plra,a,and denied owens application to proceed as a pauper on appeal.owens appealed both aspects of the judgment and the imposition of a second filing fee after his first complaint was dismissed for failure to exhaust.because the district court erroneously considered the prison grievance procedure an available remedy for owens complaint under the plra,a,and failed to consider submissions showing that owens exhausted the available remedy for complaints,we reverse the dismissal of owens complaint.we also hold that a second filing fee should not be assessed to a prisoner whose initial complaint was dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust.we grant owens in forma pauperis status on appeal.
background 
in,owens was imprisoned in nashville,tennessee,at the middle tennessee correctional complex annex mtcx.at compl.on september,george keeling,a classification coordinator at mtcx,approached owens and invited him to take part in a voluntary counseling program that tbopp had recommended.at compl.the next day,an individual program planner hearing was held pursuant to tdoc administrative policies and procedures app regarding transferring owens from mtcx to another facility so that he could receive counseling,which was not offered at mtcx.at,compl.at this meeting,owens learned that tbopp was postponing its consideration of his parole eligibility until he participated in the program.at compl.on september,a classification panel hearing was held,during which charles szostecki,a classification coordinator at mtcx and the chairperson of the panel,told owens that he was being transferred to the west tennessee high security facility to receive counseling,despite owens objection that he should not be transferred because he was incompatible with an inmate already imprisoned there.at,compl.this same day,owens filed a classification appeal.at classification appeal.
on september,having not yet received any response to his classification appeal,at compl,owens wrote letters to donal campbell,commissioner of tdoc,regarding his reclassification for mental health treatment and his placement on punitive segregation,at owens letter to campbell at,and to candace whisman,his work supervisor,see at whisman letter to owens.on september,owens filed an inmate grievance.the following day,sheila howard,mtcx grievance chairperson,notified owens that his grievance is unable to be processed as you have submitted due to you not following policy,and that c lassification matters are inappropriate to grievance procedure.at howard memo.on september,owens was transferred to the northwest correctional center main compound nwcc,a second reclassification.at compl.on october,he was moved to the northwest correctional center annex nwcx to attend the counseling program there.at compl.
sometime after his transfer to nwcc and before october,owens wrote to fred raney,then warden of nwcc and nwcx,regarding a transfer back to mtcx.at raney mem.to owens.then owens again contacted whisman,and she forwarded owens letter to brandon maloney,assistant director of classification.at whisman letter to owens.on march,maloney sent owens a letter acknowledging and then denying his transfer request.at maloney letter to owens.maloney suggested that owens contact raymond goodgine,a classification coordinator at nwcc,about his reclassification hearing,but stated that maloney office would take no action unless the classification coordinator or his staff recommended a transfer.id.on april,pursuant to goodgine advice,owens wrote a letter to keeling requesting to be transferred back to mtcx because he had completed his counseling at nwcx.at owens letter to keeling.keeling did not respond.on august,owens wrote to tony parker,then warden of nwcc and nwcx,regarding a transfer back to mtcx.at owens letter to parker.parker forwarded this letter to goodgine.at goodgine mem.to owens.on august,owens wrote to howard cook,tdoc commissioner of operations,regarding a transfer.see at owens letter to cook.on august,goodgine responded to owens letter to parker by explaining that he contacted keeling regarding owens transfer back to mtcx.at goodgine mem.to owens.goodgine included keeling response we sent subject there for mental health program at his request for treatment.we did not tell him he could come back after treatment.per the parole board,he is to continue in current treatment and they will see him again.id.goodgine concluded i sincerely hope this will reinforce the many times i have told you that if mtcx wanted you,they would send a request.by virtue of this letter,i consider this a finalized issue.id.emphasis added.
on june,owens filed his first complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee docket alleging violations of his constitutional rights by tdoc officials,which the district court dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust.on june,owens filed a motion for relief from judgment,as well as a supporting brief and documentation.the district judge acknowledged that the documentation attached to owens motion show ed that he had fully exhausted his administrative remedies prior to the filing of this action,but denied the motion because a prisoner plaintiff is not allowed to amend his complaint to avoid a sua sponte dismissal.appellant br.ex.b july,order.
on august,owens applied to proceed in forma pauperis in another action docket against the same defendants.this matter was assigned to the same district judge,who denied owens application the day it was filed.owens filed a motion to vacate the judgment denying his application.owens then moved the district court to stay this motion pending the appeal he filed on october.
on september,owens filed a third complaint docket raising the same or similar claims.at form compl.at,compl.at.the same district judge once again dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust and denied owens certification to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal under a because an appeal from the judgment would not be taken in good faith.at,order.owens then timely appealed the october,judgment dismissing his complaint,and that appeal is presently before us.at notice of appeal at.
ii.exhaustion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a prisoner suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plra,a.burton jones,cir curry scott,cir.
background 
although the plra exhaustion requirement is a necessary prerequisite to filing prisoner claims in federal court rather than jurisdictional,wyatt leonard,cir,we have directed that district courts can no longer waive the exhaustion requirement,see brown toombs,cir.the prisoner bears the burden of demonstrating that he administratively exhausted his claim,either by attaching documentation of the relevant administrative decisions or by detailing the process followed and the outcome in the complaint knuckles el toombs,cir.we have held that the plra does not require total exhaustion,and have instead adopted a rule of partial exhaustion that is,when a prisoner files a complaint containing exhausted and unexhausted claims,the prisoner can proceed with his exhausted claims despite the dismissal of his unexhausted claims for failure to exhaust.spencer bouchard,cir citing burton jones,cir hartsfield vidor,cir.but see jones bey johnson,cir holding that the plra requires total exhaustion 
tdoc recognizes two separate avenues for pursuing a prisoner grievance or other complaint that are relevant to this case the grievance process and the classification appeals process.the grievance process begins with the filing of an inmate grievance.app.under app vi g,this grievance process is inappropriate for.a ddressing matters such as institutional placement and custody level,which may be appealed through other avenues outlined in the tdoc policy series,except where policy violations are alleged.the classification appeals process provides a separate remedy for prisoners complaints regarding classification decisions such as institutional placement and custody level.
owens began by pursuing his complaint regarding his transfer through the classification appeals process.he also pursued the grievance process by filing an inmate grievance.however,once owens received notice that his inmate grievance was,he did not pursue any appeals related to his inmate grievance because he correctly determined that the classification appeal was the appropriate venue for airing his concern.appellant br.at.the district court dismissed owens complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he failed to appeal the determination of his inmate grievance as and because his letter to campbell does not constitute an appeal within the meaning of the plra.at dist.mem.at.the district court did not consider owens pursuit of the classification appeals process.
grievance process 
the plra states that an action can not be filed until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a emphasis added.in analyzing the meaning of available remedies under the plra,we have previously concluded that s o long as the prison system has an administrative process that will review a prisoner complaint the prisoner must exhaust his prison remedies.wyatt,at.tdoc has a flat rule declining jurisdiction,in its grievance process for grievances that are related to institutional placement and custody level,which may be appealed through other avenues outlined in the tdoc policy series,except where policy violations are alleged,app vi g.because owens complaint relates to his institutional placement and did not allege a policy violation,it is through the grievance process and must instead be pursued through the classification appeals process as outlined in app.the of owens complaint through the grievance process makes that remedy unavailable under the plra,and thus he does not have to pursue that remedy to exhaust his claim.see wyatt,at rancher franklin county,cir holding that a issue met wyatt flat rule declining jurisdiction standard and thus that the prisoner need not pursue the grievance process to exhaust the claim.
the fact that owens could have appealed this decision,see app vi g stating that i f the chairperson determines a matter to be,the grievant may appeal that decision as outlined in the handbook tdoc inmate grievance procedures,is immaterial because a prisoner is not required to pursue a remedy where the prison system has an policy declining to utilize that remedy for the type of claim raised by the prisoner.see wyatt,at.owens should not be penalized for incorrectly filing an inmate grievance regarding his classification because it appears that owens only resorted to filing an inmate grievance after he received no response regarding his pursuit of a remedy through the classification appeals process.indeed,owens decision not to pursue his inmate grievance any further was in compliance with tdoc policy that the subject of his inmate grievance was not grievable and that the appropriate remedy for his complaint was the classification appeals process.
classification appeals process 
the classification appeals process set forth in the tdoc policy series is the proper mechanism by which to appeal c lassification matters such as institutional placement,except when a policy violation is alleged.app vi g.the classification appeals process was the correct avenue for owens to pursue his complaint regarding his transfer,a matter of institutional placement,that did not allege any policy violation 
the classification appeals process begins with written notice to an inmate who is being reclassified of a scheduled hearing before the classification panel.app vi a.the classification panel then holds a hearing,and the p anel members shall sign the classification summary form after the majority recommendations are concisely summarized and justified on the document.app vi d.the warden can designate the classification panel chairperson to serve as the final authority for the classification action except when a custody override is recommended or the chairperson is the dissenting member.app vi e.a classification action can be appealed within days of the final action using a classification appeal,to which a copy of the classification documents must be attached.app vi g.when the chairperson is the final authority the inmate may appeal to the warden,who shall either uphold or veto the panel recommendations in such cases,the warden decision is final and the appeal process is exhausted.app vi g.when the warden is the final approving authority,the inmate may appeal to the director of classification programs,who shall either uphold or veto the panel recommendations in such cases,the decision of the director is final and the appeal process is exhausted.app vi g.
therefore,under app vi g,after the panel hearing and the receipt of the classification action summary,submitting a classification appeal is the only procedure required for a prisoner to exhaust the classification appeals process.there is no written notice of the classification panel hearing nor any classification summary form regarding owens classification in the joint appendix or in the documents appended to the parties briefs on appeal,and thus it is uncertain whether owens was provided with this documentation.in any event,owens filed a classification appeal within the day limit.at classification appeal.although owens did not complete a form for his classification appeal,he copied the format of the with near perfect precision,and his classification appeal follows the in all material respects.therefore,the fact that his appeal was not made on the preprinted form has no impact on the exhaustion determination 
despite owens contention that his classification appeal was directed at both the warden and the director of classification programs,appellant br.at,by marking a pound sign in the box to the left of warden and making no mark next to director of classification programs,by writing that he was appealing the arbitrary decision made by this committee to the warden of mtcx and mtcc,by repeatedly addressing the warden in his appeal letter,and by stating in his complaint that he addressed his appeal to the warden,owens has indicated that he was addressing his classification appeal only to the warden.at classification appeal emphasis added,at compl.to whom the classification appeal is addressed matters because the classification appeal must be addressed to the person one step above the person who had final authority over the disputed classification action.see app vi g stating that the inmate appeals to the warden if the committee chairperson is the final authority but to the director of classification programs if the warden is the final authority.the evidence provided to this panel does not clearly indicate who the final authority was in owens case.it would be fair to assume,however,that szostecki,the committee chairperson,was the final authority because owens case was not one that required the warden to serve as the final authority,see app vi e,and it appears from owens complaint that szostecki issued the recommendation without the warden involvement.at compl.though the warden of mtcx never responded to owens classification appeal,at compl,owens did everything he could to exhaust this remedy.
owens met his burden of showing that he administratively exhausted the classification appeals process.in his complaint,owens asserted that he met with the classification panel and that he filed a classification appeal to the warden of the institution,at,compl,and he alerted the court that his complaint was not properly answered by prison officials.at form compl.at,compl.in addition,owens states,see appellant br.at,and defendants do not dispute,see appellees br.at,that he submitted,among other documents,the following documents to the district court owens inmate grievance,dated september,at howard response that owens grievance was,dated september,at owens classification appeal,dated september,at and goodgine letter to owens,dated august,at.although the correct procedure to be followed for owens complaint might not have been evident to the district court because the tdoc policies were not submitted to the district court,it is now clear that owens did exhaust the available administrative remedy the classification appeals process.the complaint and the documents that accompanied it were sufficient for owens to meet his burden of proving exhaustion.owens submitted documentation that the prison determined his inmate grievance to be and that he filed a classification appeal,the proper action to exhaust the classification appeals process.owens also submitted a letter from goodgine stating that he considered owens request for a transfer a finalized issue.at goodgine mem.to owens.the district court erred by failing to consider owens pursuit of the classification appeals process and the pleading and documentation that evidenced this pursuit,and thus erroneously concluded that owens failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
finally,even if owens did not formally exhaust the classification appeals process,we deem him to have exhausted this remedy because he never received a response to his classification appeal from the warden,the official responsible for reviewing and either upholding or reversing the classification panel decision under app vi g.see boyd corr.of,cir holding that administrative remedies are exhausted when prison officials fail to timely respond to a properly filed grievance.any response owens did receive from prison officials regarding his transfer was not timely,as the first response specifically addressing his transfer was not until march,at maloney letter to owens,and thus was insufficient.see boyd,at.
we need not address owens argument that the dismissal of his claim under these circumstances violated his right to due process because the reinstatement of his complaint will prevent any process being denied to him.we also decline to address the defendants arguments regarding the sufficiency of owens complaint.this matter is not properly before us as the defendants never filed a motion to dismiss and thus the district court did not consider this issue.after the reinstatement of owens complaint,the sufficiency of the complaint can be addressed in the district court should the defendants choose to raise this issue.
iii.filing fees 
second filing fee for refiling complaint after dismissal for failure to exhaust 
owens claims that he should not have to pay a second filing fee for refiling his complaint after it was initially dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust we agree.in interpreting the plra exhaustion requirement,we have held that prisoners filing cases involving prison conditions must allege and show that they have exhausted all available state administrative remedies.brown,at.we have instructed d istrict courts to enforce the exhaustion requirement sua sponte if not raised by the defendant by dismissing the complaint without prejudice when this standard is not met.id.the heightened pleading standards allow federal courts to determine whether the exhaustion requirement has been met without having to rely on evidentiary hearings and responsive pleadings.baxter rose,cir quoting knuckles el,at.we have further held that prisoners can not amend their complaints to cure the failure to satisfy the exhaustion pleading requirement in the initial complaint.id.the bar on amendment serves the purpose of the heightened pleading requirement,permitting courts to assess the fundamental viability of the claim on the basis of the initial complaint.the possibility of amendment undermines the screening process,preventing courts from efficiently evaluating whether the plaintiff met the exhaustion requirement.id.
title a provides that t he clerk of each district court shall require the parties instituting any civil action,suit or proceeding in such court,whether by original process,removal or otherwise,to pay a filing fee of id.emphasis added.a prisoner who refile s a complaint alleging the same claims regarding prison conditions after it was initially dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust is not instituting a suit,but is merely following the particular procedure chosen by this court for curing the initial complaint deficiency.see baxter,at requiring courts to assess the fundamental viability of the claim on the basis of the initial complaint and efficiently evaluat e whether the plaintiff met the exhaustion requirement.therefore,we hold that when a prisoner refiles a complaint raising the same claims as a complaint that was initially dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust under the plra,the prisoner need not pay an additional filing fee under a.thus,we direct the district court to reimburse owens the he paid when he refiled his complaint in satisfaction of the baxter requirements 
b.in forma pauperis status on appeal 
owens also appeals the district court order denying his application to file his appeal in forma pauperis ifp.the district court denied the application on the ground that owens appeal would not be taken in good faith.federal rule of appellate procedure a governs the procedure for consideration of a request to proceed ifp on appeal after the district court has denied such an application.it provides that 
a party may file a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis in the court of appeals within days after service of the notice prescribed in rule a.the motion must include a copy of the affidavit filed in the district court and the district court statement of reasons for its action.if no affidavit was filed in the district court,the party must include the affidavit prescribed by rule a.
fed.app.a.the advisory committee note to rule elucidates that rule a 
establishes a subsequent motion in the court of appeals,rather than an appeal from the order of denial or from the certification of lack of good faith,as the proper procedure for calling in question the correctness of the action of the district court.the simple and expeditious motion procedure seems clearly preferable to an appeal.
fed.app.a advisory committee note.the rule,as applied to prisoners in owens circumstances,has been explained as follows 
if the district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith,the appellant may still move in the court of appeals for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.in the case of a prisoner,certification that the appeal is not in good faith allows two choices.the prisoner either may pay the full filing fee and any relevant costs and proceed on appeal for plenary review or contest the certification decision by filing a motion for leave to proceed as a pauper with the court of appeals.
wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.
in mcgore wrigglesworth,cir,we stated that a challenge to a district court denial of pauper status does not exist for a prisoner.that was at a time,however,when floyd united states postal service,cir,was still the law of the circuit.floyd,a case,considered the conflict between the then recently enacted a,which provides that a n appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that the appeal is not taken in good faith,and the version of rule a then in effect which provided for the filing of a motion in the court of appeals for consideration of a request to proceed ifp on appeal after the denial of such a request by the district court.id.at.floyd held that because a statute passed after the effective date of a federal rule repeals the rule to the extent of the actual conflict,a controlled,and thus a district court denial of a motion to proceed ifp on appeal on the ground that the appeal would not be taken in good faith was final.id.at.after rule a was amended on december,to its current version,we again considered the conflict between rule and a.see
