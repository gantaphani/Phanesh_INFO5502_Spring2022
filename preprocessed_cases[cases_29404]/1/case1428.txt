this appeal arises out of a complaint petitioner beverly calhoun filed with the occupational safety and health administration osha claiming that united parcel service ups took adverse employment actions against him as a result of conduct protected by the surface transportation assistance act staa,west.an administrative law judge alj with the department of labor dol recommended a finding that ups had disciplined calhoun for engaging in activity,but,in its final order,the dol administrative review board arb found that calhoun had not met his burden of showing that ups violated the staa.calhoun petitioned this court for review,and,for the following reasons,we affirm the arb denial of calhoun complaint.
time is of the essence to ups business,which guarantees package delivery by a certain date and,often,time.a problem at one facility,even with one driver,can create a ripple effect of delays that can seriously interfere with ups delivery commitments.accordingly,ups gives its drivers a time allowance in which to inspect their vehicles allowance in order to minimize delays.ups does not discipline drivers for being over their allowance over allowed unless the time the driver is spending on inspections is significantly greater than that of other drivers.
despite the time pressures incumbent on its business,ups still has a very positive reputation for safety in the industry.an expert testifying for ups at the alj former director of the bureau of motor carrier safety at the department of transportation dot described ups as one of the leaders in safety innovation and safety investment in terms of their motor carrier operations.all ups feeder drivers attend a feeder school that includes hours of classroom training and hours of training.ups conducts an ojs ride with every feeder driver at least once a year.and ups prescribes inspection methods for its drivers that have been found to meet and exceed the requirements of the federal motor carrier safety regulations fmcsrs.in june,dot conducted an inspection of the ups facility in greensboro,north carolina,where calhoun works at the conclusion of the inspection,dot inspectors found that a ll of the drivers observed checked each of the necessary components thoroughly and advised that they were satisfied that the vehicles were in good working condition.
calhoun worked for ups as a feeder driver for over thirty years,finally retiring in december.as a feeder driver,calhoun drove double trailers from a ups hub in greensboro to carnesville,georgia,and back four days a week.in,ups recognized him with an award for his driving record of years without an avoidable accident.
calhoun filed the osha complaint at issue in this case on december.in it,he claimed that on several days between june and october,ups took adverse action against him as a result of activity protected under the staa specifically,calhoun alleged that he was warned,suspended,and discharged for engaging in daily vehicle inspections that exceeded the ups inspection guidelines but that he felt were necessary to comply with fmcsrs that require a driver to be satisfied with the safe operating condition of a vehicle prior to driving.at the administrative hearing before the alj,several of calhoun fellow drivers testified that they also engaged in inspection measures that exceeded those prescribed by ups.
ups allowance for a feeder driver operating a double trailer like calhoun is minutes if the trailer set comes and minutes if the driver has to assemble the unit himself.in,on average,ups drivers ran about minutes over the allowance.other drivers on calhoun particular route were an average of minutes.calhoun,on average,was minutes.between january and june,calhoun inspection delays caused him to return more than minutes late for the twilight sort on percent of the days he worked.
over the years,ups informed calhoun on numerous occasions that he needed to reduce his times.nonetheless,as of january,calhoun was the most driver at the greensboro facility,and his times only worsened between and.calhoun inspection delays have both caused multiple service failures and forced ups to take costly measures to prevent service failures.from january,calhoun was the most frequent cause of service failures at the greensboro facility.
calhoun appeal requires us to determine whether on ten days between june and june calhoun was subject to adverse employment action as a result of engaging in activity.the events of those days are as follows 
june,don allen,calhoun supervisor,did an ojs ride with calhoun.allen observed calhoun wipe down the dash,steering wheel,gear shifter and buttons,and touch lug nuts,belts,hoses,and steering components.calhoun then performed an unapproved brake test.allen asked him to stop because such measures exceeded ups prescribed inspection methods and were causing delays,but calhoun told allen his instructions were bullshit and continued using his own inspection methods.
during his inspection,calhoun found the dolly latch that controlled the trailer coupling device was not working properly.allen initially instructed him to hook up the dolly anyway,but calhoun took the trailer to the shop,where a mechanic found the dolly brake drum was defective.calhoun was given a replacement.after the ojs ride was completed,allen prepared a report noting that calhoun engaged in an inspection of his vehicle with no sense of urgency.
june,allen again observed calhoun inspection on june.allen advised calhoun that ups methods prescribe that air lines be checked by walking around the truck and listening and looking for leaks.calhoun ignored allen instructions not to touch the air lines,and in doing so,he found two air lines that needed to be replaced because they had air bubbles in them.
june,both allen and shop steward randall williams accompanied calhoun on his inspection on this day.after calhoun grabbed and twisted the steering rod,pulled on the drag link,and touched some lug nuts,allen asked him to come back to the ups office.there,allen informed calhoun that because he continued to disregard instructions he was being given another warning letter.calhoun responded that he needed to touch the equipment for safety and he resumed his inspection by touching some more lug nuts and wiping off the steering wheel and gearshift lever.allen then gave calhoun a suspension without pay.calhoun did not drive that day 
june,allen again accompanied calhoun on his inspection,during which calhoun found an air leak in the brake system.however,after calhoun began separating a trailer set,allen stopped him,and calhoun became belligerent,stating that he wanted to check the equipment his way.as a result,calhoun was taken out of service the next day.calhoun apparently still drove his vehicle on june,although he indicated that he was working under protest.
july,allen once again accompanied calhoun on his inspection.calhoun turned off the air to the rear trailer in order to inspect for leaks.allen later prepared a audit in which he indicated that calhoun had engaged in an exaggerated inspection and had unnecessarily turned off the air to the rear trailer instead of simply listening for a leak 
july,allen and union steward thomas hope accompanied calhoun on his inspection.calhoun reported a problem with the air pressure in his brake system fluctuating significantly.after the issue was fixed,allen hurried him through the rest of his inspection,pressuring him to get on the road despite the fact that calhoun was not satisfied with the state of his equipment.
july,allen again accompanied calhoun on his inspection and found him again to be engaged in an inspection,including draining the air off the dolly,manually inspecting brake hoses,and looking under the cab door area and looking under the rear of the truck.afterwards,allen asked calhoun to join him in a meeting with another supervisor,mark hamilton.at that meeting,calhoun was given a suspension for not scanning equipment properly.allen indicated that calhoun should inspect equipment with a quick,visual glance and that he needed to keep moving as he did his inspection.in a audit prepared that day,allen indicated that calhoun was purposely overextending his inspections and ha d not improved his sense of urgency about departing on schedule.
september,allen and feeder manager harry wolfe met with calhoun at the beginning of the day.at the meeting,calhoun was asked to make a commitment to improving his time and following instructions,but he refused.allen then accompanied calhoun on his inspection,where calhoun continued to manually inspect equipment and looked under the tractor cab multiple times.at one point in the inspection,calhoun dropped to one knee and looked under the dolly to inspect the springs and brakes.in doing so,calhoun saw a dolly brake was out of adjustment and told allen that he wanted to take it to the ups shop.allen responded that the brake test felt okay and that calhoun needed to move on and go.calhoun left but when he got to carnesville,ga,he felt that the brakes were not working properly,and a mechanic found that the brake parts were severely rusted.at a meeting the next day with allen,union steward williams,and feeder manager wolfe,calhoun was discharged for insubordination.in a discharge letter dated september,ups cited calhoun september conduct and calhoun other failures to follow instructions on june and july as reasons for the discharge 
october,before doing his inspection,calhoun was given a trailer set to hook up.during his inspection,he proceeded to uncouple the set in order to inspect the coupling device and brakes.allen approached and told calhoun that he was not to separate and inspect doubles and that he would be terminated again if he continued to do it.on october,calhoun received a discharge letter as a result of a warning letter on july,a july suspension,a july suspension,the september notice of termination,and the october failure to follow supervisor instructions.
may,supervisors again observed calhoun uncoupling a trailer set.calhoun was discharged once more on may.
in a recommended decision and order,issued on june,the alj found that calhoun had established a prima facie case of discriminatory action by ups on june,june,june,july,and september.the alj further found that ups had failed to establish that calhoun was disciplined for legitimate,reasons.it therefore found him entitled to back pay and compensatory damages for emotional distress.the arb,however,declined to follow the alj recommendation in its final decision and order issued on september.the arb found that on each of the given days on which calhoun claimed ups acted adversely against him,he either could not make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the staa or could not show that the nondiscriminatory reason proffered by ups for the adverse action was pretextual.calhoun now petitions this court for review of the arb final decision and order,and ups has been granted leave to intervene.

the staa was passed to promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles,to minimize dangers to the health of operators of commercial motor vehicles,and to ensure increased compliance with traffic laws and with commercial motor vehicle safety and health regulations and standards.a.to achieve this purpose,the staa protects employees of commercial vehicle operators as follows 
a person may not discharge an employee,or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay,terms,or privileges of employment,because 
a i the employee has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation,standard,or order,or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding complaint clause or 
b the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because refusal to drive clause 
i the operation violates a regulation,standard,or order of the united states related to commercial motor vehicle safety,health,or security actual violation prong or 
ii the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle hazardous safety or security condition reasonable apprehension prong 
a see also brock roadway express,d.
to prevail on a claim under a,calhoun must establish a prima facie case that he engaged in protected activity,his employer took adverse employment action against him,and there is a causal relationship between his protected activity and the adverse employment action.yellow freight,reich yellow freight ii,cir.the burden then shifts to his employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.id.if the employer successfully rebuts the complainant prima facie case,the complainant bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons were a pretext for discrimination.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
calhoun argues that he can satisfy the protected activity element of his prima facie case under both the refusal to drive clause and the complaint clause of a.ups disputes that he can make out a prima facie case under either clause.
calhoun first challenges the arb conclusion that his conduct on june,june,june,july,and september,does not constitute protected activity under the refusal to drive clause.in order to make out a prima facie case under this subsection of,calhoun needs to show that he refused to operate his vehicle because either a operating the vehicle would constitute an actual violation of the fmcsrs,or b he had a reasonable apprehension that operating the vehicle would result in harm to the public or to himself.a b.calhoun does not argue that he can satisfy the reasonable apprehension subclause,so we do not discuss its applicability here.
looking at the first requirement of the refusal to drive clause a refusal to alj found that calhoun refusal to drive until he completed his inspections satisfies the requirement that he refuse to drive.the arb,however,found that the alj erred in his interpretation of the law because calhoun can not seek protection under the refusal to drive clause on the days he drove his vehicle.
the plain language of a b makes clear that to qualify for protection under the refusal to drive clause,an employee must have refuse d to operate a vehicle.thus,there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the arb conclusion that calhoun did not refuse to drive for purposes of a b on june,when he drove his vehicle but indicated that he was working under protest.we similarly find no fault with the arb finding that calhoun did not refuse to drive on september,when he drove his route despite his concerns about the dolly brake.the question of whether calhoun conduct on june,june,and july meets the refusal to drive requirement of a b is a closer one.on june,calhoun did not operate his vehicle at all,either because he was serving a suspension or because he took himself out of service.on june and july,calhoun did not operate his vehicle until he had completed his vehicle inspection to his satisfaction.yet,we need not decide whether this conduct is sufficient to constitute a refusal to drive,because we are satisfied that calhoun still can not make out a prima facie case under the refusal to drive clause for these days.
with respect to june and july,we affirm the arb conclusion that calhoun did not engage in protected activity under the refusal to drive clause because we find that calhoun can not satisfy the second prong of that clause he has not shown that operating the vehicle would have resulted in an actual violation of an fmcsr.
