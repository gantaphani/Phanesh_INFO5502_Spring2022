the state of rhode island seeks interlocutory review of a decision by the environmental appeals board the eab denying its motion to intervene in a permit proceeding.the case presents a threshold question about the availability of judicial review with respect to such interlocutory administrative determinations.we hold,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,that the collateral order doctrine applies to agency determinations.here,however,the order appealed from does not fit within the parameters of that doctrine the eab proceedings are ongoing,and rhode island challenge to the intervention decision can and should be adjudicated at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings.consequently,we dismiss the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.
i.the statutory framework 
the principal purpose of the clean water act the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a see also adams epa,cir.one of the ways in which the cwa seeks to achieve this purpose is by authorizing a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes.under this regime,persons contemplating the discharge of pollutants into united states waters must obtain npdes permits before doing so.see a,see also aqueduct sewer auth.epa,cir.such permits govern,inter alia,the quantity and concentration of discharged pollutants as well as the rate of discharge.see arkansas oklahoma,d citing pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions.
npdes permits may be issued either by the environmental protection agency the epa or,in those states authorized to administer their own npdes programs,by a state agency subject,however,to epa review.since massachusetts is not a specially authorized state,we focus here on the epa permitting procedures.
once the epa receives a permit application,its regional administrator typically prepares a draft permit,invites comment,and initiates a public hearing.at the end of this process,the regional administrator hands down a decision denying or granting the permit.id.a granted permit ordinarily will carry conditions,which may be of varying scope and severity.a.any person who has participated during the comment period may,within thirty days,petition the eab for review of the epa decision including review of the permit conditions.a.that review is discretionary.id.should the eab deny review,the permit becomes administratively final.id.c.
if,however,the eab elects to afford review,it gives public notice to that effect.id.it then sets a briefing schedule and invites interested persons to participate as amici,friends of the board.id.only after an eab determination on the merits is the regional administrator authorized to issue a final permit.id.f.any interested person can then petition for judicial review of the eab actions or any aspect thereof in the appropriate circuit court of appeals.b f.
ii.factual and procedural background 
this case involves the brayton point power plant,operated by usgen new england,usgen in somerset,massachusetts.the plant sits on the shores of mount hope bay,a body of water lying partly within rhode island borders.heat is a pollutant for cwa purposes,id,and the plant cooling system discharges water into the bay at elevated temperatures.according to the epa,discharges of heated water from the plant have detrimentally affected the bay fish population.
the npdes permit for brayton point expired in.usgen applied for a renewed permit and,throughout the pendency of the permitting procedures,the epa undertook to address concerns about the plant discharge protocol.a draft permit was issued in.rhode island played an active role during the comment period.on october,the epa regional administrator for region i handed down a proposed final npdes permit for brayton point discharge system.the permit contained a series of new,more stringent conditions.usgen filed a petition for administrative review and requested an evidentiary hearing.rhode island moved for leave to intervene in order to support the proposed permit or,alternatively,for permission to participate as an amicus.
the eab responded by issuing a order.in re usgen new.brayton point station,npdes appeal,slip op,available at.the order granted usgen petition for review,reserved decision on whether to hold an evidentiary hearing,denied rhode island motion to intervene without prejudice with the proviso that the motion could be renewed in the event that the eab subsequently decided to convene an evidentiary hearing,granted rhode island amicus status,and set a briefing schedule.
rhode island took an immediate appeal from the conditional denial of its motion to intervene.we expedited review and heard oral arguments on june.we now conclude that we lack jurisdiction over rhode island interlocutory appeal.
iii.appellate jurisdiction 
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.am.fiber finishing,tyco healthcare group,cir.thus,they can hear cases only if and to the extent that they are authorized to do so by statute.bell new jersey,d.with this in mind,we inspect the hooks on which rhode island tries to hang our jurisdiction.
section b f.
rhode island first response is to identify b f as the basis for appellate jurisdiction in this case.this is a very frail hook.the statute provides 
review of the administrator action in issuing or denying any permit under section of this title may be had by any interested person in the appropriate circuit court of appeals of the united states upon application by such person.any such application shall be made within days from the date of such issuance or denial 
b f.by its plain terms,this provision conditions the availability of judicial review on the issuance or denial of a permit.in addition,the case law has construed the provision in that manner.see,appalachian energy group epa,cir city of ames reilly,cir.
given the statutory and regulatory scheme,this construction defeats rhode island first jurisdictional claim.where a petition for administrative review has been timely filed,the regional administrator issues or withholds a permit only at the conclusion of the eab review process.f.this means that where eab proceedings are they are has not as yet been an issuance or denial of a permit sufficient to support the invocation of circuit court jurisdiction under section b f.
this reading of section b f comports with the strong presumption that judicial review of an agency decision will be available only when agency action becomes final.bell,at.agency action is considered final when it represents the culmination of the agency decisionmaking process and conclusively determines the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the matters at issue.bennett spear,d.here,that point will not be reached until the completion of proceedings before the eab.only then will a final npdes permit issue,concluding the epa decisionmaking process and imposing obligations.see f stating that,for purposes of judicial review,final agency action occurs when a final npdes permit decision is issued by epa and agency review procedures under this section are exhausted.
b.the collateral order doctrine.
rhode island has a fallback position.despite the absence of final agency action in the traditional sense,rhode island suggests that the eab order denying intervention is amenable to immediate review under the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.describing a small class of orders that do not end the proceedings below but should,for systemic reasons,be treated as final and immediately appealable.this suggestion warrants serious consideration.
we begin by stepping backward in time.the collateral order doctrine was developed as a safety valve to provide a modicum of relief from overly strict application of the requirement that appellate courts review only final decisions of district courts.see the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states see also digital equip.desktop direct,d the collateral order doctrine is best understood not as an exception to the final decision rule laid down by congress in,but as a practical construction of it.excess punctuation omitted.there remains some question whether the doctrine applies at all in the administrative context,that is,whether an aggrieved party can invoke the doctrine to obtain immediate appellate review of a collateral order that impacts,but does not end,an administrative proceeding.see augusta bakery nlrb,cir reserving the question see also dep t of envtl.mgmt.united states,cir speculating that interlocutory review might be available for some administrative orders based on an analogy to the collateral order doctrine.today,we answer that question affirmatively and hold that the collateral order doctrine does have vitality with respect to judicial review of agency determinations.we ground this holding on three lines of reasoning.
first and foremost,the supreme court has strongly signaled,in a trilogy of cases,that cohen rationale carries over to administrative determinations.in mathews eldridge,d,the court concluded that an agency order constituted a final decision by the secretary for purposes of judicial review.id.at.pertinently,justice powell wrote 
t he nature of the claim being asserted and the consequences of deferment of judicial review are important factors in determining whether a statutory requirement of finality has been satisfied.the role these factors may play is illustrated by the intensely practical approach which the court has adopted,cohen beneficial.loan,when applying the finality requirements of to be sure,certain of the policy considerations implicated in cases are different from those that are relevant here.but the core principle that statutorily created finality requirements should,if possible,be construed so as not to cause crucial collateral claims to be lost and potentially irreparable injuries to be suffered remains applicable.
id.at.citations omitted.
in a subsequent case,the supreme court,albeit with only meager discussion,actually applied the collateral order doctrine to determine the reviewability of an agency order.see ftc standard oil,d concluding that the order in question was not immediately reviewable.the court reinforced the thought that the collateral order doctrine was administratively available in bell,at,in which it intimated that the presence of an appealable collateral order might allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over an otherwise agency determination.we agree with judge ginsburg,see drg funding sec y of hud,ginsburg,concurring,that the signposts erected by the court are reasonably clear.given those signposts,we are loath to strike off in a different direction.
second,we see no overriding policy reason to apply a wholly different rule of finality to review of agency determinations.both in litigation and in administrative proceedings,insisting upon a final decision before appellate intervention promotes efficiency by avoiding disruption,delay,duplication,and needless expense.such a rule also allows the tribunal of first instance,be it a court or an agency,an opportunity to shepherd a case to an orderly and expeditious conclusion without the interruptions that accompany piecemeal review.compare,koller,d describing value of finality rule,with standard oil,at.describing value of final agency action requirement.the collateral order doctrine does not frustrate this requirement,but,rather,embodies a practical,common sense realization that,in a few instances,the costs of finality may outweigh its benefits.see johnson jones,d.that is as true in the administrative context as in a purely judicial setting.
there may,of course,be an argument that finality has added value in the administrative context.mckart united states,d noting that postponing judicial review of agency action until exhaustion of administrative review is an expression of executive and administrative autonomy quoting louis jaffe,judicial control of administrative action.on the whole,however,the idea that preserving crucial collateral claims and avoiding potentially irreparable harm occasionally justifies construing statutorily created finality requirements with a modicum of flexibility seems to apply with equal or,at least,nearly equal force to the review of both judicial and administrative orders.see meredith fed.mine safety health comm n,cmty.broad.of boston,fcc,per curiam.
third,and finally,every circuit to have considered the question to date has determined often with little or no analysis that the collateral order doctrine applies to judicial review of administrative determinations.see osage tribal council dep t of labor,cir meredith,at carolina power light dep t of labor,cir jim walter,fed.mine safety health comm n,cir per curiam donovan oshrc,cir donovan oil,atomic workers int l union,cir marshall oshrc,cir.we are not disposed to divide the circuits in the absence of any compelling justification for creating a split.see,alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir,slip op.at.there is none here.
these three reasons converge to make a solid case for the deployment of the collateral order doctrine in judicial review of administrative determinations.accordingly,we hold that the doctrine is generally applicable in that context.
c.the denial of intervention.
against this backdrop,we turn to the question of whether the eab order denying rhode island motion to intervene qualifies as an immediately appealable order under the collateral order doctrine.to reach that safe harbor,the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d accord in re recticel foam,cir.the order must meet all three of these requirements in order to qualify for interlocutory review.
in this instance,the question of intervention plainly satisfies the second prong of the test the issue is separable from the merits of the underlying proceeding.williams katz,cir holding that the question of a putative intervenor status was entirely separate from the underlying tort action.the first and third prongs,however,comprise greater obstacles to rhode island aspirations.
under the first prong of the collateral order test,an order must conclusively determine the disputed question.coopers lybrand,at.tentative orders,subject to change before the end of the proceedings,fall short of this benchmark.id.at.this presents a potential problem here because the eab denied rhode island motion to intervene without prejudice and indicated that it would allow the state to renew its motion if an evidentiary hearing eventuated.
there is some authority suggesting that denials of intervention without prejudice fail to satisfy cohen conclusiveness requirement.see,united states city of milwaukee,cir dismissing appeal when district court had denied a motion to intervene on technical grounds but at the same time had invited the appellant to refile.still,we easily can envision circumstances in which a denial of intervention that is nominally without prejudice nonetheless may be sufficiently conclusive to warrant immediate review.see,conservation law found.of new,mosbacher,cir.in this context,therefore,we are reluctant to accord talismanic significance to a trier use of the term without prejudice.accord city of milwaukee,at.because the third prong of the collateral order test offers a more basis for resolving the issue,we leave the questions surrounding the conclusiveness prong for another day.
this brings us to the third prong of the test unreviewability.an order flatly denying a motion to intervene in a judicial proceeding is an immediately appealable collateral order.see james moore,moore federal practice,at to ed see,pub.serv.patch,cir reviewing an order denying intervention claimed as of right under rule a.the central rationale for permitting immediate review is that once intervention has been denied,the putative intervenor can not appeal from any subsequent order or judgment in the proceeding.of trainmen balt.ohio.thus,in the absence of immediate appellate review,a denial of intervention becomes,in cohen terms,effectively unreviewable.
a denial of intervention in an eab proceeding carries critically different consequ
