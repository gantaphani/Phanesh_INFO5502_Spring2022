plaintiffs are a class of medicaid beneficiaries who suffer from severe developmental disabilities.in july,they sued the secretary of the north carolina department of health and human services the secretary or the ncdhhs piedmont behavioral healthcare pbh,a local subdivision of the state that manages the delivery of plaintiffs medicaid services pursuant to a contract with the ncdhhs and pamela shipman,the director of pbh.plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated their rights under the medicaid statute and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by reducing their health care services without notice and an opportunity for a hearing.the district court awarded a preliminary injunction in plaintiffs favor,ordering defendants to reinstate plaintiffs services to their prior levels and enjoining defendants from reducing those services without a hearing.
in this appeal,pbh and shipman challenge the district court entry of the preliminary injunction.critically,however,the other defendant in this case the secretary of the ncdhhs did not join in the appeal.under the medicaid statute and basic principles of justiciability,the secretary decision dictates the disposition of this case.that is because a provision in the statute,a,requires each state to designate a single state agency to administer its medicaid plan here,the ncdhhs and a regulation prohibits pbh from chang ing or disapprov ing any administrative decision of that agency,e.yet pbh seeks to do exactly that through its appeal to reduce plaintiffs services immediately,notwithstanding the ncdhhs decision to comply with the injunction.moreover,the secretary choice means that any judgment we could enter in pbh favor would not provide pbh the redress it seeks because the ncdhhs would remain bound by the preliminary injunction,so too would pbh as its agent.we therefore dismiss this appeal.
the case involves the delivery of medicaid services to a class of north carolina medicaid recipients who suffer from chronic disabilities such as cerebral palsy,seizure disorders,mental retardation,and autism.while plaintiffs conditions are serious enough to qualify them for institutional placement,they are able to live in community environments with the assistance of certain support services.for example,named plaintiff is a teenage medicaid recipient with severe autism.although he is verbally and requires supervision at all times,is able to live at home with the help of professionals who teach him basic skills such as eating,dressing,and personal hygiene,and who provide temporary care for him when his parents are unavailable.
plaintiffs receive these services through a type of medicaid program known as managed care medicaid.in contrast to traditional medicaid,where beneficiaries seek services directly from providers who are then reimbursed by the state,managed care medicaid is a model in which the state contracts with a managed care organization mco,which oversees the delivery of services to beneficiaries in exchange for a fixed,prospective payment from the state for each enrollee.see medicaid program medicaid managed care new provisions,june.
in this case,pbh is the mco that manages the delivery of plaintiffs medicaid services,and shipman is pbh director more specifically,pbh is party to a contract with the ncdhhs under which pbh provides managed care to roughly disabled individuals,including plaintiffs,as part of a program known as the north carolina innovations waiver.the contract requires pbh to provide these enrollees with a list of certain covered health care services.pbh does so through a system in which it requires for services like the and temporary care provided to plaintiff to obtain authorization,enrollees and their guardians meet each year with their physicians and a pbh employee to design an individual support plan identifying the services that the enrollee needs.the identified services are then submitted to pbh for approval.once an enrollee services are authorized,the contract provides that if pbh reduces or terminates those services,pbh must provide the enrollee with certain notice and appeal rights described in.
as part of its process,pbh sets annual base budget amounts for each enrollee the maximum level of funding that is available for certain services.prior to,pbh set plaintiffs base budget amounts using a benchmark system that was intended to tailor the amount of funding an enrollee could receive to his or her medical needs.in light of increasing service requests and budget shortfalls,however,pbh designed a new system,which established different funding categories for enrollees based on factors such as the enrollee needs,safety risk,age,and place of living.
pursuant to this updated system,pbh sent letters to innovations waiver enrollees in march and april of informing them of their newly assigned base budget amounts.for some enrollees in particular,the five named plaintiffs and the members of the class eventually certified by the district court the letter indicated that their previous base budget amounts would be reduced.the letter also stated that the new base budget amounts would be the maximum amount of base service funds that can be authorized in your individual support plan and that pbh would be in contact to develop their next plan.
to illustrate,parents received a letter from pbh informing them that base budget would be reduced from to in graduated steps beginning on july.the letter contained no information on how to appeal or challenge the reduced amount.as a result,even though was approved on april,to receive worth of and temporary care services,mother eventually signed a new plan under what she states were threats that pbh would terminate all of.services reducing services to comply with his new budget.under the new plan,services were reduced by seventy to one hundred hours per month from their prior levels.in order to maintain services at those prior levels and to avoid placing him in an institution,parents paid for his care directly out of their savings.
on july,four innovations waiver enrollees filed a class action against lanier cansler,the secretary of the ncdhhs pbh and shipman.a fifth enrollee,intervened as a plaintiff in december.the plaintiffs now appellees sought preliminary and permanent injunctions reinstating their services to previously authorized levels and enjoining defendants and their agents from reducing their services without complying with the notice and hearing requirements of the medicaid statute and the fourteenth amendment.
the district court ruled on plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction on march.because the medicaid regulations require an mco to provide notice and hearing rights only when it has taken action,b,the court focused its attention on defendants argument that the reduction of plaintiffs budgets did not amount to action in the first place.the court noted that action is defined in relevant part as the reduction,suspension,or termination of a previously authorized service,id.b.it then reasoned that pbh took action by reducing the plaintiffs authorized service budgets and communicat ing to them that as of july,they must reduce or terminate certain services to comply with those reduced budgets.the district court thus held that plaintiffs were entitled to the notice and appeal rights provided for by the medicaid statute and the fourteenth amendment.the court further ruled that defendants had failed to comply with those requirements and accordingly granted the motion for a preliminary injunction.
on april,defendants pbh and shipman filed a timely notice of their interlocutory appeal of the district court order.the deadline to appeal expired fourteen days later,see fed.a,with no notice filed by the remaining defendant,the secretary of the ncdhhs.
pbh contends that the narrow legal question before us is whether the budget communications that pbh sent to plaintiffs in march and april constituted agency action,as that term is defined in b.appellants br.but before reaching that question,we must first address the threshold issue of whether pbh may litigate this appeal to begin with,given that the ncdhhs has decided not to.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the medicaid statute and accompanying regulations preclude pbh from appealing in the absence of the ncdhhs.
we begin with the relevant provision of the medicaid statute and its attendant regulations.at the heart of our inquiry is congress pronouncement that each state must provide for the establishment or designation of a single state agency to administer or to supervise the administration of its medicaid program,a,a command we shall refer to as the single state agency requirement.in implementing this requirement,the department of health and human services has set forth the following regulation 
if other state or local agencies or offices perform services for the medicaid agency,they must not have the authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision of that agency,or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the medicaid agency with respect to the application of policies,rules,and regulations issued by the medicaid agency.
as implemented through this rule,the single state agency requirement reflects two important values an efficiency rationale and an accountability rationale.from an efficiency perspective,the requirement ensures that final authority to make the many complex decisions governing a state medicaid program is vested in one and only one agency.the requirement thereby avoids the disarray that would result if multiple state or even local entities were free to render conflicting determinations about the rights and obligations of beneficiaries and providers.thus,for example,where the designated state agency determines that a person is eligible for medicaid benefits,administrative efficiency counsels that the agency itself,the individual,and other affected parties should be able to rely on the decision without worrying that some other state or local entity may later change or disapprove it,in violation of e.see forsyth cnty.bd.of soc.servs.div.of soc,holding that under e,a county department of social services can not sue seeking reversal of the single state agency medicaid eligibility determination.
with respect to the accountability rationale,the vesting of responsibility over a state medicaid program in a single agency safeguards against the possibility that a state might seek to evade federal medicaid requirements by passing the buck to other agencies that take a less generous view of a particular obligation.as the second circuit has explained,the reason for the requirement that a state designate a single state agency to administer its medicaid program was to avoid a lack of accountability for the appropriate operation of the program.hillburn maher,cir rejecting single state agency argument that it did not need to comply with certain medicaid regulations because of contrary decisions by another agency.as a result,a single state agency may not diminish or alter its medicaid responsibilities based on the action or inaction of other state offices or agencies.id.
in sum,the single state agency requirement represents congress recognition that in managing medicaid,states should enjoy both an administrative benefit the ability to designate a single agency to make final decisions in the interest of efficiency but also a corresponding burden an accountability regime in which that agency can not evade federal requirements by deferring to the actions of other entities.see san lazaro ass connell,cir noting that single state agency requirement ensures systemwide efficiency and systemwide accountability.this does not mean,of course,that a single state agency may never delegate responsibilities to other entities.such agency relationships are expressly contemplated,for example in the context of mcos like pbh that manage the provision of medicaid on the state behalf.see b.but the single state agency requirement does mean that a delegation can go only so far where the agency makes a final decision,it can not be overridden by another state or local entity.
in this case,there is no dispute that north carolina law designates the ncdhhs as the agency responsible for operating the state medicaid plan.nor is there any dispute that pbh is a local political subdivision of the state.a,which has contracted with the ncdhhs to operate a managed care medicaid program on the state behalf.federal and state law thus interlock,establishing the following propositions the ncdhhs is the single state agency with the final responsibility to administer the state medicaid program under a,and as a local subdivision of the state,pbh is forbidden to change or disapprove any administrative decision made by the ncdhhs pursuant to e.
the question,then,is whether pbh appeal seeks to change or disapprove an administrative decision of the ncdhhs such that it is barred by e.pbh contends that the answer is no.it argues first that this appeal does not change or disapprove any ncdhhs decision at all because pbh and the ncdhhs still take the same position in this litigation namely that they did not violate plaintiffs notice and hearing rights.appellants reply br.but this contention misses the mark for a simple reason it focuses on the wrong decision.
the agency decision that pbh seeks to disapprove is not the ncdhhs ultimate position on the merits of the underlying case.it is the ncdhhs decision not to appeal and thereby to comply with the preliminary injunction.the ncdhhs decision to comply means that the injunction is binding not only on the ncdhhs itself,but also on the ncdhhs agents and any who are in active concert or participation with it.d.there is thus no escaping the fact that the ncdhhs has effectively decided that it and pbh which is obligated to manage plaintiffs care in accordance with its contract with the ncdhhs will provide plaintiffs with their prior level of services or else notice and a hearing until a final judgment permits otherwise.yet the entire purpose of pbh appeal is to overturn that decision pbh seeks to reduce plaintiffs services immediately,without providing notice or a hearing.we must therefore reject pbh contention that this appeal does not change or disapprove any decision by the ncdhhs.
pbh responds that even if its appeal does seek to change or disapprove some decision made by the ncdhhs,the decision in question is not an administrative decision of that agency protected under e,but rather a mere litigation decision.appellants reply br.again we disagree.
to start,we find no support for the notion that litigation decisions are somehow categorically precluded from constituting an administrative decision under the regulation.although the phrase is not expressly defined in the relevant provisions,the plain meaning of an administrative decision of a single state medicaid agency naturally encompasses decisions that pertain to the management of the state medicaid program.see random house dictionary of the english language ed defining administrative as pertaining to administration and administration as the management of any office,business or organization.no less than its decisions in other contexts,of course,an agency litigation decisions can have substantial impacts on the management of a state medicaid program.one need look no further than this case to see how the ncdhhs choice to comply with the preliminary injunction means that absent the provision of notice and appeal rights,the state must provide a class of medicaid beneficiaries their previously authorized level of services pending a final ruling from the courts.
of course,our conclusion that the secretary decision not to appeal is an administrative decision protected from interference by another agency under e does not mean every litigation decision by a single state agency qualifies as such.but we do not need to list every example of an administrative decision in order to hold that where,as here,an agency decision is tantamount to a substantial policy choice,the decision falls within the sphere of agency judgment covered by e.after all,it can hardly be disputed that if the ncdhhs had issued a policy statement declaring that all pbh enrollees would be eligible to receive their prior level of services or else a fair hearing until a contrary judicial ruling,that choice would surely constitute an administrative decision that local agencies would not be permitted to change or disapprove under e.the result should not be any different here simply because the secretary made the same decision in response to litigation rather than before it.if anything,a decision made in the instant context should be entitled to even greater respect because it comes with the backing of a court order announcing a preliminary interpretation of federal law.
our conclusion is all the more necessary when one considers the implications of pbh opposing approach.if important litigation decisions made by a single state agency were not administrative decisions protected from challenge by another agency,the resulting inefficiency and turmoil would be profound.consider,for example,a case in which a single state agency agrees to a consent decree confirming the medicaid eligibility of a group of citizens.pbh position would imperil that decision by permitting any county medicaid office or local mco to embroil the courts in a collateral lawsuit seeking a reversal of the decree.or consider the converse situation where the designated agency elects to litigate a medicaid case rather than to settle.under pbh view of e,the agency choice to pursue the lawsuit could be subject to change or disapprov al by another state or local entity that would prefer to settle the matter on whatever terms that other entity deemed satisfactory.the result of pbh interpretation would be a constant state of confusion in the litigation process in which parties and judges must not only attempt to argue or decide the merits of each case,but where they must first identify which of multiple state entities is even speaking with the state final authority.
pbh view would thus compromise both the efficiency and accountability rationales for the single state agency requirement.that requirement prevents improvident ends by arresting their beginnings.put simply,by directing states to designate a single medicaid agency the decisions of which may not be overridden by other state and local actors,the requirement prohibits precisely what pbh aims to achieve in this appeal to place itself in the driver seat and call the shots on how the state medicaid program is to be administered in the face of a clearly contrary decision by the ncdhhs.pbh appeal thus contravenes a and e,and must be dismissed.
the case for dismissal of the appeal is underscored not only by the single state agency requirement,but also by the fact that it follows from that very requirement that pbh is pushing the court to issue an advisory opinion.for the secretary decision not to appeal means that pbh would remain bound by the preliminary injunction regardless of any decision this court might issue.
a party seeking recourse must establish that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that its injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.of course,the elements of standing must be satisfied not just at the outset of a suit,but also on appeal.see bond united states,d.
in this appeal,pbh seeks relief in the form of a reversal of the district court preliminary injunction.pbh argues that such a decision would in no way be merely advisory because once the injunction is reversed,pbh injury will necessarily be redressed that is,pbh will be free to reduce plaintiffs services or as pbh argues,their budgets without first providing notice and hearing rights.appellants reply br.
pbh is mistaken.its problem lies again in the secretary choice not to appeal and to instead comply with the preliminary injunction while litigating the case through to final judgment.in that context,the question becomes whether the fact that the ncdhhs remains obligated to obey the injunction means that pbh would also be bound to comply regardless of any decision we might issue.or,put slightly differently,the question is whether pbh the ncdhhs contractual agent with respect to plaintiffs medicaid services may disregard the injunction even as pbh principal is obligated to comply with it.for several reasons,we can not countenance that result.
first,because the preliminary injunction binds the ncdhhs,so too must it bind pbh under ordinary operation of the federal rules of civil procedure.federal rule of civil procedure d dictates that every order granting an injunction is binding not only on named parties,but also on the parties agents as well as any others with whom they are in active concert or participation.as the supreme court has explained,the purpose of this rule is to prevent defendants from nullify ing a decree by carrying out prohibited acts through aiders and abettors.regal knitwear nlrb.echoing that purpose,the plaintiffs motion in this case specifically requested preliminary injunctive relief against not just the defendants,but also their agents and all persons acting in concert or participating with them.
applying rule d to this case,there is no dispute that pbh is an agent of the ncdhhs due to its contract to administer plaintiffs medicaid services on behalf of the state.nor is there any question that pbh is acting in participation with the ncdhhs to that same end.thus,pbh is restrained by the preliminary injunction through not one,but two channels first,in its capacity as a named defendant,and second,in its capacity as an agent and of the ncdhhs with respect to plaintiffs medicaid services.to be sure,a decision in this appeal in pbh favor could negate the former channel of restraint.but such a decision could in no way affect the latter channel because the ncdhhs choice not to appeal means that the injunction remains binding on it and,as a consequence of rule d,so too its agent and pbh.see.ass of health maint.orgs.grier,cir holding that under rule d,consent decree issued against single state medicaid agency was also binding on mcos due to their agency relationship with the state ex rel.rahman oncology,cir citing rule d and holding that writ of mandamus issued against medicare agency was also binding on medicare contractors.
there is another reason why we may not allow pbh to evade a preliminary injunction that continues to run against the ncdhhs the single state agency requirement.recall that this requirement embodies an important accountability rationale congress desire to prevent states from backsliding on their medicaid obligations by deferring to the nonconforming actions of other agencies.see hillburn,at.to that end,e provides that the single state agency must not delegate authority to e xercise administrative discretion in the administration of the state medicaid plan to others.another regulation,id.b,requires the agency to t ake corrective action to ensure the adherence of local agencies to the state medicaid program.the single state agency requirement thus forbids the result that pbh seeks on appeal it bars the ncdhhs from escaping its legal responsibilities,to obey the injunction by acquiescing to the actions of another agency like pbh.
in sum,pbh must show that it is likely,not just speculative,that a favorable decision will provide the redress it seeks.see lujan,at.yet the binding effect of the preliminary injunction on pbh pursuant to rule d and the single state agency requirement makes it speculative at best whether a decision in this appeal would enable pbh to engage in the conduct that the district court enjoined.
pbh asserts that any decision reversing the injunction as to it would automatically inure to the benefit of ncdhhs because it is not logical to argue that an order that is reversed or vacated based on an erroneous interpretation of law would somehow still be enforceable against a party simply because that party did not also take an interlocutory appeal.appellants reply br.if pbh were correct,there would be no redressability problem since a ruling in its favor would negate both channels through which it is restrained by the preliminary injunction the injunction would no longer bind pbh either as a named defendant or as an agent of the ncdhhs.
but pbh is again mistaken.it is basic to appellate practice that a judgment will not be alt
