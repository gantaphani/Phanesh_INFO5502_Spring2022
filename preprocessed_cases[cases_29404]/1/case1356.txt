tcr sports broadcasting holding,mid atlantic sports network appeals an order of the federal communications commission fcc.based on a review of its media bureau decision and the records below,the fcc found that time warner cable time warner provided legitimate and reasons for declining to carry mid atlantic sports network programming on an analog tier in its north carolina cable system.
on appeal,mid atlantic sports network argues that the fcc order should be vacated and remanded because time warner engaged in unlawful discrimination,thereby violating section of the telecommunications act of,as amended,and the fcc program carriage rules.because the fcc acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously in rendering its order,we conclude that the fcc acted within its discretion,and we deny the petition for review and affirm the fcc order.
congress enacted the cable television consumer protection and competition act of the cable act,stat,which amended the telecommunications act of,to address concerns about the possibly anticompetitive effects of the vertical integration of cable companies that own both video distribution facilities and programming content.see a.to that end,the cable act directed the fcc to promulgate regulations that govern program carriage agreements and related practices between cable operators or other multichannel video programming distributors and video programming vendors.u.a.
in october,the fcc established rules to prevent multichannel video programming distributors from taking undue advantage of programming vendors through various practices,including coercing vendors to grant ownership interests or exclusive distribution rights to multichannel distributors in exchange for carriage on their systems.implementation of sections of the cable tele.consumer protect.competition act of dev.of competition diversity in video programming distrib.carriage,second report and order,rcd,program car riage order see also.
in developing these regulations,the fcc recognized the congressional intent to prohibit unfair or anticompetitive actions without restraining the amount of multichannel programming available by precluding legitimate business practices common to a competitive marketplace.program carriage order,fcc rcd.at.consequently,the fcc sought to promulgate program carriage rules consistent with the cable act without unduly interfering with legitimate negotiating practices between multichannel video programming distributors and programming vendors.id.
in july,subject to several conditions,the fcc approved time warner and comcast corporation purchase of adelphia communications corporation cable systems.see applications for consent to the assignment transfer of control of licenses,adelphia commc ns,assignors to time warner cable,assignees,et ah,mem orandum opinion order,rcd.adelphia order.because the fcc found the transaction had the potential to give time warner an increased incentive to deny carriage to rival unaffiliated regional sports networks rsns with the intent of forcing the rsns out of business or discouraging potential rivals from entering the market,thereby allowing time warner to obtain the valuable programming for its affiliated rsns,the fcc adopted a condition providing with an alternative avenue for redress of alleged program carriage violations id.at.under that condition,in lieu of filing a complaint with the fcc,an rsn unaffiliated with any multichannel video programming distributor that is denied carriage by time warner may submit its carriage claim to commercial arbitration within thirty days after that denial.see id.at.
further,within thirty days after publication of the arbitration decision,a party may file a petition with the fcc to challenge the arbitrator award.id.at,appendix b.the fcc reviews the arbitrator award de novo and examine s the same evidence that was presented to the arbitrator and choose s the final offer of the party that most closely approximates the fair market value of the programming carriage rights at issue.id.
mid atlantic sports network is an unaffiliated rsn that owns the rights to produce and exhibit nearly all of the games of two major league baseball franchises the baltimore orioles and the washington nationals.since its launch,mid atlantic sports network has sought program carriage on the networks of multichannel video programming distributors throughout its television territory,which stretches from pennsylvania to north carolina.
time warner owns multiple cable systems in several states and is the largest provider of pay television service in north carolina.all of time warner customers subscribe to the basic tier,which includes broadcast stations and public access services,and approximately ninety percent of its customers further subscribe to the cable programming services tier,which includes services such as the discovery channel and a.the basic tier and cable programming services tiers are collectively referred to as the analog tier.id.as time warner has upgraded its cable systems to allow for digital transmission,it has used its digital spectrum to provide a digital basic tier,which includes a multitude of additional video program services.id.approximately half of time warner customers are digital basic subscribers.
among other programming interests,time warner is affiliated with news,a regional service established by time warner in that provides local news and weather programming.news telecasted games of the charlotte bobcats basketball team during the period of time warner negotiations with mid atlantic sports network.at the time that mid atlantic sports network requested carriage on time warner systems,time warner was also affiliated with turner south,an rsn that held the distribution rights for several professional sports teams,including the atlanta thrashers hockey team,the atlanta hawks basketball team,and the atlanta braves baseball team.
in march,mid atlantic sports network initiated negotiations with time warner for program carriage in north carolina on an analog tier.during negotiations,time warner proposed carriage of mid atlantic sports network programming on a digital sports tier or on an analog tier in time warner cable systems only in eastern north carolina.however,mid atlantic sports network wanted program carriage on the statewide analog tier.in may,negotiations broke down.
in june,mid atlantic sports network filed an arbitration demand with the american arbitration association,pursuant to the procedure established in the adelphia order.at an arbitration hearing held in may,mid atlantic sports network argued that,among other things,in violation of section a a of the cable act,time warner engaged in discrimination by denying mid atlantic sports network carriage on time warner statewide analog tier,which time warner offered to its affiliated rsns.on june,the arbitrator issued a decision and award in favor of mid atlantic sports network,after determining that mid atlantic sports network carried its burden of proof to establish that time warner treated mid atlantic sports network differently from time warner affiliated rsns.the arbitrator found that mid atlantic sports network competed with rsns in which time warner has or had ownership interests across its footprint and concluded that in denying program carriage of mid atlantic sports network,time warner discriminated against mid atlantic sports network based on affiliation.
time warner,in turn,filed a petition for review of the arbitration decision and award with the fcc,defending its decision to decline to carry mid atlantic sports network on a statewide analog tier as a legitimate business decision and urging the fcc to set aside the ruling on october,the media bureau agreed with mid atlantic sports network and affirmed the arbitration decision and award on the basis that time warner denial of carriage on an analog tier in north carolina was discriminatory in violation of the cable act,the fcc program carriage rules,and the adelphia order,and that such discrimination unreasonably restrained the ability of mid atlantic sports network to compete fairly.the media bureau ordered time warner to launch mid atlantic sports network on the analog tier of all of its north carolina systems within thirty days.
in november,time warner filed an application for review of the media bureau order before the full fcc in december,after reviewing the record de novo,the fcc reversed and vacated the media bureau order,concluding that mid atlantic sports network had failed to demonstrate that time warner has impermissibly discriminated pursuant to a and its implementing rules.the fcc found that very few cable subscribers in north carolina were interested in watching the games of professional teams from baltimore and washington.the fcc further found that time warner would incur costs of approximately million per year if it carried mid atlantic sports network.additionally,the fcc found that,unlike the carriage of the time warner affiliate news charlotte bobcats games,which did not require a separate channel or cost any additional money,the carriage of mid atlantic sports network would necessitate two new analog channels and an additional charge of sixty cents per subscriber per month.
moreover,the fcc noted that time warner did not completely refuse to carry mid atlantic sports network under any circumstances but instead offered to carry mid atlantic sports network on a digital tier.the fcc concluded that time warner had provided legitimate and reasons for rejecting mid atlantic sports network carriage proposal.mid atlantic sports network now petitions this court to vacate the fcc order and remand the case to the fcc with instructions for the fcc to issue a final decision within sixty days.
when assessing the reasonableness of the fcc decision,the administrative procedure act apa requires this court to affirm the decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.review under this standard is highly deferential,with a presumption in favor of finding the agency action valid.ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir.moreover,i n conducting our review under the apa,we perform only the limited,albeit important,task of reviewing agency action to determine whether the agency conformed with controlling statutes,and whether the agency has committed a clear error of judgment.hodges abraham,cir quoting.dep t of human res.dep t of agric,cir.
we first address mid atlantic sports network contention that the fcc erroneously credited time warner post hoc justifications for what mid atlantic sports network characterizes as time warner discriminatory refusal to carry mid atlantic sports network.specifically,mid atlantic sports network attacks the admissibility of the sworn statements of carol hevey,time warner executive vice president of operations for north carolina,and brian kelly,a time warner executive who reports to hevey,as post hoc justifications invented for the purpose of litigation we find that even if the statements the initiation of this litigation,the fcc reasonably credited the sworn statements and testimonies of hevey and kelly.
in her sworn declaration,hervey recounted that she and her staff took into account the cost of mid atlantic sports network programming.hevey projected that if time warner had agreed to pay the rights demanded by mid atlantic sports network,sixty cents per subscriber per month,cable bills would have increased for the majority of cable subscribers,and time warner would have had to pay mid atlantic sports network almost million per year for analog coverage,despite that mid atlantic sports network would not likely generate enough revenue to cover this rights fee.hevey testimony also reflected that time warner considered the opportunity costs associated with analog carriage of mid atlantic sports network,including that because time warner lacked vacant channels on its analog tiers in north carolina,carriage of mid atlantic sports network on an analog tier would require time warner to delete existing programming services.
in another sworn declaration,brian kelly confirmed that he,hevey,and other time warner employees participated in numerous discussions concerning the weak demand in north carolina for mid atlantic sports network telecasts of orioles and nationals baseball games.they concluded that there was relatively little interest in the orioles in north carolina and even less in the nationals.when kelly personally made inquiries concerning the ratings for fox sports south north carolina telecasts of orioles games in past seasons,he discovered that those ratings were low.
contrary to mid atlantic sports network argument challenging these statements as being impermissible post hoc justifications,the decisions of our sister circuits,in discrimination cases,persuasively guide us to decline to read significance solely into the timing of a defendant explanation or the absence of contemporaneous evidence.see,merrick farmers ins.group,cir rejecting argument that an employer reasons for not promoting an employee lack ed credibility because they were not documented until after the commencement of litigation adeyemi district of columbia,declin ing to find any significance in the timing of the defendant explanation or the absence of contemporaneous evidence,and rejecting plaintiff argument that the defendant had manufactured its justifications after the fact.accordingly,we find that the fcc reasonably credited hevey and kelly uncontradicted testimony.
mid atlantic sports network also asserts that time warner failed to produce a single contemporaneous document supporting even one of the reasons offered by hevey,mak ing it implausible at best that these were truly the factors motivating time warner decision.pet r br.at.time warner counters that it supplied a contemporaneous email exchange between two time warner employees,mickey carter and tom smith,buttressing time warner sworn testimony that the limited demand for mid atlantic sports network programming played a key role in time warner rejection of mid atlantic sports network proposal.nonetheless,mid atlantic sports network contends that the contemporaneous email exchange provides no credible evidence of the actual reasons why time warner cable refused to carry its programming on an analog channel.
the referenced document,a copy of an august email exchange between two time warner employees,mickey carter and tom smith,reads in pertinent part 
carter do your systems in eastern north carolina receive fox sports south if so,do you receive any baltimore orioles games on fox sports south 
smith we are in the baltimore footprint and have no baltimore fans to speak of.there is a huge atlanta fan base here,we have no way to deliver what they want 
carter your feedback has been very helpful my gut has been that your market ca have many oriole fans.
this contemporaneous documentary evidence is consistent with time warner sworn testimonial evidence that there was limited demand for orioles games in north carolina.accordingly,this exchange bolsters the unrefuted sworn statements of hevey and kelly that the limited demand for orioles games in north carolina played a key role in time warner.moreover,all such evidence underscores that the fcc conclusion that time warner business justifications provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for denying mid atlantic sports network carriage on its statewide analog tier was not unreasonable,capricious,or otherwise unlawful.
additionally,contrary to mid atlantic sports network assertion,the lack of documentation corroborating time warner defenses does not undermine the fcc order.the fcc directly addressed this issue and noted that there is nothing in cable act or its implementing rules requir ing program carriage defendants to memorialize any aspect of their decision making process.the fcc also noted it did not find any evidence in the record that cable operators typically document their internal carriage discussions.id.accordingly,the absence of contemporaneous evidence is hardly unusual,adeyemi,at,and that it does not seem unusual for a company to wait to memorialize the reasons for a challenged decision until after litigation is commenced.merrick,at.therefore,we conclude that the fcc reasonably accepted time warner sworn testimon
