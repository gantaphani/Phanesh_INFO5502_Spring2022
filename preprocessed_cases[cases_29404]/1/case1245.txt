opinion of the court 
the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat,as amended,a,provides that a prisoner confined in any jail,prison or correctional facility may not bring any action under any federal respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.the issue in this case is whether the plra exhaustion requirement applies to a grievance procedure described in an inmate handbook but not formally adopted by a state administrative agency.we hold that it does.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
plaintiffs victor concepcion and anthony ways are inmates in the custody of the new jersey department of corrections njdoc.they filed this s action against various corrections officers and officials on august,alleging that the defendants violated their civil rights through the use of excessive force during two separate incidents on august.we briefly describe each of these alleged incidents in turn.
concepcion incident 
during the morning of august,corrections officer william sellnow opened all of the cells in concepcion tier at the new jersey state prison njsp so that the inmates could proceed to morning breakfast.after opening the cells,sellnow walked down the hallway and crossed paths with concepcion.because the hall was narrow,concepcion claims that he had to turn to the side so that sellnow could pass.according to concepcion,for no apparent reason,sellnow rammed his shoulder into concepcion left shoulder as he walked by,and concepcion responded by asking,what your problem app.at.concepcion claims that the two men then started swinging at each other simultaneously.
according to concepcion,he and sellnow exchanged punches for only a couple of seconds.id.at.concepcion admits that he hit sellnow,who later received at least four stitches in the forehead.upon witnessing the fray from a nearby desk,sargeant larry cole called a code,which,according to concepcion,means there a fight.id.at.at this point,concepcion claims that approximately thirty to forty officers began running towards him.in response,concepcion ran in the opposite direction and jumped over the tier railing down to the first floor.
several officers caught and restrained concepcion on the first floor.corrections officer george phillips testified that it took four or five officers to place concepcion in handcuffs.while restraining concepcion,phillips suffered a burn from a nearby boiler pipe.after he was restrained,concepcion claims that cole kicked him in the face and that phillips stuck his nightstick in between concepcion handcuffs,lifting him off his feet and into the air.concepcion further claims that phillips rammed his head into a cement wall,and that after concepcion was taken to a detention cell,phillips hit him in the forehead with a nightstick.
as a result of the events described above,concepcion was charged with committing a prohibited act assaulting any person in violation of title of the new jersey administrative code,which subjects inmates to disciplinary action and sanctions for committing certain enumerated acts.see admin.code tit,a.after a disciplinary hearing,the hearing officer found concepcion guilty as charged and sanctioned him to days detention,a loss of commutation time,and days administrative segregation.
ways incident 
on august,the same day in which the above events took place,inmate anthony ways was involved in a separate incident.after having his lunch at the prison cafeteria,ways proceeded towards a central rotunda,upon which various wings of the prison converge.he alleges that,as he approached the rotunda,there was a commotion going on,with people running and officers swinging sticks.app.at.he also testified that he saw two officers on the ground in the center of the rotunda.
after observing this commotion,ways claims that he attempted to get back to his wing so that he could return to his cell.id.at.according to ways,while attempting to return,he was approached by corrections officer robert richter.ways testified as follows 
h e approaching me,so,out of instinct,my hands go up.he swings.as he swings,i trying to prevent his swing by pushing his shoulder away from me as he swings,he hits me in my jaw,and it did knock me out,but it was enough for me.i laid on the ground and surrender ed.
id.at.according to ways,after he laid down on the ground,richter and another officer placed his arms and legs in handcuffs.ways claims that,after he was restrained,several officers stood him up and carried him towards another wing of the prison.as he was being carried,ways alleges that he was dropped to the floor and that richter kicked him.he testified that he sustained various injuries requiring medical treatment.
in connection with the events of that day,ways was charged with assaulting richter and two other corrections officers in violation of title of the new jersey administrative code.see admin.code tit,a.after a disciplinary hearing,a hearing officer found ways guilty on all charges and sanctioned him to days detention,a loss of commutation time,days administrative segregation,and a loss of recreation privileges.on february,also in connection with what transpired on august,ways pled guilty to criminal aggravated assault in violation of stat.annn.b.the aggravated assault charge was based on the fact that ways had punched corrections officer kimberly bleinstein in the face,breaking her jaw.
plaintiffs complaint 
on august,concepcion and ways filed their complaint pursuant to,alleging that they were the victims of excessive force in violation of their constitutional rights on august.they named seven njsp corrections officers and officials as defendants.
on august,the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies pursuant to a,which mandates that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section by a prisoner until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.more specifically,the defendants argued that,before seeking redress in a federal court,the plaintiffs were required under a to follow the administrative grievance procedure set forth in the department of corrections inmate handbook handbook.the district court described that procedure as follows 
the process begins by the inmate submitting an administrative remedy form to the administrator office.upon receipt,the department head writes a response on the form this response is signed by the primary level supervisor and the department head and the response is finally reviewed and signed by the intermediate level supervisor as the administrator designee.the inmate complaint form with the administrative response is then placed in the inmate classification folder and the prisoner is given a copy.no administrative appeal is permitted.
concepcion morton,d,citations omitted.the handbook states that the grievance procedure is set up to give the inmate population a way to bring complaints,problems,suggestions,to the attention of the administration of new jersey state prison to solve or possibly put into use.app.at.
finding that the grievance procedure described in the handbook does not constitute an administrative remedy for purposes of a,the district court held that there were no available administrative remedies for the plaintiffs to exhaust and therefore denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to address available administrative remedies on december,concepcion,d at.after conducting an analysis of the language,structure,and legislative history of a,the court concluded that,in using the phrase administrative remedies,congress meant administrative schemes promulgated by an agency.id.at.because the prison warden and his staff,rather than the department of corrections,promulgated the grievance procedure in the handbook,the district court held that the remedy was not administrative in nature and thus outside the scope of a.see id.
