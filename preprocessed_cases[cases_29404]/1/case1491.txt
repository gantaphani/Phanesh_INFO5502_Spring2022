the federal trade commission ftc brought this action against the south carolina state board of dentistry board,alleging that the board engaged in unfair competition by promulgating an emergency regulation that prevented oral hygienists from performing certain services in school settings unless a dentist had first examined a student and prescribed a course of treatment.the board countered,inter alia,that it was immune from suit under the state action antitrust immunity doctrine of parker brown.after the ftc refused to grant that protection,the board brought this interlocutory appeal,arguing that the denial of parker protection falls within the narrow class of collateral orders that may be appealed notwithstanding their lack of finality.we disagree,and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
in,south carolina amended its dental practice act.the legislature,concerned that many school children in areas were receiving inadequate dental care because of the scarcity of providers,relaxed the restrictions on oral hygienists performing oral prophylaxis and applying sealants in schools.prior to the amendments,hygienists could only perform those services in schools if a dentist had personally examined the patient within the preceding days and had authorized such treatment.see ann.c west supp.after the amendments,however,hygienists could perform those services so long as they were under the general supervision of a dentist.id.west supp.general supervision,in turn,means that a licensed dentist has authorized the procedures to be performed but does not require that a dentist be present when the procedures are performed.id.west supp emphasis added.the amended statute did not define the term authorized.
in january,health promotion services hps,a private dental services firm,began sending hygienists to schools in south carolina to provide preventative dental care.hps hygienists performed oral prophylaxis and applied sealants on students that had not been by dentists.in early july of that year,the board received reports of substandard patient care by those hygienists.
on july,in order to prevent any future harm,the board enacted an emergency regulation pursuant to its rulemaking authority under ann.west.that regulation reinserted the preexamination requirement into b by defining the term authorized to mean 
the supervising dentist must have clinically examined the patient and actually determined the need for any specific treatment.before treatment may be performed by a dental hygienist,the supervising dentist must provide a written work order for the procedure s to be performed by the dental hygienist.a clinical examination must be conducted by the supervising dentist for each patient not more than fortyfive days prior to the date the dental hygienist is to perform the procedure for the patient.
reg.july.under south carolina law,this emergency regulation expired after days,in january.see ann.c west 
on september,months after the emergency regulation had expired and three months after the south carolina legislature had enacted compromise legislation supported by both the board and hygienists the ftc instituted this action against the board.under b west,such actions are adjudicated in an administrative hearing before the ftc.if the ftc issues a order,the defendant may appeal directly to this court.see id.c.
the board asserted two defenses during the ftc proceeding.first,it claimed the action was moot in light of the amendments to the dental practice act.second,it argued that it was entitled to state action antitrust immunity under parker brown,in which the supreme court held that the sherman act should not be presumed to apply to states.on july,the ftc denied the board request for parker protection but determined that it could not resolve the mootness issue without additional discovery into whether the challenged conduct was likely to recur.it therefore referred the case to an alj for limited discovery on that question the board then filed this interlocutory appeal of the ftc rejection of the state action antitrust exemption.
the central question in this case is whether the board may presently appeal the ftc determination that it is not entitled to parker protection.generally,a party may only appeal from an order that ends litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.see also west the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states the supreme court has,however,allowed interlocutory appeals in a small class of cases that finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action.cohen beneficial indus.loan.
although the collateral order doctrine has never been expansive,the court recent pronouncements on the subject stress that only a very few types of interlocutory orders can qualify as immediately appealable collateral orders,lest the doctrine overpower the substantial finality interests is meant to further.will hallock,d see also id.at w e have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope.digital equip.desktop direct,d t he narrow exception should stay that way citation omitted.

there is no dispute that the denial of parker protection satisfies the first collateral order requirement a decision that the board is not entitled to such protection conclusively determines the question of whether the board is subject to the federal trade commission act restrictions on anticompetitive conduct.the circuits are divided,however,as to whether the denial of parker protection satisfies the final two requirements.two circuits have said that it does.see martin memorial,cir commuter transp.hillsborough cty.aviation,cir.two others have suggested the same in dicta.see we,city of philadelphia,cir segni commercial office of spain,cir.the sixth circuit,however,has held that the denial of parker protection fails to meet either of the final two collateral order requirements.see huron valley,city of pontiac,cir.because we too conclude that the parker analysis is neither completely separate from the merits nor effectively unreviewable after trial,we join the sixth circuit in holding that the denial of parker protection is not an immediately appealable collateral order.
an order is only collateral to the merits of a case if it does not involve considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues compromising the plaintiff cause of action.coopers lybrand livesay,d quoting mercantile bank langdeau,d.the issues raised in an interlocutory appeal need not be identical to those to be determined on the merits to fail under this requirement only a threat of substantial duplication of judicial decision making is necessary.
thus,time and again the supreme court has refused to find an order to be collateral when entertaining an immediate appeal might require it to consider issues intertwined not identical ultimate merits inquiry.for example,in cunningham hamilton county,d,the court held a sanctions order not sufficiently collateral because an interlocutory appeal of that order may require the reviewing court to inquire into the importance of the information sought or the adequacy or truthfulness of a response.id.at.in van cauwenberghe biard,d,the court held an order refusing to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds not collateral because its immediate consideration could require a court to scrutinize the substance of the dispute between the parties to evaluate what proof is required.id.at.and in coopers lybrand,the court found an order denying class certification not collateral because immediate appellate review of that decision could require analysis of questions entangled with the merits,such as the typicality and commonality of claims.at.
the kind of interlocutory order at issue denying parker similarly not separable from the merits of the underlying action.explaining why this is so requires a brief examination of the three situations in which a party may invoke the parker doctrine.first,if that party is the state itself,the state legislature or the courts its actions ipso facto are exempt from the operation of antitrust laws.hoover ronwin,d.second,municipalities may invoke the state action doctrine if they can demonstrate that their anticompetitive activities were authorized by the state pursuant to state policy to displace competition.town of hallie city of eau claire,d internal quotation marks omitted.third,parker may shield a private party that acts pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition and whose actions are actively supervised by the state itself.cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d internal quotation marks omitted.
this framework demonstrates why parker analysis is not separable from the merits of the antitrust action.in two of the three circumstances in which parker applies,a court must look to state law and determine if the state has a clearly articulated policy to displace competition.that inquiry is inherently enmeshed with the underlying cause of action,which requires a determination of whether a defendant has used unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce or unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a west.as the sixth circuit put it,t he analysis necessary to determine whether clearly articulated or affirmatively expressed state policy is involved and whether the state actively supervises the anticompetitive conduct is intimately intertwined with the ultimate determination that anticompetitive conduct has occurred.huron valley,at 
to be sure,the parker analysis does not always require an inquiry into whether the state acted to displace competition the ipso facto exemption turns only on the identity of the defendant.but the fact that some parker claims are separable can not suffice to render them all separable.the law is clear on this point.most recently,in van cauwenberghe,the court recognized that although in certain cases an interlocutory order will not require significant inquiry into the facts and legal issues presented by a case,and an immediate appeal might result in substantial savings of time and expense for both the litigants and the courts,a court should look to categories of cases,not to particular injustices in fashioning a rule of appealability in collateral order cases.at.see also cunningham,at.w e have consistently eschewed a approach to deciding whether an order is sufficiently collateral.carefirst,at the determination of whether an order satisfies the requirements of the collateral order doctrine must be made by applying the requirements to the general category to which the disputed order belongs,not on a basis to every order sought to be appealed.emphasis added.
because the parker analysis is not separable from the merits of this action,the ftc refusal to extend parker protection to the board can not be a collateral order.see carefirst,at an order must meet all three requirements to be appealable.but even if it were separable from the merits,the order at issue still would not be immediately appealable because,as explained below,it is not effectively unreviewable after trial.
to be effectively unreviewable,an order must protect an interest that would be essentially destroyed if its vindication must be postponed until trial is completed.lauro lines chasser,d emphasis added.the supreme court has specifically directed that courts not play word games with the concept of a right not to be tried.midland asphalt united states,d.i t is not mere avoidance of a trial,but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest,that counts when asking whether an order is effectively unreviewable if review is to be left until later.will.at.
only a limited number of interests fall into the class of rights effectively unreviewable after trial.recently,the court identified just four categories of appeals in which the values at stake created a right not to be tried claims to absolute immunity,nixon fitzgerald,d qualified immunity,mitchell forsyth,d eleventh amendment sovereign immunity,puerto rico aqueduct and sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d and the protections of the double jeopardy clause,abney united states,d.see will.at.in each of these cases,some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial honoring the separation of powers,preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials,respecting a state dignitary interest,and mitigating the government advantage over the individual.id.at.see also id.i t is not mere avoidance of a trial,but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest,that counts when asking whether an order is effectively unreviewable if review is to be left until later.
given these principles,we can not conclude that parker creates an immunity from suit.the parker doctrine did not arise from any concern about special harms that would result from trial.instead,parker speaks only about the proper interpretation of the sherman act 
we find nothing in the language of the sherman act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.in a dual system of government in which,under the constitution,the states are sovereign,save only as congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority,an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to congress.
parker,at.the supreme court did not say in parker that states and their agencies are immune from federal restrictions placed upon a state regulation of commerce within its borders or that congress could not otherwise make states liable for antitrust violations.on the contrary,the parker court assumed that congress,pursuant to its commerce clause powers,could prohibit a state from engaging in acts that would otherwise be prohibited under the sherman act,but found nothing in the language of the sherman act or in its history that suggested that congress had taken that presumably permissible step.id.simply put,parker construed a statute.it did not identify or articulate a constitutional or common law right not to be tried.parker,therefore,recognizes a defense qualitatively different from the immunities described in will,which focus on the harms attendant to litigation itself.even the fifth circuit,on whose reasoning the board relies,agrees with this assessment.see surgical care ctr.of hammond,hosp.serv.dist,cir en banc parker immunity is an inapt description,for its parentage differs from the qualified and absolute immunities of public officials while thus a convenient shorthand,parker immunity is more accurately a strict standard for locating the reach of the sherman act than the judicial creation of a defense to liability for its violation.
hence we can not conclude that the supreme court fashioned the parker state action doctrine to protect against any harm other than a misinterpretation of federal antitrust laws.although it is undoubtedly less convenient for a this case the have to wait until after trial to press its legal arguments,no protection afforded by parker will be lost in the delay.a party denied parker protection,like the board,is in much the same position as a defendant arguing that his conduct falls outside the scope of a criminal statute.see,united states gilbert,cir defendant maintained that his innocent possession of narcotics was beyond the reach of g.just as that defendant must endure a trial before appealing the merits of his unsuccessful motion,so too must the board await a single consolidated appeal if,indeed,it is found to have engaged in unfair
