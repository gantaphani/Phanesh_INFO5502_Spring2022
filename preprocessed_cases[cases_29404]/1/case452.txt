it is a crime for an alien to the country after he has been deported,unless he has the express permission of the attorney general of the united states or unless such permission is unnecessary in his case for other reasons.a.the usual sentence for the crime is a term in prison,followed by deportation.
somewhat unusually in the criminal law,there is an exception provided by statute,id.d,for aliens who can prove that the original deportation order was based on administrative proceedings which were fundamentally unfair.subsection d codifies these due process concerns,which were originally set forth in united states,d.see united states luna,cir.the collateral attack on the deportation order pursuant to d requires that the alien make three showings that he has exhausted administrative remedies,that he was improperly deprived of the opportunity for judicial review,and that the deportation order was fundamentally unfair.
rafael garcia was convicted after a jury trial of the crime of illegal and was sentenced on april,to months imprisonment and two years of supervised release he was released from prison on september,and was in immigration custody awaiting deportation as of the close of briefing in this appeal.
his appeal turns largely on attacking rulings by the district court denying his motion to dismiss the indictment under d because he had not met the three criteria for a successful collateral attack,and denying dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.he challenges jury findings that the criminal proceedings were brought within the statute of limitations and that he the country without the express consent of the attorney general.although he has served his term of imprisonment,will be deported and can not the united states legally,he also attacks his sentence of months imprisonment plus supervised release.finally,and with some cause,he complains about the delay of more than one year before the district court provided him a transcript for appeal.
the one fact that permeates the analysis in this case,and that affects many of the issues,is that at the time of his original conviction for sale of crack cocaine and consequent deportation,garcia gave the false name of dario deleon.he chose to hide from the immigration and naturalization service ins both his true identity and the fact that he had a green card in his true name rafael garcia.indeed,he asked for a prompt deportation and took no appeal.the district court found as a matter of fact that this was a deliberate scheme of deception on his part so that he could illegally the country by using his green card and his real name.this is exactly what he did a mere two months after his deportation he then lived in the united states for nearly eight years as rafael garcia.in march,the government learned for the first time that rafael garcia was the same person as the deported deleon and started these proceedings.
we affirm garcia conviction and sentence in all respects and note these key points in our holdings.first,in performing the collateral attack analysis under d,the court ordinarily should address the initial test of exhaustion of administrative remedies before going on to the other two tests.second,we address the situation where an alien claims that the statute of limitations applicable to prosecutions has run but the government lack of knowledge of the alien presence is a result of the alien misrepresentations as to his identity.third,we clarify and reinforce that a defendant who has been delayed in resolution of his appeal by delay in preparation of the trial transcript can not establish a violation of due process absent a showing of prejudice.
the following facts are undisputed except where otherwise noted.
garcia initial criminal conviction and deportation 
garcia,a native of the dominican republic,came to puerto rico in or,when he was approximately twelve years old.he obtained temporary permanent resident status in and lawful permanent resident status in.he later moved to massachusetts.
in late february,garcia was arrested in quincy,massachusetts and charged with,among other things,selling crack cocaine to undercover officers.garcia,who was carrying no identification,told the police his name was dario deleon.he also gave a false birth date and lied about his father name.
garcia,who said he spoke no english,appeared at least twice in quincy district court,accompanied both times by an attorney and at least once by an interpreter.according to a notation in the court records,garcia was a dvised of right to counsel and a dvised of alien rights.he never told the judge or anyone else his real name.on march,still under the name deleon,garcia entered a plea to the drug charge and was sentenced to time served,thirty days incarceration.
garcia was then transferred to the custody of the ins.there he again identified himself as deleon and consistently denied having legal status.he denied having a visa or a social security number and claimed to be unemployed.
the ins order to show cause issued to garcia under the name of deleon,which was written in both english and spanish,informed him,among other things,that he could seek an attorney or representative,if he desire d to be represented.it also informed him that if he was not satisfied with the eventual decision of the immigration judge ij,he had the right to appeal.garcia signed a form using the name deleon which stated that the order to show cause had been read to him in spanish.garcia also signed as deleon a form that stated,in spanish,that he was not a citizen of the united states,that he d id not wish to apply for relief from deportation,and that he want ed to be deported as soon as possible.the form further stated this request is completely voluntary.i have not been coerced,threatened,or enticed in any way 
prior to his appearance before the ij,garcia was provided with a notice of rights in spanish.the notice had two relevant sections.the first,entitled right to be represented by an attorney or representative,stated 
if you have any questions regarding any of your rights you can speak with an attorney or representative who can explain your rights,including any relief that may be available to you from deportation.the officer who gave you this notice will give you a list of organizations that can provide legal information.representatives from these organizations will speak to you for free or for a small fee,and some of them might speak your language you may contact a lawyer or other legal representative at this time or at any other time prior to your departure from the united states.
the second section,entitled right to a hearing before an immigration judge,stated in relevant part 
if you do not want to return to your country,you have a right to a hearing before an immigration judge,who will determine whether you can remain in the united states.if you request a hearing,you may be represented at the hearing by a lawyer or other legal representative at your own expense.if you can not afford to pay a lawyer,you may contact an organization on the list of free legal services.for example,if you are married to a citizen or permanent resident,or have lived in the for seven years or longer,and have not been convicted of a serious crime,you may be eligible for relief from deportation.
emphasis in the original.garcia signed the bottom of the form as deleon,indicating he had read it.
garcia also received,as part of the order to show cause,a page of written information entitled notice of rights and consequences.it stated,in both english and spanish you will be given a list of organizations,attorneys and other persons who have indicated their availability to represent aliens in these proceedings.some of these persons may represent you free of charge or for a nominal fee.it noted that hearings before the ij were typically scheduled no sooner than fourteen days after the issuance of the order to show cause to allow you to seek an attorney or representative,if you desire to be represented.
on april,garcia appeared before an ij in oakdale,louisiana.a court interpreter was present.the following colloquy ensued 
ij deleon,sir,this is your first appearance in my court,immigration court.as such,you entitled to delaying your case,if you wish,to better prepare your case or to acquire an attorney or we may go forward today,whichever you desire.
garcia i can not afford an attorney.i would like would like to ask for deportation.
ij do you understand the nature of immigration court,sir 
garcia yes.
at that point garcia took an oath to testify truthfully.the colloquy then continued 
ij sir,do you understand that you have the right to have an attorney represent you at no expense to the government 
garcia yes.
ij and you understand,sir,that you have the right to appeal any decision of this court to a higher court in washington,dc,and you do that through the federal court system of this country 
garcia yes.
ij sir,do you acknowledge previous receipt of the form,the legal aid sheet as well as your criminal conviction records 
garcia yes.
later,garcia stated still under oath that he was not a citizen or national and that he entered the united states in without inspection.the ij found garcia deportable.the ij asked the government attorney if he was aware of any relief from deportation,to which the government replied no,your honor.the ij ordered garcia deported to the dominican republic.he asked garcia do you wish to accept that decision or is there an appeal garcia replied i accept it.
garcia and second conviction 
soon after garcia june deportation,his sister mailed his green card and passport from massachusetts to him in the dominican republic.less than two months later,in late july,garcia used these documents to the united states via puerto rico under his real name he did not inform the immigration officials that he had been deported as dario deleon.an immigration official checked garcia permanent resident card and then admitted him.pursuant to standard practice at that time,he did not take garcia fingerprints,nor did he check the prints already on file for garcia against any other database.
garcia eventually moved back to massachusetts,where he lived under his real name for several years.in march,garcia argued with two people at a store in massachusetts.after he left the store,he noticed that the two were following his car.he decided to go to a police station.the police asked him for identification,which he provided under his real name.the police then arrested him on an outstanding warrant for operating an unregistered vehicle.garcia was fingerprinted,and the prints were sent to the fbi for a check of the bureau database at that point,authorities realized that garcia and deleon were one and the same.
garcia was charged with the federal crime of illegal in violation of.before trial,he moved to dismiss the indictment under the theories that the deportation proceeding violated his right to due process and was invalid under d,and the indictment was untimely.the district court rejected these contentions in a detailed order,discussed below.
after a jury trial,garcia was convicted.on april,the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment with credit for time served and months of supervised release.garcia completed his term of imprisonment on september,during the pendency of this appeal,and was transferred to ins custody to await deportation.
garcia primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred when it found that he failed to meet the collateral attack standard under d and refused to dismiss the indictment.
subsection d bars any collateral challenge to the underlying deportation order unless the alien demonstrates the following 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.here,the district court found that garcia had not met the third ground,in part because he could not show fundamental unfairness,as required under d.see luna,at.we review the subsidiary factual findings for clear error and the ultimate mixed conclusion that there was no fundamental unfairness de novo.see id.at.
garcia argued before the district court that he was denied the right to counsel during the deportation proceeding,and therefore that he met prongs and and that he was excused from meeting prong.he argued that he was illiterate in both english and spanish in,and so the notices informing him of his rights meant little.he also contended that when the ij told him he could obtain counsel and he replied,i can not afford an attorney,the ij was obligated to pursue the matter.he stated that he never received the legal aid sheet listing pro bono service providers,and that his affirmative answer when the ij asked him if he had received the sheet was simply a product of his confusion.
garcia also argued that he met the requirements of d because he did not know he was eligible for relief from deportation.he contended that as a lawful permanent resident,he would have been eligible for discretionary relief under former c and h of the immigration and nationality act he said the government led him to believe he was not eligible for relief,and that the ij deprived him of his right to be informed about potential relief by failing to mention it.
the district court rejected garcia collateral attack,first in a pretrial opinion and order and again after the verdict.the court skipped over the exhaustion and judicial review requirements of d and d and instead held that garcia could not show,pursuant to d,that entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair.this was so for several reasons.as to the right to be informed about discretionary relief,the district court found that the ij failure to mention it was entirely garcia fault garcia had lied to the ij and ins officials from the beginning,giving them a false name and telling them he had no legal status.under the circumstances,the court found,the ij had no duty to tell garcia about discretionary relief,because the ij had no way to know garcia was eligible 
as to the right to counsel,the court found that garcia had been notified twice in writing of his right to representation,that the ij had informed him of his right to obtain counsel yet he had declined,and that he had told the ij he received the legal aid sheet.in the order,the court explicitly found not credible garcia testimony during a pretrial motion hearing that he had never received the legal aid sheet,and added that even if he had not received it,that would not render the proceedings unfair,because he told the ij he had.as to garcia purported illiteracy,the district court wrote that it was certainly relevant to a due process inquiry but that it does not excuse garcia failure to notify the immigration judge that he wanted help in finding an attorney or that he needed help in reading a list of lawyers.
finally,and importantly,the district court concluded that garcia could not in any event demonstrate prejudice,as required under d,even if he had been denied access to a list of available counsel.this was because garcia did not intend to avail himself of counsel,but rather intended all along to lie about his identity and be deported as quickly as possible so that he could using his green card and real name.the court found the totality of defendant actions and statements indicates that he wanted his true identity and legal status concealed,rather than trumpeted.
on appeal,garcia presents the broad argument that at his deportation hearing,the government merely went through the motions and failed to give meaning to his rights.he says this is because the ij failed to determine whether garcia wished to be represented by counsel and failed to advise garcia of his right to pro bono counsel.the brief also argues that garcia rights were impinged because the ins failed to provide garcia with a list of legal aid counsel,as it was required to do,thus preventing garcia from retaining counsel who would have obtained c relief from deportation.
these arguments are an attempt to ignore the district court findings of fact the district court explicitly found that garcia had been advised multiple times of his right to obtain counsel during the immigration proceedings,that his testimony that he never received the legal aid list was not credible,that he never said he wanted a lawyer,and that he never requested time to find a lawyer.the court also found that it was quite unlikely garcia wanted a lawyer to further his scheme of fraudulent,he wanted to be quickly deported under the false name.those factual findings required a finding that garcia could demonstrate neither prejudice nor fundamental unfairness.no effort is made to show that the findings are clearly erroneous.
nonetheless,we have given garcia the benefit of reviewing the district court findings against the evidence,and there was no error at all.the district court ruling that the third precondition for collateral attack was not met is unassailable.
we add that ordinarily,the d analysis should start with the first ground,which the district court skipped over congress has mandated that an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order unless that alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order.d emphasis added.it is clear that appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia is such an administrative remedy,and that failure to take such an appeal constitutes a failure of exhaustion.see sayyah farquharson,cir.it is also undisputed that garcia explicitly waived his right to appeal to the bia when he asked to be deported as soon as possible and subsequently told the ij he accepted the decision ordering him deported.barring some exception to the exhaustion requirement,therefore,garcia may not challenge the deportation order validity.
garcia argues that just such an exception exists.he relies on cases from other courts which have concluded that the d exhaustion requirement can not bar collateral review of a deportation proceeding when the waiver of the right to an administrative appeal did not comport with due process,united states,cir,and therefore that failure to exhaust administrative remedies bars collateral review of a deportation proceeding under section d only where an alien waiver of administrative review was knowing and intelligent,united states sosa,cir see also,at waiver must be considered and intelligent internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states arrieta,cir united states,cir.
whether or not this court would create such an exception to the exhaustion requirement,a question on which we take no view,the facts here preclude the argument.garcia was told at least when the order to show cause was read to him,and again by the he had the right to appeal.he was asked again by the ij later in the proceeding whether he desired to appeal.he stated that he did not he also signed a form indicating that he did not wish to contest deportation.given this record,garcia waiver was knowing and intelligent.see united states johnson,cir finding knowing waiver where the ij clearly advised the alien of his right to appeal,at finding knowing waiver in part because the alien signed a form,read to him in spanish,stating that he did not wish to contest the charges.further,the district court found on ample evidence that garcia never had any intention of appealing,because he wanted to be deported as quickly as possible so that he could under his real name.see,at finding of knowing waiver was supported by an ins agent testimony that the alien had expressed a desire to return to mexico as soon as possible.
garcia argues that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because the ij did not tell him he was eligible for discretionary relief and the government attorney affirmatively informed him that he was not entitled to any discretionary relief.again,the argument depends on ignoring the district court factual findings.it was garcia lies about his identity and his failure to disclose his green card status that hid his potential eligibility from the government and the ij he gets no reward for that.a stating in the context of other forms of relief that the ij shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility emphasis added.
in sum,garcia knew precisely what he was doing when he decided to forgo an appeal of his deportation order if there is an exception to the d exhaustion requirement,he does not fall within it.his challenge to the deportation order fails.
a.the statute of limitations 
the crime of illegal is subject to a statute of limitations.the district court denied garcia pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on limitations grounds.the issue also was submitted to the jury,which made a specific finding that the government had proved the indictment was timely.we review the district court pretrial ruling de novo and the jury finding for sufficiency of the evidence.see united states walsh,cir holding that district court did not err as a matter of law in refusing to dismiss an indictment where a jury could reasonably have concluded on the evidence at trial that the limitations period had not run.
a deported alien who illegally reenters and remains in the united states can violate at three different points in time when he enters,attempts to enter,or when he is at any time found in this country.united states cuevas,cir quoting a.where an alien is indicted under the found in prong,as garcia was here,the alien is deemed to have committed the offense at the moment he was found.id.citing united states rodriguez,cir.
garcia argues the government could have found out earlier that he was illegally in the united states and that its lack of diligence should be held against it.the argument is based on language from other courts in factually distinct cases to the effect that an alien is found for purposes when immigration authorities could have,through the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities,discovered the violation in other words,when they had constructive knowledge that the alien was in the country illegally.see united states gomez,cir see also united states,cir.garcia argues that the jury was compelled to find that the government had the requisite constructive knowledge as soon as he the country,and so the limitations period ran several years before his indictment.this,he says,is because diligent immigration authorities would have realized at the time of his that he and deleon were the same person.
the district court,in considering garcia motion to dismiss,accepted the existence of this constructive knowledge theory for purposes of analysis.it examined affidavits and other evidence submitted by the government which stated that immigration procedures in place in did not involve checking the fingerprints of arriving green card holders like garcia against any database of criminals or of past deportees.the district court found that based on this evidence,and on the fact that garcia lied about his identity during the deportation process,it could not say as a matter of law that immigration officials exercising ordinary diligence should have known at the time of garcia that he previously had been deported.
we approach the question differently.this court has never adopted the theory that the government may be charged with constructive knowledge of an alien illegal for purposes of,and there are certainly good arguments against the theory in this context.we do not,however,resolve the broad question of whether constructive knowledge can be attributed to the government.we hold more narrowly that for statute of limitations purposes in prosecutions,there can be no finding of lack of diligence where it is deception by the alien as to his identity that has caused the government not to have knowledge of his presence.to hold otherwise would be to reward deceit by the alien and to encourage the withholding of information,and so the corruption of the deportation process united states mercedes,cir i t is difficult not to find mercedes claim regarding the delay disingenuous when he was the one who attempted to deceive law enforcement officials by concealing his true identity.in any event,the facts before the district court prior to trial showed that the government could not,in the ordinary course,have discovered the deception,and so there would be no basis for a constructive knowledge claim even if one were cognizable.
finally,any claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of timeliness fails.the government introduced evidence at trial to the effect that it did not know garcia had illegally the country until he was arrested in this evidence was uncontradicted.the jury had ample basis to find that it was not a lack of diligence by the government that resulted in the timing of the indictment in this case.
consent to 
garcia next argues the evidence was insufficient to support the jury conclusion that he lacked the attorney general consent to the country.in reviewing such a challenge,we consider the record evidence and any reasonable inferences therefrom as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution,asking whether the evidence would have permitted a rational jury to find the defendants guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.t he evidence may be entirely circumstantial,and need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states,cir.
to convict garcia of violating a,the jury must have found that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that garcia was an alien,that he had been deported,that he entered or attempted to enter or was later found in the united states,and that he did so without the express consent of the attorney general for such entry.id.citing,at see a.at trial,the government presented evidence as to the express consent,a certificate of nonexistence of record stating that no such consent appeared in the ins on dario deleon.garcia argues that since the ins kept a separate on rafael garcia,the jury could not convict absent evidence that no indication of consent appeared in the rafael garcia file either.since the government produced no such evidence,he says,it failed to carry its burden.
this argument is without merit.garcia own lies led to his deportation under the name deleon.if he had requested permission to after deportation,he would have had to do so as deleon otherwise the request would have made no sense to the immigration authorities and any such permission logically would be in the deleon file.further,as the district court found,the evidence supports the conclusion that garcia schemed to be deported under a false name so he could immediately using his real identity.a jury could reasonably infer that garcia never would have requested permission under any name to,since such a request would have alerted the ins to his deception.in short,the evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury verdict.
garcia falls back to an argument that he in fact had express permission to the country because he did so using his green card,which was issued by the attorney general and which he says constitutes the requisite permission.as the district court said under defendant interpretation of the statute,he can lie about his identity and then with impunity using a green card under his real name.this would obviously frustrate the statutory purpose of keeping aliens from reentering the country without the attorney general express prior permission.garcia had just been deported,regardless of what name he was using at the time,and he therefore needed the attorney general contemporaneous permission before he could legally.a.if garcia had been deported under his real name,his green card likely would have been revoked,and in any event obviously would not constitute such permission he can gain no advantage from having deceived the ins about his identity.
c.the issue 
garcia argues that his conviction must be vacated because the district court did not submit to the jury the question of his underlying drug conviction.he argues that the district court was required to do so because united states,d,in which the supreme court held that the prior conviction is a mere sentencing factor for b purposes,id.at,has been overruled by subsequent case law.he relies on justice thomas concurrence in shepard united states,d,which stated that in light of apprendi new jersey,d,and subsequent sixth amendment jurisprudence,a majority of the court now recognizes that was wrongly decided.shepard.at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
as an initial matter,we note that garcia seems to be mixing apples and oranges in challenging his conviction on this basis.the cases upon which he relies largely go to whether a judge may consider a prior conviction for sentencing purposes when that conviction has not been found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the flawed rule of emphasis added.perhaps garcia is making a sentencing argument.
either way,however,garcia argument fails.garcia stipulated to the prior conviction at trial his counsel not only affirmatively told the jury about the fact of a prior conviction and agreed to the entry into evidence of a redacted record of the conviction,but also argued prior to trial that evidence of the conviction is wholly irrelevant to garcia charged illegal reentry offense and has the potential to prejudice garcia unfairly.garcia has waived any argument that the jury needed to find the fact of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.see blakely washington,d a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial factfinding as to sentence enhancements,which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.see also united states glover,cir in regard to sentencing,a defendant may waive his sixth amendment rights under apprendi and blakely by stipulating to facts underlying sentence enhancements.citing blakely,at.
further,even had garcia not waived the issue,his precise argument has already been rejected by a panel of this court.united states ivery,cir.in ivery,the court noted that the supreme court has taken care to reaffirm the prior conviction exception of in all of its recent sixth amendment jurisprudence,and that even the shepard majority cautioned that it is up to the future to show whether apprendi eventually will be extended to require proof of prior convictions to a jury.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting shepard.at.the ivery panel concluded it is not our place to anticipate the supreme court reconsideration of its prior rulings thus remains binding law that we must apply until overruled by a majority of the supreme court.id.we in turn are bound by ivery holding.
booker issue as to garcia term of supervised release 
garcia has now served the imprisonment portion of his sentence and is subject to a term of supervised release,but is in the hands of immigration authorities and awaiting deportation,if he has not yet been deported.nonetheless,in a long footnote in his brief on appeal,garcia says he is entitled to be resentenced,presumably to alter the sentence of supervised release.
garcia was sentenced under the mandatory guidelines scheme in place prior to united states booker,d.he concedes that his booker claim was not preserved in the district court,but says he meets the reasonable probability standard this court requires under booker review,united states antonakopoulos,cir,because the district judge sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range and stated that his case was sympathetic.the government argues that we can not reach the booker issue because it is moot.
it is that a convict claim is not moot if he has finished his prison term but still faces supervised release or a restitution order,so long as those conditions give him a continuing stake in the outcome of a challenge to the sentence.united states molak,cir see also united states prochner,cir.
the government argues that the supervised release sentencing issue is moot on these facts.the argument is that garcia,who is in immigration custody and facing imminent deportation from the united states,will never be subject to the supervised release portion of his sentence.the government argues that the possibility that garcia could one day return to the united states does not change the analysis.this is because ga
