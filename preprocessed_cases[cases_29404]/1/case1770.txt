background 
factual background 
for the purposes of the cruz family applications for relief,the trouble began in guatemala in september when hector reyes perez reyes,a community leader and peasant farmer,disappeared.reyes was the manager of several swaths of farmland owned by the spaniard carlos vidal fernandez alej os vidal,including one parcel named nueva linda in the guatemalan state of retalhuleu.at the time of reyes disappearance,the guatemalan government had initiated a program under which it agreed to redistribute parcels of farmland,including some that vidal owned,to the peasant farmers in the region.reyes was allegedly helping to organize the government transfer of land,which was clearly in direct conflict with the interests of vidal,his employer.because of reyes role in the redistribution plan,many individuals from retalhuleu,including cruz,believed that vidal had orchestrated reyes disappearance and suspected death in order to prevent the seizure of his land.at the time of reyes disappearance,cruz was still residing in the united states,but apparently motivated by the prospect of obtaining some land as a result of the government redistribution efforts,cruz returned to guatemala in january.
despite the general belief among the peasant farmers that vidal was responsible for reyes disappearance,the guatemalan government never brought charges against vidal,and many organizations,including amnesty international,questioned the thoroughness of the government investigation.to protest the government inaction,approximately nine hundred peasants,many of whom were members of the association of farmers development committees codeca,peacefully occupied nueva linda for eight months in early.cruz took part in this protest and was nominated to be one of the four spokespersons for codeca.according to cruz,their hope was to pressure the authorities into investigating further reyes disappearance.cruz also testified that this initial occupation was authorized by court order.as a spokesperson,cruz engaged in negotiations between the peasant farmers and the guatemalan government,which ultimately proved fruitless.at some point either during or following the negotiations,the governor of retalhuleu ordered the peasant farmers to vacate the property.the record appears to indicate that the original judicial order allowing the peaceful occupation had been overruled and that the eviction order was valid.
according to cruz testimony and the articles that he submitted in support of his application for relief,when the peasant farmers refused to vacate the land,around guatemalan police,known as the national civilian police pnc,entered nueva linda in an attempt to remove the protestors and enforce the eviction order.unfortunately,a violent confrontation ensued.an amnesty international report,which cruz introduced as part of the record indicates that t he first line of police to enter nueva linda was unarmed.amnesty int l,guatemala land of injustice,available at.press reports in the record indicate,however,that as the officers advanced the occupying peasant farmers attacked the pnc with numerous weapons,including,rifles,firebombs,pyrotechnic devices,and machetes.one article that cruz submitted states that as the pnc advanced,two agrarian leaders on horseback distribute d ammunition to their companions,encouraging them to fight the police.pet.app x at prensa libre art.not surprisingly,the police responded with tear gas,batons,and perhaps firearms,although it is not entirely clear from the record.cruz testified that despite the press accounts and the guatemalan government assertions,the peasant farmers did not,in fact,bring weapons to the occupation of nueva linda.instead,cruz claims that the pnc and individuals working in conjunction with vidal introduced weapons into the otherwise peaceful protest in order to undermine the objectives of the occupation.cruz testified that he did not possess any weapons and did not harm any police officers.he stated that he engaged in only peaceful protest signs and demanding justice.at the end of the ordeal,however,there were scores injured and at least ten individuals dead,including seven peasant farmers and three police officers.
following the incident at nueva linda,the guatemalan government issued an arrest warrant for cruz based on his alleged participation and leadership role at nueva linda.because cruz believed that the guatemalan government was attempting to prosecute him based solely on his political opinion,and not for any legitimate purpose,he fled guatemala to the united states.cruz testified that given the imbalance of power between the landed class and the peasants,there was no hope for a fair trial in guatemala.both abigail and delia testified that based on their relationship to their father they also feared being returned to guatemala.specifically,they believed that cruz political opinion would be imputed to them and that they would become the targets of violence at the hands of cruz enemies,including vidal and the rest of the property owners of spanish descent in the region.
procedural history 
the immigration judge ij held a hearing on the merits of cruz,abigail,and delia applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief in july the ij found that the cruz family was basically credible.pet.app x at ij decision.specifically with regard to cruz,the ij concluded that he would largely accept cruz discussion of what happened.id.in fact,the ij did not believe cruz to be lying about anything that actually happened,and concluded that cruz testified credibly as to what happened,what he thinks happened,or what he believes in his opinion is the motivation of the people in guatemala.id.despite this conclusion,however,the ij then refused to accept cruz description of what went on on the vidal farm,concluding that all of cruz supporting documentation indicated that it was not a peaceful demonstration of any sort.id.moreover,the ij specifically rejected cruz claim that vidal was responsible for the introduction of weapons,deeming cruz assertion impossible to believe.id.at.
the ij ultimately concluded that cruz was involved in an armed confrontation with the police at the nueva linda farm,which was certainly illegal at the time and place of its occurrence,and that cruz was barred from asylum and withholding of removal.id.the ij alternatively concluded that cruz was clearly a terrorist as that term is defined in the ina,and would be barred from relief on that ground as well.id.with respect to abigail and delia,the ij acknowledged that t here is some level of risk to them as a result of their father activities but that it would be extremely unlikely that anyone would connect them with their father activism and cause them harm provided that they returned to guatemala city or some other part of the country.id.at.furthermore,the ij concluded that abigail and delia had failed to establish that members of a family amounted to a particular social group under the ina and would have failed to meet the burden to show eligibility for relief even assuming that relocation within guatemala were not a possibility.id.at.turning to the cruz family cat claims,the ij found that there is no evidence in th e record that would indicate that if cruz were to be prosecuted under the warrant for his arrest in guatemala that he would more likely than not be tortured.id.at.the ij further concluded that there is no evidence whatsoever that the children would be tortured by anyone,let alone someone with which the government acquiesces or turns a blind eye to.id.at.
the bia affirmed the ij decision denying asylum and withholding of removal to cruz on the ground that cruz had failed to establish that the criminal charges he faces in guatemala are,in fact,pretext for persecution based on his political opinion.because cruz had failed to meet his burden to show that he faces persecution on political grounds,the bia expressly declined to reach the immigration judge alternate determination that cruz is a terrorist and thus barred from obtaining relief.pet.app x at bia op.disposing of abigail and delia claims,the bia ruled that they had not shown that they could not reasonably relocate within guatemala in order to avoid harm,thus failing to meet their burden for asylum or withholding of removal based on fear of future persecution.lastly,the bia upheld the ij denial of cat relief on the grounds that none of the members of the cruz family had presented sufficient evidence to show that they face a clear probability of torture in guatemala.id.the cruz family timely sought review of the decision of the bia.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
because the bia adopted and supplemented the ij decision,we review the opinion of the ij in conjunction with the bia additional comments and discussion.see bi feng liu holder,cir.we review the ij and bia findings for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the decision was manifestly contrary to law,b c,that is,if the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it,haider holder,cir quoting ouda ins,cir.
ij credibility determination 
a preliminary matter that this court must address before reaching the issue of whether cruz has established eligibility for relief from removal involves a dispute over the ij credibility finding.cruz argues that the ij finding on his credibility was inconsistent.cruz claims that,in one breath,t he ij explicitly found cruz to be credible and state d that the ij did not believe cruz to be lying about anything that actually happened,but,i n almost in the same breath the ij disavow ed cruz account of the situation at vidal farm.appellant br.at quoting ij decision.cruz asserts that i t is extremely unclear exactly what portion of cruz testimony the ij believed if he did not believe the portion regarding the farmer group,and he argues before this court that he must be found credible and that his testimony treated as such.id.at.the bia made no finding with regard to credibility.
we agree with cruz that there is some tension between the ij determination that cruz was basically credible and that he was not lying about anything that actually happened,pet.app x at ij decision,and the subsequent conclusion that cruz account of the confrontation at nueva linda was impossible to believe,id.at.in essence,despite a statement that cruz was not lying,the ij did appear to treat his testimony as untrue,and the ij conflicting statements make it difficult to determine what the ij actually credited.recently,in haider,a panel of this court confronted a similar challenge to an ij ambiguous credibility finding when,as here,the credibility determination was not the basis of the agency ultimate decision to deny relief.in haider,the panel held that when an ij or the bia expresses suspicion about an applicant lack of credibility but the bia fails to make an explicit adverse determination and instead denies relief on some other basis,we will assume that the applicant was credible in order to review the actual grounds for the ruling.haider,at.if we conclude that the stated basis for denying relief was supported by substantial evidence,further review is foreclosed,but i f the evidence compels the opposite result,however,we will remand for a credibility determination.id.citing ins,cir see also maklaj mukasey,app x,cir unpublished opinion.
we will thus assume for the purposes of this appeal that cruz testified,that although cruz was a leader of a group of individuals that ultimately engaged in a protest that turned violent,cruz himself was unarmed,did not engage in violent behavior,and was not responsible for arming the peasants who did possess weapons.ultimately,however,the assumption that cruz testified credibly is irrelevant because,for the reasons outlined below,we hold that the bia finding that cruz will not be persecuted upon his removal to guatemala is supported by substantial evidence,and no remand is required.haider,at.
cruz is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal 
the disposition of an application for asylum involves a inquiry whether the applicant qualifies as a refugee as defined in a a,and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.kouljinski keisler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t o qualify as a refugee,the applicant must establish that he or she has suffered past persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,social group,or political opinion or show that he or she has a fear of persecution on one of those same bases.see also b.if an individual is eligible for asylum,then the applicant bears the burden of establishing that the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.kouljinski,at internal quotation marks omitted.
to prevail on a petition for withholding of removal under the ina,an alien must show that there is a clear probability,that is,that it is more likely than not,that he or she would be subject to persecution on the basis of one of these five grounds were he or she removed from this country.almuhtaseb gonzales,cir quoting liti gonzales,cir,and b.by contrast,to be eligible for withholding of removal under the cat,the applicant bears the burden of establishing it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.id.quoting liti,at.
the bia conclusion that cruz is not a refugee and is ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal because he does not fear persecution on account of his political opinion is supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we deny cruz petition for review as this circuit has recognized previously,there is a marked distinction between persecution and criminal prosecution.see,perkovic ins,cir hajdari gonzales,app x,cir unpublished opinion lakaj gonzales,app x,cir unpublished opinion.that is not to say,however,that there are not instances in which criminal prosecution can amount to persecution within the meaning of the ina.haider,at t he types of actions that might cross the line from harassment to persecution include detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
some courts have noted that persecution does not exist where the law that the native country seeks to enforce in its criminal prosecution is generally applicable.saleh dep t of justice,cir abedini ins,f d,cir.still other courts have noted that petitioners fail to establish persecution where the law is fairly administered.scheerer att y,cir shardar ashcroft,cir ngure ashcroft,cir ali gonzales,app x,cir unpublished opinion.
a petitioner may also establish that prosecution reaches the level of persecution if the individual can demonstrate that the prosecution or criminal investigation was actually pretext for persecution on account of one of the ina enumerated grounds.lakaj,app x at see hajdari,app x at.to determine whether the government motivations for criminal prosecution are improper,this circuit has looked at the substance and context of the law that the native country is attempting to enforce.for example,in perkovic,a panel of this circuit held that criminal prosecution under laws in the former yugoslavia that outlaw ed and punishe d peaceful expression of dissenting political opinion,the mere possession of albanian cultural artifacts,the exercise of citizens rights to petition their government,and the association of individuals in political groups with objectives of which the gove
