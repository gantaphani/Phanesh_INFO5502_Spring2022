opinion of the court 
this case requires us to construe a consent decree.the appellants,a class of tenants living in philadelphia public housing,moved the district court to enforce the decree and to cite the philadelphia housing authority and two of its employees together,the pha for civil contempt.the tenants alleged that the pha had violated the decree by failing to factor rising gas rates into allowances they were entitled to receive for their gas bills.the district court denied the motion initially and on reconsideration,concluding that the tenants could not show any actual provable injury as a result of the pha violations.it reasoned that the pha could offset its arrears by retroactively reducing the tenants allowances in light of evidence that tenant gas consumption during the period of the violations had been overstated.
we disagree with this reasoning.the plain text of the decree and applicable federal regulations do not permit the pha to revise the tenants allowances retroactively to correct for historically overstated consumption.the tenants were entitled to recover in the form of sanctions the difference between the allowances they received and the allowances they should have received based on the consumption factor then in effect.the district court erred in calculating their loss based on the pha revised figures,and its order denying their motion is vacated.
this case has its genesis in an april lawsuit filed against the pha by jackie mcdowell,a tenant in philadelphia public housing system.the suit was brought in federal court pursuant to.mcdowell complaint alleged that the pha had deprived her of her federal rights by failing to factor rising gas rates into the gas allowances she was entitled to receive under the united states housing act of,et.mcdowell sought relief for herself and for similarly situated tenants who were allegedly owed allowances by the pha.the plaintiff class was certified in may.
to understand the plaintiffs claims,some exposition of the housing act and its accompanying regulations is necessary.under section a a of the act,as amended,a public housing authority ordinarily may not require a tenant family to pay more than of its monthly adjusted income as rent.a a.since the department of housing and urban development hud has interpreted rent to include the reasonable cost of utilities,see,tenant allowances for utilities,wright roanoke redevelopment hous,d,housing authorities must issue rebates to tenants who purchase service directly from a utility company.see west sullivan,cir west bowen,cir.
these rebates take the form of monthly allowances credited toward the tenant rent.see b.the amount of the allowance is calculated to approximate a reasonable consumption of utilities by an household of modest circumstances consistent with the requirements of a safe,sanitary,and healthful living environment.id.a.separate allowances are calculated for each utility based on the utility company rates and a consumption factor that takes account of the climate in which the housing is located,the size of the dwelling units,and other relevant circumstances.id.d,a.if a tenant utility bill exceeds the allowance,the tenant must make up the difference if the allowance exceeds the bill,the difference may be pocketed.see west bowen,at.
in january,the parties agreed to settle mcdowell lawsuit.the stipulation of settlement read in pertinent part 
pha shall,commencing with,review,at least annually,the basis on which utility allowances have been established and,if reasonably required,shall establish revised allowances.
the annual review shall include all changes in circumstances indicating probability of a significant change in reasonable consumption requirements and changes in utility rates.
pha may revise its allowances for utilities between annual reviews if there is a rate change except that pha shall revise its allowances for utilities between annual reviews if any change in utility rates,by itself or together with prior rate changes not adjusted for,results in a change of percent or more from the rates on which the allowances were based.
adjustments to utility allowances shall be retroactive to the first day of the month following the month in which the last rate change taken into account in such revision became effective.
app.at.the terms of the settlement were incorporated into a consent decree,which provided that the district court would retain continuing jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of the parties agreement.id.at.
on december,after three years of stability in gas prices,the philadelphia gas works pgw raised the tenants rates by approximately.a month later,it raised them again.the pha own data show that the tenants rates exceeded the baseline rate at the time the decree was entered by at least during all but two months of the period from december through december.despite receiving several letters from the tenants counsel urging it to revise the gas allowances,the pha took no action on the rate hikes.the pha frankly admits that it fell out of compliance with the decree during this period.pha br.at.
on october,the tenants filed a motion to enforce the consent decree and to cite the pha for civil contempt.under a settlement reached in december,the pha agreed to increase the tenants gas allowances effective january.the adjustment was not retroactive,however,and the parties agreement expressly left unresolved whether the tenants were entitled to sanctions for the period of noncompliance from november through december.the district court fixed a briefing schedule to resolve this issue and heard oral argument on it in july.
the court denied the tenants motion in an unpublished order dated march.it found that the tenants had not suffered any actual provable injury as a result of any failure of pha to comply with the consent decree prior to january.app.at.this finding was based on r evised gas consumption calculations for the period july,through december,which showed that the overstatement of gas consumption during this period equaled or exceeded the shortfalls in the allowances due to the higher rates.id.the revised calculations were provided by sud associates,sud,a consulting firm retained by the pha.
the tenants moved for reconsideration under federal rule of civil procedure e.in addition to challenging the district court construction of the consent decree,they argued that the court should have afforded them discovery of sud data and an evidentiary hearing to contest its findings.the court denied the motion on may,and the tenants timely appealed on june of that year,raising the same claims rejected on their motion for reconsideration.
the denial of a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see river ins.cigna reinsurance,cir.this standard of review also applies to the underlying decision to deny the motion to enforce the consent decree.see holland dep t of,cir harris city of philadelphia,cir.an abuse of discretion may occur as a result of an errant conclusion of law,an improper application of law to fact,or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.chiang veneman,cir.
the proper construction of the consent decree is a question of law that receives plenary review.see holland,at sansom comm.ex rel.cook lynn,cir.the decision to deny the tenants discovery and an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states hedaithy,cir united states albinson,cir.under these standards,vacatur may be required if the district court denied the tenants motions based on a misconstruction of the decree or if it abused its discretion in denying them discovery and an evidentiary hearing.we discuss these claims in turn.
since a consent decree issued upon the stipulation of the parties has the characteristics of a contract,contract principles govern its construction.see frew ex rel.frew hawkins,d united states new jersey,cir.one of these principles is that an unambiguous agreement should be enforced according to its terms.see united states new jersey,at citing fox dep t of hous.urban,cir.whether the decree is unambiguous is a question of law that the court decides by considering whether,from an o
