background 
a.the regulatory.the clean water act 
congress enacted the clean water act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical and biological integrity of the nation waters.wildlife fed consumers power,cir quoting a.the goal of the clean water act is to achieve water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish,shellfish,and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water.a.thus,the act provides that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.id.a.pollutant is a statutorily defined term that includes,at least,dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water.id.the supreme court has held that this list is not exhaustive and that pollutant should be interpreted broadly.rapanos united states,d.
the clean water act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into navigable waters from any point source unless the epa issues a permit under the npdes permitting program,a,where a point source is any discernible,confined,and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged.id.the permitting program constitutes an exception to the clean water act prohibition on pollutant discharges into the nation waters.id.a.thus,if a party obtains a permit,the discharge of pollutants in accordance with that permit is not unlawful.id.
before a permit is issued,the epa,or a state agency that has been approved by the epa,evaluates the permit application to ensure that the discharge of a pollutant under the proposed circumstances will not cause undue harm to the quality of the water.see.in addition to granting permits for specific discharges,the epa and state authorities may also grant general permits that allow for the discharge of a specific pollutant or type of pollutant across an entire region.id.for example,prior to the epa adoption of the final rule,the state of washington had issued a general permit to allow for the application of all aquatic pesticides in the state.see acquatechnex washington dep t of ecology,pchb,wa env lexis,pollution control hr gs bd,as a result,users of aquatic pesticides in washington could discharge those pesticides covered by the rule without obtaining a permit.these general permits greatly reduce the administrative burden by authorizing discharges from a category of point sources within a specified geographic area.florida water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,d citing b v.once the epa or a state agency issues such a general permit,covered entities,in some cases,need take no further action to achieve compliance with the npdes besides adhering to the permit conditions.id.
the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act 
the epa also regulates the labeling and sale of pesticides under the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act.under the fifra,all pesticides sold in the united states must be registered with the epa.see et.the epa approves an insecticide for registration only when it finds that the chemical,when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice,will not generally cause unreasonably adverse effects on the environment.no spray coalition city of new york,cir quoting c d.under the fifra,the epa issues a label for each registered pesticide,indicating the manner in which it may be used the statute makes it unlawful to use any pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.id.quoting a.
for nearly thirty years prior to the adoption of the final rule,pesticide labels issued under the fifra were required to contain a notice stating that the pesticide could not be discharge d into lakes,streams,ponds,or public waters unless in accordance with an npdes permit.epa policy and criteria notice.despite amendments made to the fifra labeling requirements over the years,pesticide labels have always included a notice about the necessity of obtaining an npdes permit.see epa policy and criteria notice pesticide registration pr notice july,pr notice may,see also,available at fact.pdf,pesticide reregistration notification for,referring to the labeling requirement described in the pr notice.
the regulatory framework under the final rule 
under the clean water act,pollutants may only be discharged according to a permit unless they fit into one of the exceptions listed in the federal regulations at.the final rule revises the regulations by adding pesticides to these exceptions as long as they are used in accordance with the fifra requirements.at.specifically,the final rule states that pesticides applied consistently with the fifra do not require an npdes permit in the following two circumstances 
the application of pesticides directly to waters of the united states in order to control pests.examples of such applications include applications to control mosquito larvae,aquatic weeds,or other pests that are present in waters of the united states.
the application of pesticides to control pests that are present over waters of the united states,including near such waters,where a portion of the pesticides will unavoidably be deposited to waters of the united states in order to target the pests effectively for example,when insecticides are aerially applied to a forest canopy where waters of the united states may be present below the canopy or where pesticides are applied over or near water for control of adult mosquitoes or other pests.
although the epa,through its final rule,takes the position that pesticides are not generally pollutants,it makes an exception for pesticide residuals,which include excess amounts of pesticide.at.pesticide residuals are those portions of the pesticide that remain in the water after the application and its intended purpose elimination of targeted pests have been completed id.the epa concedes that pesticide residue unlike pesticides generally is a pollutant under the clean water act because it is waste of the pesticide application.id.nonetheless,the epa contends that pesticide residue is not subject to the npdes permitting program because at the time of discharge to a water of the united states,the material in the discharge must be both a pollutant,and from a point source.id.according to the epa,the residue can not be subject to the permitting program because by the time it becomes a pollutant it is no longer from a point source.since no point source is at play,the epa reasons,pesticide residue is a nonpoint source pollutant and therefore not subject to the permitting requirements.id.
procedural background 
timely petitions for review of the final rule were filed in the first,second,third,fourth,fifth,sixth,seventh,eighth,ninth,tenth,and circuits by either the industry petitioners or the environmental petitioners.the petitions for review were consolidated in this circuit by an order of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation,under and a.the industry intervenors filed a motion to intervene in support of the final rule 
environmental petitioners filed a timely motion to dismiss the petitions because of lack of subject matter jurisdiction or,alternatively,to transfer the cases to the ninth circuit.industry petitioners,the epa,and industry intervenors opposed this motion.the environmental petitioners have also filed a complaint challenging the final rule in the northern district of california in order to preserve review of the final rule in the event this court grants their motion to dismiss.on july,we denied the motion to transfer and deferred the decision on the question of subject matter jurisdiction.
ii.jurisdiction 
environmental petitioners contend that this dispute should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that original review of the final rule by the courts of appeals is not covered by the grant of original jurisdiction set forth in the clean water act,b.environmental petitioners are correct that congress did not intend court of appeals jurisdiction over all epa actions taken pursuant to the act.lake cumberland trust,epa,cir quoting boise cascade epa,cir.however,we conclude that,at a minimum,b f encompasses the action before us.
under b f,a party may challenge epa actions issuing or denying any permit under section in the appropriate circuit court.the clean water act permitting program is set forth in.the jurisdictional grant of b f authorizes the courts of appeals to review the regulations governing the issuance of permits under section,as well as the issuance or denial of a particular permit.am.mining cong.epa,cir.thus,in natural resources defense council,epa,cir,the court held that it had jurisdiction to review an epa rule exempting uncontaminated discharge from the permitting regulations.the natural resources court concluded that it had the power to review rules that regulate the underlying permit procedures.id.at citing nrdc epa,and du pont de nemours train,d.the final rule before us today likewise regulates the permitting procedures,and we therefore conclude that jurisdiction is proper under b f.

the agency has relied on factors that congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency experience.

b.the parties positions 
the petitioners 
environmental petitioners argue that the epa exceeded its authority under the clean water act in issuing a rule that excludes pesticides from the definition of pollutant under that the epa exceeded its authority under the clean water act when it determined that,while pesticides are discharged by point sources,the residue of these pesticides is nonetheless a nonpoint source pollutant and that the epa may not exempt applications of pesticides from the requirements of the clean water act.industry petitioners,on the other hand,argue that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because it treats pesticides applied in violation of the fifra as pollutants,while it treats the very same pesticides used in compliance with the fifra as.in other words,the industry petitioners complain that whether something constitutes a pollutant should not hinge upon compliance with the fifra.
as described above,the epa final rule exempts from the npdes permitting program pesticides that are applied directly to the nation waters,or near such waters,in order to control pests.h.the epa says that its final rule exempts both pesticides generally and pesticide residue,which includes excess pesticide.at.
the epa provides two reasons that its final rule is reasonable.first,the epa argues that the clean water act as it applies to pesticides is ambiguous.the epa contends that it reasonably determined that pesticides applied according to the fifra requirements are not pollutants and therefore are not subject to the npdes permitting program.the epa reasons that congress defined the term pollutant in the clean water act to mean one of specific items.epa br.at.of these sixteen,the epa states that pesticides,which are either chemical or biological in nature,may only be considered to be chemical wastes or biological materials.at.the epa argues that pesticides are not chemical wastes in the ordinary dictionary definition of the word waste,because waste is that which is eliminated or discarded as no longer useful or required after the completion of a process.id.quoting the new oxford american dictionary elizabeth jewell frank abate.rather than being wastes,the epa reasons that pesticides applied according to the fifra labeling requirements are products that the epa has evaluated and registered for the purpose of controlling target organisms,and are designed,purchased,and applied to perform that purpose.id.the epa next concludes that pesticides applied in accordance with the fifra are not biological materials because to find otherwise would lead to the anomalous result that biological pesticides are pollutants,while chemical pesticides used in the same circumstances are not.id.
the epa second argument attempts to justify its final rule as applied to pesticide residue.in contrast to pesticides generally,which the epa contends are not pollutants,the epa concedes that pesticide residue and excess pesticide are pollutants within the meaning of the clean water act because they are wastes of the pesticide application.at.the epa also concedes that pesticides are discharged from a point source.id.at.nonetheless,the epa concludes that no permit is required for pesticide applications that result in excess or residue pesticide because it interprets the clean water act as requiring permits only for discharges that are both a pollutant,and from a point source at the time of discharge.id.at.
are pesticides unambiguously pollutants within the meaning of the act 
the first question under chevron is whether the clean water act unambiguously includes pesticides within its definition of pollutant.under this first step,this court determines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.this is determined by employing traditional tools of statutory construction.id.the meaning of a statute is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d see also dole united steelworkers of,d our starting point is the language of the statute,but in expounding a statute,we are not guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.citations omitted.if congress intent is clear from the statutory language,then that intent must be given effect.chevron,at.
as noted above,the clean water act defines pollutant as dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water.this court has previously concluded that the broad generic terms included in the definition of pollutant demonstrate congress intent to capture more than just the items expressly enumerated.united states hamel,cir concluding that the clean water act covers,at a minimum,those pollutants covered under the refuse act,which applies to all foreign substances not explicitly exempted from coverage see also,cedar point oil,at t he breadth of many of the items in the list of pollutants tends to eviscerate any restrictive effect.no spray coalition,dist.lexis,at citing.at,reprinted in.however,we need not consider the term breadth today.rather,we find the plain language of chemical waste and biological materials in b to be unambiguous as to pesticides.this court must,therefore,give effect to the congress expressed intent.see chevron,at.
chemical waste 
generally,a court should give a word in a statute its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended it to bear some different import.grand traverse band of ottawa chippewa indians office of attorney,cir quoting williams taylor,d.the epa refers the court to the new oxford american dictionary jewell abate eds,which defines waste as eliminated or discarded as no longer useful or required after the completion of a process.id.at.industry petitioners point the court to black law dictionary ed,which defines waste as r efuse or superfluous material,esp.that after a manufacturing or chemical process.id.at.similarly,the ninth circuit has accepted the american heritage dictionary definition of waste as any useless or worthless byproduct of a process or the like refuse or excess material.plains res.council fidelity exploration dev,cir fairhurst hagener.
under any of these definitions of waste,chemical waste for the purposes of the clean water act would include discarded chemicals,superfluous chemicals,or refuse or excess chemicals.as such,under a analysis of the term,we can not conclude that all chemical pesticides require npdes permits.rather,like our sister circuit in fairhurst,we conclude that so long as the chemical pesticide is intentionally applied to the water to perform a particular useful purpose and leaves no excess portions after performing its intended purpose it is not a chemical waste,at,and does not require an npdes permit.id.
on the other hand,as environmental petitioners argue and the epa concedes,excess pesticide and pesticide residue meet the common definition of waste.to this extent,the epa final rule is in line with the expressed intent of congress,as the rule defines these pesticide residues as pollutants because they are wastes of the pesticide application.at.the epa aptly states 
p esticides applied to land but later contained in a waste stream,including storm water regulated under the clean water act,could trigger the requirement of obtaining an npdes permit in addition,if there are residual materials resulting from pesticides that remain in the water after the application and its intended purpose has been completed,the residual materials are pollutants because they are substances that are no longer useful or required after the completion of a process.
epa br.this court agrees.
therefore,at least two easily defined sets of circumstances arise whereby chemical pesticides qualify as pollutants under the clean water act.in the first circumstance,a chemical pesticide is initially applied to land or dispersed in the pesticides are sometimes referred to as either terrestrial pesticides or aerial pesticides and include applications above or near waterways.at some point following application,excess pesticide or residual pesticide finds its way into the navigable waters of the united states.pesticides applied in this way and later affecting the water are necessarily discarded,superfluous,or excess chemical.such chemical pesticide residuals meet the clean water act definition of chemical waste.
in the second circumstance,a chemical pesticide is applied directly and purposefully to navigable waters to serve a beneficial pesticides are often referred to as aqueous or aquatic pesticides.as contemplated by the epa,if residual aquatic pesticide remain s in the water after the application and the pesticide intended purpose has been completed,then the residue would likewise qualify as a chemical waste.epa br.as such,these chemical wastes would unambiguously fall within the ambit of the clean water act.
this second scenario,of course,leads to the inevitable quandary that both aqueous pesticide and pesticide residual are applied to water at the same moment,which then gives rise to the question of how the epa can regulate and permit the residual.however,this problem is more theoretical than practical.in reality,whether or not a particular chemical pesticide needs to be regulated can be easily answered by both the epa and industry experience with that pesticide.if,as was the case in fairhurst,a chemical such as antimycin leaves no excess portions after performing its intended purpose,then that chemical use need not be regulated.see fairhurst,at.if,on the other hand,a chemical pesticide is known to have lasting effects beyond the pesticide intended object,then its use must be regulated under the clean water act.see also headwaters,talent irrigation,cir.
biological materials 
continuing our review under chevron,we must examine the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of biological materials.grand traverse band,at.environmental petitioners point out that webster third new international dictionary gove ed defines material as of,relating to,or consisting of matter and the basic matter from which the whole or the great part of something is made.id.at.the oxford english dictionary provides that material is that which constitutes the substance of a thing physical or nonphysical a physical substance a material thing.oed online,available at.com cgi entry que ry type word queryword material firs t max to show sort type alpha result place search id vo pl c vw rj a hilite.the plain,unambiguous nature of this language compels this court to find that matter of a biological nature,such as biological pesticides,qualifies as a biological material and falls under the clean water act if it is discharged into water.
the epa points to ninth circuit case law that holds that mussel shells and mussel byproduct are not pollutants under the clean water act.ass to protect hammersley,eld totten inlets taylor,cir.the hammersley court found the clean water act to be ambiguous on whether biological materials means all biological matter regardless of quantum and nature.id.while that case is distinguishable,we choose a more limited analysis we see our obligati
