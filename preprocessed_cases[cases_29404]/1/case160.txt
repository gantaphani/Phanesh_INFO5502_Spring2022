this case presents an and a purported facial attack on the massachusetts statutory and administrative scheme for revoking licenses for the carrying of firearms.the district court entered summary judgment dismissing the claims.hightower city of boston,d.
stacey hightower is a former boston police officer who,during many of her years of service from to,had a broad class a license which permitted her to carry and to conceal a large capacity firearm,in addition to her boston police department bpd service gun.shortly after her resignation from the bpd,her license was revoked because the bpd determined that she had inaccurately answered a question on her license renewal form.the question was whether she had any complaints or charges pending against her.after the revocation,she neither invoked her right to judicial review nor sought a more limited license which would have entitled her to carry her small handgun.
on the facts of this case,we hold that hightower has standing to bring her claims,that the case is ripe,that her second amendment claim fails,that her purported second amendment facial attack also fails,and that her procedural due process claim fails,as does her equal protection claim.we affirm entry of judgment against hightower.
the facts giving rise to this suit are largely undisputed.
massachusetts firearms licensing license revocation statute 
massachusetts has three categories of licenses available for the carrying of firearms a firearms identification card fid card,a class b license,and a class a license.see.laws ch.all three are issued by the relevant licensing authority,which is defined as the chief of police or the board or officer having control of the police in a city or town,or persons authorized by them.id.it is generally a crime under massachusetts law to carry a firearm without having the appropriate license or fid card,or being exempt from licensing.id.ch.as the massachusetts supreme judicial court has explained 
to lawfully carry a firearm within the commonwealth a person must either obtain a license to do so under,or be exempt from the normal licensing requirements under,or there is one other exemption.a person who obtains a firearm identification card under,allowing him or her to possess a firearm legally,may carry a firearm within his or her residence or place of business without violating the law.

a sworn bpd officer is not required to have a license to carry a firearm.see.laws ch,o listing exempted persons and uses as including police officers and other peace officers of any jurisdiction,in the performance of their official duty or when duly authorized to possess them see also id.ch,police officers may carry within the commonwealth such weapons as the chief of police or the board or officer having control of the police in a city or town shall determine.this dispute is not about hightower police firearm,but her private one.
an fid card allows the holder to own,transfer,or possess a firearm in his residence or place of business.commonwealth gouse.various statutory requirements and exemptions govern the issuance of fid cards.see.laws ch.notably,there is no suitable person requirement for issuance of fid cards,as there is for class a and b licenses the licensing authority shall issue an fid card unless the applicant falls within one of the statute enumerated categories of ineligible individuals.id.
a class b license entitles a holder thereof to purchase,rent,lease,borrow,possess and carry i capacity firearms and ii rifles and shotguns,including large capacity rifles and shotguns.id.b.large capacity firearms include any firearms capable of accepting,or readily modifiable to accept,any detachable large capacity feeding device,and a l arge capacity feeding device is defined to include any magazine or similar item that can hold more than ten rounds.id.class b licenses shall not entitle the holder thereof to carry or possess a loaded firearm in a concealed manner in any public way or place,shall not entitle the holder thereof to possess a large capacity firearm,and are to be issued subject to such restrictions relative to the possession,use or carrying of such firearm as the licensing authority deems proper.id.b.
class a licenses provide the same privileges as class b licenses,except that the holder may possess large capacity firearms,and the statute does not preclude possession or carrying of concealed firearms in public.id.a.class a licenses are issued subject to such restrictions relative to the possession,use or carrying of firearms as the licensing authority deems proper,id,which can include preventing the carrying of concealed weapons in public.
both licenses are governed by the same application procedures,eligibility requirements,and revocation procedures.individuals may submit an application for a class a or class b license,or for renewal of such license,to the licensing authority of the jurisdiction of their place of residence or place of business.id.d.any applicant who knowingly files an application containing false information may be punished by fine or imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than two years.id.h.
as to eligibility,the statute provides seven categories of individuals who are not eligible to receive a license individuals who have been convicted of a felony,a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than two years,or certain other crimes,individuals who ha ve been confined to any hospital or institution for mental illness,unless the applicant submits an affidavit of a physician attesting that the applicant is not disabled by such an illness in a manner that should prevent such applicant from possessing a firearm,those who are or have been under treatment for or confinement for drug addiction or habitual drunkenness,unless such applicant is deemed to be cured of such condition by a licensed physician,those under the age of,aliens,individuals currently subject to certain restraining orders,and individuals currently the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant.id.d i vii.
if an individual,like the plaintiff here,is not rendered statutorily ineligible as a result of falling into one of those categories,the licensing authority 
may issue a class a or class b license if it appears that the applicant is a suitable person to be issued such license,and that the applicant has good reason to fear injury to his person or property,or for any other reason,including the carrying of firearms for use in sport or target practice only,subject to such restrictions expressed or authorized under this section.
the licensing authority must make a decision on the application within forty days from the date of application if the application is denied,the authority must notify the applicant of the reason for such denial in writing.id.e.if granted,both class a and class b licenses shall be valid,unless revoked or suspended,for a period of not more than years from the date of issue,and are to expire on the licensee date of birth.id.i.
as to suspension or revocation of licenses,which is at the heart of this case,the statute provides 
a license issued under this section shall be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority,or his designee,upon the occurrence of any event that would have disqualified the holder from being issued such license or from having such license renewed.a license may be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority if it appears that the holder is no longer a suitable person to possess such license.any revocation or suspension of a license shall be in writing and shall state the reasons therefor.
if a license is suspended or revoked,or an application is denied,the aggrieved individual may file a petition to obtain judicial review in the district court within ninety days of the denial,revocation,or suspension.id.f a justice of such court,after a hearing,may direct that a license be issued or reinstated to the petitioner if such justice finds that there was no reasonable ground for denying,suspending or revoking such license and that the petitioner is not prohibited by law from possessing same.id.further judicial review may be had in an action in the nature of certiorari under.laws ch.levine chief justice of the dist.court.
if a class a or b license is revoked or suspended,the licensing authority shall take possession of such license and the person whose license is so revoked or suspended shall take all actions required under the provisions of section.no appeal or motion shall operate to stay such revocation or suspension.laws ch,f.
section,in turn,provides 
upon revocation,suspension or denial of an application for a firearm identification card or of any firearms license if said firearms identification card is not then in force,the person whose application was so revoked,suspended or denied shall without delay deliver or surrender,to the licensing authority where he resides,all firearms,rifles,shotguns and machine guns and ammunition which he then possesses unless an appeal is pending.
id.emphasis added.
that section further provides that s uch person,or his legal representative,shall have the right,at any time up to one year after said delivery or surrender,to transfer such firearms to any licensed dealer or any other person legally permitted to purchase or take possession of such firearms,and requires the licensing authority to transfer such firearms upon receiving written notice.id.
factual background 
stacey hightower,a resident of boston,served as a police officer for the city of boston from june until august.hightower initially applied for and received from the licensing authority for the city of boston a class a license to carry large capacity firearms in.that license was unrestricted,meaning that hightower was authorized to carry firearms for all lawful purposes,including carrying firearms concealed in public.pursuant to this license,hightower possessed a caliber revolver,which was a personal firearm she owned in addition to her firearm.a bpd officer must possess a class a license to carry a concealed firearm in public no license is required to carry a firearm.see.laws o listing exempted persons and uses as including police officers and other peace officers of any jurisdiction,in the performance of their official duty or when duly authorized to possess them.
hightower class a license lapsed in march.in july,hightower filed an application to renew her class a license.to renew the license,hightower had to fill out,in addition to the ordinary renewal form,a form g s,which was specific to boston police officers,who were required to fill out that form when applying for or renewing firearms licenses one of the questions on the g s form was are there any complaints or charges pending against you hightower answered no to that question hightower renewal was approved without restrictions on august.
hightower resigned from the boston police on july,effective august.on august,a police commissioner personnel order was placed into her file without her endorsement,stating that her resignation had been presented with charges pending.the bpd officer in charge of the licensing unit,which is responsible for issuing firearms licenses within the city of boston,reviewed this order.after confirming with bpd internal affairs that hightower,in bpd view,had charges pending against her when she resigned,the licensing unit officer determined that hightower had been untruthful in her answer on the g accordingly,the officer sent her a letter revoking her class a license and stating the reasons.
on august,hightower received the letter revoking her class a license on the grounds that she completed the application form untruthfully.the parties agree that the basis for this conclusion was that,in the view of the defendants,hightower in fact had complaints or charges pending when she filled out the license renewal form,contrary to her answer on the form.
the pending internal affairs charges related to a complaint by an individual that he had been assaulted at the booking desk by a police officer not hightower after his arrest.hightower had transported the prisoner from the location of his arrest to the police station.hightower was interviewed by bpd internal affairs investigators regarding the complaint.in,bpd internal affairs investigators found that hightower had violated three bpd rules,including abuse of process withholding information during the investigation into the complaint.hightower received a letter dated november,which stated that these findings had been made by the investigators.hightower testified at her deposition that she understood one of the findings of the investigators was that she had not been truthful during the investigation.hightower internally appealed those findings and had entered into settlement negotiations regarding the violations,but had yet to resolve the matter at the time she resigned from the bpd.the parties dispute whether the status of that matter at the time hightower filled out form g s amounted to pending complaints or charges within the meaning of the form,and also dispute whether hightower remained aware of the status of her internal affairs matter.
the license revocation letter informed hightower that she was entitled to appeal this decision with days to the district court with appropriate jurisdiction.hightower chose not to appeal the revocation.hightower never contacted the bpd to inquire as to whether she had in fact answered a question on the form untruthfully.
hightower has also never filed another application for either a class a license,class b license,or fid card after she left the boston police.because hightower is no longer a bpd officer,she would not need to fill out a form g s were she to apply for a class a license.the defendants maintain that if hightower applied for a class a license,she would receive a restricted license assuming that she is not statutorily disqualified,and if she desired an unrestricted license,the licensing authority would make a determination based on her needs and the interests of the boston police department in regulating class a unrestricted licenses.
the license revocation letter also stated that hightower shall,in accordance with,without delay,deliver or surrender to the licensing authority where you reside your licenses to carry,and all firearms.section provides that u pon revocation,suspension or denial of an application for a firearm identification card or of any firearms license if said firearms identification card is not then in force,the person whose application or license was revoked,suspended,or denied shall without delay deliver or surrender all firearms which he then possesses unless an appeal is pending.laws ch,emphasis added.hightower surrendered her firearm after receiving the revocation letter.
procedural history 
hightower filed suit in federal court on november.the complaint,as amended,named as defendants the city of boston and the boston police commissioner.the complaint alleged that the revocation of her class a license was unconstitutional,under several theories the second amendment,procedural due process,substantive due process,and equal protection.the complaint requested as relief return of hightower revolver,an order restoring hightower class a license,a permanent injunction preventing enforc ement of the customs,policies,and practices complained of,and attorneys fees.
the commonwealth of massachusetts intervened as a defendant in february.the parties filed for summary judgment,and on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.hightower,d at.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,assessing the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the party.valley forge ins.field,cir.all of hightower claims on appeal present questions of law,which we review de novo.united states rehlander,cir the issues before us are legal and our review is therefore de novo.
hightower raises three arguments on appeal that the revocation of her license,and massachusetts firearms licensing scheme,violate the second amendment that the same revocation and licensing scheme violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and that the revocation violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the defendants argue that hightower second amendment claim is not ripe.we address ripeness and other preliminary matters before turning to each of hightower claims.
preliminary issues 
hightower has met the requirements for both standing and ripeness to assert claims for denial of procedural due process and equal protection,and for violation of any second amendment rights arising from the revocation of her license.
as to standing to bring at least claims as to the class a license,it is clear that the revocation of hightower license constitutes an injury that suffices to satisfy the minimum requirements of article iii standing,regardless of whether hightower can apply for another license.see katz pershing,llc,cir outlining elements of article iii standing see also,parker district of columbia,we have consistently treated a license or permit denial pursuant to a state or federal administrative scheme as an article iii injury,aff sub nom.district of columbia heller.
hightower claim extends only to the characteristics of the license that was revoked a class a unrestricted license that allows for carrying of concealed,large capacity weapons outside the home.hightower lacks standing to raise a claim as to a class b license she has never applied for such a license,been denied one,or had such a license revoked.such a license would allow her to carry a capacity weapon in public for the same reason,she lacks standing as to an fid card,which would allow her to possess a firearm in her home or place of business.
as to ripeness,the fact that hightower can apply for another type of license that would redress her injury of not being licensed for her small gun does not render her claim unripe.see gastronomical workers union local metro.hotel ass pension fund dorado beach hotel,cir t he ripeness claim is that a future event may change the type of remedy available to redress an existing injury.consequently,it is the future event,not the injury,that is speculative.viewed in this light,the argument is not a ripeness argument at all.see also kachalsky cacace,d,rejecting similar argument in a second amendment case because t hat state licensing officers might grant individual plaintiffs second permit applications were they to submit such applications at some point in the future does not suggest that their current injuries are speculative.
however,both the existence of various firearms licenses for which hightower could apply and the fact that hightower has not applied for such licenses do impact the arguments hightower can properly raise on the merits of her claims,as discussed below.
second amendment claims 
as applied claim 
hightower argues that she is entitled to a declaration that the second amendment secures the right to publicly carry a handgun outside of her home for self defense,and that this right can not be made to depend on a suitability determination by licensing officials.hightower also requests injunctive relief.
hightower argues that the class a license is the only form of massachusetts license that would allow her to exercise the second amendment right she claims to have.for hightower second amendment challenge to the license revocation to succeed,then,hightower must prove that denial of the additional benefits granted by an unrestricted class a license,over and above those granted by a class b license,amounted to a second amendment violation.as we understand it,although hightower made no firm commitment on the record as to this point,she does not in fact desire a license for a large capacity firearm,and her personal firearm is not a large capacity weapon.in any event,she has presented no argument about why the possession or carrying of large capacity weapons is protected from any form of government regulation by the second amendment.that the license lost allowed carrying of large capacity weapons weakens the second amendment claim,as district of columbia heller,was concerned with weapons of the type characteristically used to protect the home she does wish to be licensed to carry her small gun as a concealed weapon and argues that those interests are protected by the second amendment and the revocation is unconstitutional.in her favor,we examine her more limited claim.to succeed on her second amendment claim,hightower would have to show that the license revocation,as applied to her ability to carry concealed handguns in public,amounts to a second amendment violation.
the second amendment applies to state and local regulation of firearms.mcdonald city of chicago.in heller,the court held,inter alia,that a law that totally bans handgun possession in the home violated the second amendment.at.the court required the district of columbia to permit the plaintiff to register his handgun and issue him a license to carry it in the home,if the plaintiff was not disqualified.id.at.the court stressed that the home is where the need for defense of self,family,and property is most acute,id.at,and explained that the second amendment elevates above all other interests the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,id.at emphasis added.
courts have consistently recognized that heller established that the possession of operative firearms for use in defense of the home constitutes the core of the second amendment.see,united states booker,cir while we do not attempt to discern the core second amendment right vindicated in heller,we note that heller stated that the second amendment elevates above all other interests the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.quoting heller.at,cert.denied.united states greeno,cir the core right recognized in heller is the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.quoting heller.at,georgia,wl,at cir.july,to be published in noting that the heller court went to great lengths to emphasize the special place that the home an individual private property occupies in our society united states barton,cir at the core of the second amendment is the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.quoting heller.at united states staten,cir according to the court,the core right of the second amendment is the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.quoting heller.at,cert.denied.united states reese,cir t he court suggested that the core purpose of the right was to allow,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.quoting heller.at,cert.denied.it is plain that the interest hightower advances in carrying concealed weapons outside the home is distinct from this core interest emphasized in heller 
under current supreme court precedent,hightower can not make out her second amendment claim as to the concealed weapon aspect of her revoked license,as she must for her challenge to succeed.under our analysis of heller,as follows,the government may regulate the carrying of concealed weapons outside of the home.
in heller,the court explained that the right secured by the second amendment is not unlimited and noted that the majority of the courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under second amendment or state analogues.at.we have interpreted this portion of heller as stating that laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons are an example of longstanding restrictions that are presumptively lawful under the second amendment.united states rene,cir quoting heller.at see also robertson baldwin,observing that the first amendments to the c onstitution protect rights that are subject to certain exceptions and stating,in dicta,that the second amendment right is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons licensing of the carrying of concealed weapons is presumptively lawful,and hightower makes no serious argument to the contrary.
indeed,we do not understand her to make the implausible argument that the government may not,under the second amendment,ever revoke a license to carry a concealed weapon.rather,her attack is on the standard used in the revocation of her license.we detail her arguments below.
the standards for revocation of her license stem from section,which provides for revocation in two circumstances 
a license issued under this section shall be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority,or his designee,upon the occurrence of any event that would have disqualified the holder from being issued such license or from having such license renewed.a license may be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority if it appears that the holder is no longer a suitable person to possess such license.
laws ch,f.a revocation on either basis is subject to judicial review.id.
hightower attacks many provisions of the statute,but her key focus is on what she contends is the inherent subjectivity of the suitability requirement and its inadequacy as a standard.however,hightower license was not revoked because of a general finding that she was not suitable,but rather because of a particular determination that she completed the application form untruthfully.
we conclude that the revocation of a firearms license on the basis of providing false information as to the existence of pending complaints or charges on the firearms license application form is not a violation of the second amendment in this case.hightower argues that this court must apply strict scrutiny to her license revocation claim.her claim fails whatever standard of scrutiny is used,even assuming there is some second amendment interest in carrying the concealed weapons at issue.we do not reach the question of what standard of scrutiny applies here.we agree with judge wilkinson cautionary holding in united states masciandaro,cir,cert.denied,that we should not engage in answering the question of how heller applies to possession of firearms outside of the home,including as to what sliding scales of scrutiny might apply.id.at.as he said,the whole matter is a vast terra incognita that courts should enter only upon necessity and only then by small degree.id.
a requirement that firearms license applicants provide truthful information,enforced by the revocation of licenses if the applicant provides false information,serves a variety of important purposes.for one,it helps ensure the integrity of the system of keeping prohibited persons from possessing firearms.massachusetts licensing scheme prohibits certain categories of people from possessing firearms.see.law ch,d i vii.a licensing authority does not necessarily possess all of the information necessary to determine an individual eligibility.the submission of false information by an applicant could make it more difficult for the licensing authority to assess whether the applicant is eligible,submission of a false name would make it more difficult to perform a background check the prohibition of the inclusion of false information in a license application is necessary to the functioning of the licensing scheme.
the supreme court has commented on a federal prohibition on providing material false information to a licensed dealer in connection with the acquisition of firearms,saying that a 
was enacted as a means of providing adequate and truthful information about firearms transactions.information drawn from records kept by dealers was a prime guarantee of the act effectiveness in keeping these lethal weapons out of the hands of criminals,drug addicts,mentally disordered persons,juveniles,and other persons whose possession of them is too high a price in danger to us all to allow.
huddleston united states,quoting cong.rec.remarks of tydings.the same holds true for massachusetts licensing scheme.in huddleston,the defendant had been convicted of providing false information in answering a form in connection with the acquisition of a firearm the court affirmed the conviction.id.at.
a requirement that information on firearms license applications be accurate is an important government interest,and it is enforced not only by the revocation scheme.massachusetts law makes it a criminal offense to knowingly submit false information of certain types on a firearms license application.laws ch,providing a criminal penalty for anyone who gives a false or fictitious name or address or knowingly offers or gives false information concerning the date or place of birth,his citizenship status,occupation,or criminal record,in any application for any form of license or permit issued in connection with a firearm id.h providing a criminal penalty for a ny person who knowingly files an application containing false information.such provisions are commonplace in state firearms licensing regimes,particularly as to licenses to carry concealed weapons 
like the supreme court,we hold that this particular ground for unsuitability is not subjective,and it does not confer too much discretion on the licensing authority.see city of littleton,gifts d,statute providing that an adult business license shall be denied if the applicant,inter alia,provides false information is based on objective criteria thomas chi.park,statute that allows denial of a large public assembly permit based on,inter alia,the application containing a material falsehood or misrepresentation is based on reasonably specific and objective grounds.individual disputes about the accuracy of an answer may be addressed under the statute provision for judicial review,an option that hightower declined to use.
further,the particular question hightower answered inaccurately in the defendants view whether hightower had complaints or charges pending against her at the time she was a bpd officer was a material question.the existence of such complaints or charges could impact an individual suitability to possess a firearm,depending on the nature of the underlying complaints.an accurate answer to the question is important to allowing the licensing authority to investigate further and make an informed decision on the licensing application.
hightower challenge to the revocation of her unrestricted class a license fails.we turn now to her attempt to raise a facial attack 
facial attack 
hightower attempt to get a declaration of unconstitutionality of the revocation statute overreaches.hightower facial challenge,much like her challenge,focuses on the discretion conferred by the suitability requirement.the facial challenge fails for a number of reasons.
the supreme court has itself explained that 
f acial challenges are disfavored for several reasons.claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation.as a consequence,they raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.sabri united states,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.facial challenges also run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.ashwander tva,brandeis,concurring quoting liverpool,new york philadelphia commissioners of emigration.finally,facial challenges threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the constitution.we must keep in mind that a ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.ayotte planned parenthood of northern new,quoting regan time,plurality opinion.
state grange.state republican party.
for hightower facial attack to succeed,hightower would have to establish that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep.united states stevens,quoting washington glucksberg,stevens,concurring in the judgment.hightower bears the burden of demonstrating that this standard is met,and she has not and can not do so.see see also united states salerno,mccullen coakley,cir del gallo parent,cir.
hightower general attack is that the suitability requirement confers too much discretion and is not sufficently connected to a sufficient government interest.that attack does not establish that there is no plainly legitimate sweep of circumstances where an applicant may properly be denied a license on the grounds of unsuitability.our review of hightower own claim outlines one set of circumstances where the suitability requirement is clearly constitutional where false information is provided on an application form.because hightower has not shown that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,her facial attack fails.
we also note that weighing against the facial challenge is the fact that the supreme judicial court has not had the opportunity to interpret the statute in light of heller and mcdonald.the massachusetts courts have seldom had occasion to interpret the suitable person requirement the statute itself does not define what constitutes a suitable person to be issued a firearms license.laws ch,d.in a series of cases,massachusetts courts have stated that the licensing authority is given considerable latitude in determining who is a suitable person.ruggiero police comm r,accord howard chief of police,the suitable person standard vests in the chief broad discretion or considerable latitude.quoting ruggiero,at godfrey chief of police,same macnutt police comm r,noting t he broad grant of discretion implicit in a statute which lacks guidelines 
still,even before heller,massachusetts courts had recognized that the discretion vested in the licensing authority is not unlimited.see macnutt,at noting that the grant of discretion may be limited properly by judicial interpretation to measures which are not arbitrary or capricious quoting caswell licensing comm n,stavis carney,wl,at the standard for issuing licenses to carry under must be interpreted in accordance with the intent of the legislature the goal of firearms legislation in massachusetts is to limit access to deadly weapons by irresponsible persons.t he licensing authority has the authority to require an otherwise eligible applicant for a license to carry a firearm to comply with any other requirements that are reasonably related to the goal of keeping firearms out of the hands of irresponsible people.quoting ruggiero,at 
no massachusetts appellate court has construed the suitable person requirement in a published opinion or.the supreme judicial court has never construed it,save for one limited question while these considerations would not independently bar hightower facial challenge,see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,w e have never held that a federal litigant must await a construction before bringing the federal suit,they do weigh against it,see.state grange.at noting that a state had not had an opportunity to accord the law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions,and that e xercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge frees the court from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy quoting united states raines.
hightower attempts to avoid these principles by making a qualitatively different argument.hightower argues that her facial challenge should succeed under particular doctrines that were developed under the first amendment the prior restraint and overbreadth doctrines.we disagree and find these first amendment doctrines a poor analogy for purposes of facial challenges under the second amendment.
based on the prior restraint doctrine,hightower argues she may challenge the unbridled discretion conferred by the suitable person requirement regardless of the facts that she did not apply for another license and that the suitability requirement was constitutionally applied to her.
under the first amendment,when a licensing statute allegedly vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity,one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first applying for,and being denied,a license.city of lakewood,at.such f acial attacks on the discretion granted a decisionmaker are not dependent on the facts surrounding any particular permit decision and may be brought regardless of whether the government official has exercised his discretion in an impermissible fashion.forsyth county nationalist movement.
that rationale is particular to the first amendment a t the root of this long line of precedent is the knowledge that in the area of free expression a licensing statute placing unbridled discretion in the hands of a government official or agency constitutes a prior restraint and may result in censorship.city of lakewood,at emphasis added.the court has that there are two major first amendment risks associated with unbridled licensing schemes by speakers in order to avoid being denied a license to speak and the difficulty of effectively detecting,reviewing,and correcting censorship as applied without standards by which to measure the licensor action.id.at.it is only when statutes threaten these risks to a significant degree that courts must entertain an immediate facial attack on the law.id.the court made clear that for a facial challenge to be proper,t he law must have a close enough nexus to expression,or to conduct commonly associated with expression,to pose a real and substantial threat of the identified censorship risks.id.the prior restraint doctrine is specific to the first amendment and stems from the substantive first amendment restrictions.see generally monaghan,first amendment due process,harv,like the substantive rules themselves,insensitive procedures can chill the right of free expression.the prior restraint doctrine is not a label that may be attached to allow any facial challenge,whatever the constitutional ground.
other courts,at the district court level,agree.see woollard sheridan,no.l,wl,at,to be published in d rejecting the argument that a licensing scheme amounts to an unconstitutional prior restraint on the exercise of plaintiff second amendment rights because it vests unbridled discretion in the officials responsible for issuing permits,in part because this court would be hesitant to import constitutional doctrine wholesale from one field of law into another for which it was never designed piszczatoski filko,d,rejecting the argument that a statute is invalid under the second amendment if it vests uncontrolled discretion,in part because t he general rule is that facial challenges are disfavored.it is only in light of particular censorship related concerns that they have been permitted in the first amendment context where the licensing scheme vests unbridled discretion in the decisionmaker and where the regulation is challenged as overbroad.quoting.city of dallas,kachalsky,d at rejecting the argument that a statute is invalid based on analogy to first amendment cases prohibiting unbridled discretion in granting permits,and explaining that while some second amendment cases borrow an analytical framework,they do not apply substantive first amendment rules in the second amendment context.we have found no circuit cases that have discussed the prior restraint doctrine in the context of the second amendment.
hightower second argument based on the overbreadth doctrine fails for similar reasons.the overbreadth doctrine is a second type of facial challenge,under which a law may be invalidated under the first amendment as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.stevens.at quoting.state grange.at internal quotation marks omitted.an overbreadth challenge essentially argues that a statute could not be enforced against a plaintiff,because it could not be enforced against someone else.sabri united states.
the supreme court has cautioned courts against allowing overbreadth challenges outside of certain limited contexts 
facial challenges of this sort are especially to be discouraged.not only do they invite judgments on records,but they entail a further departure from the norms of adjudication in federal courts overbreadth challenges call for relaxing familiar requirements of standing,to allow a determination that the law would be unconstitutionally applied to different parties and different circumstances from those at hand.see,chicago morales,plurality opinion.accordingly,we have recognized the validity of facial attacks alleging overbreadth though not necessarily using that term in relatively few settings,and,generally,on the strength of specific reasons weighty enough to overcome our reticence.see,broadrick oklahoma,free speech aptheker secretary of state,right to travel stenberg carhart,abortion city of boerne flores,legislation under of the fourteenth amendment outside these limited settings,and absent a good reason,we do not extend an invitation to bring overbreadth claims.
hightower argues that heller was an instance where the court struck down broad prohibitions on second amendment rights that could be validly applied to dangerous people,and so implicitly recognized an overbreadth doctrine in the second amendment context.we disagree.
heller involved a challenge to a total ban on handgun possession in the home,brought by an individual whose attempt to register the handgun was denied based on this ban.heller.at.that was not an overbreadth challenge heller argument was that the total ban was unconstitutional,including as applied to his registration attempt.
we reject the overbreadth argument in light of sabri our view is joined by every court to have expressly considered the issue.see united states decastro,cir holding that t here is no overbreadth argument that decastro can make in the second amendment context,and so,since his challenge failed,the facial challenge must necessarily fail as well masciandaro,at declining to entertain the novel notion that an overbreadth challenge could be recognized outside the first amendment context,and rejecting a facial challenge on the basis that the challenge failed barton,at rejecting facial challenge under the second amendment because we do not recognize an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment united states skoien,cir en banc noting that the court has allowed overbreadth arguments when dealing with laws that restrict speech,but that the salerno formulation governs other contexts,cert.denied.united states weaver,cr,wl,at,a party challenging the validity of a law on vagueness or overbreadth grounds outside the domain of the first amendment must demonstrate that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.richards county of yolo,d,rejecting attempt to import doctrines from the first amendment context kachalsky,d at rejecting application of overbreadth doctrine where second amendment claim fails see also united states tooley,wl,at cir,per curiam tooley also made a facial challenge to g in his motion to dismiss the indictment and continues the argument on appeal.however,to prevail on a facial challenge,tooley must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.by finding the statute valid as applied to th is plaintiff,the facial challenge fails as well.alterations in original quoting urofsky gilmore,cir.
the facial attack fails.
equal protection claim 
hightower advances an equal protection claim in a cursory fashion,stating that the revocation of her license violated equal protection for the same reasons as advanced in support of her second amendment claim.even were this claim not waived it fails on its own terms 
given that the second amendment challenge fails,the equal protection claim is subject to rational basis review.see nordyke king,cir en banc as to the plaintiffs equal protection claim,because the ordinance does not classify shows or events on the basis of a suspect class,and because we hold that the ordinance does not violate either the first or second amendments,rational basis scrutiny applies.kwong.bloomberg,civ.jgk,wl,at,to be published in d rational basis review is the appropriate standard of scrutiny to apply to penal law because the law involves no suspect classification and imposes no burden on the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.footnote omitted locke davey,because we hold that the program is not a violation of the free exercise clause,however,we apply scrutiny to plaintiff equal protection claims.mcguire reilly,cir where statute satisfies first amendment review,it necessarily passes the rational basis test employed under the equal protection clause.for the reasons given above as to why hightower claim fails,the license revocation survives rational basis review under the equal protection clause.
procedural due process claim 
hightower procedural due process claim is that the bpd was required to give her a hearing before it revoked her license and that the availability of postdeprivation relief is inadequate.
we will assume hightower has a property interest in her class a weapon license although she may be eligible for other licenses.in united states rehlander,cir,we said 
t he right to possess arms among those not properly disqualified is no longer something that can be withdrawn by government on a permanent and irrevocable basis without due process.ordinarily,to work a permanent or prolonged loss of a constitutional liberty or property interest,an adjudicatory hearing,including a right to offer and test evidence if facts are in dispute,is required.
id.at.rehlander,however,did not concern licenses to carry concealed weapons,much less large capacity weapons,but a disqualification from possession of firearms at all.
the parties dispute whether the deprivation here is either permanent or irrevocable.after all,as defendants argue,if all hightower wants is to carry a small weapon the revolver which she had been carrying,she may apply for a class b license.
we take the case as it comes to us,as a ripe case on a record of actual deprivation from the revocation of her class a license.we also assume,in hightower favor,that she does have some second amendment interests arising from the revocation of her license.we avoid these underlying questions and assume the requirements of due process apply.
hightower primary argument as to why due process was not provided to her is that she was entitled to a predeprivation hearing before her license was revoked and before her gun was required to be turned over to the licensing authority.in support of this point,she also asserts that the postdeprivation process available was inadequate.we reject her claim.
predeprivation process 
under the massachusetts licensing scheme,before a license may be revoked,the licensing authority must determine that there was an occurrence of any event that would have disqualified the holder from being issued such license or from having such license renewed,or that it appears that the holder is no longer a suitable person to possess such license.laws ch,f.the statute provides that a ny revocation or suspension of a license shall be in writing and shall state the reasons therefor.id.it is undisputed that this requirement was complied with here.
we reject hightower claim that due process required that a hearing take place before her license could be revoked.the predeprivation process provided here was constitutionally adequate,when considered in conjunction with the available postdeprivation process.the supreme court has recognized,on many occasions,that where a state must act quickly,or where it would be impractical to provide predeprivation process,postdeprivation process satisfies the requirements of the due process clause.gilbert homar.we have explained that t he variety of circumstances within which the exception to the general requirement of predeprivation process has been recognized demonstrates that the exception is a flexible one.san gerónimo caribe project,acevedo vilá,wl,at cir.july,to be published in en banc omission and second alteration in original quoting elena municipality of san juan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has explained that p rotection of the health and safety of the public is a paramount governmental interest which justifies summary administrative action.indeed,deprivation of property to protect the public health and safety is one of the oldest examples of permissible summary action.hodel.surface mining reclamation ass n,second alteration in original quoting ewing mytinger casselberry,see also san gerónimo,wl,at.the court has traditionally accorded the states great leeway in adopting summary procedures to protect public health and safety.mackey montrym,upholding statutory scheme providing for summary suspension of a driver license if a driver suspected of being intoxicated refuses to take a breathalyzer test.in such circumstances,full predeprivation process is not required so long as prompt postdeprivation review is available for correction of administrative error.id.at.
the revocation of a firearms license,particularly a license to carry a concealed,large capacity weapon,without a predeprivation hearing is justified by concerns as to public health and safety see kuck danaher,cir connecticut clearly has a strong and compelling interest in ensuring that firearm permits are not issued to those lacking the essential character or temperament necessary to be entrusted with a weapon.quoting dwyer farrell,spinelli city of new york,cir holding that predeprivation process was not required to suspend gun dealer license where there were security lapses at the gun store,given the interest in public safety hain deleo,cv,wl,at,rejecting the claim that revocation of a firearms license requires a predeprivation hearing,in part because the state interest in protecting the public safety through the enforcement of licensure requirements is compelling a predeprivation hearing would significantly burden the state interest in quickly removing licenses from individuals who prove to be dangerous after their license has been issued thomson bd.of firearms permit exam rs,no,wl,at,holding that no predeprivation hearing need be held to revoke a pistol permit,in part because,given the nature of weapons and their potential for inflicting harm or causing death,recognition of a right to continue to carry a weapon between the time that evidence of unsuitability arises and completion of notice and a hearing would impose a great risk to the public whose interests the government must protect rabbitt leonard,holding that,while the connecticut constitution provides a right to bear arms which must be protected by procedural due process,predeprivation process for revoking a pistol permit is not required,in part because t he summary nature of a pistol permit revocation is vital to protect the public safety.a permittee who is,in fact,unfit to carry a pistol could conceivably do a great deal of harm if given advance notice that his permit might be revoked it could even result in the loss of human life.the risk is too great.
to the extent that hightower separately argues that she was entitled to a hearing before surrendering her firearm itself,the argument fails because hightower could have retained her firearm had she appealed the revocation of her license.the revocation statute provides that u pon revocation or suspension,the licensing authority shall take possession of such license and the person whose license is so revoked or suspended shall take all actions required under the provisions of section.no appeal or motion shall operate to stay such revocation or suspension.laws ch,f.the license revocation letter hightower received stated that hightower shall,in accordance with,without delay,deliver or surrender to the licensing authority where you reside your licenses to carry,and all firearms.section,in turn,provides that u pon revocation of any firearms license if a firearms identification card is not then in force the person whose application was so revoked shall without delay deliver or surrender,to the licensing authority where he resides,all firearms which he then possesses unless an appeal is pending.id.emphasis added.the supreme judicial court has noted that under,the obligation to turn over the firearms is suspended during the pendency of such an appeal.pasqualone gately,
postdeprivation process 
as to postdeprivation process,the statute provides that if a license is suspended or revoked,the aggrieved individual may file a petition to obtain judicial review in the district court within ninety days after receiving notice of the revocation or suspension.laws ch,f.the statute requires the district court to hold a hearing before making a determination as to the licensing decision,and the massachusetts courts,before heller,interpreted the statute as requiring an evidentiary hearing.godfrey,at see also moyer,at.after such a hearing,a justice of the reviewing court may direct that a license be issued or reinstated to the petitioner if such justice finds that there was no reasonable ground for denying,suspending or revoking such license and the that petitioner is not prohibited by law from possessing same.laws ch,f.this provision has been interpreted,in cases,as placing the burden of proof on the applicant to show that the licensing authority decision was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.howard,at quoting moyer,at internal quotation mark omitted see also godfrey,at stating same standard ruggiero,at same.further judicial review may be had in an action in the nature of certiorari under.laws ch.levine,d at.
hightower only argument as to why these postdeprivation procedures are inadequate is that the standard of review places the burden of proof on the individual challenging the revocation.hightower failed to develop the argument or cite to any pertinent authority in her opening brief,so this claim is waived.see united states berk,cir issues not developed in the opening brief are waived,cert.denied.
we also reject the notion that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,in conjunction with an evidentiary hearing where the aggrieved individual may introduce evidence to demonstrate that the licensing decision was erroneous,renders the postdeprivation judicial process inadequate.the arbitrary and capricious standard of review is widely accepted in the context of reviewing agency action.see,a.and,unlike typical administrative review provisions,the massachusetts statute allows the aggrieved individual to introduce new evidence before the reviewing court as to the licensing authority determination.see stavis,wl,at in one respect,the nature of the judicial review available in the district court under,is clearly broader than the review available under massachusetts general administrative review provision because the district court is authorized to the facts found by the licensing authority and find facts.
in addition,the supreme court has explained that o utside the criminal law area,where special concerns attend,the locus of the burden of persuasion is normally not an issue of federal constitutional moment.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,alteration in original quoting lavine milne,internal quotation marks omitted.the massachusetts legislature could have reasonably concluded that,on review in the district court,the burden should be placed on the aggrieved individual,who would be in the best position to present relevant evidence as to the suitability requirement.we reject hightower claim that the revocation scheme violates procedural due process.
we affirm the district court entry of judgment against hightower.
the massachusetts licensing scheme defines a firearm as a pistol,revolver or other weapon of any description with a barrel of less than inches in length.laws ch.

the ordinary application form contains the question are you now under any charge s for any offense s against the law hightower answered no to this question.the defendants do not claim that this answer was inaccurate or untruthful.
the statute only prevents the holder of a class b license from carry ing or possess ing a loaded firearm in a concealed manner in any public way or place.laws ch,b emphasis added.
hightower asserts that the boston police apparently do not issue unrestricted class b licenses to openly carry revolvers and other capacity handguns,and so,de facto,the only way for her to carry a firearm,openly or not,outside her home is with an unrestricted class a cites no authority for this proposition,aside from certain comments that do not address the matter made by defense counsel at a hearing.the statute itself only provides that class b licenses shall not entitle the holder thereof to carry or possess a loaded firearm in a concealed manner in any public way or place.laws ch,b emphasis added.the defendants claim that a class b license is sufficient to keep a regular capacity firearm,rifle,or shotgun in one home or to carry it openly in public.the defendants also point out that hightower could apply for a restricted class a license that would allow her to carry a firearm in public.
