this appeal involves a discovery dispute between bnsf railway company and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees regarding disclosure obligations under the parties collective bargaining agreement.an article in the collective bargaining agreement provided benefits to furloughed employees if their furloughs were a direct result of increased subcontracting.the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees filed claims under this article that were sent to an arbitration board.the board ordered bnsf railway company to produce certain information regarding its subcontracting expenses,but the parties failed to reach an agreement on the confidentiality of the materials to be produced.the board then sustained the claims based on bnsf railway company failure to turn over the information.the district court vacated the award,finding that the board acted outside the scope of its jurisdiction in directing the production of these documents.the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees appealed the district court judgment to this court.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment insofar as it vacated the award issued by the board,we reverse the district court judgment insofar as it failed to remand the case to the board,and we remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand to the arbitration board for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe and bnsf railway company bnsf are parties to a collective bargaining agreement the cba.during negotiations of the cba,a stalemate was reached on the issue of subcontracting,and the matter was submitted to presidential emergency board the peb.the peb suggested a compromise that the parties adopted verbatim as article xv of the cba 
the amount of subcontracting of a carrier,measured by the ratio of adjusted engineering department purchased services such services reduced by costs not related to contracting to the total engineering department budget for the period,will not be increased without employee protective consequences.in the event that subcontracting increases beyond that level,any employee covered by this agreement who is furloughed as a direct result of such increased subcontracting shall be provided new york dock level protection.
thus,article xv requires a claimant to establish two elements a present subcontracting level that exceeds the base level of allowable subcontracting and that his furlough was a direct result of this increased subcontracting.
almost immediately after the cba became effective,the parties began disputing the content and frequency of the documentation that bnsf was required to produce in connection with article xv.bnsf wanted to produce only its reports,which are public records that it files annually with the surface transportation board.bmwe demanded reports that were more detailed and produced on a monthly basis 
in,bmwe began filing grievances against bnsf under article xv on behalf of furloughed workers.bnsf admitted that these workers had been furloughed.however,it argued that bmwe had not shown that subcontracting had increased beyond the level allowed by article xv or that the furloughs were a direct result of such increased subcontracting.bmwe then requested that bnsf produce more detailed information regarding both the base and current levels of subcontracting.
when bnsf refused to produce this information,the claims were sent to arbitration before the national railroad adjustment board the nrab.on may,the nrab issued an award directing bnsf to turn over the source documents used to compile the summary reports for and provide monthly data for the period the award in reaching this conclusion,the nrab emphasized that i bnsf had relied upon its records as a defense to bmwe claim that it had increased subcontracting levels,ii bnsf then refused to allow bmwe to see the source documents for the summaries that bnsf had been relying upon,and iii bnsf then took the position that bmwe had not provided supporting evidence to substantiate its claim.under those circumstances,the nrab held that bnsf was obligated to allow bmwe to inspect the source documents used by bnsf in formulating the summaries that bnsf used in defending the claims.the nrab also noted that the benefits referred to in article xv,new york dock benefits are calculated in monthly increments and,therefore,bnsf subcontracting data should be presented on a monthly basis.
the nrab did not provide any detailed instruction on the method of disclosure,who would be allowed to access the documents,or to what extent bnsf could protect the privacy of its business records.instead,the nrab remanded the matter to the parties to take action consistent with the terms of the award.it specifically noted that it had not made any findings on whether bmwe had shown that the employees were furloughed as a direct result of the increased subcontracting.finally,the nrab stated that it would sustain the claims based on an adverse inference drawn against bnsf if it failed to comply with the terms of the award.
bnsf refused to turn over the source documents without a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit bmwe from using the information for any purpose other than the prosecution of claims.bmwe would not enter into any confidentiality agreement that would make it liable for monetary damages in the event of disclosure.after the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a confidentiality agreement,bnsf sought an interpretation of the award from the nrab in order to ascertain definitive limits on the types of documents that should be made available on a going forward basis and to reach an understanding about exactly what showing would be necessary to comply with this award.on june,the nrab issued interpretation,which denied bnsf request for an interpretation because bnsf had not requested an actual interpretation but rather an advisory opinion.the nrab gave the parties sixty days to establish their own production procedures and any accompanying confidentiality agreements.if the parties were unable to reach an agreement,the nrab indicated that it would make a decision on whether bnsf had fulfilled its obligations under the award and whether the claims should be sustained.
bnsf made a second request for an interpretation of the award,asking the nrab to determine which of the parties competing confidentiality agreements should be signed.on december,the nrab entered interpretation,sustaining bmwe claims based on the negative inference that had bnsf produced the information sought by bmwe,that information would have supported bmwe position.as was the case with the award,there was no finding in interpretation on whether bmwe had shown that the employees were furloughed as a direct result of the subcontracting.
on january,bnsf appealed the award to the united states district court for the northern district of texas.the district court granted bnsf motion for summary judgment and vacated the award,holding that the nrab failed to interpret the cba and instead added new terms to the cba based on its own notions of industrial justice.bnsf ry.of maint.of way employees,d,holding that the nrab discovery mandate certainly did not draw its essence from the cba.

under the railway labor act the rla,minor disputes involving the interpretation of terms in an existing collective bargaining as the dispute in this be resolved through binding arbitration before the nrab or another adjustment board.see consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d.these arbitration remedies were intended by congress to be the complete and final means for settling minor disputes.of locomotive eng rs louisville nashville,d discussing union pac.price,d see also union pac.sheehan,d congress considered it essential to keep these minor disputes within the adjustment board and out of the courts.the effectiveness of the adjustment board in fulfilling its task depends on the finality of its determinations.citation omitted.accordingly,the federal courts do not sit as super arbitration tribunals in suits brought to enforce awards of the adjustment board.they may not substitute their judgments for those of the board divisions.diamond terminal ry.state docks,cir see also united paperworkers int l union misco,d courts thus do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.
we have described the scope of our review of nrab awards as among the narrowest known to the law.diamond,at.the findings of the nrab are conclusive,and we review only for failure to comply with the rla failure to conform or confine itself to matters within its jurisdiction and fraud or corruption.q.absent one of these,the award is binding upon the parties and the findings and order are conclusive in court.air lines,transp.workers union,cir the nrab interpretation must stand unless we find it to be wholly baseless and completely without reason.id.quoting gunther san diego.ry,d.
b.the nrab ignored an element of article xv by sustaining the claims without making a finding on whether the furloughs were a direct result of increased subcontracting.
after describing the base level of subcontracting,article xv states that i n the event that subcontracting increases beyond that level,any employee covered by this agreement who is furloughed as a direct result of such increased subcontracting shall be provided new york dock level protection.the plain meaning of article xv requires a claimant to prove that the increased subcontracting was the cause of his furlough.as reflected in the district court opinion,the award discusses the need to make a finding on this second element 
specifically,we express no opinion on whether the claimant was furloughed as a direct result of such subcontracting indeed,if there was no increased subcontracting as contemplated by article xv,because this claim seeks protective benefits for the claimant,then the question of whether the claimant is entitled to those benefits is moot.
it follows from this quotation that if subcontracting had increased,then the nrab would have to reach the causation element before determining whether the claims should be sustained.the award later threatens that s hould bnsf fail to make that source information available,we will sustain the claim.the nrab did precisely that in interpretation it drew an adverse inference from bnsf failure to comply with the award and sustained the claims without making any finding as to whether the employees furloughs were a direct result of the inferred increase in subcontracting.
the logic supporting the adverse inference rule is that a party fails to produce evidence in its control in order to conceal adverse facts.there is no necessary connection between the contents of the source documents which relate only to subcontracting expenses and the causal relationship with a claimant furlough.see transcon.gas pipe line mobile drilling barge,cir holding that a party who benefits from an adverse inference must still establish the remaining elements of a tort claim.thus,assuming that the nrab was correct in drawing an adverse inference against bnsf,that inference only established that subcontracting had increased and not that the furloughs were a direct result of that increased subcontracting.
we have previously held that an arbitration panel exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction if it ignores an explicit term in a cba.see cont l airlines,at noting that an interpretation which reads out a phrase from an agreement can not be an arguable construction of the agreement.by not making any finding as to the necessary element of causation,the nrab essentially ignored a term of the cba.accordingly,sustaining the claims without any finding as to the second element of article xv was wholly baseless and without reason and not an interpretation of the cba for this reason,the award should be vacated and the claims remanded to the nrab.
c.the nrab acted within its jurisdiction in directing bnsf to produce the source documents.
the role of the arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the cba he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice.united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.the supreme court has explained that 
t he arbitrator award settling a dispute with respect to the interpretation or application of a labor agreement must draw its essence from the contract and can not simply reflect the arbitrator own notions of industrial justice.but as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.
misco,at.see also cont l airlines,at noting that an award must be grounded in the cba of locomotive eng rs atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir the test is not error it is ultra vires.in drawing on the essence of the contract,the nrab is not limited to interpreting the explicit language in the cba,but can look to implied terms as well as the parties practice,usage,and custom.of ry.carmen atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir citing consol.rail,at.
in concluding that the nrab acted outside of its jurisdiction,the district court noted that the cba does not include any language regarding the production of data under article xv.bnsf,d at.because the cba is silent on bnsf obligation to turn over such information,the district court concluded that the nrab added a new term to the cba.id.holding that the absence of a term means that only the parties,and not the nrab,can resolve that issue.
the district court also gave significant consideration to norfolk western railway company transportation communications international union,cir.in norfolk western,the collective bargaining agreement contained a clause stating that the arbitration board shall have authority to request the production of additional evidence from any party.id.at.the arbitration board acknowledged that the power to request was not the same as the power to compel the production of documents,but concluded that it could draw an adverse inference from the carrier failure to comply with its request.id.at.based on that adverse inference,the arbitration board sustained the union claim id.
the district court differentiated norfolk western based on the fact that the cba in this case did not have a clause allowing the nrab to request the production of documents.bnsf,d at the fourth circuit concluded that the action of the board was within the board jurisdiction because of the special provision in the contract.in other words,the district court assumed that,but for the agreement expressly granting the arbitration board the power to request documents,the board would not have been acting within its jurisdiction.although in part supra we have agreed that the claims should not have been sustained,we disagree with the district court interpretation of norfolk western and the remainder of its analysis.
the district court too literally interprets norfolk western to mean that the nrab power to direct the production of documents can exist only incidental to an express clause in the cba.its ruling is based on the premise that it was not possible for the nrab to have been arguably construing or applying the contract unless there was explicit language describing either the parties duty to produce documents or the nrab power to request production.this ruling does not give sufficient deference to the nrab.
the nrab acts within its jurisdiction so long as its decision is drawn from the essence of the cba.see misco,at.the essence of the cba includes not just the express language contained within the four corners of the document,but also implied terms and the parties practice,usage,and custom.of ry.carmen,at citing consol.rail,at.under the district court analysis,the nrab lacked authority to direct the production of documents because there was no express provis
