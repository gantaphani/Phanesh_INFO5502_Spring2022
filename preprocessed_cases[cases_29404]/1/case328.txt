this appeal has many of the characteristics of a civics lesson.one principal characteristic is that it offers a window on the interaction of the three branches that comprise our tripartite system of government.the lesson began when the legislative a consumer protection statute.it continued when the executive the person of the secretary of agriculture the secretary promulgated implementing regulations under that statute.it soon implicated the judicial branch,where this court ultimately passed upon the validity of the regulations and found that some of them conflicted with the plain language of the statute.
that was not the end of the lesson congress,apprised of our decision,amended the statute in an obvious effort to save some of the challenged regulations.it now falls to us to determine whether the amended statute and the original regulations can coexist.
the specifics of the situation are easily summarized.in harvey veneman,cir harvey i,we reviewed several regulations promulgated by the secretary under the organic foods production act ofpa.we declared a number of those regulations invalid and gave others limiting constructions.congress responded to this opinion by passing a series of amendments to the ofpa.the central issue in this appeal involves the extent to which those amendments vitiate our earlier invalidation of two such regulations.
background 
the ofpa establishes a national certification program for producers and handlers of organic products and regulates the labeling of such products.see a,a a.as a general matter,an agricultural product must be produced and handled without the use of synthetic substances in order to be labeled or sold as organic.see id.nevertheless,the ofpa contemplates that there will be a national list through which substances can be approved for use in organic products.id.the statute specifies the types of substances that can be included on the national list and limns a procedure for obtaining inclusion of substances.see id.it also authorizes the secretary to promulgate implementing regulations.id.
in december of,the secretary published a final rule pursuant to that power.see pt.arthur harvey took umbrage with various aspects of the final rule,which he viewed as overly tolerant of substances.thus,in,he filed suit in maine federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the administrative procedure act.
the appellant complaint alleged that several provisions of the final rule were inconsistent with the ofpa and impermissibly diluted its organic standard.the only claims relevant to this appeal are those embodied in count.that count alleged that two sections of the final rule,b and b contravened ofpa a by too freely permitting the use of synthetic substances in the processing of organic foods.
for present purposes,the travel of the case in the district court is of no moment.what happened on appeal is,however,of decretory significance.there,we agreed with the appellant as to the gist of count and invalidated both of the challenged regulations.see harvey i,at.we based this decision on our interpretation of ofpa a,which we described as a general prohibition against adding synthetic ingredients in handling operations.id.at.in rejecting the secretary argument that the national list provision authorized the agency to create such exemptions,we noted that section c b iii allowed inclusion on the national list of an otherwise prohibited substance for use in handling only if the substance was.id.this led to the conclusion that section c b iii simply did not say what the secretary need ed it to say.id.because the regulations challenged in count were contrary to the plain language of the ofpa,we ruled that the secretary had exceeded her statutory authority.id.at.
on remand,the parties agreed upon a consent decree and final judgment,which the district court entered on june.the judgment purposed to remand the matter to the secretary to conduct notice and comment rulemaking and to publish in the federal register final rules implementing the court order with regard to count.the judgment gave the secretary a period within which to develop new regulations.
before the secretary took responsive action,congress intervened.in november of,congress amended the ofpa.see,stat,hereinafter amendments.in so doing,it added language to section authorizing the use in handling operations of synthetic ingredients appearing on the national list congress simultaneously modified section in two respects.first,it changed the subtitle of section c to clarify that the national list relates to processing and handling as well as to production second,it eliminated subsection c b iii,the provision that we had singled out as limiting the inclusion of substances used in handling to.see harvey i,at.no legislative history accompanied these alterations.finally,congress directed the secretary to prepare a report detailing the impact of harvey i and describing whether restoring ofpa regulatory scheme to its i status would negatively impact farmers,processors,or consumers.amendments,stat.at.
the secretary proceeded to revise the final rule to comply with other aspects of the judgment in harvey see.june.with regard to the subject matter of count,however,the secretary stated 
congress amended the ofpa by permitting the addition of synthetic substances appearing on the national list for use in products labeled organic.the amendment restores the nop regulation for organic processed products containing at least percent organic ingredients on the national list and their ability to carry the usda seal.therefore,the usda is not revising the nop regulations to prohibit the use of synthetic ingredients in processed products labeled as organic nor restrict these products eligibility to carry the usda seal.
this statement displeased the appellant.on june,he asked the district court to enforce the judgment count.the secretary opposed this motion and for relief from the judgment.the essence of the secretary position was that the amendments had made any revisions to the regulations in question unnecessary.
the district court denied the appellant motion to enforce and granted the secretary for relief from judgment.harvey johanns,d harvey ii.this timely appeal ensued.the amici,whose assistance we appreciate,have filed a brief in support of the secretary position.
ii.standard of review 
typically,we would review both a motion to enforce a judgment and a motion for relief from judgment for abuse of discretion.see,mcdowell phila.hous,cir motion to enforce a judgment honneus donovan,cir motion for relief from judgment.in this instance,however,the main issue on appeal concerns whether the two count regulations invalidated in harvey i have been salvaged by the amendments.that issue turns on a question of statutory interpretation,involving the significance and effect of the amendments.thus,appellate review is de novo.see united states leahy,cir bonano carib.airline,cir.if the statute is found to be unclear,however,an inquiring court should defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir.
there is a second issue bound up in this issue that involves the scope of the final judgment.thus,whether to enforce the judgment on this ground turns entirely on a question of law concerning the scope of the judgment itself.consequently,we employ de novo review as to that issue as well.see fafel dipaola,cir goya foods,wallack mgmt,cir explaining that an error of law is the functional equivalent of an abuse of discretion.
iii.the effect of the amendments 
we begin this segment of our analysis by revisiting the procedural posture in which this appeal arises.after our decision in harvey i,the district court entered a final judgment.final is a relative term even though a judgment is denominated as final,a court may grant relief from it in a variety of circumstances.one such circumstance is when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.b.thus,when subsequent legislation effects a change in the applicable law,a judgment,legally correct when entered,may become i
