petitioner abou kane,a native of senegal unlawfully present in the united states,seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals the bia reversing a decision of the immigration judge the ij that had granted kane application for withholding of removal.the bia rejected kane derivative claims grounded in allegations that his minor would be subjected to female genital mutilation fgm when they accompany him and his wife to senegal.agreeing with the bia that,under the current state of the law,kane derivative claim for withholding of removal is not cognizable and that we lack jurisdiction to consider his asylum claim,we deny review.
facts and proceedings 
kane first entered the united states in,staying for approximately months before leaving for gabon,where he operated a clothing business.in,kane illegally the united states,followed shortly thereafter by his wife,whom he had married two years earlier.they now have five children,including two daughters who are under ten years old and hold birthright citizenship of the united states.
in,the department of homeland security dhs commenced proceedings against kane by issuing a notice to appear,charging him with removability pursuant to a a i i.following a hearing on that charge,the ij found that kane removability had been established by clear and convincing evidence.after kane declined to specify a country for removal,the ij designated kane native senegal as the removal country.
kane then filed an application for cancellation of removal,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.he claimed to be seeking to remain in the united states because his minor daughters would be subjected to fgm if he were removed to senegal.
during a subsequent hearing before the ij,kane testified that he,his wife,and his daughters are all members of the fulani tribe,which practices fgm.kane stated that,because he would be unable to earn enough money in senegal to support his family in the united states,his wife and daughters would have to accompany him if he were removed.according to kane,he would be helpless to prevent members of his tribe from subjecting his minor daughters to fgm once they were in senegal.as evidence of the risk to his daughters,kane testified that his relatives recently requested that he bring the girls to senegal for the express purpose of fgm.when questioned whether he feared for his own safety,kane replied that his family members and fellow tribesmen would likely humiliate him for opposing fgm,but that he did not believe that he would be beaten or physically tortured for his opposition,insisting that his primary concern was for his young daughters health and.
kane wife also testified at the hearing,explaining that,like her mother and sisters,she had been subjected to fgm as a young girl and had suffered serious negative health effects,including complications in giving birth.kane testified that the fulani tribal edict of fgm is so deeply ingrained that,if she and her daughters followed her husband to senegal,it would only be a matter of time before one of her or her husband perform fgm on her daughters,regardless where in senegal the kane family might choose to live or how vocal their opposition might be.
the ij granted kane application for withholding of removal but dismissed his cat claim as moot and did not address asylum.finding that both kane and his wife were credible witnesses,the ij concluded that,if kane were removed to senegal,members of the fulani tribe would likely take any steps necessary to ensure that his young daughters were subjected to fgm.the ij reasoned further that kane himself would likely suffer persecution for his opposition to fgm if he attempted to prevent tribal elders from subjecting his daughters to the process.citing humanitarian grounds as an additional basis for granting kane request,the ij explained that it is,quite frankly,difficult for this court to expose two young citizens to this practice,simply because their parents were not of status in this country.
the dhs appealed the ij decision to the bia,framing the issue on appeal as whether an alien father may succeed on a derivative withholding claim based on a fear that his minor be subjected to fgm if the father were removed to his native country.the dhs advocated reversal of the ij decision on the grounds that the immigration and nationality act ina does not authorize derivative claims for withholding of removal,and the practice of fgm was in decline,as evidenced by the senegalese government criminalizing fgm and providing for terms of up to five years imprisonment for anyone who either directly commits the offense or orders it committed against a third person.
in kane brief on appeal to the bia,he insisted that,although the ij had correctly granted withholding of removal,he had failed to consider whether kane is also eligible for asylum in addition to his eligibility for withholding of removal.kane contended that,if removed to senegal,he would be subject to persecution as a member of a social group of parents of minor daughters of the fulani tribe who have not had fgm,and who oppose the practice,as a result of his political and religious opposition to fgm,and by having to endure his daughters fgm.kane urged that if it deemed the ij withholding of removal to be in error,the bia should not order him removed but should remand the case to the ij for a determination regarding kane claims for asylum and relief under cat.
the bia reversed the ij order and directed that kane be removed from the united states in holding that kane could not establish eligibility for withholding of removal based solely on the fear that his daughters would be forced to undergo fgm in senegal,the bia determined,inter alia,that the ina does not authorize derivative claims for withholding of removal,kane had not established that he himself would be persecuted or tortured as a result of his opposition to the practice of fgm,kane daughters,as united states citizens,could remain safely in the united states in the custody of their mother or a guardian ad litem after kane removal,and if kane daughters did accompany him to senegal,the family could likely prevent the girls from being subjected to fgm by settling in an area of relative safety.the bia also declined to remand to the ij for further consideration,ruling instead that kane cat claim failed because he did not allege that he had been tortured in the past or had a reasonable fear of torture in the future,and kane had waived any right to seek asylum by failing timely to raise the issue before the ij.
in addition to petitioning this court for review of the bia removal decision,kane asked the bia to reconsider its rejection of his asylum application as untimely,contending that he had failed to raise the issue of asylum during the proceedings before the ij because he had mistakenly believed that he was ineligible to do so.kane insists that the ij was obligated to inform him that he might be eligible for asylum,and that the failure to do so entitles kane to apply for asylum now.the bia denied reconsideration of kane asylum claim,and he did not seek review of that denial in his petition to us.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when the bia conducts a de novo review of the record evidence and does not adopt any part of the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision for review of orders of removal under the ina,the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.we review factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record the substantial evidence standard requires only that the bia conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.we will reverse the bia only when the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find in favor of the petitioner we may not reverse merely because we would have decided the case differently.
before reaching the merits of kane petition for review,we must first address any jurisdictional problems that it raises.in his brief to us,kane he did to the bia in his motion for the ij had a duty under c to inform him that he was apparently eligible to apply for asylum.according to kane,the ij failure to inform him of his apparent eligibility entitles him to apply for asylum now.in response,the dhs contends that we lack jurisdiction to resolve this issue because kane did not raise it before the bia in his direct appeal,and that only matters addressed in that direct appeal are properly before us for review at this time.
we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal judicial review of such an order is only available,however,if the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies of right failure to exhaust an issue through administrative proceedings creates a jurisdictional bar,preventing our review of that issue an alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.when a petitioner seeks to raise a claim not presented to the bia and the claim is one that the bia has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy,the petitioner must raise the issue in a motion to reopen prior to resorting to review by the courts.
in kane brief on direct appeal to the bia,he contended that the ij had correctly granted withholding of removal but had erroneously failed to consider the merits of his asylum claim as well.kane claimed that he qualifies for asylum because,if removed,he would suffer persecution consisting of emotional and economic suffering resulting from his daughters being subjected to fgm,and constant harassment from family and tribal members for his religious and political opposition to fgm.critically,however,kane failed to raise his apparent eligibility argument to the bia on direct appeal.it was not until kane filed his motion for reconsideration that he asserted to the bia that the ij failure to inform him of his apparent eligibility for asylum should excuse his tardiness in applying.in the absence of that argument,the bia ruled that kane had waived any claim he might have to asylum by not timely raising the issue before the ij as kane petition for review does not raise the bia subsequent denial of reconsideration of his asylum claim based on apparent eligibility,however,the only decision properly before us now is the bia initial order denying withholding of removal and holding his asylum claim waived consequently,we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of kane asylum claim to the extent that kane seeks review of the bia initial holding that he waived his asylum claim,we find no error,particularly in light of the record that was before the bia at the time of its decision 
withholding of removal 
to be eligible for withholding of removal,an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution on his return to the country of removal the applicant may demonstrate such a probability by showing that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion persecution has been construed to require a showing that harm or suffering will be inflicted upon the applicant in order to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome.demonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific,detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution.
in his petition to us,kane raises several arguments that he had not presented to the bia on direct appeal.for example,kane now contends that he has a legal right to serve as his daughters guardian for medical decisions,irrespective of his immigration status.according to kane,removal would interfere with his constitutionally protected custodial rights by subjecting his daughters to fgm,thus violating his legal right both to live with his minor children and to control their medical treatment.we have no jurisdiction to review issues raised for the first time in kane petition,which the bia did not have the opportunity to consider in the first instance 
as for the remainder of kane assertions,we are satisfied that the bia decision to deny withholding is supported by substantial evidence.for example,kane claims that fulani tribal elders enforcing the practice against his daughters would in effect be persecuting him.in its decision on direct appeal,the bia conceded that there may be cases where a person persecutes someone close to an applicant,such as a spouse,parent,child or other relative,with the intended purpose of causing emotional harm to the applicant,but does not directly harm the applicant himself.as the bia explained,however,in such a case,the persecution would not be derivative,as the applicant himself would be the target of the emotional persecution that arises from physical harm to a loved one.after the bia reviewed kane testimony and all the evidence in the record,it concluded that kane had failed to demonstrate that he would be the target of such persecution.we see no reversible error in this decision,and note that kane himself testified that fulani tribal elders would likely enforce the practice against his daughters only because they believe that their culture compels them to do so and not as a way to persecute kane for any particular belief or characteristic that he exhibits.
in response to kane contention that he would be persecuted simply for opposing the practice of fgm,the bia concluded that he had failed to show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his opposition to this practice.in reaching this conclusion,the bia cited as persuasive kane repeated and specific testimony that he has no fear of any persecution to himself if he were to return to senegal.the bia determination on this point is supported by substantial evidence,particularly considering that kane himself stated numerous times during his testimony that he did not fear any personal harm other than perhaps humiliation or harassment,neither of which rises to the level of persecution 
further,as we have previously held,the ina does not recognize derivative claims for withholding of removal although kane insists that he is not making a derivative withholding claim,this assertion is inconsistent with his testimony before the ij to the extent that kane does seek withholding based on a fear that his daughters will be subjected to persecution if they accompany him to senegal,we see no error in the bia determination that kane is not entitled to derivative withholding.
the bia also reasoned that kane could avoid the risk of his daughters being subjected to fgm altogether by having them remain in the united states,which they are legally entitled to do,either by staying with the parent who is not currently in removal proceedings,or through the appointment of a guardian to ensure their welfare until such time as they reach majority.the bia alternatively concluded that,in light of recent efforts by the senegalese government to frustrate the practice of fgm,even if kane children were to accompany him to senegal,they could avoid fgm by relocating to an area of comparative safety.although this admittedly presents kane with a difficult and painful decision,we see no reversible error in the bia determination.
other circuits are in accord.presented with similar facts,the seventh circuit held in oforji ashcroft that an alien is not entitled to withholding based solely on the possibility that her might be subjected to fgm following the alien removal in oforji,the court stated 
although the threatened hardship for her children is apparent,there is no statutory or regulatory authority for petitioner to have her own deportation suspended because she fears for her children if they return to nigeria with her.of course,as united states citizens the daughters have the right to stay here without her,but that would likely require some form of a hobson choice,but a choice no parent wants to make.given the undesirable consequences of the choice she has to make,petitioner is in effect r
