discussion 
azize primarily contends that his initial application for citizenship was improperly denied,that but for this allegedly improper denial he would have become a naturalized citizen,and that,as a citizen,he would not have been subject to removal proceedings.he frames his legal position as asserting both a denial of the constitutional right to have the government follow its own procedures,see morton ruiz,d,which he contends applies in the immigration context,see montilla ins,cir,and an estoppel against the government,see thom ashcroft,cir.
azize bases his claim of improper denial of his application for citizenship on what he alleges was the ins termination of the processing of his first application upon his failure to surrender his green card,which he had informed the ins officer had been stolen and for which an application for a replacement card was pending.this action,azize contends,violated the ins regulation concerning surrender of a green card,cfr.that regulation states 
no certificate of naturalization shall be delivered by the clerk of the court in any case in which the representative of the service in attendance at the final naturalization hearing notifies the clerk of court that the naturalized person has not surrendered his alien registration receipt card.upon subsequent receipt of notice from the district
