the international union of operating engineers,local,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge before the national labor relations board,claiming that csx hotels,doing business as the greenbrier,a resort near white sulphur springs,west virginia violated the national labor relations act the act by interfering with the union right to engage in lawful picketing.the administrative law judge decided that the greenbrier violated the act on both june and june.the greenbrier filed exceptions to the alj decision with the board.a divided panel of the board adopted the alj decision,but only as to the june violation.the greenbrier now petitions for review of the board decision,and the board for enforcement of its order.the union has intervened.we grant the greenbrier petition for review and deny the board for enforcement.
in june,lynch construction was building a maintenance facility on the greenbrier property.the union determined that lynch construction violated its agreement with the union by hiring employees represented by a different labor union to work on the greenbrier project.to protest this alleged breach of agreement,the union set up a picketing stand a few feet from the greenbrier property line near the greenbrier employee entrance on the public along highway.
although highway has only two lanes,it is a major artery for traffic heading to and from the greenbrier,the city of white sulphur springs,and several other destinations in greenbrier county.traffic along highway is especially heavy during the morning and afternoon commutes.until,when the white sulphur springs police department took jurisdiction over this particular stretch of road,highway averaged one death per year for more than a decade.the speed limit is on the portion of highway where the union chose to picket.
during the morning commute on the first day of picketing,thursday,june,about twenty picketers from the union congregated on the public near the greenbrier employee entrance.the greenbrier security director flagged down a white sulphur springs police officer who was passing by on highway and informed him about the picketers that officer went to where the picketers were protesting and ordered them to move their vehicles,which were parked in an unauthorized zone along highway.the officer also told the picketers that he would check at the police station to see if they needed an assembly permit to picket in that particular location.the picketers moved their vehicles away from highway and resumed picketing.
soon thereafter,the general manager of the greenbrier approached the picketers to ask what they were doing at the greenbrier employee entrance.the picketers informed him that they were picketing lynch construction and that the lynch construction employees were using the greenbrier employee entrance.after the general manager assured the picketers that he would require lynch construction to use its own designated entrance to the property about feet down highway,the picketers agreed to move to the lynch construction entrance.the greenbrier security director was present during this discussion and remained in the vicinity of the picketers even after they moved to the lynch construction entrance.
although lynch construction was performing work on the greenbrier property,the union was not picketing the greenbrier.the greenbrier hires several hundred employees who are represented by nearly a dozen different labor unions but none from the union in question.thus,these picketers were not employees of the greenbrier.
meanwhile,the white sulphur springs police officer returned to the police station and informed two of his superior officers about the picketing.after determining that the picketers needed to obtain an assembly permit,the three officers proceeded to the greenbrier property.once they arrived,the junior officer controlled traffic on the highway,and the senior officers informed the picketers that they were violating white sulphur springs assembly code by not having a permit.the officers directed the picketers to leave the premises or face arrest,and the picketers peaceably left the premises.as the officers left the area,they reported to the greenbrier security director,who was still monitoring the picketing,that they had advised the picketers about the city assembly permit requirement.
after leaving the premises on june,the union attempted to apply for a permit.a permit application must be submitted five days before the planned assembly and requires approval by the police chief.one reason for requiring an application several days in advance is to allow the police chief to assess whether the city has adequate manpower to maintain traffic safety.under the city code,the police chief has discretion to deny an assembly permit.because the police chief was scheduled to be out of town for several days and also because the union believed it had a right under both the first amendment and the act to picket,the union decided to resume picketing without a permit at the lynch construction entrance four days later on monday,june.
during the monday morning commute,approximately five union members picketed at the lynch construction entrance.when the police chief returned to work that morning,two security officers from the greenbrier arrived at the police station to inform him that the picketers had returned.according to the chief,the greenbrier security officers were worried about the traffic and stuff,because like i said,that time in the morning,traffic is bad.the chief promptly went to the scene and determined that the picketing posed a traffic safety concern.the police chief told the picketers to leave because they did not have a permit.one of the greenbrier security officers was standing next to the chief when the chief addressed the picketers.
as the police chief was talking with the picketers,the attorney for the union arrived.the chief drove the union attorney back to city hall to discuss the situation with the city attorney.the city attorney directed the chief to allow the picketers to proceed without a permit.
later that same day,the greenbrier attorney faxed a letter to the city attorney requesting that the city enforce the assembly permit requirement.the greenbrier attorney cited the speed limit and the picketers proximity to the highway as reasons for requiring the permit,emphasizing that the greenbrier overriding concern is public safety.
in his response,the city attorney explained that the permit was not required because there were so few picketers at the site.the city attorney also expressed doubt whether the was within the city jurisdiction.
the alj decided that the greenbrier interfered with the union right to picket on june by contacting the police,which he found was for the purpose of seeking the removal or arrest of the picketers the majority of the panel of the board adopted the alj decision based on what it characterized as the well settled rule that an employer exclusion of union representatives from public property violates a of the act if the union representatives are engaged in an activity,such as picketing,that is protected under.the dissenting member of the panel concluded that the greenbrier lawfully contacted the police based on its reasonable concern about public safety on the highway.
