petitioner zhikeng tang,a native and citizen of china,seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals the board denying his requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,cat.because substantial evidence supports the board decision,we deny tang petition for review.
tang entered the united states in july without admission or inspection.his wife and child remained behind in fuzhou city,china,located within the fujian province.in august,a coworker introduced tang to catholicism,and he began to attend a local church.he filed for asylum later that year,and the government initiated removal proceedings 
during a hearing before an immigration judge ij,tang conceded removability,but sought asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection based on his religion.tang testified that his faith was genuine and that he shared his religious teachings with his family and friends.he submitted letters and other documents evidencing his membership in the catholic church.despite china recognition of catholicism,tang claimed his faith obliged him to attend an underground catholic church,rather than a church.tang maintained that he would proselytize if he were removed to china,and he feared persecution by the chinese government for participation in an underground church.in support of his claim that he would be persecuted,tang proffered letters from his wife and a friend,both in china,which represented that there were some instances of persecution of underground catholic churches in that country.tang also provided the ij with two state department reports that he viewed as critical of china treatment of certain religious groups.
the ij determined that tang testimony was credible,but that tang had not met his burden of showing that he would be persecuted in china for practicing catholicism.the ij suggested that tang would be able to join the catholic church sanctioned by the chinese government and noted that tang had not explained how this church was not authentic.despite tang testimony and the other evidence submitted in the case,the ij did not find enough evidence to establish that tang faces an objectively reasonable risk of persecution on account of his roman catholicism.because tang could not meet the standard for asylum eligibility,the ij concluded that he also failed to satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.finally,with respect to cat protection,the ij determined that tang had not shown even an objectively reasonable chance that he will face torture in china,much less the requisite more likely than not chance of torture.the ij ordered tang removal to china.
on administrative appeal,the board agreed with the ij that tang did not meet his burden to establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal under the act based on his conversion to roman catholicism while in the united states.the board found that tang had not shown that the chinese government was aware or would become aware of his catholic faith,nor had he established that there is a pattern or practice of persecution in china of persons similarly situated to him.the board also noted that tang did not challenge the ij cat ruling and,thus,that claim was waived.
when the board adopts and supplements an ij decision,as it did here,we review both rulings.see hernandez nolasco lynch,cir.our review is narrow and deferential,djadjou holder,cir,and we will uphold the board removal decision unless it is manifestly contrary to law.b c.the alien has the burden of proving that he or she is entitled to asylum,withholding of removal,or protection under cat.see b b asylum id.b c withholding of removal c cat 
we review the board factual rulings under the substantial evidence standard,which dictates that findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.in other words,w e uphold factual findings unless no rational factfinder could agree with the board position.temu holder,cir.the board removal decisions must remain undisturbed if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.tassi holder,cir.we may not reweigh the evidence,see lin holder,cir,and,e ven if the record plausibly could support two results the one the ij chose and the one the petitioner advances,reversal is only appropriate where the court find s that the evidence not only supports the opposite conclusion,but compels it.mulyani holder,cir.quoting niang gonzales,cir.we review the board legal conclusions de novo.see hernandez nolasco,at.
tang challenges the board denial of asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.we address each in turn.
tang argues primarily that the board decision to deny his asylum request is erroneous.specifically,he takes issue with the board determination that he did not meet his burden of showing a fear of future persecution.tang contends that this holding is not supported by substantial evidence.
the immigration and nationality act empowers the attorney general to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees under the statutory definition,at her discretion.see b a hernandez avalos lynch,cir.the alien has the burden of proving that he or she is a refugee,b b,defined as any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the applicant may qualify as a refugee because he or she has a fear of future persecution.b persecution takes the form of threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.singh holder,cir.quoting fatin ins,cir.actions less severe than threats to life or freedom may rise to the level of persecution,but they must be something more than mere harassment.li gonzales,cir.quoting dandan ashcroft,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
based on the applicable statutory provisions,an applicant must show that he has a subjective fear of persecution based on race,religion,nationality,social group membership,or political opinion,that a reasonable person would have a fear of persecution in that situation,and that his fear has some basis in objective reality.rusu ins,cir.the subjective component is satisfied by presenting candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution,while t he objective element requires the asylum applicant to show,with specific,concrete facts,that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.marynenka holder,cir.quoting yong hao chen ins,cir.
tang has satisfied the subjective component of his claim based upon the ij favorable credibility finding.see,ai hua chen holder,cir.again,both li and chen were found to be credible witnesses.their task,therefore,was to establish that their genuine subjective fear of persecution based on their religious faith is objectively reasonable.the only issue,then,is whether he can demonstrate an objective fear of persecution.
an objective fear of persecution exists when t here is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if the applicant were to return to that country.b i b.the alien is required to provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution unless t he applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice of persecution on account of the applicant religion in his or her country of nationality.id.b iii see also yong hao chen,at.to establish a pattern or practice of persecution,t he key for the applicant is to show the thorough or systematic nature of the persecution he fears.yong hao chen,at.
here,tang has not argued that he will be singled out for persecution in china,nor has he asserted that the chinese government has any awareness of his religious affiliation.in fact,the board obse
