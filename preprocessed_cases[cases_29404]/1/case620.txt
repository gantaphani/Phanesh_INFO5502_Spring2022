plaintiff appellant george brault appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont murtha,affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security the commissioner denying brault application for disability benefits.we conclude the decision of the administrative law judge alj was supported by substantial evidence and was not the product of legal error,and affirm the district court judgment.
background 
brault filed an application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits in september.he claimed that he became disabled in september because of nerve damage in his left arm and a cervical spine injury he sustained in a accident.after his application was denied initially and on reconsideration,he requested an administrative hearing before an alj.
the alj found that brault had carried his burden of proof on steps one through four of the process the commissioner employs to determine disability.see butts barnhart,cir,as amended on reh g in part,cir.at that point,the burden shifted to the commissioner to show there is other work that brault can perform.see dechirico callahan,cir.the alj concluded,based on the testimony of the vocational expert ve the government had retained,that brault was capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.accordingly,brault application was denied.
although brault counsel stipulated to the ve expertise,he asserted a objection to the ve actual testimony,contending it was unreliable in response to hypotheticals from the alj roughly describing brault specific limitations,the ve had identified eight occupations an individual with such limitations could perform he based that determination on his own expertise,as well as on the position descriptions in the dictionary of occupational titles the dot,a united states department of labor publication.the dot gives a job type a specific code for example,automobile rental clerk and establishes,among other things,the minimum skill level and physical exertion capacity required to perform that job.because of the detailed information appended to each dot code,the codes are useful for determining the type of work a disability applicant can perform.in fact,the dot is so valued that a ve whose evidence conflicts with the dot must provide a reasonable explanation to the alj for the conflict.see social security ruling ssr,policy interpretation ruling titles ii and xvi use of vocational expert and vocational specialist evidence,and other reliable occupational information in disability decisions,wl.
the dot,however,just defines jobs.it does not report how many such jobs are available in the economy.consequently,the ve turned to the occupational employment quarterly ii the oeq,prepared by a private organization called publishing,to assess whether positions exist for each of the eight dot codes,both in the national economy and in vermont,brault home state.the ve testified that according to the oeq more than,unskilled,positions exist in the national economy,and more than exist in vermont.
brault argued,somewhat in passing,that the ve report improperly counted positions.but his main objection to the ve testimony was that it did not reliably match the dot codes to the oeq data.according to brault submissions to the alj,the oeq does not compile data by dot code,but rather by standard occupational classification system soc code,a new system the bureau of labor statistics has embraced to replace the dot code regime.soc codes,however,are not useful for disability proceedings because they do not contain the same detailed occupational information as dot codes.thus a ve must use some method for associating employment numbers to job types.the problem,however,is that dot codes are much more granular than soc codes according to brault,there were nearly job titles in the edition of the dot,but only about soc titles.
citing this inexact matching,brault submitted a memorandum arguing that the underlying numbers are unscientific and fail to meet the daubert standard for reliability.according to him,the numerical data provided by the soc code do not enable a vocational expert to accurately determine the number of jobs within that soc code for a particular dot title.as such,he maintained that the ve has no scientific basis to break down between the various dot titles and to match them to soc codes.he then explained without any citation that an expert must use a crosswalk,in other words,a algorithm,to the occupational detail for a particular dot code to a soc code and then must use the statistical data to define the number of jobs related to that dot code.
brault counsel addressed most of these points while the ve.while acknowledging brault objections,however,the ve denied having reported the numbers for the entire soc.instead,he claimed to have reduced the numbers from the entire soc code to only count jobs that i know exist.with the alj permission,brault counsel submitted additional briefing fully setting forth his objections to the ve soc to dot mapping methodology.
the alj never directly responded to those objections.instead,about a month after the hearing,the alj issued a ruling which relied on the ve testimony,agreed that positions existed in the eight dot positions the ve had identified at the numbers the ve had given,and denied brault application for benefits.
brault appealed to the district court,which rejected brault challenge to the reliability of the ve testimony,noting that it was appropriate for the ve to consult the oeq in rendering his testimony.see brault soc.sec,comm r,cv jgm,wl,at.march.it affirmed the commissioner decision as supported by substantial evidence.brault timely appeals.
ii.discussion 
when we review the commissioner denial of social security benefits,our focus is not so much on the district court ruling as it is on the administrative ruling.schaal apfel,cir.indeed,i t is not our function to determine de novo whether a plaintiff is disabled.pratts chater,cir.instead,we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine if there is substantial evidence,considering the record as a whole,to support the commissioner decision and if the correct legal standards have been applied.moran astrue,cir see also a on judicial review,t he findings of the commissioner of social security as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.
substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.moran,at quotation marks omitted.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.but it is still a very deferential standard of review even more so than the clearly erroneous standard.see dickinson zurko,d.the substantial evidence standard means once an alj finds facts,we can reject those facts only if a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude otherwise.warren shalala,cir emphasis added and quotation marks omitted see also osorio ins,cir using the same standard in the analogous immigration context.
brault argues the alj erred by relying on ve testimony which brault considers of dubious reliability.according to brault,once that testimony had been challenged,the alj was required to grant an opportunity to inspect and challenge the proffered evidence and if the alj relied on the challenged evidence,to explain why the challenge was rejected.brault claims to find support in seventh circuit case law,but he candidly acknowledges a split among our sister circuits on the matter one we have yet to address.compare bayliss barnhart,cir with mckinnie barnhart,cir.we address his arguments in reverse order.
statement of reasons 
there is no question that the alj,in his written ruling,did not mention brault objection to the ve testimony.in accepting that testimony,the alj necessarily rejected brault grievances,but brault argues this implied rejection was insufficient the alj needed to do more.in his view,he was owed an explanation.
he claims support from donahue barnhart,cir,purporting to quote from what he characterizes as the seventh circuit holding that,when
