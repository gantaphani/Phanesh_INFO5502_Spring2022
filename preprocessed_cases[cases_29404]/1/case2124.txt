jimmy bivens,an officer in the illinois state police isp,discovered that he had elevated levels of lead in his blood due to lead contamination at the indoor firing range where he was stationed.he complained to his superiors,both directly and through a union grievance,about the safety of the working conditions.the firing range was immediately analyzed and closed for environmental remediation.after he was denied workers compensation benefits,bivens sued his supervisors in the isp,larry trent,jay keevan,diane rotter,mark beagles,and roger hayes,under,claiming that they retaliated against him in violation of the first amendment because he complained about the conditions at the firing range.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all of the bivens appeals.we affirm.
in october,bivens was assigned to the position of range officer for district of the isp.as range officer,he oversaw all aspects of the range operation,including qualifying individuals on firearms and keeping the range clean and in good working order.the main purpose of the range was to provide firearm training and qualification testing to state police officers,but it also served as a facility for other state police training exercises and as a firing range for other police departments.members of the general public also occasionally used the range,including hunters to set their shotgun sights and occasionally school children touring the facility.
by all accounts,bivens did a great job of bringing order and cleanliness to the range,which resembled a train derailment when he arrived,and he received a written commendation just a month after he started.within a few months,however,bivens began to feel ill,with severe headaches,aching hips,and numbness and tingling in his extremities.by february,bivens was concerned that his symptoms were caused by exposure to lead at the firing range.he first asked for a blood test through the firing range chain of command.when he did not receive a response within a couple of weeks,bivens asked master sergeant roger hayes,his supervisor in district,to arrange a blood test.during that conversation,bivens expressed concern about the safety of the facility.as a result of that conversation,and at bivens urging,hayes sent a memorandum to captain jay keevan,the district commander for district,recommending that a lead test be arranged for bivens.keevan suggested that bivens be tested for lead exposure at the county health department.after the health department would not perform the test,keevan authorized bivens to make his own arrangements,for which the isp would reimburse him.
bivens had his blood tested and on march learned that his lead levels were highly elevated.he informed hayes of this that same day.on march,bivens filed a grievance with the state police union for a violation of the safe working conditions provision of the collective bargaining agreement.he detailed his symptoms,tests,and previous complaints,and requested that the range be professionally analyzed,cleaned,and repaired in such a manner as to render the facility safe of any health hazard with the prospect of a sic minimal.on march,the lead levels at the range were evaluated and found to be elevated.on march,the range was closed for professional.the closure of the range received local media attention.it did not open again until november.
in the meantime,bivens medical concerns continued.on march,he consulted hogan,who performed a neurological exam and the lead levels in his blood.hogan found no evidence of lead poisoning but ordered that bivens be limited to desk work until the results of the lead test were received.after speaking with one of bivens supervisors,hogan agreed that bivens could return to work and amended his order accordingly.when the new lead test later showed normal lead levels,hogan released bivens to return to full work with the only restriction that he not be exposed to lead.bivens sought a second opinion from schrieber,a physician who had been recommended by bivens workers compensation attorney.schrieber recommended that bivens not return to work until april.bivens returned on that day and worked for one week,but continued to experience his neurological symptoms and stopped working again a week later.because bivens was absent from work due to a medical condition and receiving disability benefits,the isp arranged for an independent examination of bivens.david peeples examined bivens on may,and concluded that the neurological examination was normal and opined that bivens could carry out any work so long as it did not involve lead exposure.bivens still did not feel well,however,and schrieber continued to opine that bivens was suffering from cerebral deficits.in response,the isp asked bivens to visit a psychiatrist for an independent evaluation of his cerebral deficits.bivens was initially reluctant,but in late december he was examined by psychiatrist william stillings.stillings found no evidence of the disorders described by schrieber and opined that bivens was simulating memory deficits.just as peeples had found eight months earlier,stillings concluded that bivens was able to work without restrictions,as long as he was not exposed to excessive levels of lead.after stillings diagnosis,the isp terminated bivens disability benefits and ordered him to return to work on january.further,based on peeples and stillings medical findings and because the defendants were concerned that bivens was faking his illness,the isp did not allow bivens to use his earned sick time to reduce his hours to cope with his illness and instead required him to use his personal time.after his personal time ran out,he only was paid for the hours he actually worked.
bivens then filed a workers compensation claim.he claimed that his illness was causally related to the lead exposure and that the medical services he received were reasonable and necessary,and challenged the amount of compensation he received for temporary total disability.on july,an arbitrator from the illinois workers compensation commission held a hearing regarding bivens workers compensation claims.on august,the arbitrator filed his decision with the commission.the arbitrator was not persuaded by the opinions of schreiber regarding bivens neurological damage and instead credited the lack of findings in the exams of hogan,peeples,and stillings.the arbitrator did,however,find that bivens was injured by exposure to high lead levels and that he was totally disabled from march,until may.he also found that bivens medical expenses were reasonable,necessary,and related.bivens filed a timely petition for review with the commission,but the commission affirmed the arbitrator decision with only minor modifications.
bivens next filed this action under against larry trent,jay keevan,diane rotter,mark beagles,and roger hayes,his supervisors at the isp.he alleged that the defendants,while acting pursuant to their duties with the isp,violated his first amendment rights by retaliating against him because his grievance about lead levels at the range forced them to close the range for nearly nine months and caused the isp public embarrassment.the alleged retaliation against bivens included subjecting him to different workplace rules than his,disciplining him without justification by docking his pay,paying him only for hours worked when his personal leave ran out,refusing to allow him to use his earned benefit time by forcing him to use personal rather than earned sick leave,reassigning him to a different position,harassment,disclosure of confidential information,and dissemination of false information that he was faking his illness to coworkers.
the defendants moved for summary judgment on several grounds.first,they argued that the supreme court decision in garcetti ceballos,foreclosed first amendment protection for bivens grievance about lead levels because the cleanliness and safety of the range were part of his official job duties.second,they argued that if,and to the extent that,garcetti did not foreclose bivens grievance,his speech would still not be protected because it was an entirely private grievance,unconcerned with any possible publi
