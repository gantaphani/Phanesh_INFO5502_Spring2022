three parents and their lawyer filed this action under the first and fourteenth amendments after being denied permission to make a repeat appearance before the board of education of jefferson county,tennessee.the district court refused to overturn a jury verdict in favor of the defendants and awarded attorney fees to the defendants.we affirm the jury verdict,but we reverse the court grant of attorney fees.
jeff lowery,lisa lowery and randy giles are parents of children who used to play on the jefferson county high school football team.in october,the coach dismissed their sons for challenging his leadership.see lowery euverard,cir.after the parents complained unsuccessfully to various officials,they decided to address their concerns to the school board as a whole.
the jefferson county board of education allows individuals to apply to speak for five minutes at board meetings so long as their appearances are not frivolous,repetitive,nor harassing.bd.of educ.policy,roa.the board tasks the director of schools with applying this standard and gives the chairman of the board authority to limit appearances on these grounds at the meeting.even when someone has not applied beforehand,the board sometimes will vote at the meeting to allow an individual to speak.
lisa lowery called the office of doug moody,the director of schools,and asked for speaking time at a november,school board meeting,saying the subject was football.tr.moody secretary called her back the day of the meeting to confirm her appearance.at the meeting,an attorney,michael kelley,spoke on behalf of the parents.although kelley was polite in tone,he criticized several school officials and threatened legal action if his clients concerns were not addressed.
dissatisfied with the results of the november meeting,lisa lowery called and asked for a speaking spot at the next scheduled board meeting on december,again saying the subject was football.tr.after receiving the request,moody conferred with greg sharpe,the chairman of the board.moody thought the speech would be harassing because kelley previous speech had threatened legal action and contained very strong,derogatory comments about personnel and repetitive because the speaker was the same,it was going to be the same topic.tr.sharpe was concerned only that the appearance would be repetitive,because he had just had a meeting with giles,and,according to giles,most of what was going to be said there was similar to what we had heard in november.tr.they made a joint decision to reject the request,tr,and moody called giles to confirm the subject matter and notify him and the lowerys of the denial.
the lowerys,giles and kelley came to the december meeting but did not make any further request to speak.the next day the parents,represented by kelley,filed a lawsuit on behalf of their children against the football coach and various other school officials,alleging that the coach violated the children first amendment rights when he dismissed them from the team due to their criticism.the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment,but our court reversed,holding that there was no constitutional violation in the children dismissal from the team.see lowery,at.
one week after filing the first lawsuit,the lowerys,giles and kelley filed a second lawsuit,this time claiming that moody,sharpe and the school board violated their first amendment rights when they refused to allow them to make a second appearance before the board.a jury found for the defendants and the district court not only denied the plaintiffs motions for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law but also ordered the plaintiffs to pay attorney fees and expenses of,calling their claims frivolous and accusing them of filing the lawsuit to harass the defendants.roa.
federal law allows individuals to sue any person who,under color of state law,subjects any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.all agree that moody,sharpe and the school board are persons who acted under color of state law the issue is whether their denial of the plaintiffs second request to speak violated the first and fourteenth amendments.the individual defendants have waived any qualified immunity argument by not raising it.see brown crowley,cir.
we give fresh review to the denial of the motion for a judgment as a matter of law and review to the motion for a new trial.see mccurdy montgomery county,cir.a court may grant judgment as a matter of law only when there is a complete absence of fact to support the verdict,so that no reasonable juror could have found for the nonmoving party,pouillon city of owosso,cir,and may grant a new trial only when a jury has reached a seriously erroneous result,such as when the verdict is against the weight of the evidence or the trial is influenced by prejudice or bias,mike train house,lionel,cir citation omitted.because this case touches on matters of free speech,we independently examine the record as a whole but with due deference to the jury ability to assess the credibility of witnesses.see hurley gay,lesbian bisexual group of boston,d.
the right to free speech is not absolute,especially when a speaker seeks access to government property as a platform for his speech.the extent to which the government may regulate speech in this setting depends on the context of the speech and the government reasons for restricting the speech.see perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.at one end,the government regulatory powers are at their weakest in traditional public fora like parks and streets,which have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public,and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions.hague comm.for indus.at the other end,the government has broad though not complete discretion to regulate speech in nonpublic fora like military bases,internal mail systems and public transit advertising spaces.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.
the school board meeting at issue in this case falls in the middle.while this type of meeting offers citizens a chance to express their views to the board,it can not accommodate the sort of uninhibited,unstructured speech that characterizes a public park.see city of madison,joint sch.dist.empl.rel.comm n,d white city of norwalk,cir jones heyman,cir per curiam.that is why courts call this sort of forum a designated and limited public forum designated because the government has intentionally open ed it for public discourse,cornelius,at,and limited because the state is not required to allow persons to engage in every type of speech in the forum,good news club milford cent,d.within such a forum,the government may regulate the time,place and manner of speech so long as the regulation is,narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leave s open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.clark cmty.for creative,d.
the board denial of the plaintiffs request to speak under policy passes this test.here is how the policy works it allows citizens to apply and be approved to speak for five minutes at board meetings it provides that t he director of schools shall take appropriate steps to determine that appeals or appearances before the board are not frivolous,repetitive,nor harassing in nature and it says that t he chairman shall have the authority to terminate the remarks of any individual who does not adhere to the above rules or chooses to be abusive to an individual board member or the board as a whole.roa.in practice,the executive committee the director moody and chairman sharpe,tr.whether to allow a particular individual to speak,and the board may vote at the meeting to allow someone who has not gone through the screening process to speak at the meeting.
this policy is.any restriction on speech under this policy is justified without reference to the content of the speech,making it on its face.cmty.for creative,at.the policy stated justifications include allow ing everyone a fair and adequate opportunity to be heard assur ing that the regular agenda of the board is completed and recogniz ing the voluntary nature of the board time and us ing that time efficiently.roa.each of these justifications has nothing to do with the subject of an individual proposed speech and everything to do with conducting orderly,productive meetings.
the policy serves significant governmental interests.unstructured,chaotic school board meetings not only would be inefficient but also could deny other citizens the chance to make their voices heard.see jones,at.that is why public bodies may confine their meetings to specified subject matter.city of madison,at.
the policy narrowly and carefully advances these interests.outside the context of or speech regulations,see pleasant grove city summum,d,the regulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the government objective.ward rock against racism,d.so long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government interest could be adequately served by some alternative.id.at.
the school board policy is narrowly tailored because it prohibits speech only when it is repetitive,harassing or frivolous.roa.the policy thus allows almost all speech except when it is likely to interfere with the board interests in efficient and productive meetings.see white,at a speaker may disrupt a city council meeting by speaking too long,by being unduly repetitious,or by extended discussion of irrelevancies.jones,at upholding removal from city commission meeting based on,disruptive and antagonistic speech wright anthony,cir upholding limit for speech at public hearing.
the evidence at trial supports a finding that moody and sharpe denied the request on the ground that the proposed speech fell into these exceptions,particularly the prohibition on repetitive speech.lisa lowery testified that she mentioned the same subject football both times she asked for speaking time.tr.moody testified that he considered this request repetitive because the speaker was the same,it was going to be the same topic,tr,and sharpe testified that he inferred from his discussion with giles that most of what was going to be said there was going to be similar to what we had heard in november,tr.on this record,the jury could fairly find that the request fell into a neutral category repetitive thus was permissibly denied.see white,at a moderator certainly may stop a speaker if his speech becomes irrelevant or repetitious.if,as everyone seems to agree,a moderator may limit a speaker to five minutes on a topic at any one meeting,see wright,at,he generally should be able to limit the same speaker to five minutes on the same specific topic across two meetings.
the policy allows ample alternative channels of communication.although the policy limits the length of speaking opportunities at board meetings,it allows speech in all other contexts with few,if any,restrictions.tennessee law allows citizens to contact members of public bodies like the school board,see jackson hensley,an opportunity that the plaintiffs took ample advantage of here.in addition to the first appearance before the board in november,the plaintiffs talked informally to the athletic director,the principal,director of schools moody,four board members,including chairman sharpe,and four county commissioners.giles compiled a booklet of information and gave it to board members.after appearing before the board in november,kelley sent each board member a letter restating the plaintiffs position.the plaintiffs held not one but two press conferences to protest the dismissals from the team.giles testified that he and the other plaintiffs presented a tremendous amount of shocking information to every level of.tr.all things considered,the policy amounted to a time,place and manner regulation.
the plaintiffs attack this conclusion on two main fronts,neither successfully.first,they argue that denying a request ahead of time,rather than waiting to regulate the speech after hearing it,imposes a prior restraint on the speaker,subjecting the denial to more rigorous scrutiny and requiring more procedural safeguards.it is true that the defendants restrained the plaintiffs from speaking prior to the meeting,but that does not make their actions a prior restraint in a first amendment sense.in thomas chicago park district,d,the supreme court faced a similar claim that chicago permit requirement for public events,which also had to be obtained before the public event,was a prior restraint.the court not only rejected the first amendment challenge,but it also rejected plaintiffs characterization of the requirement,treating the policy as a permissible time,place and manner regulation rather than as a prior restraint.id.at.the same conclusion applies here.
the plaintiffs second impermissible viewpoint discrimination motivated the decision to bar the plaintiffs from also unavailing.no doubt,some evidence if credited suggests that disagreement with the plaintiffs viewpoint,not repetitiveness,prompted the denial of the second request.although sharpe cited repetitiveness as his sole motivation,tr,moody testified that he also based his decision on a belief that kelley november address,although polite,was critical enough to count as harassing.tr.he stated,for instance,that some very strong,derogatory comments were made about personnel,even to the point that if the board did not intervene there would be other action considered.i felt that was threatening.tr.
although the school board may exclude some types of harassing it has the potential to disrupt the meeting,or threatens illegal acts as opposed to the filing of a lawsuit the board may not exclude speech merely because it criticizes school officials.see police dep t of city of chicago mosley,d.save for rare,speech promoting drug use at a high school event,see morse frederick,d the first amendment forbids government officials from regulating speech based on their reaction to its point of view,see mosley,at.
in this instance,however,the jury had ample bases for concluding that any potential motives of the board did not affect the outcome.no violation occurs when the same result would have occurred in the absence of any illegitimate motive,see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d,and the inquiry is one for the jury,not for us,to decide,waters churchill,d plurality see also id.at.scalia,concurring in the judgment describing the causation determination as one for the factfinder.the district court did not give a special healthy instruction here and the plaintiffs did not request one,but it did give a general causation instruction,and explicitly warned the jury that the government may not exclude speech based on the viewpoint it expresses.
considerable evidence supports a finding that the plaintiffs would not have received permission to speak,no matter what their viewpoint had been.of the two,sharpe testified that his only concern was the repetitiveness of the speech,and moody cited it as a partial motivation.even then,moody had approved the speech at the november meeting despite knowing ahead of time how critical it would be.when asked,so you get one chance to make harassing statements he replied,i believe that the judgment that i offered the chair.tr.finally,although he testified that he would have granted lisa lowery december request if she had called saying she wanted to praise staff members rather than criticize them,he clarified that b ragging on staff and bashing staff would be different topics.tr.the jury reasonably could have understood his interpretation of harassing to overlap with repetitiveness,making it matter little for this case that it also included a dislike of the speaker point of view.this conception of harassment aligns with the reality that harassment usually involves repetitiveness.state hoxie,the offense of harassment itself requires more than one telephone call brooks city of san mateo,cir except in extremely severe cases,a claim of sexual harassment requires repetitive incidents.the jury stood on solid ground in finding no violat
