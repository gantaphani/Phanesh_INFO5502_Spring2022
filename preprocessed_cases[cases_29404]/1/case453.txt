the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte,acting as an arbitrator of a dispute over an interconnection agreement between verizon new england,and global naps,issued an order requiring global naps to pay verizon compensation for certain phone calls the amount verizon alleges global naps owes is at least million.the question before the dte involved a particular variant on a larger question of allocation of compensation for telephone calls placed to internet service providers isps.the larger question has been addressed in a series of orders from the federal communications commission fcc.at the heart of this case is one such order,the isp remand order.
the dte,in an arbitration order,required global naps to pay verizon access charges for all virtual nxx traffic,including traffic,rejecting global naps argument that state commissions were preempted by the isp remand order from regulating intercarrier compensation for all traffic.global naps filed suit challenging the dte conclusion in federal district court.verizon and the dte argued that the dte retained authority to decide the issue because the fcc order only preempted state commission regulation of local traffic sent to an isp,and the fcc did not hold that virtual nxx traffic is such local traffic.
the district court never reached the preemption issue,because it found that global naps had implicitly consented to the jurisdiction of the dte to resolve the dispute,and so could not later challenge the dte jurisdiction to impose access charges for traffic.it granted verizon and the dte motions for partial summary judgment.no party on appeal agrees with that reasoning.
in the end,we affirm,though on different grounds.a party contesting an issue of whether federal law has preempted a state commission authority does not waive judicial review of the argument by first presenting it to the commission in the course of an arbitration under the telecommunications act of.because the preemption question was not waived,it must be addressed.the issue is one of federal law over which the federal court exercises de novo,not deferential,review.we reach the merits and hold that the fcc did not expressly preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for calls as are involved here,leaving the dte free to impose access charges for such calls under state law.
regulatory background 
prior history between these parties is set forth in our opinions in global naps,verizon new england,global naps i,cir,and global naps,massachusetts department of telecommunications energy global naps ii,cir.
the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,was enacted to end the local telephone monopolies and create a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored competition in local telephone markets.global naps i,at.telecomms.regulatory,cir see also verizon.pub.serv.comm n,d at t iowa utils,d.to achieve this goal,the tca requires the former local phone monopolies,called incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,to allow competitive local exchange carriers clecs to interconnect with their networks.see c.interconnection permits customers of one local exchange carrier to make calls to,and receive calls from,customers of other local exchange carriers.global naps ii,at.the tca also requires the ilecs to negotiate in good faith the terms of interconnection agreements with the clecs.see c.these agreements provide the terms of interconnection and fulfill the duties enumerated in.global naps ii,at quoting c.
section prescribes the process by which interconnection agreements are to be formed.under this provision,if negotiations between local exchange carriers do not result in a final agreement,either party can petition the relevant state commission to arbitrate unresolved issues.see id.b.the state commission must limit its consideration of the agreement to the matters specifically presented in the petition for arbitration and in the response.see id.b a.the state commission has the authority to decide the open issues between the parties,and to impose conditions on the parties for the implementation of the terms of arbitration into an agreement,global naps i,at citing b c,so long as its resolutions are consistent with and any regulations promulgated by the fcc,see c,a.once an agreement is concluded,it is submitted to the state commission for final approval.id.e.
state commission decisions are subject to judicial review in federal court under e 
in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
reciprocal compensation and access charges 
the underlying issue on appeal is whether,as global naps argues,the fcc isp remand order preempted state commissions from regulating intercarrier compensation for all calls.verizon and the dte take the position that the fcc only expressly preempted state regulation of intercarrier compensation for local calls.this issue requires a brief discussion of the distinction between local and interexchange calling and the different mechanisms of intercarrier compensation that apply to them.
the fcc and the dte have maintained a distinction between local and interexchange traffic.see local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of local competition order,wl drawing the distinction.local traffic stays within the boundaries of a local calling area.interexchange or traffic crosses the boundaries of a local calling area and is generally subject to toll or charges paid by the calling party traditionally,local calling areas have been geographically defined.
intercarrier compensation comes into play whenever two or more carriers collaborate to complete a phone call.whether a call is local or interexchange generally makes a difference in what regime of intercarrier compensation or access to that call.
the tca requires interconnecting local exchange carriers lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements,b,under which the originating lec compensates the terminating lec for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic.see global naps ii,at citing.the fcc,in its initial regulations implementing the tca,limited reciprocal compensation obligations to telecommunications traffic that originates and terminates within a local area,leaving interexchange calls outside the reciprocal compensation regime.see local competition order,at,wl see also global naps ii,at.
in those regulations,the fcc made clear that it was leaving in place the access charge regime that applied to interexchange calls 
a s a legal matter,transport and termination of local traffic are different services than access service for long distance telecommunications the tca preserves the legal distinctions between charges for transport and termination of local traffic and interstate and intrastate charges for terminating traffic.
local competition order,at,wl see also id,at,wl traffic originating or terminating outside of the applicable local area would be subject to interstate and intrastate access charges.
importantly,the fcc initial tca regulations also reaffirmed the ability of states to regulate intrastate access charges.as a result,verizon intrastate access charge tariffs for all phone calls are approved by the dte.
in its initial tca regulations,the fcc also left with the state commissions the power to define local calling areas consistent with their historical practice of defining local service areas for wireline lecs,and decided that the states should determine whether intrastate transport and termination of traffic between competing lecs,where a portion of their local service areas are not the same,should be governed by section b reciprocal compensation obligations or whether intrastate access charges should apply to the portions of their local service areas that are different.id,at,wl.
global naps vnxx system 
under the traditional system for rating calls,whether a call is local or interexchange depends on geographically defined local calling areas.the dte established the existing geographic local calling area structure for massachusetts after a generic proceeding in which all interested parties had the opportunity to comment.verizon implements this system by comparing the nxx numbers the nxx is the middle three digits of a phone number of the caller and the recipient.the nxx has generally been associated with a particular switch that is,the equipment that routes phone calls to their destination physically located within a local calling area nxxs have thus served as proxies for geographic location.this means that if the nxx numbers of the caller and the recipient were within the same local calling area,one could assume that the caller and recipient were actually physically within the same calling area and bill the call as a local call.
global naps has the ability to assign its customers virtual nxxs vnxx,so that a global naps customer can be given vnxx numbers that are different than those that would normally be assigned to him based on his physical location.this allows a party to call what appears to be a local number,although behind the scenes that call is actually routed to a different local calling area.when the party making such a call is a verizon customer,the call is transmitted outside the local calling area by verizon.
many of global naps isp customers use vnxx arrangements,and many of these isps customers use verizon for local phone service.to access the internet,the dials in to a vnxx number assigned to his or her own local calling area.then,verizon transports the call across local calling areas to global naps point of interconnection with the verizon network.global naps and verizon agree that u nder vnxx arrangements,the verizon end user call to the isp server is to the end user whether or not the isp server is located in the same local exchange area in which the originates the call.emphasis added.
c.the isp traffic debate 
the treatment of intercarrier compensation for traffic has been a matter of considerable debate in recent years.calls to isps tend to be long,and generally go exclusively from the isp customer to the isp.this has created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.for example,in the context of reciprocal compensation,since reciprocal compensation flows from the lec whose customer makes the phone call to the lec whose customer receives the phone call,an lec with a high proportion of isp global naps to gain a windfall in a reciprocal compensation scheme which includes traffic to an isp.see global naps ii,at citing bell atl.fcc,
the fcc has issued several orders related to intercarrier compensation for traffic.in,the fcc ruled that traffic was not subject to reciprocal compensation obligations under,although it left to state commissions the ability to conclude pursuant to contractual principles or other legal or equitable considerations,that reciprocal compensation is an appropriate interim rule pending final fcc rulemaking on the matter.local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of internet traffic order,wl.
the circuit vacated the internet traffic order on march,and remanded to the fcc,finding that the fcc rationale for treating traffic as interstate traffic for the purposes of reciprocal compensation was inadequate.global naps ii,at citing bell atl,at.on april,the fcc issued an order in response to the circuit remand,holding once again that the provisions of section b do not extend to traffic but resting its decision on a different legal ground.local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of isp remand order,wl.the fcc also provided an interim intercarrier compensation regime for at least some traffic to supplant existing state regimes going forward.this interim regime was meant to limit opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.it is undisputed that this interim regime preempts state commission regulation of intercarrier compensation for local calls.the question here is whether the preemptive effect extends to the interexchange calls at issue here.
the circuit held that the fcc new legal grounds as expressed in the isp remand order were still inadequate.see worldcom,fcc.however,it chose not to vacate the fcc order,and so the isp remand order remains in force.see global naps ii,at citing worldcom,at verizon.global naps,cir.
simultaneously to the release of the isp remand order,the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to consider whether it should reconsider the system of intercarrier compensation for all calls,including calls to isps.see developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime intercarrier compensation nprm,wl see also developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime intercarrier compensation fnprm,wl further notice of proposed rulemaking.
procedural history 
verizon and global naps began the negotiation process for a new interconnection agreement in.global naps i,at.on july,global naps filed a petition for arbitration with the dte for resolution of a number of open disputes concerning the proposed interconnection agreement,id.at,including whether vnxx calls should be treated as local or interexchange for purposes of intercarrier compensation.included with this petition was a version of the interconnection agreement,reflecting global naps proposed changes.verizon filed its response to global naps petition on august,including its own version of the interconnection agreement.the parties filed direct testimony with the dte on september.an evidentiary hearing was held on october,and the parties submitted briefs on october,and.
with respect to the vnxx issue,global naps argued that allowing verizon to impose access charges on such calls would thwart technological advances.indeed,global naps argued that vnxx traffic should be treated as local traffic,and therefore be subject to the state reciprocal compensation regime or,to the extent the traffic was,the federal interim compensation regime.as detailed below,during the course of the administrative proceedings global naps also made clear its position that the isp remand order had preempted the dte authority to regulate intercarrier compensation for all traffic,while leaving in place the dte ability to regulate intercarrier compensation for other intrastate calls.
verizon argued that the entire vnxx system was simply a way for global naps to engage in regulatory arbitrage.in effect,verizon argued,global naps vnxx system was a way to provide services to verizon customers so that verizon would not get any fees from those customers,deprive verizon of the access fees it would normally get for calls,and instead require verizon to pay global naps reciprocal compensation.
the dte issued an order on december,resolving all open issues.with respect to the vnxx issue,the dte rejected global naps position that all vnxx calls be treated as local for intercarrier compensation purposes.it found global naps position would create considerable market distortion based on an implicit verizon subsidy of global naps operations.instead,the dte decided that vnxx calls will be rated as local or toll based on the geographic end points of the call.it further found that verizon proposal to have the parties collaborate to determine the geographic end points of vnxx calls was an acceptable starting point,and ordered the parties to submit contract language with the final agreement to implement verizon solution.
the dte also rejected global naps arguments based on the isp remand order,finding that the order explicitly recognized that intrastate access regimes in place prior to the act remain unchanged until further state commission action and continues to recognize that calls that travel to points beyond the local exchange are access calls.the dte expressed its intent to continue enforcement of the existing intrastate access charge regime.
the dte ordered the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into a final interconnection agreement by january,this deadline was later extended to january,on the parties joint motion.global naps i,at.after the dte issued its december order,the parties began negotiating final terms of interconnection.however,on january,global naps informed verizon that it refused to negotiate any further.instead,it attempted to adopt the terms of a different agreement between verizon and sprint id.
verizon responded on january,by filing a motion for approval of a final arbitrated agreement,attaching a proposed final agreement.id.this agreement contained the following provision,to deal with the vnxx compensation issue global naps shall pay verizon originating access charges for all vnxx traffic originated by a verizon customer,and global naps shall pay verizon terminating access charges for all vnxx traffic originated by a global naps customer.it is this provision of the agreement that global naps challenges,to the extent that it requires payment of access charges for traffic.
in a february,order,the dte rebuffed global naps attempt to opt into the agreement.id.it approved verizon proposed final agreement and ordered the parties to sign and file that agreement.the parties eventually filed a final agreement on march,including,and it is the agreement currently in effect between the parties.
in the meantime,on december,global naps brought an action in federal district court challenging the merits of the dte arbitration determination.global naps i,at.in its complaint,global naps asserted that the dte lacked jurisdiction to impose access charges on isp bound traffic.it also complained that the dte reasoning,at least with respect to traffic,was wholly at odds with the isp remand order.the february,ruling by the dte rejecting global naps attempt to opt in to the agreement led global naps to file a second action in district court,on march.
on march,global naps,verizon and the dte moved to consolidate global naps two federal actions,and asked the district court to first resolve the question of whether global naps was permitted to opt in to the agreement before ruling on the challenge to the arbitration agreement.on may,the district court affirmed the dte decision not to allow global naps to opt in to the agreement.global naps i,at.on january,in global naps i,we affirmed that judgment.id.at.
global naps then revived its challenge to the dte december,arbitration order by filing a motion for partial summary judgment in the district court on may,global naps argued that in the isp remand order,t he fcc expressed in unambiguous language its intention to assert exclusive jurisdiction over intercarrier compensation for traffic.thus,it argued,the dte lacked the authority to require global naps to enter into an interconnection agreement that included,which required global naps pay verizon access charges for all vnxx traffic,including traffic bound for isps global naps based its preemption argument solely on the fcc isp remand order.
verizon and the dte filed motions for partial summary judgment in response,arguing that the isp remand order did not preempt the dte from imposing access charges for traffic,but dealt only with the narrow issue of reciprocal compensation for calls within a local calling area.
on september,the district court granted verizon and the dte motions for partial summary judgment.the district court correctly noted that it was unclear whether the isp remand order preempted state commissions from imposing access charges on all traffic.but it did not reach the merits of that question it held that since global naps voluntarily sought arbitration by dte after the fcc issued the isp remand order and thus impliedly consented to dte jurisdiction over its petition,it may not now challenge dte authority on the basis of unsettled law in order to avoid the consequences of its own business strategy.
global naps appeals,arguing that it did not waive any claim regarding the preemptive effect of the fcc isp remand order or impliedly consent to the dte authority to decide the issue which had been preempted by the isp remand order,and so the district court erred in not reaching the merits of its claim and that this court should reach the merits and find that the isp remand order preempts the dte from imposing access charges for traffic 
the district court jurisdictional holding 
the district court conclusion that global naps could not obtain review of the dte preemption decision,because global naps had impliedly consented to the dte jurisdiction over its petition,was error.the issue of preemption was squarely presented to the dte,the dte decided this issue of federal law,and global naps challenged that decision before the district court.the district court should have reviewed the dte conclusion,as it would any other conclusion of federal law by a state commission.
global naps admits that in its petition for arbitration,it did not explicitly spell out its views with respect to intercarrier compensation for traffic but points to a number of instances during the administrative proceedings in which it did.in testimony during the hearing before the dte on october,global naps expert,lee selwyn,testified with respect to the vnxx issue as follows 
let me first preface my remarks on the vnxx issue by making the point that we are speaking here of traffic originating by verizon customers,terminating to global naps,that is not traffic.traffic is not subject to any treatment other than the arrangement as set forth in the fcc isp remand order.
in its brief to the dte after the hearing,global naps reiterated this point 
in the isp remand order,the fcc determined that compensation for traffic is solely within the jurisdiction of the fcc and that on a going forward basis,state commissions have been preempted from addressing the issue.thus the department has no jurisdiction to impose access charges or other limitations on isp traffic the arbitration order should be clear that the interconnection agreement is not intended to regulate compensation for traffic in any manner.
global naps made the same argument in its reply brief to the dte and in a february,letter to the dte after the dte issued its december,order.the dte rejected these arguments,requiring global naps to pay access charges to verizon for vnxx traffic under the intrastate tariffs.
global naps also argues that it could not voluntarily consent to the jurisdiction of the dte to determine access charges,because the tca requires arbitration before the dte under b when negotiation leaves open issues,and because t he dte may not enlarge its own subject matter jurisdiction beyond that granted to it by the act and fcc rulings implementing the tca.neither may dte jurisdiction be expanded by agreement of dte litigants.
global naps use of the phraseology of jurisdiction may have led to some confusion.questions about federal preemption of state law in this context may or may not be properly thought of as jurisdictional in nature.wolf reliance standard life ins,cir holding that erisa preemption is not jurisdictional but a waivable affirmative defense.
in the end,however the claim is characterized,global naps properly presented an issue of federal preemption to the dte,and the dte rejected global naps argument.this does not mean it waived federal court review of the dte conclusion on that question.see global naps i,at t he federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to review state agency determinations under the tca for compliance with federal law,pursuant to.united states insurers insolvency fund,cir a federal preemption ruling presents a pure question of law subject to plenary review.
preemptive effect of the isp remand order 
we reach the merits of global naps claim,confining ourselves to the record before the agency.this case presents a pure issue of law and the parties have asked us to decide it.furthermore,we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.see,cir.
before reaching the merits of global naps claim,however,we must deal with an issue raised by the dte,but rejected by verizon,regarding the appropriate standard of review of state commission conclusions of federal law made pursuant to an arbitration under b.
standard of review of the dte determination of preemption issue 
the dte argues that judicial review of an interpretation of the tca by a state commission in an arbitration should be limited to the question whether the state commission interpretation of the tca is reasonable.the dte draws an analogy to the deferential standard of review given arbitral awards under the federal arbitration act faa,as expressed in cases like jci communications,international brotherhood of electrical workers,local,cir.
the dte argues that because congress used the term arbitration in b,we should treat state commission arbitral decisions with the same deference as arbitral decisions under the faa,which predates the tca.the dte points out that congress used terms other than arbitration to describe other types of actions taken by state commissions.
the dte position has no basis either in the tca,its legislative history,or in case law.the dte points to nothing more than the use of the term arbitration in the tca.the dte argument,furthermore,is in flat conflict with our holding in global naps i,where,in the context of review of a decision pursuant to an arbitration,we held that determinations of federal law by state agencies under the tca were subject to de novo review.see at.we noted in global naps i that e ach of the circuits that has addressed the standard of review under the tca has held that where the state agency determination rests principally on an interpretation of the tca,de novo review is applied.id.at.a number of circuits have reached this conclusion in the context of federal court review of state commission arbitrations under the tca.see,mci telecomms.ohio bell,cir de novo review of questions of federal law after state commission arbitration.bell.mccarty,cir same mcimetro access transmission,bellsouth,cir same.
the dte states that it does not seek consideration of broader questions than review of arbitration regarding the proper standard of judicial review for other determinations by state commissions under the tca.if we were to accept the dte position,it would create a strange result.the standard of review would vary not by the nature of the question presented interpretations of the tca but by the nature of the proceeding in which the question is presented.thus,under the dte view,a state commission conclusions of federal law when it is acting as an arbitrator under b would be subject to deferential review,but the very same conclusions about the tca made pursuant to other state commission proceedings,such as the e approval process,would be subject to de novo review.congress surely did not intend such an odd result merely by using the term arbitration in the tca.
we review de novo the dte conclusion that the isp remand order did not preempt its authority to regulate access charges for interexchange vnxx traffic.tower,llc plainville zoning bd.of appeals,cir holding that issues based on specified provisions of the tca present questions that a federal district court determines in the first instance without any deference to the local zoning board.
preemption 
the supremacy clause of art.vi of the constitution provides congress with the power to state law.pub.serv.comm fcc,d.may result not only from action taken by congress itself a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may state regulation.id.at.see also city of new york fcc,d i n proper circumstances the agency may determine that its authority is exclusive and any state efforts to regulate in the forbidden area.
in arguing for a broad reading of the isp remand order,global naps points to language in the order which suggests that all traffic is subject to the fcc jurisdiction.see,isp remand order,at w e reaffirm our previous conclusion in the internet traffic order that traffic delivered to an isp is predominantly interstate access traffic subject to the fcc jurisdiction.id,at finding that traffic is properly characterized as interstate access and thus is subject to fcc jurisdiction.even assuming that this language could cover the calls at issue here,it does not help answer the question before us.a matter may be subject to fcc jurisdiction,without the fcc having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state regulation.the question before us is whether the fcc intended in the isp remand order to exercise its jurisdiction over the precise issue here,to the exclusion of state regulation.see qwest scott,cir there is no dispute in this case that the fcc has the power to preempt states from establishing standards and requiring reports relating to special access services.the fighting issue is whether the fcc actually intended to do so.
in this context,the law requires a clear indication that an agency intends to preempt state regulation.hillsborough county automated med.labs,d b ecause agencies normally address problems in a detailed manner and can speak through a variety of means,we can expect that they will make their intentions clear if they intend for their regulations to be exclusive.see also qwest,at finding no preemption of state regulation where fcc regulations were notably agnostic on the question 
the requirement of a clear indication of the agency intent to preempt is especially important in the context of the tca,which divide d authority among the fcc and the state commissions in an unusual regime of cooperative federalism,with the intended effect of leaving state commissions free,where warranted,to reflect the policy choices made by their states.global naps ii,at quoting.telecomms.regulatory,cir.as we noted in global naps ii,t he goal of preserving a role for the state regulatory commissions is reflected in a number of provisions in the tca.id.at.
also relevant is congress express instruction that nothing in this chapter including,shall be construed to apply or to give the commission jurisdiction with respect to charges,classifications,practices,services,facilities,or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier.b see also.pub.serv.comm n,at.relying on b to find that the fcc could not preempt state law depreciation regulation.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.global naps does not challenge the dte determination that whether a call is local or interexchange should be based on the geographic endpoints of the call,or the decision to impose access charges on vnxx calls.rather,the challenge is to the dte imposition of access charges on that subset of vnxx calls that are bound for an isp.global naps argues that we should determine the scope of preemption by limiting our examination to the text of the isp remand order.verizon and the dte ask us to also consider the context in which the order was passed and the regulatory objectives of the order they argue that the fcc only intended to preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for local traffic and did not address the question before the dte.
regardless of which approach is used,the isp remand order does not clearly preempt state authority to impose access charges for interexchange vnxx traffic it is,at best,ambiguous on the question,and ambiguity is not enough to preempt state regulation here.
global naps can not point to any language in the order that explicitly preempts state regulation of access charges for the traffic at issue.instead,global naps central argument is that,in preempting state regulation of intercarrier compensation for traffic in the isp remand order,the fcc did not expressly limit itself to traffic originating and terminating within a local calling area.it suggests that the interim federal regime of intercarrier compensation established by the isp remand order actually applies to all calls,so that the preemptive effect of the order should extend to the access charges at issue here.global naps points in particular to paragraph of the isp remand order,in which the fcc stated 
the interim compensation regime we establish here applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements this order does not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here.because we now exercise our authority under section to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for traffic,however,state commissions will no longer have auth
