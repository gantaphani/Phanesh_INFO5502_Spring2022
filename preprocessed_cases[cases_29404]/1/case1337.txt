appellants and his parents,and,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the baltimore city board of school commissioners bcbsc and baltimore city public schools.they contend that section of the rehabilitation act of,section,compels bcbsc to provide educational services related to certain disorders even though d.is enrolled exclusively in a private religious school.they also claim that bcbsc requirement that attend a public school in order to receive section services is unconstitutionally burdensome on their right to make educational decisions under wisconsin yoder,d,and pierce society of sisters.because we do not read section to apply an affirmative obligation on school districts to provide services to private school students and because appellants retain full educational discretion,we affirm the district court ruling.
who was in eighth grade when he and his parents filed this case in,has suffered from difficulties with attentiveness,focus,and impulsivity since he was in kindergarten.in,parents brought him to a specialist who diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and anxiety.in,bcbsc determined that did not qualify for services under the individuals with disabilities education act,idea,but that he was eligible under section.however,bcbsc informed parents that they could not provide section services unless enrolled in one of the district public schools.because maryland law does not permit simultaneous dual enrollment in a private and public school,would have had to withdraw from his yeshiva a private religious school he attended at the time to enroll in a local public school.
parents challenged bcbsc position before a hearing examiner appointed by bcbsc.after the examiner decided that section does not require that bcbsc allow to access special education services while enrolled in a school,the parents brought suit in the united states district court of maryland.bcbsc filed a motion for summary judgment,and and his parents responded with their own motion for partial summary judgment.on august,the court granted bcbsc motion and denied appellants.appellants timely appealed

section states that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.the implementing regulations for section require that public schools make a fape available to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient jurisdiction a.an appropriate education includes provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons b.as long as the public schools make a fape available,they bear no obligation to pay for a child education in a private school.c.
appellants argue that these regulations mandate that bcbsc provide with a fape at a public school even while he continues to enroll in and attend a private school.they read the language,provide each section eligible student within its jurisdiction with a fape to mean that public schools need to go further than just making the education available.see a.
the plain language of the statute and the regulations does not make clear whether public schools are required to provide services to students enrolled in private schools.while c does state that public schools need not finance a child education in private school,it is unclear whether the term education here encompasses special education services.appendix a to part of the regulations provides some clarification,i f a recipient offers adequate services and if alternate placement is chosen by a student parent or guardian,the recipient need not assume the cost of the outside services.app.however,while the appendix explains that a public school need not pay for services when a parent accesses those services from a provider other than the public school,it does not answer whether a private school student can access those services from the public school itself.
the department of education office for civil rights issued a direct clarification of the disputed regulation in an opinion letter.ocr response to veir inquiry re various matters,idelr letter to veir.letter to veir states,in part,w here a district has offered an appropriate education,a district is not responsible under section,for the provision of educational services to students not enrolled in the public education program based on the personal choice of the parent or guardian.id.appellants attempt to parry letter to veir by arguing that it is a response to questions related to the provision of services at home for a homeschooled student whereas is willing to come to the public school to receive services.however,while the question posed to ocr in letter to veir does specifically request clarification about whether a public school must provide services at home,ocr does not similarly cabin its response.
where a regulation is ambiguous we must grant deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation.auer robbins,d see also christensen harris,d humanoids grp.rogan,cir.we grant auer deference even when the agency interpreting its regulation issues its interpretation through an informal process,such as an opinion letter.humanoids,at bassiri xerox,cir department of labor interpretation of its own regulations as explained in opinion letters deserved auer deference.where an agency has made an interpretation of its own regulation,as the department of education has done in letter to veir,that interpretation is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see auer,at.
a comparison of idea and section lends support to letter to veir interpretation of c.a requirement that extends to provision of services while students are enrolled in private schools creates an inescapable conflict with the limitations that congress placed on school district responsibilities under idea.before congress amended idea in,courts had interpreted idea as granting eligible children enrolled in private schools an individual right to special education and services.foley special sch.dist.of louis,cir.the amendments,however,clarified that states only had to allocate a proportionate amount of funds received from the federal government to eligible students in private schools a a i.the amendments and related regulations established that n o private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school.under appellants interpretation of section,however,school districts would have to provide and fully fund services that an eligible private school student requested under a section plan.because all students who are eligible for services under idea are also covered for those services under section,this scenario would entitle all students in a private school to full services using section.see letter to williams,idelr osep.in other words,appellants interpretation of section would create an individual right to special education and related services where none exists.this interpretation flies directly in the face of the limitations that congress imposed on school districts obligations under idea by reading an affirmative obligation into section,an antidiscrimination statute.see sellers sch.bd.of city of manassas,cir.
nonetheless,appellants argue that section must be interpreted broadly because it is a remedial statute.see consol.rail darrone,d stating that section has a remedial purpose.indeed,the su
