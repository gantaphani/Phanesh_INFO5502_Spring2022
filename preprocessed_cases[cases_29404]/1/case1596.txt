an immigration judge found petitioner john nyakundi omari removable,but granted him a discretionary cancellation of removal.the government appealed this decision to the board of immigration appeals,which reversed the ij and ordered omari removed to kenya.omari now petitions this court to vacate the bia order on four separate grounds.but omari has never properly presented any of the issues he now raises to the bia,despite the opportunity to do so.as d requires that a petitioner exhaust all administrative remedies available as of right for this court to have jurisdiction over an issue,omari failure to raise these issues before the bia jurisdictionally bars us from addressing them.
ordinarily,such a failure to raise an issue before the bia would end our inquiry.but omari makes two arguments that warrant consideration.first,he asserts that he not all pertinent issues before the bia,such that the bia had adequate notice to satisfy exhaustion.second,omari alternatively asks that we excuse his failure to exhaust.we find both arguments unavailing allowance of effective exhaustion runs contrary to the purposes of d,and,at least after the supreme court decision in bowles russell,d,we do not have the authority to excuse omari failure to comply with a statutory jurisdictional mandate.
we therefore dismiss omari petition for lack of jurisdiction.as our decision turns on a procedural stumble committed in his second appeal to the bia,we set forth the history of omari case in some detail.
factual and procedural background 
omari came to the united states as a student in and soon became a lawful permanent resident.he later pleaded guilty to two unrelated criminal offenses a minnesota misdemeanor charge of assault the minnesota assault conviction and a federal charge of conspiracy to transport stolen goods in interstate commerce the federal conspiracy conviction.the government began removal proceedings against omari and issued him a notice to appear,eventually asserting three separate grounds for removal his federal conspiracy conviction was an aggravated felony,see a a iii his minnesota assault conviction was a crime of domestic violence,see a e i and both his minnesota assault and federal conspiracy convictions were crimes involving moral turpitude,see a a ii.omari contested his removability and also applied for cancellation of removal.see a.an ij found omari removable on the ground that his federal conspiracy conviction constituted an aggravated felony and did not address the other grounds for removal or omari request for cancellation.the bia later affirmed the ij decision.
omari petitioned this court to review the bia order.finding that the record did not establish that omari had committed an aggravated felony,we vacated the bia order and remanded the case for further proceedings.see omari gonzales,cir omari i.
on remand,the ij still found omari removable but ultimately determined that he merited cancellation of removal.the ij first concluded that,despite the additional evidence the government had introduced on remand,omari still had not been convicted of an aggravated felony.the ij instead found omari removable as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence and,alternatively,as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude.turning to omari application for cancellation of removal,however,the ij weighed the equities and concluded that omari merited cancellation.
the government appealed the ij decision to the bia,disputing the ij determination that omari had not been convicted of an aggravated felony as well as the ij discretionary grant of cancellation.omari did not file an appeal from the ij decision,but he did file a response brief that similarly focused on the aggravated felony and cancellation issues.the bia agreed with the ij that omari had not been convicted of an aggravated felony but reversed the ij conclusion that omari merited cancellation of removal.the bia determined that the equities did not weigh in omari favor and noted a potential child support arrearage of.the bia thus vacated the ij decision,denied omari application for cancellation of removal,and remanded the case to the ij for entry of an order of removal.
omari moved the bia to reconsider its decision.see b.in his motion for reconsideration,omari argued,inter alia,that he was not removable because his minnesota assault conviction was neither a crime of domestic violence nor a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia had erroneously found him to owe in unpaid child support,and the bia failed to give proper weight to factors meriting discretionary cancellation of removal.the bia denied this motion.it first noted that omari had failed to address his minnesota assault conviction on appeal and could not do so for the first time in a motion for reconsideration.second,the bia refused to consider new evidence concerning omari child support obligations,noting that a motion for reconsideration was not the proper avenue for addressing new evidence.third,the bia concluded that omari provided no reasons for reversing its determination that he did not merit cancellation.finally,insofar as omari motion could be considered one to reopen based on evidence of his actual child support obligations,see c,the bia found that omari had failed to show that this evidence was previously unavailable or that it demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.the bia thus ordered omari removed to kenya.
omari now petitions this court to vacate the bia order of removal.omari raises four arguments on appeal his minnesota assault conviction is neither a crime of domestic violence nor a crime involving moral turpitude,his federal conspiracy conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia engaged in impermissible factfinding,and the court should remand the case for a determination of whether he is eligible for waiver of removal under h.
ii.jurisdiction 
actual exhaustion 
as always,we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.omari i,at.and although we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal,a,under d,we may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.petitioners fail to exhaust their administrative remedies as to an issue if they do not first raise the issue before the bia,either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.see heaven gonzales,cir wang ashcroft,cir.this exhaustion requirement applies to all issues for which an administrative remedy is available to a petitioner as of right.mukasey,cir.a remedy is available as of right if the petitioner could have argued the claim before the bia,and the bia has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy such a claim.see mukasey,cir falek gonzales,cir.since exhaustion in this context is a statutory rather than prudential mandate,failure to exhaust an issue deprives this court of jurisdiction over that issue.wang,at see also roy ashcroft,cir per curiam.
minnesota assault conviction 
omari did not appeal the ij determination that his minnesota assault conviction was a crime of domestic violence and a crime involving moral turpitude.moreover,omari did not challenge this determination in his brief before the bia.his failure to do so is a failure to exhaust,jurisdictionally barring us from addressing the merits.
granted,omari did raise the issues regarding his minnesota assault conviction in his motion for reconsideration,but we find this insufficient to satisfy d.a motion to reconsider challenges the bia original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard.in re,bia see also b a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior bia decision.a motion for reconsideration is thus confined to the substance of the bia original decision.it is not the proper avenue for raising new issues or arguments,and a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied,at.instead,the party bringing a motion for reconsideration must specify the factual and legal issues raised on appeal that were decided in error or overlooked in the bia initial decision.id.emphasis added.in short,an issue raised for the first time in a motion for reconsideration that could have been raised earlier has not been properly presented to the bia.we therefore hold that improperly raising an issue for the first time in a motion for reconsideration does not satisfy d exhaustion requirement.
because omari did not initially raise any issues regarding his minnesota assault conviction in his brief to the bia and the bia did not address them in its order,omari arguments regarding his minnesota assault conviction were not the proper subject of a motion for reconsideration.as such,they were never properly raised before the bia.omari has therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these issues,and d jurisdictionally bars us from addressing them.
federal conspiracy conviction 
similarly,omari neither appealed nor briefed the ij conclusion that his federal conspiracy conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude.indeed,omari never addressed this the bia.omari has therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to this issue,and d jurisdictionally bars us from addressing it.
cancellation 
omari contends that,in overturning the ij grant of cancellation of removal,the bia committed legal error by making its own factual findings instead of properly deferring to those of the ij.as this argument alleges a legal error in the bia decision,omari necessarily did not address this issue in his initial brief to the bia.still,omari raises this issue for the first time before this court,and the bia has never had the chance to address it.this court and others have previously held albeit in unpublished decisions that certain allegations of bia error must first be brought to the bia in a motion for reconsideration.see rivas de williams gonzales,cir per curiam manan gonzales,cir.of particular relevance,the tenth circuit has held that allegations of impermissible factfinding by the bia must first be brought before the bia in a motion for reconsideration to satisfy exhaustion.see sidabutar gonzales,cir.along these lines,omari could have brought his allegation of impermissible factfinding before the bia in his motion for reconsideration,and we conclude that his failure to do so constitutes a failure to exhaust the issue.
this holding comports with our decisions on the necessity of raising new claims in a motion to reopen.we have previously held that when a petitioner seeks to raise a claim not presented to the bia and the claim is one that the bia has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy,the petitioner must raise the issue in a motion to reopen prior to resorting to review by the courts,at quotation marks and alteration omitted see also roy,at wang,at goonsuwan ashcroft,cir.in,for example,the petitioner asserted for the first time before this court that the vacatur of his criminal conviction mandated the vacatur of his order of removal.at.the petitioner explained that he never asked for such relief before the bia because the vacatur of his criminal conviction occurred beyond the time in which he could file a motion to reopen.id.we recognized that,because any resort to the bia would have been untimely,the only way that the bia could address the petitioner new claim would be through an exercise of its sua sponte authority to reopen a case for exceptional circumstances.id.at.we also acknowledged that a motion to reopen was not generally required to satisfy d.id.at.but we held that the bia sua sponte authority was an available and adequate mechanism for the bia to first address the petitioner claim.id.as despite the of asking the bia to act sua sponte,see wang,at required that a petitioner first present an issue to the bia through a motion to reopen for exceptional circumstances for that issue to be exhausted,at.
the same reasoning applies to motions for reconsideration.a motion for reconsideration specifies the errors of fact or law in a prior decision.see b.such a motion is an available and adequate mechanism for the petitioner to argue,and the bia to correct,any errors that arise in a bia decision.this is not to say that a motion for reconsideration is generally required for exhaustion if a party disagrees with the bia resolution of an issue previously raised before the bia,there is no need to reargue this issue in a motion for reconsideration.but where the bia decision itself results in a new issue and the bia has an available and adequate means for addressing that issue,a party must first bring it to the bia attention through a motion for reconsideration.
the issue omari now raises regarding the bia decision illustrates the reasons for this requirement.omari asserts that the bia contravened its own regulations by engaging in impermissible factfinding when denying his request for cancellation of removal.he thus asserts that the bia committed a legal error in its decision.this error involves an issue stemming from the bia act of decisionmaking,and was one that neither party could have possibly raised prior to the bia decision.but after the bia issued its decision,omari could have argued to the bia that it had engaged in impermissible factfinding in his motion for reconsideration.in other words,omari had an available and adequate means of presenting this argument to the bia before bringing it to this court,and d requires that he avail himself of it.if the bia had found omari argument meritorious,it could have corrected this error.yet omari did not make this argument in his motion for reconsideration.although he did argue that the bia erred in finding that he owed more than in child support,this argument challenged only the record support for the finding and not the act of factfinding itself.thus,omari never raised the issue of impermissible factfinding before the bia.because omari has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to this issue,d jurisdictionally bars us from addressing it.
waiver of removal under h 
omari seeks,as an alternative form of relief,to have this case remanded for consideration of his claim that he should be granted a waiver of inadmissibility under h.omari did not raise this issue before the bia in his brief or motion for reconsideration.again,omari failed to exhaust this issue and we therefore lack jurisdiction to address it.
effective exhaustion 
omari asserts that,despite the lack of any explicit mentioning of the present issues to the bia,he effectively exhausted his claims.he argues that the issues he briefed before and discussed with the ij and the bia were sufficient to give the bia adequate notice that he disputed the grounds of removability.moreover,omari contends that some of the issues he now raises overlap with one he did address in his brief to the bia,namely,the argument that his federal conspiracy conviction was not an aggravated felony.omari thus suggests that,even if he did not explicitly state his contention with all of the alternative grounds upon which the ij eventually found him removable,the bia had sufficient notice opportunities to issues he now raises.
we disagree,and take this opportunity to emphasize that parties must fairly present an issue to the bia to satisfy d exhaustion requirement.such a requirement has been an implicit necessity of our prior decisions.though rarely a point of emphasis,our cases on d have continually stated that a petitioner must raise,present,or mention an issue to the bia to satisfy exhaustion.see,at heaven,at roy,at wang,at goonsuwan,at.implicit in these repeated statements is the suggestion that d requires some affirmative action on the part of a party.such a reading is reinforced by those marginal cases where the sufficiency of raising an issue has been contested.in salinas gonzales,cir,for example,we held that a petitioner sufficiently exhausted an issue by presenting it in a form to the bia.similarly,in burke mukasey,cir per curiam,we held that a pro se petitioner general argument to the his conviction for possession of stolen property was not an aggravated the slightly more specific question of whether his conviction was a theft offense.and in hongyok gonza
