nathaniel craigmiles and several other plaintiffs challenge a provision of the tennessee funeral directors and embalmers act fdea that forbids anyone from selling caskets without being licensed by the state as a funeral director.licensing requires an applicant to undergo two years of education and training,very little of which,craigmiles argues,pertains to casket design or selection.the district court held that the fdea,insofar as it bars funeral directors from the retail sale of caskets,violates both the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.recognizing that the limitation neither affected any fundamental right nor discriminated against any protected class,the district court nevertheless determined that the restriction lacked a rational basis and therefore did not pass even slight constitutional scrutiny.tennessee appeals the district court order,arguing that the fdea at least advances several legitimate governmental purposes.we consider the state arguments below,and affirm the district court judgment.
the fdea requires all those engaged in funeral directing to be licensed by the board of funeral directors and embalmers,established by the fdea.see ann.when the licensing legislation was originally enacted in,the definition of funeral directing did not include the sale of caskets and other funeral merchandise,but was limited to the arranging of funeral ceremonies,burial,cremation,and embalming.in,the tennessee general assembly amended the definition of funeral directing to include the making of arrangements to provide for funeral services the selling of funeral merchandise,the making of financial arrangements for the rendering of the services,the sale of such merchandise.ann.a a ii emphasis added.
the requirements for licensure as a funeral director are more than administrative.applicants may choose one of two paths of study.they may complete either one year of course work at an accredited mortuary school and then a apprenticeship with a licensed funeral director or a apprenticeship.there is no specified curriculum for the apprenticeship,although the funeral director under whom the candidate is training must file a quarterly report with the board regarding the apprentice activity.after the completion of either of the tracks,the candidate must take and pass the tennessee funeral arts examination.
for the candidate on the mortuary school track,there is only one accredited school in tennessee,gupton college.to complete the required year at gupton,the candidate must take eight credit hours in embalming,three in restorative art,and in funeral service.although there was testimony at trial that portions of sixteen of the hours in funeral service classes pertain to caskets and urns,students testified that casket and urn issues constituted no more than five percent of the gupton curriculum.only of the questions on the tennessee funeral arts exam concern funeral merchandising,including various casket options,ftc regulations regarding the sale of funeral merchandise,and merchandise display.
craigmiles and his fellow plaintiffs operate two independent casket stores casket supply in chattanooga and the casket store in knoxville.the stores offer caskets,urns,gravemarkers,monuments,flower holders,and other merchandise items.the stores engage in no embalming or arranging of funeral services,cremations,or burials.neither of the stores has sought to sell caskets,and each,at least so far,sells caskets only after the death of the intended occupant.
the board issued a cease and desist order to both businesses,which barred them from continuing to sell caskets and other funeral merchandise.in the orders,the board declared that the businesses were engaged in funeral directing and employed no licensed funeral directors,thus violating the fdea.both businesses ceased operations on issuance of the orders.
craigmiles and the other proprietors affected by the cease and desist orders filed this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee.bringing the action under,craigmiles alleged that the fdea,insofar as it restricted the sale of caskets,urns,and other funeral merchandise to licensed funeral directors,violates the due process,equal protection,and privileges and immunities clauses of the fourteenth amendment.craigmiles requested that the court enjoin the enforcement of the fdea against businesses engaging only in the retailing of funeral merchandise.
the district court held that the application of the fdea to the plaintiffs businesses violates their due process and equal protection rights,but rejected the plaintiffs privileges and immunities clause argument.accordingly,the district court enjoined the board from enforcing the fdea against the plaintiffs businesses,with respect to the way they operated before the board cease and desist order.the district court did not,however,enjoin the operation of the entire act,its application to other parties,or even to the plaintiffs if their business activities changed.see craigmiles giles,d.
after the issuance of the injunction,the plaintiffs resumed operations.the state of tennessee now appeals and argues that the district court injunction should be dissolved.
the supreme court has established a tripartite rubric for analyzing challenges under the equal protection and due process clauses.when a statute regulates certain fundamental rights voting or abortion or distinguishes between people on the basis of certain suspect characteristics race or national origin,the statute is subject to strict scrutiny.zablocki redhail,d.to survive strict scrutiny,the regulation must serve a compelling state purpose and be narrowly tailored to achieving that purpose.ibid.the supreme court has identified other classifications,such as gender and illegitimacy,which are less suspect,and are therefore subject only to intermediate scrutiny,under which the regulation need only serve an important state interest and the means employed need only be substantially related to that interest.see alabama,d mississippi for women hogan,d.
all other regulations are subject to rational basis review,requiring only that the regulation bear some rational relation to a legitimate state interest.romer evans,d.even foolish and misdirected provisions are generally valid if subject only to rational basis review.as we have said,a statute is subject to a strong presumption of validity under rational basis review,and we will uphold it if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis.walker bain,cir.see also heller doe,d.those seeking to invalidate a statute using rational basis review must negative every conceivable basis that might support it.lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d.our standards for accepting a justification for the regulatory scheme are far from daunting.a profferred explanation for the statute need not be supported by an exquisite evidentiary record rather we will be satisfied with the government rational speculation linking the regulation to a legitimate purpose,even unsupported by evidence or empirical data.fcc beach communications,d.under rational basis review,it is constitutionally irrelevant what reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision.railroad retirement bd.fritz,d quoting flemming nestor,d.
all of the parties concede that rational basis review is the proper standard for evaluating the fdea.while feared by many,morticians and casket retailers have not achieved the protected status that requires a higher level of scrutiny under our equal protection jurisprudence.although the licensing requirement has disrupted the plaintiffs businesses,the regulations do not affect any right now considered fundamental and thus requiring more significant justification.nevertheless,the district court determined that the amendment to the fdea,to the extent that it required licensure as funeral directors for casket retailers,was not even rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.according to the district court,the amendment was designed only for the economic protection of funeral home operators.
courts have repeatedly recognized that protecting a discrete interest group from economic competition is not a legitimate governmental purpose.see city of philadelphia new jersey,d thus,where simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation,a virtually per se rule of invalidity has been erected.see also hood sons,du mond.energy reserves group,kansas power light,d distinguishing between legitimate state purposes and providing a benefit to special interests.at trial,the plaintiffs adduced evidence that funeral home operators sell caskets at prices substantially over total costs.the fdea has the effect,at least,of preventing individuals who are not licensed funeral directors from selling caskets,potentially at a lower price.in this case,the district court found that funeral home operators generally mark up the price of caskets to percent,whereas casket retailers sell caskets at much smaller margins.see craigmiles,d at.
of course,nothing in the fdea prevents casket retailers from becoming licensed funeral directors.however,dedicating two years and thousands of dollars to the education and training required for licensure is undoubtedly a significant barrier to entering the tennessee casket market.the question before this court is whether requiring those who sell funeral merchandise to be licensed funeral directors bears a rational relationship to any legitimate purpose other than protecting the economic interests of licensed funeral directors.
the weakness of tennessee proffered explanations indicates that the amendment adding the retail sale of funeral merchandise to the definition of funeral directing was nothing more than an attempt to prevent economic competition.indeed,tennessee justifications for the amendment come close to striking us with the force of a,unrefrigerated dead fish,united states searan,cir united states perry,cir,a level of pungence almost required to invalidate a statute under rational basis review.only a handful of provisions have been invalidated for failing rational basis review.see romer evans,d city of cleburne cleburne living center,d peoples rights,city of columbus,cir.we hold that this case should be among this handful.
tennessee claims that subjecting funeral merchandise retailers to the licensure requirement promotes both public health and safety and consumer protection.with regard to public health and safety,the state contends that the education and training required for licensure insures that those who handle dead bodies may dispose of them safely and prevent the spread of communicable diseases.the district court,however,was unable to find any way in which the application of the fdea to the plaintiffs promoted public health or safety.the plaintiffs,of course,would not handle the bodies,much less engage in any embalming services.as the plaintiffs businesses operated at the time of the board order,consumers after a relative death would simply purchase a casket from the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs would then deliver the purchased casket to the funeral home that would be handling the body.the district court did not enjoin the enforcement of the fdea to anything other than the retailing of funeral merchandise.
the quality of the caskets used potentially threatens public health.if the contents of a casket were to leak,visitors to funeral services and perhaps even ground water could be exposed to bacteria emanating from the corpse.at trial,funeral directors testified that such leakage was of particular concern when the decedent died from a communicable disease,or when the body was not embalmed.tennessee law,however,does not require that any particular type of casket,or any casket at all,be used at burial.it is perfectly legal in tennessee for to provide a homemade casket,for friends to give but not to sell a casket for use in burial,or for a body to be buried in no container at all.this lack of regulation of body disposal is no different for those who have died from contagious diseases.
the general assembly could have decided against direct regulation of corpse containers,choosing instead the placement of experts in the field to advise family members of the decedent in the selection of a casket.however,the requirements for licensure would not seem to make it more likely that the corpse would be placed in the safest possible casket.neither the board nor the general assembly has established standards for casket selection to which licensed funeral directors are held accountable.there is no evidence in the record that licensed funeral directors were selling caskets that were systematically more protective than those sold by independent casket retailers.see craigmiles,d at.indeed,the only difference between the caskets is that those sold by licensed funeral directors were systematically more expensive.ibid.
in fact,restricting sales of caskets to licensed funeral directors would seem to have an adverse effect on the quality of caskets.the licensing requirement does not require consumers to choose more protective caskets or funeral directors to recommend them.generally,however,the cost of more protective caskets is higher.if casket retailers were to increase competition on casket prices and bring those prices closer to marginal costs,then more protective caskets would become more affordable for consumers with limited funds and their use would likely increase.if a consumer were able to spend,for example,on a casket,a more competitive casket market would likely lead to that consumer procuring a higher quality casket.because nothing prevents licensed funeral directors from selling shoddy caskets at high prices,the licensing requirement bears no rational relationship to increasing the quality of burial containers.
tennessee also argues that the funeral directors education and training would increase their ability to advise consumers on which casket would be most protective in particular cases.however,the availability of casket retailers will not prevent funeral directors from continuing to dispense this advice.only the price of the caskets that the funeral directors may recommend might be affected.
the district court determined that there was no evidence of any public safety risk from a leaky casket,or a mere box for human remains.craigmiles,d at.the district court might be correct,but we need not take a position in this debate.even if casket selection has an effect on public health and safety,restricting the retailing of caskets to licensed funeral directors bears no rational relationship to managing that effect.
the district court also held that the licensing requirement was not rationally related to the state interest in consumer protection.the state of tennessee argues that the fdea closely regulates the conduct of funeral directors,preventing them from making fraudulent misrepresentations,making solicitations after death or when death is imminent,or selling a previously used casket.see ann.a.the penalties for violation of these provisions include the suspension or termination of the funeral director license.the state contends that if casket retailers need not be funeral directors,then the retailers would not be subject to these regulations and consumers would be at risk.
there are a few problems with this argument.first,some of the regulations in section b of the act are generally applicable to retailers already,enforced by civil and criminal sanctions.for example,it is not as if casket retailers would be free to engage in misrepresentation or fraud if not covered by the fdea.see ann.b.second,to the extent casket retailers would not be covered by the conduct requirements,it would be a symptom of the structure of the act,not the unconstitutionality of requiring licensure for casket retailers.the legislature could develop similar standards for casket retailers,or even make section directly applicable to casket retailers also,without requiring the licensure that is the subject of complaint.
these arguments about how the legislature could have developed a more carefully calibrated act foreshadow another argument for the act constitutionality.the overinclusiveness of the statute may simply be a byproduct of legislative efficiency.the state could have passed a mo
