backgrounda.procedural history 
plaintiffs abass and isatu bangura filed the instant lawsuit on march,claiming violations of the ina,the apa,and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment in connection with defendants denial of abass bangura spousal immigration petition made on behalf of his wife,isatu bangura.on may,defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or in the alternative,under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.the district court issued an opinion and order on march,granting defendants motion to dismiss.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on april.
substantive facts 
the banguras have been married for six years.they have two children and are expecting a third.this marriage,however,is bangura third marriage.prior to marrying bangura,bangura was married to ibrahim sesay,a citizen of sierra leone,and don chisley,an american citizen.bangura met her first husband,ibrahim sesay,while visiting the united states on a sixth month tourist visa in.her marriage to sesay was apparently brief,and on march,she married chisley.
two months after chisley and bangura married,chisley filed an spousal immigration petition with the immigration and naturalization service ins,seeking to classify bangura as the spouse of a united states citizen.chisley petition stated that bangura and sesay were divorced on july.the ins requested a copy of the divorce decree from bangura marriage to sesay,and chisley provided a document entitled certificate of final divorce from the national mosque of freetown in sierra leone.after being informed by the american embassy in sierra leone that the national mosque of freetown did not exist and that all divorce decrees are in english and arabic,the ins determined that the divorce decree was fraudulent.furthermore,a check with chisley employers established that chisley had informed them he was single and provided them with a different address for himself than the one he had given to the ins as his marital address.accordingly,on february,the ins concluded,from the foregoing and from the lack of joint personal properties,liquid assets,and liabilities that your marriage to the beneficiary is merely a poorly rehearsed attempt to evade the immigration laws for the purpose of obtaining benefits.ins priv.ltr.rul.
the ins gave chisley days to submit additional evidence however,chisley did not respond.on april,bangura sent a letter to the ins requesting that chisley application be withdrawn because she and chisley had separated.bangura now claims that she ended her marriage to chisley after learning that he fathered a child out of wedlock and concealed it from her.the ins issued a final denial of chisley petition on june,without responding to bangura request.the ins sent a letter to bangura on october,informing her of the formal denial of chisley petition but without indicating the reason for the denial.
bangura and chisley were divorced in maryland on february.subsequently,on february,bangura married bangura,who is a naturalized united states citizen.bangura filed an spousal immigration petition on behalf of bangura on may.the ins denied bangura petition on july,citing the earlier fraud finding from chisley petition the record is clear that the beneficiary had entered into a prior marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.accordingly,the petition you filed can not be approved,as the beneficiary is statutorily ineligible for the benefit sought.ins priv.ltr.rul.july,emphasis in original.bangura filed an administrative appeal from this decision,which is apparently still pending.
in addition to filing an administrative appeal of the denial of bangura spousal immigration petition,plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit in the district court.they contend that their rights were violated when ohio district director of the department of homeland security,mark hansen,used the fraud finding to deny bangura petition.plaintiffs argue that the administrative rules prohibit them from appealing the decision to the board of immigration appeals bia,and thus,collateral use of the fraud finding deprives them of procedural due process,interferes with their marriage in violation of substantive due process,and is contrary to the ina in violation of the apa.plaintiffs also claim that the fraud finding was not supported by substantial evidence.
defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because bangura has failed to exhaust administrative remedies on his petition,and on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief.thereafter,the district court dismissed plaintiffs procedural due process claim holding that although plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies on the ins denial of his petition did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction,it nonetheless rendered the exercise of its own jurisdiction inappropriate for reasons of judicial economy.additionally,the district court rejected plaintiffs substantive due process claim based on the fundamental right to marriage on the ground that plaintiff failed to state a claim.according to the district court,the issue is not whether bangura has a right to marry,but rather,whether she has a right to be granted legal residency through her marriage to bangura.plaintiffs now appeal the district court ruling.

jurisdiction 
the plaintiffs failure to exhaust their administrative remedies does not deprive this court or the district court of subject matter jurisdiction,and the district court abused its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs constitutional claims for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies in the name of judicial economy.where a statute requires a plaintiff to exhaust his or her administrative remedies before seeking judicial review,federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the plaintiff claim until the plaintiff has exhausted his or her administrative remedies.perkovic ins,cir stating that while exhaustion is prudential in most cases,it is jurisdictional where congress has placed it in the statute granting federal courts jurisdiction.however,the supreme court has long held that the exhaustion requirement is far from absolute.of paramount importance to any exhaustion inquiry is congressional intent w here congress has not clearly required exhaustion,sound judicial discretion governs.dixie fuel comm r of social security,cir quoting mccarthy madigan,d.exhaustion of administrative remedies may not be required in cases of constitutional challenges to an agency procedures.southern ohio coal office of surface,mining,reclamation and enforcement,cir.in the immigration context,several circuits have indicated that constitutional challenges to the ina and ins procedures and some due process claims do not require exhaustion because the bia does not have the power to adjudicate these claims.sundar ins,cir citing ins,cir akinwunmi ins,cir mojsilovic ins,cir rashtabadi ins,cir.
in this case,the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing in federal court.it is undisputed that no statute or administrative rule required plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies.see a ii providing that a petitioner may appeal to the bia hoang comfort,cir,abrogated on other grounds,demore kim,d noting that the ina only requires plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies in removal proceedings.thus,whether plaintiffs should be required to exhaust their administrative remedies is a matter of sound judicial discretion.see dixie fuel,at.here,requiring plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies does not serve the interests of judicial economy.although the bia undoubtedly could grant plaintiffs some relief and possibly render plaintiffs procedural due process claim moot,it does not have the authority to adjudicate plaintiffs substantive due process claim.akinwunmi,at.moreover,as discussed infra at section ii,this court must address the merits of one of plaintiffs apa claims.it does not serve the interests of judicial economy to dismiss plaintiffs claims for failure to exhaust when the federal courts must nonetheless hear other claims that are integrally related to the dismissed claims.therefore,the district court abused its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs procedural due process claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
failure to state a claim 
substantive due process 
the district court correctly held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief based on substantive due process.generally,a plaintiff adequately alleges a substantive due process claim where the plaintiff pleads that a statute or government action burdens a fundamental right and can not withstand strict scrutiny.kallstrom city of columbus,cir.montgomery carr,cir holding that government actions interfering with marriage are subject to strict scrutiny.in immigration cases,however,federal courts apply a much more deferential standard of review to substantive due process challenges even where the immigration law interferes with a plaintiff fundamental rights.fiallo bell,d.this court upholds immigration statutes so long as they are conceivably related to the achievement of a federal interest.almario attorney general,cir denying equal protection claim that involved the fundamental right to marry see also anetekhai ins,cir applying minimum scrutiny to a substantive due process claim that involved the right to marry barmo reno,holding a statute need only be supported by facially legitimate and bona fide reason where it burdened the right to marry.this standard may be even lower than rational basis review.fiallo,at.in fiallo,the supreme court stated,
appellants suggest that the distinction drawn in s sic b d is unconstitutional under any standard of review since it infringes upon the constitutional rights of citizens and legal permanent residents without furthering any legitimate governmental interest those are admittedly the consequences of the congressional decision not to accord preferential status to this particular class of aliens,but the decision nonetheless remains one solely for the responsibility of congress and wholly outside the power of this court to control i t is not the judicial role in cases of this sort to probe and test the justifications for the legislative decision.
id.internal citations omitted.but see azizi thornburgh,cir stating that the facially legitimate and bona fide reason test is the same as the rational basis test.
the limited role of courts in reviewing the substantive policy embodied in immigration statutes derives from the constitution grant of plenary power to exclude aliens to congress.see,landon plasencia,d noting that an alien initial admission into the united states is a privilege and wholly within the sovereign power to exclude aliens fiallo,at.galvan press.holding that while aliens may receive procedural due process,the court ability to review the substantive policy of immigration statutes is limited to review for rationality.the supreme court has long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments largely immune from judicial control t he power over aliens is of a political character and therefore subject to only narrow judicial review.fiallo,at.citations omitted.
in this case,the statute in question,c,easily withstands this deferential standard of review.section c denies aliens immediate relative visas when they marry american citizens for the purpose of obtaining residence.c.congress presumably enacted c to prevent immigration fraud,which is a legitimate federal interest.thus,c is conceivably related to a federal interest,and this court must uphold its constitutionality even assuming plaintiffs have established that it interferes with their fundamental right to marry.see almario,at.
ii.procedural due process 
similarly,plaintiffs failed to a state a procedural due process claim because plaintiffs failed to properly allege a liberty or property interest.the fourteenth amendment prohibits the government from depriving persons of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.the due process clause protects aliens physically present in the united states as well as citizens.landon,at.mathews diaz,d.due process rights only attach,however,once a plaintiff asserts a liberty or property interest.see also almario,at.to establish a liberty or property interest,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the constitution or a federal or state statute grants him a protected right.see almario,at.
in this case,plaintiffs assert that the constitution grants them a liberty interest in their marriage,and thus,that the government must give them due process before denying bangura a visa.while this court recognizes that the banguras have a fundamental right to marry,it does not agree with plaintiffs characterization of the nature of the government infringement.a denial of an immediate relative visa does not infringe upon their right to marry.as this court stated in almario,t he constitution does not recognize the right of a citizen spouse to have his or her alien spouse remain in the country.almario,at.
plaintiffs procedural due process claim in this case is indistinguishable from the claim that this court rejected in almario.in almario,this court addressed a challenge to h,which requires an alien who marries an american citizen while in deportation proceedings to live outside the united states for two years before the alien spouse is permitted to apply for an immediate relative visa.id.the plaintiffs in almario argued that h infringed upon their procedural due process rights because it presumed that their marriage was fraudulent without giving them the opportunity to prove otherwise.id.this court rejected the plaintiffs argument stating that t he constitution does not recognize the right of a citizen spouse to have his or her alien spouse remain in the country.id.
while almario rejected a procedural due process claim predicated on the right to marry,it did not address whether and create a property interest protected by the due process clause.the issue of whether and creates a protected interest in an immediate relative visa,however,is not before this court.plaintiffs complaint does not clearly allege that the ina creates a protected interest.similarly,neither plaintiffs answer to defendants motion to dismiss nor any of their briefs on appeal argue that the ina creates a protected interest.plaintiffs attempt to raise the issue during oral arguments is insufficient to present it for appellate review.see fed.pro.a requiring appellants to raise all issues in their briefs bickel korean air lines,cir.thus,this court need not decide the issue 
plaintiffs apa claims 
the district court held that plaintiffs waived their apa claims.because we find that the plaintiffs did not waive their apa claims,we address issues not discussed by the district court,namely,defendants contentions that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies plaintiffs lack standing to bring their apa claims and plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the apa.because we find that bangura does not have standing to challenge the denial of chisley petition,that neither plaintiff states a claim for relief based on the denial of bangura petition,and that bangura loses on the merits of her challenge to chisley petition,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs apa claims.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court dismissal for failure to prosecute under the abuse of discretion standard.carver bunch,cir.we review all other issues de novo because the district court did not reach them.
waiver or failure to prosecute 
the district court abused its discretion in holding that plaintiffs waived their apa claims.in a footnote in its opinion,the district court disposed of all of plaintiffs apa claims.the district reasoned that plaintiffs waived the apa claims by failing to address them in plaintiffs response to defendant motion to dismiss.in carver bunch,this court held that a district court abused its discretion in dismissing a plaintiff claims solely because the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.at.it reasoned that such a dismissal was akin to a dismissal for failure to prosecute,and thus,governed by the standard set forth in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.id.it then determined that in order for a district court to dismiss a plaintiff claims in response to a b motion,the district court must conclude beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,regardless of whether the plaintiff responded.id.quoting haines kerner,d.analogizing to a summary judgment motion,the court also noted that the federal rules of civil procedure place the burden on the moving party to demonstrate that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief.id.at.in this case,the district court failed to address whether plaintiff complaint stated a claim for relief under the apa and dismissed the apa claims solely because plaintiffs failed to respond to defendant motion.thus,the district court dismissal rested on impermissible grounds.
moreover,the factual basis underlying the district court determination that plaintiffs waived their apa claims is clearly erroneous.the district court states that plaintiffs fail to even mention their apa claims in their memorandum.op.or.granting mot.to dismiss,march.in fact,half of plaintiffs memorandum in response to defendants motion to dismiss is devoted to their apa claims and rebutting defendants contention that plaintiffs do not have standing to seek judicial review for their apa claims.
finally,the district court erroneously placed the burden on plaintiffs to demonstrate that they stated a claim for relief.as noted above,this court has determined that on a b motion,the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff failed to state a claim.carver,at.in this case,defendants did not argue in their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief under the apa.instead,defendants argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear any of plaintiffs claims and that plaintiffs failed to state a substantive or procedural due process claim.because defendants did not offer a single argument to support their assertion that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief under the apa,defendants failed to meet their burden of proof,and the district court should have dismissed defendants motion 
failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
plaintiffs failure to exhaust their administrative remedies does not deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs apa claims.the law governing the exhaustion of apa claims differs from that governing exhaustion in other contexts.it is governed by darby cisneros,d.section only requires a plaintiff to exhaust his or her administrative remedies where a statute or agency rule makes the remedies mandatory.see also dixie fuel,at.where an appeal is optional,however,the apa does not require a plaintiff to appeal prior to filing suit in federal court.darby,at.section explicitly requires exhaustion of all appeals mandated either by statute or by agency rule it would be inconsistent with the plain language of for courts to require litigants to exhaust optional appeals as well.
in this case,it is undisputed that the ina and its implementing regulations do not require plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking review in federal court.a ii providing that a party may appeal to the bia.this is because plaintiffs do not appeal an order of removal but the denial of spousal immigration petition.in contrast to orders of removal,the ina does not require aliens to appeal denials of spousal immigration petitions to the bia before seeking relief in federal court.compare id.with d requiring aliens to appeal to bia before appealing an order of removal in federal court.therefore,this court does not have the authority to require plaintiffs to appeal to the bia before bringing their claims under the apa in federal court.
section of the apa grants all parties adversely affected or aggrieved by a final agency action prudential standing to bring suit in federal court.a person is adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the apa if his or her claim meets the zone of interest test.credit union admin.first bank,d emphasis in original holding that the apa incorporates the zone of interest test fed.election comm akins,d holding that congress waives all prudential limitations on standing except for the zone of interest test when it grants aggrieved parties the right to sue.to meet the requirements of the zone of interest test,a plaintiff must establish that the interest he or she seeks to protect,is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by the statute under which the plaintiff sues.credit union,at.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that the zone of interest test does not require a plaintiff to establish that congress specifically intended to benefit the plaintiff.see also clarke securities indus.ass n,d the zone of interest test is a guide for deciding whether,in view of congress evident intent to make agency action presumptively reviewable,a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.in cases where the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action,the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.the test is not meant to be especially demanding in particular,there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff.courtney smith,cir.rather,the zone of interest test entails a two part inquiry.first,the court must determine what interests the statute arguably was intended to protect,and second,the court must determine whether the plaintiff interests affected by the agency action in question are among them.credit union,at.see also courtney,at.
in this case,both plaintiffs interests fall within the a and a zone s of interest,and thus,both plaintiffs have prudential standing to sue under the apa.congress enacted the immediate relative visa as a part of the immigration reform act of,as reprinted in.the immigration reform act of replaced a quota system based on national origin with a system based on preferences to relatives of citizens and aliens legally residing in the united states.id.at.the new system aims to prevent family members from being separated.id.at.reunification of families is to be the foremost consideration in order that the family unit can be preserved as much as possible,parents of adult citizens,as well as spouses and children,may enter the country without numerical l
