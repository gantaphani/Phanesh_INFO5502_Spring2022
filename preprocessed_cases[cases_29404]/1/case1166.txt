this case comes to us on appeal from the district court dismissal of claims and grant of summary judgment to the appellees in this case,the united states marshal service usms,the judicial conference of the united states,the united states department of justice collectively the federal defendants,and mvm,mvm.the appellants,john wilson,frank kryjer and donald jones,filed suit against mvm and the federal defendants bringing claims under,inter alia,the rehabilitation act ra,the americans with disabilities act ada,the due process clause and a plethora of state laws.they appeal the district court dismissal or grant of summary judgment only on the ra,ada and procedural due process claims.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the district court decision.
the factual background of this case is one that is becoming familiar in the many district courts that have faced challenges by court security officers csos to the process of medical qualification.based on the statutory obligation to provide for the security of the united states courts,a,the usms contracts with a number of private security companies,including its in this case,mvm.
mvm inherited an force of csos from its predecessor,united international investigative services uiis,that included a binding collective bargaining agreement cba that was reached between uiis and the labor union for the appellants in this case.the cba includes a provision that allows for the discharge of employees for just cause only.the cba further provides an informal procedure for resolving grievances and a formal procedure to be followed if the informal procedure fails to produce acceptable results.
the contract between mvm and the usms explicitly requires mvm to provide qualified csos for the complete safety and security of judges,court personnel,jurors,witnesses,defendants,federal property and the public.as part of the determination of whether a cso is qualified,the usms has substantial medical standards that a cso must meet.in,the usms,which reserved by contract the right to incorporate revised medical standards,implemented a new physical examination for csos,adding to the list of medically disqualifying conditions use of a hearing aid,diabetes and certain heart conditions.
john wilson,frank kryjer and donald jones the appellants were all hired by uiis under the terms of the cba and had been employed for a substantial number of years,and years respectively as csos.each was labeled medically disqualified by the usms.the usms found wilson medically unfit because he suffered from diabetes and faired poorly on cardiac stress tests.both kryjer and jones were termed medically disqualified based on their use of hearing aids.
prior to their termination,the appellants were provided with notice of their medical disqualification and an opportunity to respond with documentation from their own doctors regarding their medical status.if usms found that additional documentation insufficient to respond to its concerns,it contacted mvm,provided it with each cso official medical review form,and instructed mvm to terminate the appellants as csos and provide a replacement package.at the time the appellants were termed medically disqualified and subsequently removed from their posts as csos,mvm had no alternative positions available in the eastern district of pennsylvania.therefore,in addition to being removed from their posts as csos,the appellants were discharged for just cause under their employment contract with mvm.
after their discharge,the appellants pursued various avenues to grieve their termination.wilson union filed a grievance with mvm regarding his termination,which was denied at the informal stage of the grievance procedure.neither wilson nor his union pursued the grievance through the remaining steps.wilson also sent a letter to deborah skeldon,contracting officer for the usms,contending that he was not medically disqualified.skeldon merely put the letter in a file.wilson took no further steps with regard to the usms.
after his termination,kryjer union also filed a grievance with mvm.as was the case with wilson,kryjer grievance was denied at the informal stage and neither kryjer nor his union took any steps to pursue the remaining grievance procedure.neither made a complaint to the usms.
neither jones nor his union pursued any remedies for his discharge until all three appellants filed formal charges against mvm with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on july.thereafter,the appellants were each issued a notice of right to sue.
the appellants filed the current suit in the district court on august,claiming violations of the ra,the ada,the age discrimination in employment act,equal protection,and substantive and procedural due process,as well as several state law claims for breach of contract and concert of action.on april,the district court granted the federal defendants and mvm motion to dismiss in part.among its many rulings,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the appellants ra claims against the federal defendants because,under the test articulated in community for creative reid,d,the usms was not the appellants employer.the district court also dismissed the appellants procedural due process claim against the federal defendants,finding that the appellants had no property interest in continued employment with mvm and hence could not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.b.
after denying the appellants motion for reconsideration,the district court rejected the appellants remaining claims on may,granting summary judgment to the federal defendants and mvm.the district court further elucidated its reasons for dismissing the procedural due process claims against the federal defendants,stating that even if the appellants had a property interest in continued employment with mvm,the usms was not the proximate cause of the loss of that property interest,or,alternatively,that the usms had provided sufficient process.the district court then proceeded to grant mvm summary judgment on the appellants due process claim against it,because,even if mvm was an arm of the government,the appellants had failed to make use of the process that was available to them,thereby barring their claims.it also found that mvm did not violate the ada because mvm did not believe the appellants were impaired within the meaning of the statute.
this appeal followed.

the appellants first argument on appeal is that the district court improperly dismissed their ra claims for lack of jurisdiction.section of the ra allows recovery of monetary damages by employees of the federal government who have suffered disability discrimination.much has been written on the issue of whether an individual who is technically employed by a private employer can also be a federal employee for the purposes of the ra.courts have struggled over what test to adopt to determine whether this kind of joint employment existed.some courts have adopted the joint employment test,which we have employed in other contexts.see labor relations bd.indus.of,cir graves lowery,cir.the joint employment test asks whether one employer while contracting in good faith with an otherwise independent company,has retained for itself sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment of the employees who are employed by the other employer,at.other courts,including the district court in this case,have adopted the hybrid test,based on the supreme court decision in reid,d,which balances thirteen factors to determine whether the federal agency had the right to control the means and manner of the employee performance.
most recently,the district court for the district of columbia adopted the use of the joint employer test and determined that csos are federal employees for the purposes of.int l union clark,wl,dist.lexis.in doing so,it has joined a number of other courts that have made similar determinations,albeit in unreported cases.see,strolberg akal security,dist.lexis gunnels akal security,no,walton marshall service.however,we need not reach the issue of which test to employ to determine whether the csos were federal employees or whether the district court determination was appropriate under the reid test.the appellants claims fail on exhaustion grounds.
section a of title provides the appropriate pathways by which a plaintiff may pursue an ra claim,adopting the procedures set forth in title vii of the civil rights act 
the remedies,procedures,and rights set forth in section of the civil rights act of,including the application of sections f through k f through k,shall be available,with respect to any complaint under section of this title,to any employee or applicant for employment aggrieved by the final disposition of such complaint,or by the failure to take a final action on such complaint.
a.the incorporation of the civil rights act includes the incorporation of the prerequisite exhaustion of administrative remedies.before an aggrieved employee may bring an ra claim in court against a federal employer,he must file a claim with the eeoc.only after filing this initial claim may he seek to vindicate his rights in front of a judge and jury.
as in other contexts,under the ra,exhaustion of administrative remedies serves to promote administrative efficiency,respect executive autonomy by allowing an agency the opportunity to correct its own errors,provide courts with the benefit of an agency expertise,and serve judicial economy by having the agency compile the factual record.robinson dalton,cir quoting heywood cruzan motors,cir.therefore,a court need not pass upon the merits of a plaintiff substantive claim until it satisfies itself that the claim is properly before it,including determining whether the plaintiff properly exhausted administrative remedies.
the parties before us do not contend that exhaustion is not a requirement of the ra or that the appellants filed the appropriate claims against the usms with the eeoc.it is clear from the statute and the law of this court that a plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a claim under the ra.spence straw,cir see also freed consolidated rail,cir.it is also clear that the appellants did not fully exhaust their administrative remedies.rather,the parties dispute the nature of the exhaustion requirement.at oral argument the appellants claimed that any further use of the administrative process would have been futile the federal defendants have claimed that exhaustion is a jurisdictional requirement that is not subject to a futility exception.
the parties arguments bring to bear the distinction between prudential exhaustion and jurisdictional exhaustion.a prudential exhaustion requirement is generally judicially created,aimed at respecting agency autonomy by allowing it to correct its own errors.robinson,at.because of its nature,prudential exhaustion can be bypassed under certain circumstances,including waiver,estoppel,tolling or futility.see id.at cbs,cir.jurisdictional exhaustion,however,is a prerequisite to a court subject matter jurisdiction.regardless of whether there is a compelling reason a plaintiff failed to exhaust,a court is without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff claim.nyhuis reno,cir.the question that now confronts us is whether the ra exhaustion requirement is prudential or jurisdictional,thus barring appellants claims even in the face of futility claims.
in zipes trans world airlines,the supreme court ruled that timely exhaustion of title vii administrative remedies was not jurisdictional,d.it is a requirement that,like a statute of limitations,is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.id.this court has repeatedly held the same.in robinson,we stated 
although the district court in this case described its preliminary evaluation as jurisdictional,this court has previously determined that questions of whether a plaintiff has timely exhausted the administrative remedies in title vii actions are in the nature of statutes of limitation.they do not affect the district court subject matter jurisdiction.
robinson,at see also hornsby postal service,cir the time limits in title vii are in the nature of statutes of limitation.they do not affect the district court subject matter jurisdiction.
a number of our sister circuits who have commented upon the nature of title vii exhaustion requirements have read zipes narrowly,finding that it applies only to cases involving failure to timely exhaust.while failure to timely exhaust is prudential,they have held that complete failure to exhaust is a jurisdictional bar.see sizova inst.of standards,cir distinguishing between failure to timely exhaust and complete failure to exhaust,finding the latter to be a jurisdictional bar davis north carolina dep t of,cir before a federal court may assume jurisdiction over a claim under title vii,however,a claimant must exhaust the administrative procedures bullard sercon,cir internal citations omitted but title vii strong policy of encouraging conciliation,and of giving states that have laws a chance to deal with discrimination before federal intervention,argues for treating title vii exhaustion requirements as jurisdictional.
the federal defendants argue that our cases follow the reasoning of these circuits,and that we should see the exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional.they argue that robinson and hornsby dealt solely with whether exhaustion was timely,not whether an employee had failed to exhaust administrative remedies at all.however,the federal defendants argument fails to take into consideration this court decision in waiters parsons,cir.in that case,the plaintiff did not pursue any administrative remedies before filing her suit.id.at.while we ultimately disposed of the case on different grounds,we clearly articulated the nature of administrative remedies.based on the supreme court holding in zipes,we stated that the plaintiff,who had pursued no administrative remedies,was not jurisdictionally barred.rather,should we decide on the exhaustion grounds alone,we would have to remand to the district court to consider the doctrines of waiver,estoppel and tolling.id.at.
therefore,we have clearly rejected a distinction between failure to timely exhaust and complete failure to exhaust in title vii cases.we said as much in robinson moreover,in title vii cases courts are permitted in certain limited circumstances to equitably toll filing requirements,even if there has been a complete failure to file,which necessarily precludes characterizing such requirements as jurisdictional.robinson,at see also williams runyon,cir in title vii actions,failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense in the nature of statute of limitations.
in its recent opinion in spinelli,the circuit,while recognizing the nonjurisdictional nature of title vii exhaustion requirements,still found that failure to exhaust administrative remedies in the ra context was jurisdictional.the circuit pointed out that a states that the statute limits judicial review to employees aggrieved by the final disposition of their administrative complaint.spinelli goss.accordingly,because a court may not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements the court found the exhaustion requirement was
