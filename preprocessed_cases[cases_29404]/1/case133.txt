born in the dominican republic in,vladimir perez santana immigrated to the united states and became a lawful permanent resident lpr in.in march,perez santana pled guilty in state court to one charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.he received a probationary sentence.
the department of homeland security dhs placed perez santana into removal proceedings and found him both removable and ineligible for discretionary relief.after the agency ordered his removal,perez santana sought vacatur of his criminal conviction on constitutional grounds.successful in this effort,he then filed a motion to reopen his proceedings before the board of immigration appeals bia,seeking vacatur of his order of removal as well.by the time he sought reopening,however,perez santana had already been removed to the dominican republic.the bia denied his motion,invoking a regulation known as the bar,which precludes a noncitizen from filing a motion to reopen subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.d.
perez santana petitions for our review,contending,inter alia,that the bar conflicts with the clear language of the immigration statute,which grants a n alien the right to file a single motion to reopen.c.we agree.the bar can not prevent a noncitizen from invoking his statutory right to file a motion to reopen.we therefore grant perez santana petition.
the facts of this case are straightforward.perez santana was born in the dominican republic in.when he was nine years old,he immigrated to the united states with his family as an lpr.on march,perez santana pleaded guilty in massachusetts state court to one charge of possession with intent to distribute a class d substance,namely,marijuana.he was sentenced to one year of probation.
on september,perez santana was issued a notice to appear for removal proceedings,which charged that his criminal conviction was a drug trafficking aggravated felony under the immigration statute.see a b,a a iii.three months later,the immigration judge ij found perez santana removable on the basis of his conviction,and also determined that because the conviction constituted an aggravated felony,he was ineligible for relief from removal.see a requiring that applicant for cancellation of removal for lprs must not be convicted of any aggravated felony.perez santana sought review before the bia,which applied its prior precedent on this subject and dismissed his appeal see matter of castro rodriguez,bia.the bia order was entered,and perez santana removal became final on april.
on may,perez santana filed a motion to withdraw his plea in the massachusetts state courts.he contended that under the supreme court decision in padilla kentucky,his plea was taken in violation of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel because he was not informed of the potential immigration consequences of his conviction.
while perez santana sought vacatur of his criminal conviction,he also sought to stay his removal before the dhs.sometime in may,dhs denied his request for a stay and deported him to the dominican republic on may,
on july,after initially denying perez santana motion to withdraw his plea,the massachusetts court reconsidered and granted his motion.perez santana immediately filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings before the bia,days after his removal became final.he argued that because his criminal conviction was now vacated,it could no longer serve as a ground for his removal.
on september,the bia returned perez santana motion to the ij without further action,concluding that the bar prevented him from filing a motion to reopen once he departed the united states.see d see also id.b.the bia also relied on its prior opinion in matter of armendarez mendez,bia,which held that the bar divested it of jurisdiction to consider a motion to reopen filed by a noncitizen subsequent to his departure from the united states.
perez santana timely sought review before this court of the denial of his motion to reopen 
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.bead holder,cir.under this standard,the petitioner must demonstrate that the bia committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary,capricious,or irrational way.id.quoting raza gonzales,cir.perez santana primary contention is that the agency committed a legal error when it concluded that the bar divested it of the ability to consider his motion to reopen.our review of legal questions is de novo,with deference given to the bia reasonable interpretations of statutes and regulations falling within its purview.aponte holder,cir quoting matos santana holder,cir.
a.the motion to reopen statute and the post departure bar 
the motion to reopen is an important safeguard intended to ensure a proper and lawful disposition of immigration proceedings.kucana holder,quoting dada mukasey.the procedure is codified in a statute,c a,which provides that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.the statute expressly prescribes other requirements,including that the motion state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,id.c b,that the motion be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material,and that the motion be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,id.c c i.importantly,the statute does not denominate a physical presence or geographic limitation in its general provisions.
the statute carves out certain exceptions to these general requirements.applicants for asylum,for example,are exempt from the time limit if their application is based on evidence of changed country conditions in the country to which they are to be removed,and if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been previously discovered or presented.id.c c ii.there is also a special rule for battered spouses,which extends the filing deadline to one year and waives the numerical limitation.id.c a,c c iv.in contrast to the statute general provisions,the special rule for battered spouses requires the noncitizen to be physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.id.c c iv iv.
in its current form,the bar comprises two separate regulations,one of which applies to motions filed before the bia and the other to motions filed before the ij.see d bia id.b ij.though codified in different sections,the regulations contain the same language 
a motion to reopen shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal,deportation,or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
d see also id.b.
the bia has published a precedential opinion upholding the bar validity.in matter of armendarez mendez,the bia construed the bar as a limitation on its own jurisdiction and decided that the agency therefore lacked the power to entertain motions to reopen filed by noncitizens who had departed the united states.at.
pena muriel and subsequent litigation concerning the post departure bar 
this case is not the first time we have addressed the validity of the bar.in pena muriel gonzales,cir,the petitioner asserted that the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira abrogated the regulation we now know as the bar.this is true,the petitioner asserted,because iirira repealed statutory provision c repealed by,title iii,b,stat.the repealed statute precluded a federal court from reviewing a n order of deportation if the alien has departed from the united states after the issuance of the order.c.
pena muriel contended that the bar was inextricably linked with this judicial review provision,and that its deletion signaled congress intent that the government should cease enforcing the regulation as well.pena muriel,at.we disagreed,explaining that t he attorney general authority to prohibit consideration of motions to reopen from aliens who have departed the united states did not originally depend upon the statutory language in c.id.thus,that provision repeal did not,by extension,abrogate the bar.id.
pena muriel petitioned for rehearing en banc,arguing that the text of the motion to reopen statute unambiguously gave a noncitizen the right to file a motion to reopen regardless of the noncitizen geographic location at time of filing.see c a.pena muriel contention,raised for the first time via his petition,relied on a statutory provision separate from the repealed judicial review provision he invoked in the merits briefing.see part,infra.in our order denying the petition,we observed that w hen this case was presented to the panel,petitioner had presented only one statutory argument.pena muriel gonzales,cir.we added that,n ot having been asked to do so,we did not decide whether the bar conflicted with the motion to reopen statute,and we declined to resolve the question on rehearing.id.as a result,the parties agree that our opinion in pena muriel does not control the outcome of this case.
since we decided pena muriel,the validity of the bar has been the subject of substantial litigation in the federal courts of appeals.six of our sister circuits have held that the bar conflicts with the clear language of the motion to reopen statute.see garcia carias holder,cir lin att y,cir contreras bocanegra holder,cir en banc unanimously overturning prior panel decision prestol espinal att y,cir reyes torres holder,cir william gonzales,cir.another three have struck down the regulation as an impermissible contraction of the agency jurisdiction,holding that the agency can not disclaim authority that congress has expressly conferred upon it.see luna holder,cir pruidze holder,cir marin rodriguez holder,cir.
as matters currently stand,the rule in every circuit to have addressed the arguments petitioner raises here is that the bar either conflicts with the motion to reopen statute,or can not be justified as a jurisdictional limitation.
c.the chevron analysis 
against that backdrop,we now address whether the bar is a valid exercise of the discretion conferred upon the agency by the immigration statute.resolution of this question requires that we apply the framework set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council.the chevron inquiry proceeds in two steps.first,we look to the statute to ascertain whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the statute is clear in its meaning,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.
the analysis begins with the statute language.in determining whether a statute exhibits ambiguity,courts look at both the most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the interpretive clues congress provided.succar ashcroft,cir quoting dynamics land,cline.we may also look to legislative history to see if any serious question even about purely textual ambiguity is left.id.at quoting dynamics land,at.
second,i f,after applying these interpretive rules,we conclude that the statute is ambiguous,we move to the next step of the analysis.saysana gillen,cir.importantly,we take this step only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.dynamics land,at.at chevron second step,the inquiry focuses on whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.if so,we defer to an agency interpretive regulation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.saysana,at quoting chevron,at.
perez santana contends that the plain language of the motion to reopen statute forecloses the agency from adding a geographic limitation to his ability to seek reopening of his proceedings.the government replies that the lack of an express geographic restraint should be construed as silence about the location of the noncitizen at time of filing.this silence,the government says,results in a statutory gap or ambiguity that the government is permitted to fill with the bar.
the statutory text 
looking first to the statutory text,the motion to reopen statute states that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.c a.the immigration statute in turn defines alien as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.a.thus,the provision unambiguously confers upon an alien the authority and the right to file a motion to reopen,in language that admits of no exceptions.see dada,t he statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.quoting c a.the relevant language nowhere prescribes,or even suggests,a geographic restriction on an alien who may file the motion 
the statute does describe other limitations and requirements on the right to file a motion to reopen,including numeric limitations,c a,evidentiary requirements,id.c b,and time deadlines,id.c c i.once again,these particular exceptions do not contain restrictions based on geography or the location of the noncitizen at the time of filing.the absence of such a limitation,despite the explicit enumeration of others,serves as a strong indication that congress imposed the restrictions that it deemed important and declined to impose others.united states johnson,when congress provides exceptions in a statute,it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.the proper inference is that congress considered the issue of exceptions and,in the end,limited the statute to the ones set forth.
moreover,the special rule for battered spouses does contain an explicit geographic limitation.that subsection,among other requirements,expressly requires that the alien is physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.c c iv iv.this provision shows that congress knew how to impose a geographic restriction when it wanted to,and further suggests that the statute general provisions do not contain such a limitation.see lin,at w e can draw the negative inference that congress knew how to include a requirement of physical presence when it wished to do so,and intentionally chose not to require such presence for a motion to reopen,except in the specified circumstances.quoting william,at.
the government arguments amount to nothing less than a request to write words into the statute that are not there.essentially,the contention is that we should revise the text of c a to say that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section,excepting other limitations that the attorney general may prescribe.the consequence of the government arguments is not limited to the bar.under its theory,the government possesses the discretion to impose other substantive limitations on a noncitizen right to file a motion to reopen that lack any foundation in the statutory language.we decline to adopt such a construction.
the regulation history as the source of the statute ambiguity 
the government primary defense of the regulation does not focus on the statutory text.instead,the government constructs a narrative of the bar long history and contends that,when read in light of this history,the motion to reopen statute is merely silent,and thus ambiguous,as to geographic restrictions 
a.the history of the motion to reopen proceeding and the post departure bar 
the proceeding we now know as the motion to reopen appeared as a form of relief in early twentieth century cases.see,ex parte chan shee.in,the attorney general through the immigration and naturalization service,included it in the federal regulations.see new regulations governing the arrest and deportation of aliens.a motion to reopen was treated as a matter for the exercise of the government discretion,and judicial interference was deemed unwarranted.dada,at quoting wong shong been proctor,cir.for a long time,neither the statute nor the attorney general regulations prescribed time limits on the filing of the motion.id.at.
in,congress became concerned that noncitizens were abusing the procedure by filing motion after motion in order to prolong their time in the united states.id.the legislature therefore directed the attorney general to issue regulations limiting the time period for the filing of motions to reopen,as well as restrictions on the number of motions that could be filed.id.although the attorney general investigated the issue and found little evidence of abuse,the department of justice issued a regulation imposing new time limits and restrictions on filings.id.citing executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings.this new regulation imposed a time limit,and restricted noncitizens to the filing of a single motion.id.
in,congress passed iirira,which altered numerous aspects of the immigration statute.one of these changes was the codification of the motion to reopen statute.id.at.in doing so,congress adopted the recommendations of the doj with respect to numerical and time limits,and clarified the procedure evidentiary requirements,see c b.the amendment to the statute did not similarly adopt the bar.
in light of the history of congress interventions in this field,the government contends that the emphasis of iirira codification of the motion to reopen statute was the time and number limitations enacted by the attorney general via the regulations.according to this line of reasoning,the statute is merely silent regarding the applicability of the bar,permitting the executive branch to fill the gap by prescribing geographic limitations on a n alien statutory right to file a motion to reopen.in other words,the government says that adopting petitioner argument would require us to find that the bar was impliedly repealed by iirira,notwithstanding the long history of the regulation and the lack of any express statutory repeal.
the government interpretive approach is a peculiar way to construe a statute.we have repeatedly observed that the chevron analysis begins with the statute words.see,saysana,at succar,at.starting instead with an exposition of the legislative and regulatory history is inappropriate in this case.although history can illuminate ambiguous language in some circumstances,relying so heavily on sources to read silence or ambiguity into seemingly clear text runs counter to modes of interpretation.
the government proposed methodology also carries certain dangers.as the third circuit has pointed out,this method manufactures an ambiguity from congress failure to specifically foreclose each exception that could possibly be conjured or imagined.that approach would create an ambiguity in almost all statutes,necessitating deference to nearly all agency determinations.prestol espinal,at.
moreover,the government would place upon congress,when enacting a new statute against a background regulatory scheme,the burden of addressing each and every regulation that existed before and expressly stating whether it survives the change in the statute.that argument is untenable.as the tenth circuit explained,t o require an express repeal of a discretionary regulation in this context would upend the fundamental principle that regulations should interpret statutes and not the other way around.contreras bocanegra holder,cir.instead,when faced with a legislative overhaul,agencies should recalibrate their regulations to ensure they maintain a statutory basis.id.
to be sure,the supreme court has sometimes required clearer statements of congressional intent depending on the circumstances.to that end,the government relies heavily on commodity futures trading commission schor,for the proposition that when congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change,congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by congress.id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
leaving aside any concerns we may have about the reach of this language,the principle articulated in schor does not apply to this case.until congress codified the motion to reopen,the proceeding was a regulatory creation,rather than a statutory one.in codifying the right,the legislature transform ed the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien.dada,at.this transformation took a significant degree of discretion out of the agency hands and vested a statutory right in the noncitizen.see coyt holder,cir congress amended the immigration and nationality act by,among other things,granting aliens subject to a removal order the right to file one motion to reopen.pruidze,at characterizing statute as an empowering,not a divesting,provision,as it grants the board authority to entertain a motion to reopen.and congress,by elevating the motion to reopen to a statutory right and carefully delineating its contours,instituted a pertinent change to any regulatory roadblock to the exercise of this right.prestol espinal,at congress nuanced consideration of which limitations and regulations to codify offers stronger evidence of congress intent than does congress alleged silence with respect to the regulation.in other words,the statutory changes are inconsistent with the notion that congress simply intended to stay silent regarding so substantial a limitation on the motion to reopen proceeding as the bar.
this is all the more true given the clarity of the statutory language.see id.w here the law is plain,subsequent reenactment does not constitute an adoption of the previous administrative construction.quoting brown gardner,see also brown,at c ongressional silence lacks persuasive significance,particularly where administrative regulations are inconsistent with the controlling statute.citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.here,congress intent is manifest,and we decline to inject ambiguity into words that do not allow it.
indeed,the facts of perez santana own case highlight the folly that results from the government attempts to conjure ambiguity from the statute plain meaning and coherent structure.as noted,the motion to reopen statute allows the filing of a single motion to reopen within ninety days after the final order of removal.c c.not coincidentally,iirira added a provision that requires the attorney general to effectuate physical removal of petitioners subject to a final order of removal within ninety days of the order.coyt,at citing a a.the bar places those statutory provisions in tension with one another by demanding the removal of noncitizens on or before the clock on their ability to seek reopening has run.see contreras bocanegra,at if we were to uphold the regulation,the department of homeland security would be permitted to unilaterally cut short the congressionally mandated filing period in almost every case.if the regulation no longer bars the consideration of a motion to reopen,this tension disappears 
as the supreme court has admonished,we should not adopt a construction of the statute which would,with respect to an entire class of aliens,completely nullify a procedure so intrinsic a part of the legislative scheme.dada,at second alteration in original quoting costello ins.here,perez santana order of removal became final on april,when the bia dismissed his direct appeal.thereafter,he diligently pursued relief before the massachusetts courts.a mere two days after obtaining vacatur of his plea,he sought reopening before the bia and asserted that the conviction that served as the basis of his removal had been deemed unconstitutional.this motion was filed days after his order of removal became final,and two days before the deadline to seek reopening.
in other words,perez santana did everything right he assiduously sought and obtained what relief he could before the state courts,and timely requested that his proceedings be reopened.unfortunately,his diligence was rendered useless due to the government exercise of its wholly discretionary authority to remove him from the united states.more fundamentally,that unilateral action precluded him from vindicating the right congress granted him.see reyes torres,at observing that petitioner had been forcibly removed seven days after the final order of removal was entered,and rejecting contention that
