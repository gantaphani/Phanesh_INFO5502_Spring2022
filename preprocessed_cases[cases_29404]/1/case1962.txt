that is the procedure we are following in this case.
is a native and citizen of the west african islamic republic of mauritania,a country of approximately three million people.his ethnic minority group,the black african fulani,comes from the southeastern part of the country,and senegal to the south.the state department country reports on human rights practices of february,at,states that successive civil and pursued various policies of arabization that involve discrimination,imprisonment and torture of members of ethnic minorities like the fulani and also that slavery of black africans still persists in some areas.at.the same report states that the government human rights record remained poor,unlawful killings by security forces were reported,the security forces reportedly used excessive force,beat,or otherwise abused detainees,restricted freedom of speech,the press and assembly and religion,discriminated against ethnic groups,and international reports continued that slavery in the form of involuntary servitude persisted.at.press reports after the state department country report in state that a military coup occurred august.see wikipedia,mauritania,at http.last visited,dep t of state,background note mauritania,at bgn.htm govtnote last visited.how those events have now affected country conditions remains unclear.
at the trial the immigration judge ruled inadmissible documents and witness testimony proffered by because they were not submitted ten days in advance under local rules,and so the judge ruled that,thus the case depended upon his testimony.at.the judge summarized as follows the testimony pointing to six discrepancies that led him to reject testimony.no discrepancies were found in his recital of the torture he received.all of the discrepancies are simply omissions to state a particular detail.none are lies in the sense of a statement opposite to or inconsistent with a prior statement 
discrepancy the respondent testified that he was a fulani,native and citizen of mauritania,who went to libya to obtain an education at the expense of the government of mauritania.he testified that,when the mauritanian government began to deport fulani and other black citizens from mauritania to senegal and to mali,the respondent protested and may have even formed an organization.the activities of the respondent came to the attention of the mauritanian ambassador to libya who summoned him to the embassy and told him to stop these activities.the respondent refused.shortly thereafter,the government of libya took the respondent into custody.in the personal statement found at exhibit,the respondent described being psychologically and physically tortured by the libyan government for his purported hatred of arabs.the respondent testified today that the libyan government only psychologically tortured him,but this is the first in a number of discrepancies which the court will comment on during the course of this decision.
the respondent testified that he returned to mauritania under compulsion and was taken into custody upon arriving at the airport and was then taken to a police station.the respondent testified that he was slapped by officers of the mauritanian government and accused of being a member of flam,and that he wrote lots of things against the law in the fulani language.the respondent testified that when he asked what it was that he wrote he was told that he would learn soon enough and the respondent testified that over the course of time he was tortured,including having electrodes applied to his genital parts and also being put into the jaguar position,which the court understands from previous cases to involve basically trussing a human being and holding him upside down.
the respondent testified that he wrote songs,poetry,and plays in fulani,but they were not published.he said that these songs,plays,and poetry were known to the authorities in mauritania and,at the request of the court,he recited a few lines of one song called unity of mauritania in which he lauded the importance of all mauritanian citizens to act in unity.
discrepancy the respondent testified that he was five months in jail and then moved from the jail at the fourth district of nouakchott to a jail called hundred meter jail,referring to the size of a typical cell apparently.the respondent testified that the hundred meter jail was a particularly bad jail and that this was a situation where he was required to live basically underground and he was either in darkness or had bright lights shown upon him.the respondent testified that he is required to wear eye glasses as a result of that,but he does not have a letter from a physician explaining how the injuries which he said he has suffered were caused.discrepancy.that is,the respondent has not presented any objective evidence concerning the necessity for him to wear glasses.
discrepancy the application for asylum states that the respondent was released in march and then is silent until a fear that the respondent following the break up of the ufd political party sic.this is to be contrasted with the testimony he offered today which was that after he was released from custody in he was held in a kind of house arrest between and and.discrepancy the respondent testified that he was living in the home of his cousin who has submitted documents in support of his application,see exhibits and.
discrepancy the respondent testified that he was required to report to a police station in nouakchott every monday and he was not allowed to leave the city.this does not appear in his.
discrepancy the government,on,introduced notes of the asylum officer at exhibit and the assessment to refer at exhibit.apparently,before the asylum officer he told about being required to report,but did not say anything about the second arrest which he testified about today.
discrepancy the respondent testified that on october,officers came to the house and picked the respondent up.he stated today that this so shocked his then wife,who was pregnant,that she ultimately died and this does not appear in the nor was it related to the asylum officer.indeed,the handwritten notes of the officer,at page,indicate that the officer asked the respondent if anything had happened to him after his release in.the respondent replied to the officer that nothing happened except that he was required to report and that he felt harassed by being required to report on such a regular basis.
at.emphasis added.the judge summarized his ruling in conclusory fashion,as follows 
to recapitulate,the contains no testimony about an arrest in or an earlier house arrest.the says nothing about the respondent being required to report every monday during his earlier arrest nor does it say anything about his wife dying of shock following an arrest of the respondent in and his being jailed for one month.
the asylum officer has no reason to be incomplete in his or report sic.the court finds that the assessment to refer is a reliable document and does rely on it,making negative credibility determinations against the respondent.
because of the confused nature of this record,especially as it relates to the various stories that the respondent has told before the tribunals of the united states government,the court can not conclude that the respondent has offered credible testimony today.
at.the reason that was unable to introduce any witness or documentary evidence corroborating his testimony was that his immigration lawyer at the trial did not understand or comply with the local rule requiring advance submission.the judge commented several times on counsel violations of the local rules,his ineffectiveness in conducting examination of,and the incompetence of his office in preparing for the trial.
we believe this case needs to be remanded for further consideration in a full and fair hearing with the counsel has now obtained on appeal or other competent counsel.in light of the recent coup,the earlier human rights conditions reported for mauritania,and the hostile treatment by government security forces of members of the fulani minority,retrial of claim is necessary.there is no indication in the record before us that the immigration judge or the board took cognizance of the dire human rights situation in mauritania or the mistreatment of the black african fulani by the government.if the country reports that explain the torture,slavery,and other human rights violations are unimportant or irrelevant to this case,we would like to have some explanation of the board views on this subject.see,mostafa ashcroft,cir remanding where the board opinion contains absolutely no discussion of the country conditions in iran and never mention s the state department reports included in the record zubeda ashcroft,cir remanding where the board opinion totally ignores reports from government agencies and human rights organizations that detail what appear to be country wide,systematic incidents of gang rape,mutilation,and mass murder kamalthas ins,cir remanding where nowhere in its opinion did the bia consider the documented country conditions in sri lanka which corroborate the widespread practice of torture against tamil males mansour ins,cir remanding where the board opinion failed to discuss a state department report detailing country conditions in iraq,and observing that had the bia addressed the report it might have viewed the applicant torture claim differently.
the judge and the board of immigration appeals did not find much of testimony lacking in credibility.in broken english explained that a translator wrote his original asylum petition and had left out details and that the asylum officer had cautioned him to keep it short.neither the immigration judge nor the board explains why they disbelieve this explanation for the earlier omission of details covering his wife death and the persecution he suffered upon his arrival back in mauritania after his initial period of imprisonment and torture.see,zheng gonzales,cir unpublished remanding where the immigration judge did not specifically address the applicant proffered explanations for inconsistencies nor state his reasons for finding the explanations to be not reasonable and not rational guo ashcroft,cir an adverse credibility finding is not based on substantial evidence when t he bia or the ij did not comment on an applicant explanation,nor suggest any reason that it found his explanation not credible.ins,cir noting that the bia is required to address in a reasoned manner the explanations that the applicant offers for these perceived inconsistencies.
in addition,the record discloses that counsel was clearly lacking in competence and diligence,as the immigration judge noted several times.at.as a result,witness testimony and documentary evidence purporting to explain why alleged fear of persecution was genuine and legitimate were excluded.had the board considered this evidence relevant to his fear of persecution in mauritania,it might have adjudicated claim differently.
may or may not have a meritorious claim for asylum.we can not,however,conduct a meaningful review where the board does not sufficiently articulate its reasoning nor evaluate the applicant claim on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.we understand that immigration officials and judges are hard pressed by case overload.we sympathize.federal appellate judges are confronted by the same problem.nevertheless,the policy of our asylum law is not to deport aliens who have a justified fear of returning to their native country.the combination of a coup in mauritania and uncertainty about present conditions,incompetent counsel,and questionable rejection of that seems plausible and consistent with known facts about conditions in us to vacate the decision of the board of immigration appeals and remand the case for retrial of the question of eligibility for asylum.if the board still believes after retrial that is lying,a more detailed explanation of its reasons for disbelieving the testimony is necessary.does the administrative agency disbelieve his testimony concerning his arrest in lybia,his testimony of torture upon returning to mauritania,and his imminent arrest just before he left the country if so,what facts are its contrary findings based on see,sylla ins,cir noting that an adverse credibility finding must be supported by specific reasons gao ashcroft,cir adverse credibility findings must be supported by specific cogent reasons.the reasons must be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.
accordingly,the decision of the board of immigration appeals is vacated and the case is hereby remanded to the board for further consideration in light of this opinion.

we have come a long way from these sentiments.instead,in the halls of our immigration courts today,the sentiments all too often are more like do let the door hit you on your way out.
there are no doubt many conscientious,dedicated,and thorough immigration courts across the country.unfortunately,their hard work is overshadowed by the significantly increasing rate at which adjudication lacking in reason,logic,and effort from other immigration courts is reaching the federal circuits.see,benslimane gonzales,cir this tension between judicial and administrative adjudicators is not due to judicial hostility to the nation immigration policies or to a misconception of the proper standard of judicial review of administrative decisions.it is due to the fact that the adjudication of these cases at the administrative level has fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice.rexha gonzales,wl,cir noting that horror stories persist of nasty,arrogant,and condescending immigration courts metko gonzales.cir martin,concurring although i am sympathetic with the difficulties faced by immigration courts and its caseload,it should be responsible for providing a complete and accurate determination on asylum claims.let us not forget the impact of these hearings on the lives of the individuals involved.the least we can ask of the immigration court is to provide a thorough and complete analysis for its determination beyond identifying minor inconsistencies,cultural differences,or language barriers.mece gonzales,cir the board failure to find clear error in the immigration judge adverse credibility determination leaves us,we are frank to say,more than a little puzzled.adam liptak,courts criticize judges handling of asylum cases,times,at 
the problem lies not only with the administrative courts,however,but also with the petitioners own counsel.this case demonstrates as much.ineffective assistance of in immigration proceedings,due process of much more attention in criminal cases.but,the inadequacy and carelessness of some counsel has allowed or facilitated some of the problems in the immigration courts.likewise,reviewing courts have been,in my opinion,unduly tolerant of ineffective counsel.unfortunately,the realities of the situation prevent certain checks on counsel in immigration proceedings.it is quite difficult for a deported petitioner to sue his attorney for malpractice or to file complaints with the immigration courts.and,asylum seekers are politically powerless,voiceless,and often at the mercy of counsel and the courts.the issue,therefore,requires some.the immigration bar would be well served by strongly considering whether to promulgate certain standards of,guidelines for the performance of counsel in immigration could assist counsel in representing immigration clients and also help the courts in evaluating counsel performance.although the immigration courts themselves have serious problems,it would be a disservice to claim that the problem lies only with the immigration courts.
fortunately,with regard to administrative reform,the attorney general of the united states recently acknowledged the problem in the immigration courts when he issued a memorandum to immigration judges and to the members of the board of immigration appeals and also ordered the deputy attorney general and associate attorney general to develop a comprehensive review of the immigration courts.the attorney general memorandum acknowledges that there are some immigration courts whose conduct can aptly be described as intemperate or even abusive and whose work must improve.whatever the impetus,see benslimane,at all that is clear is that it can not be in the interest of the immigration authorities,the taxpayer,the federal judiciary,or citizens concerned with the effective enforcement of the nation immigration laws for removal orders to be routinely nullified by the courts,and that the power of correction lies in the department of homeland security,which prosecutes removal cases,and the department of justice,which adjudicates them in its immigration court and board of immigration appeals,the attorney general reminder to those courts is a much needed one.to his credit,the attorney general stated i urge you always to bear in mind the significance of your cases and the lives they affect.to the aliens who stand before you,you are the face of american justice.not all will be entitled to the relief they seek.but i insist that each be treated with courtesy and respect.anything less would demean the office that you hold and the department in which you serve.this is a step in the right direction.a nation so concerned with freedom and liberty ought to accord a little more respect and dignity to those who seek from us that which we claim to be so proud to offer.
with these observations,i concur.
because i believe that substantial evidence supports the ij adverse credibility determination,and because i am unpersuaded that claim entitles him to a remand,i respectfully dissent.
adverse credibility determination 
the majority contends that a remand is necessary because the bia failed to credit testimony or his explanations for the various inconsistencies.its opinion,however,neither articulates nor follows the proper standard for reviewing an adverse credibility determination.adverse credibility determinations are findings of fact that must be reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard.yu ashcroft.cir.under this standard,we are not to reverse an ij factual determination as affirmed by the bia unless we find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.marku ashcroft,cir emphasis in original.the majority has apparently departed from this standard,remanding instead because the bia might adjudicate case differently if it emphasizes various factors that the majority considers relevant.
i also find unpersuasive the assertion of my colleagues that the board did not sufficiently articulate its reasoning nor evaluate the applicant claim on the record considered as a whole.op.at citation and quotation marks omitted.the record reflects that the opposite is true.in fact,the majority opinion itself cites instances in the record where the ij referred to various discrepancies as forming the basis for his decision.the ij decision was based not only on the incompleteness of the asylum application,as the majority opinion contends,but also on the fact that testimony was inconsistent with his personal statement attached to the application.these inconsistencies convinced the ij that had embellished his story,and ultimately led to the ij adverse credibility determination.
the majority opinion further criticizes the ij for relying on omissions as opposed to direct contradictions.op.at all of the discrepancies are simply omissions to state a particular detail.none are lies in the sense of a statement opposite to or inconsistent with a prior statement.my colleagues overlook,however,a major discrepancy concerning allegations of torture in libya,after claiming in his personal statement that he was physically and psychologically tortured in libya,testified before the ij that he was subjected to psychological torture only.such a discrepancy certainly goes to the heart of claim,see sylla ins,cir,considering that was relying on this evidence of torture to demonstrate his past necessary prerequisite to obtaining asylum.
moreover,this purported distinction between direct contradictions on the one hand and omissions on the other is not supported by our caselaw.see shkabari gonzales,cir holding that omissions may form the basis of an adverse credibility determination,provided that they are substantially related to the asylum claim citation and quotation marks omitted.in shkabari,the albanian petitioner applied for asylum on the basis that his leadership in the democratic party of albania allegedly led to persecution in his native country.the shkabari court affirmed an adverse credibility determination on the basis of two omissions shkabari testified at his hearing before the ij that he was the chairman of the albanian democratic party,yet his asylum application failed to mention a leadership role,and shkabari claimed at the hearing that he was afraid to go to the hospital because the rival political party controlled it,yet he stated in his asylum application that he was treated at a local hospital after the police burned him with scalding water.id.at.these omissions were considered major inconsistenc ies by the shkabari court because shkabari status as a leader of the democratic party,as well as his fear of the local hospital,greatly enhanced his claim of persecution.id.at.
here,as in shkabari,the alleged testimonial facts that were omitted in asylum application,if believed,would amplify his persecution claim.the last example of persecution reported in asylum application or in the notes of the asylum officer occurred in.testified before the ij,however,that he had been under house arrest from to,that he endured a subsequent arrest in,and that his wife had died as a result of shock from his arrest.prior to testimony,as the ij noted,his application and other materials portrayed him as a person who had existed in a perfectly normal manne
