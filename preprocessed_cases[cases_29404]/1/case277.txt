this appeal brings us face to face with two exotic creatures the american lobster and a claim that may or may not contain an embedded federal question sufficient to ground a claim of original jurisdiction under commonly known as federal question jurisdiction.cases of this sort require courts to venture into a murky jurisprudence.the answers are rarely black or white but,rather,more often doused in varying shades of gray.the difficult jurisdictional question presented here is no exception.
the underlying case began as a challenge to regulations promulgated by the rhode island department of environmental management dem.those regulations imposed restrictions on allocations for rhode island waters.the challenge to them centers on the dem alleged use of retroactive control dates in composing the regulatory scheme 
the dem thought that it was obliged to adopt the retroactive control dates by federal law.accordingly,it removed the case to the federal district court.the plaintiffs moved to remand,but the district court refused to relinquish jurisdiction.fishermen,dep t of envtl.mgmt.rifa i,unpublished order.the court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.fishermen,dep t of envtl.mgmt.rifa ii,wl,at.
after careful consideration of the plaintiffs ensuing appeal,we agree that the district court appropriately exercised federal question jurisdiction over the case.once the jurisdictional puzzle is solved,the challenge to the regulations is easily dispatched.the tale follows.
background 
we rehearse here the regulatory framework and travel of the case to the extent needed to place this appeal in perspective.
regulatory framework.
in,congress consented to and approved the atlantic states marine fisheries compact the compact,an interstate agreement among fifteen states including rhode island and the district of columbia.see,stat.all the signatories are situated close to the atlantic coast.
under the compact,the signatories are to exercise joint regulatory oversight of their fisheries through the development of interstate fishery management plans.see medeiros vincent,cir.originally,participation in any given fishery management plan was voluntary.id.in,however,congress implanted some teeth in the compact by adopting the atlantic coastal fisheries cooperative management act the management act,stat.codified at.
among other things,the new law made state compliance with fishery management plans compulsory.see b.it also designated the atlantic states marine fisheries commission the commission as the body that would prepare and adopt interstate fishery management plans.id.a.the commission works through management boards such as the american lobster management board to develop such plans.
once a plan is formulated and approved,each affected state is required to implement it,usually through the medium of state laws and regulations.see medeiros,at.the commission itself monitors compliance.c.if a state fails to comply with an approved plan,the commission may notify the secretary of commerce,who has the power to impose a moratorium on fishing of the relevant species in the waters of the noncompliant state.id.c.
in,the commission decided to take steps to combat rampant overfishing of lobster stock.in a determined effort to protect the supply of these appetizing arthropods,it adopted amendment to the interstate fishery management plan for american lobster.then,worried about especially rapid depletion of the lobster stock in area the waters off massachusetts and rhode american lobster management board engrafted addendum vii onto amendment.addendum vii requires these states to allocate lobster traps to fishermen based on each fisherman documented lobster catch during.see addendum vii.
in,the dem adopted regulation for the avowed purpose of bring ing the state of rhode island into compliance with addendum vii.the taking of lobsters in rhode island waters requires either a federal permit or a state license.see laws a.the state licensing scheme,in turn,involves allocations.see.under the new regulation,eligibility for a allocation depends,inter alia,on a showing i that the applicant held a commercial lobster license or federal permit for area at some time in the time frame and ii that he had documented lobster landings from traps in area during that time frame.id.
proceedings below.
distressed by what they perceived as the use of retroactive control dates in the new regulatory framework,the lobstermen clawed back.on june,the rhode island fishermen alliance,a trade organization acting by and through its president,richard fuka,and eight individual lobster fishermen steven riley,brian loftes,stephen mederios,greg duckworth,vincent carvalho,peter dibiase,robert morris,and andrew cavanagh filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against the dem and its director,michael sullivan,in his official capacity,in a rhode island state court.the plaintiffs alleged that the adoption of regulation violated the rhode island constitution and an array of rhode island statutes.
despite the fact that the complaint alleged only causes of action,defendants dem and michael sullivan invoked federal question jurisdiction,and removed the case to the united states district court for the district of rhode island.shortly thereafter,the commission and the rhode island lobstermen association,along with seven individual lobster fishermen al christopher,lanny dellinger,al eagles,aaron gerwitz,michael marchetti,harry towne,and russ wallace,filed motions to intervene,which were granted by the district court.the plaintiffs challenged the existence of federal jurisdiction and asked the district court to remand the case to the state court.the district court denied their motion.rifa i,at.
the case proceeded in the federal forum.in due season,the parties for summary judgment.in a rescript,the district court granted the defendants motion and denied the plaintiffs motion.rifa ii,wl,at.
the plaintiffs now appeal both the denial of their motion to remand and the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm both rulings.
ii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into two main segments.we first address the tangled jurisdictional issue and then briefly address the merits.
jurisdiction.
the district court denied the motion to remand without an evidentiary hearing.thus,we review de novo the propriety of that order and,thus,the court underlying conclusion that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action.see fayard vehicle,llc,cir.
removal of a civil action from state to federal court is proper only if the action initially could have been brought in the federal court.a.because the defendants concede that there is no conceivable basis for federal jurisdiction apart from,the propriety of removal hinges on whether the district court had federal question jurisdiction.see franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.
the relevant statute grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.there is no mechanical test for determining when an action aris es under federal law.see franchise tax,at.noting that the phrase arising under has resisted all attempts to frame a single,precise definition for determining which cases fall within,and which cases fall outside,the original jurisdiction of the district courts.this does not mean,however,that we are left rudderless on a sea of uncertainty.
experience teaches that there are two types of actions that fall within the encincture of federal question jurisdiction.the first and most familiar category involves direct federal questions that is,suits in which the plaintiff pleads a cause of action that has its roots in federal law say,a claim premised on the united states constitution or on a federal statute.see,am.well works layne bowler.holmes,almond capital,cir.the second and far more rare category involves embedded federal questions that is,suits in which the plaintiff pleads a cause of action,but that cause of action necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d accord smith.city title trust.
these categories have some commonalities.most prominently,every putative federal question case must pay tribute to the complaint rule.as this shorthand nomenclature suggests,the rule requires the federal question to be stated on the face of the plaintiff complaint.see franchise tax,at.holding that federal question jurisdiction extends to only those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.to satisfy the rule,the plaintiff complaint must exhibit,within its four corners,either an explicit federal cause of action or a cause of action that contains an embedded question of federal law that is both substantial and disputed.see comm l owners,cir.the existence of a federal defense to a cause of action will not suffice.see louisville nashville mottley.
in the case at hand,the plaintiffs have pleaded nothing but causes of action.consequently,the jurisdictional inquiry reduces to whether an embedded federal question afforded the district court original jurisdiction over the action.
the plaintiffs complaint limns a wide variety of state constitutional and statutory claims,attacking the dem regulatory scheme from a number of vantage points.importantly,however,all of these causes of action derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.thus,if the district court had original jurisdiction over any one of these causes of action,then it had supplemental jurisdiction over the rest,see united mine workers gibbs,d rodriguez doral mortg,cir see also cohill,d holding that the supplemental jurisdiction statute applies with equal force to cases removed to federal court,and we must answer the jurisdictional question affirmatively.mindful of this reality,we focus the lens of our inquiry on the most promising candidate for federal jurisdiction the plaintiffs claim that the adoption of regulation violated laws.
in undertaking this task,we follow the progression suggested by the supreme court decision in grable,at.we start with the most pressing concern whether the plaintiffs complaint necessarily raises a federal question.if so,we then mull whether the federal question is actually disputed and substantial.and if the question survives scrutiny on these points,we last consider whether that question is one that a federal court may entertain without impermissibly tilting the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.
necessity.in count of their complaint,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated laws.this statute,in the process of delineating the powers and duties of the director of the dem,provides in pertinent part that retroactive control dates are prohibited and shall not be used or implemented,unless expressly required by federal law,regulation or court decision.the plaintiffs allege that the director transgressed this prohibition by adopting regulation which in their view employs retroactive control dates.this charge rests on the plaintiffs argument that retroactive control dates were not expressly required by federal law because that requirement supposedly found in addendum unenforceable under the management act or,in the alternative,because amendment allows for conservation equivalency measures and,thus,allowed rhode island to propose an alternative scheme to achieve the goals of addendum vii without recourse to retroactive control dates.
we conclude that the plaintiffs complaint establishes that their asserted right to relief under state law requires resolution of a federal question.to prevail on the asserted cause of action,the plaintiffs had to show that the defendants violated laws.this,in turn,required them to show i that the director mandated retroactive control dates,notwithstanding ii that retroactive control dates were not compulsory under federal law.thus,it is not logically possible for the plaintiffs to prevail on this cause of action without affirmatively answering the embedded question of whether federal law,in the form of a fishery management plan promulgated under the compact,expressly required the use of retroactive control dates.that is enough to make out a federal question.see cuyler adams,d holding that interpretation of a congressionally sanctioned compact is a question of federal law.no more is exigible to surmount the first step of the grable progression.
indeed,the question of whether the director acted outside the scope of his authority in using retroactive control dates turns exclusively on the antecedent and embedded federal question of whether that act was expressly required by federal law.section affords the director a grant of authority to adopt retroactive control dates if,and only if,a federal law,regulation or court decision expressly requires their use.thus,answering the question of whether the director exceeded his authority necessarily entails answering the embedded federal question of whether federal law required him to act as he did.
of course,a federal preemption defense to a cause of action is insufficient to confer federal question jurisdiction on a federal court.see mottley,at.the plaintiffs beseech us,by analogy,to apply that analysis here.we reject their importunings although there may well be a preemption defense lurking in the wings that potential defense is not the hook on which we propose to hang federal question jurisdiction.rather,the federal question here is inherent in the question itself because the state statute expressly references federal law.franchise tax,at.declining to extend federal question jurisdiction where california law establish ed a set of conditions,without reference to federal law emphasis supplied.
the plaintiffs try in various ways to blunt the force of this reasoning.their most loudly bruited refrain is that they do not challenge the legality of any provision of the compact.appellants br.at.this is a red herring.
in this case,federal jurisdiction does not depend on the legality of either the compact or one of its provisions.instead,a different federal question is in play a question of whether addendum vii required the dem to insert retroactive control dates into the state regulatory scheme.it is this latter question that undergirds the case for federal jurisdiction.
the plaintiffs also argue that their claims arise under rhode island law and,therefore,not under federal law.this argument sets up a false dichotomy.it presumes that claims can not simultaneously arise under both federal and state law.that premise is faulty federal jurisdiction extends to a case arising under federal law regardless of whether the cause of action itself has its genesis in state law.see smith,at.
last but not least,the plaintiffs point to their complaint and protest that they mention only once that the defendants essentially adopted addendum vii.in their view,that lone is contained in the facts and travel portion of the serve as a basis for federal jurisdiction.
this protestation is correct as far as it goes.federal jurisdiction can not be conjured up by a passing mention of some federal subject.under the complaint rule,allegations in the complaint that are unnecessary to the statement of the relevant cause of action can not themselves support a claim of federal question jurisdiction.see,baldwin pirelli armstrong tire,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed.we can assume,for argument sake,that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to allege that the dem essentially adopted addendum vii and,thus,that federal jurisdiction could not be premised on that allegation.
in the end,this favorable assumption is small consolation to the plaintiffs.here,the claim of entitlement to a federal forum rests not on the reference in the complaint to addendum vii but,rather,on the express incorporation of federal law into the state statute on which the plaintiffs cause of action is grounded.that is a horse of quite a different hue.
