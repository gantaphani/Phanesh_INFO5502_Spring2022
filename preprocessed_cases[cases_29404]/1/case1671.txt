appellant national athletic trainers association,nata appeals from the district court dismissal of its suit for injunctive and declaratory relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.nata brought suit challenging the secretary of health and human services the secretary implementation of a new rule under the medicare regulations providing that therapy services administered by athletic trainers incident to physicians services are no longer reimbursable under medicare part b.the district court concluded that nata has standing to challenge the new rule however,it further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because claims arising under the medicare act must first proceed through all available administrative avenues before a district court has jurisdiction to hear them.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
medicare is a federally funded health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.medicare part b,the part of the program at issue here,is a voluntary supplementary medical insurance program covering physicians services,outpatient hospital care,and certain other services.beneficiaries enrolled in part b are generally entitled to covered medical and other health services,including physician services and services and supplies furnished as an incident to a physician professional service.s.in,congress amended the medicare statute to prohibit payment for any expenses incurred for items or services 
in the case of outpatient occupational therapy services or outpatient physical therapy services furnished as an incident to a physician professional services that do not meet the standards and conditions other than any licensing requirement specified by the secretary under the second sentence of section p of this title as such standards and conditions would apply to such therapy services if furnished by a therapist.
on november,the secretary of health and human services issued a final rule modifying those portions of the medicare regulations pertaining to therapy services that are included under the incident to coverage of medicare part b.the relevant provisions authorize payment for occupational therapy and physical therapy services that are provided incident to a physician professional services only if therapy services are provided by an occupational or physical therapist who meets the qualifications provided by.accordingly,the services of athletic trainers who do not meet the requirements in except licensure,can not be billed as therapy services incident to a physician service.id.
nata filed suit on may,seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction against enforcement of the new rule.the secretary filed a motion to dismiss arguing that nata lacked standing and that jurisdiction over the claims was precluded by a statutory bar against federal question suits involving claims that arise under the medicare act.the district court held that nata had standing,but found the jurisdictional bar applicable and dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.this appeal followed.

in addition to satisfying the article iii requirements for standing,a plaintiff challenging an administrative agency decision must also show that the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d quoting ass of data processing serv,camp,d.the supreme court has explained that 
i n cases where the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action,the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.the test is not meant to be especially demanding in particular,there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff.

the secretary argues that nata lacks prudential standing because its interest is not within the zone of interests protected by the provision of the statute nata is challenging.we disagree.the purpose of the amendment appears to be standardizing the quality of therapy services provided to medicare beneficiaries.accordingly,the interests protected by the statute are the medicare beneficiary interest in receiving and the physician interest in providing quality care.nata interest comports with the physician interest in providing services and the medicare beneficiary interest in receiving those services.am.chiropractic ass n,leavitt,t he interests of enrollees and the interests of chiropractors converge the chiropractor provides the service,the enrollee receives it,and medicare provides reimbursement.this is more than enough to satisfy the test.nata interest in providing services to medicare beneficiaries is sufficient to satisfy the zone of interests tests accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that nata has standing to challenge the rule.
subject matter jurisdiction 
the medicare act limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to review claims brought under the act by requiring that virtually all legal attacks be brought through the agency.shalala.council on long term care,d.specifically,makes h bar of actions against the commissioner of social security brought under or applicable to claims brought under the medicare act against the secretary,thereby purporting to make g the exclusive judicial review method for actions by the secretary.h.council,at.in illinois council the supreme court clarified an exception to h jurisdictional bar that it originally recognized in bowen michigan academy of family physicians,d.the court explained that does not apply h where application of h would not simply channel review through the agency,but would mean no review at all.council,at.accordingly,the crux of the parties dispute is whether channeling review through the agency would result in no review at all of nata claim.
the parties agree that nata members can not obtain administrative review because they are neither beneficiaries nor providers,but they disagree as to whether it is sufficient that the claim that nata is making can be brought by a third party.the secretary argues that nata claims do not fall within the illinois council exception because physicians that employ athletic trainers can pursue administrative review and,if such a claim is denied,a physician could seek judicial review in federal court and the court would have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the regulation.nata contends that it is not sufficient that third parties can assert their claims,and that even if it were sufficient,physicians lack incentive to challenge the rule because of statutory penalties and costs of litigation.we first consider whether it is sufficient that a third party can assert the claim.
in american chiropractic,an organization representing chiropractors brought suit under challenging the secretary determination that not only chiropractors,but also medical doctors and osteopaths could provide certain covered services.the organization also argued that the secretary illegally allowed health maintenance organizations to require that a patient obtain a referral before consulting a chiropractor.the district of columbia circuit noted that in order to determine whether the illinois council exception applied,it must determine whether the association could get its claims heard administratively and whether it could receive judicial review after administrative channeling.id.at.the court reasoned that an enrollee could obtain the services of a chiropractor without obtaining a referral and then challenge the referral requirement when coverage was denied.id.at.the court further reasoned that the chiropractor herself could initiate an administrative challeng
