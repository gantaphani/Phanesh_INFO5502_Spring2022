ruben ovalles ovalles,who filed an untimely motion to reconsider his removal order or to reopen his removal proceedings following his departure from the united states,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia or board denying jurisdiction over his motion pursuant to d.ovalles argues that the bar in section d is contrary to statute and therefore invalid,that the bia unreasonably concluded that the bar trumped its sua sponte authority to reconsider decisions or reopen proceedings,that section d was applied arbitrarily and capriciously in his case,and that he was deprived of his fifth amendment right to due process.for the following reasons,we deny the petition for review.
facts and proceedings below 
ovalles,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,immigrated to the united states in and eventually became a permanent legal resident.in,ovalles was convicted in ohio of attempted possession of drugs under ohio revised code ann,and sentenced to five years of probation.as a result,ovalles was charged with removability pursuant to a b i conviction of a controlled substance violation and a a iii conviction of an aggravated felony.the immigration judge ij concluded that ovalles was removable for a controlled substance violation pursuant to section a b i,but,because he was never imprisoned,his conviction was not an aggravated felony under section a a iii.as a result,the ij determined that ovalles was eligible for cancellation of removal under a,which the ij granted due to ovalles continuous work history and familial connections in the united states.the department of homeland security appealed to the bia.on march,the board held that ovalles conviction was an aggravated felony,and therefore that ovalles was ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to a.ovalles was removed to the dominican republic on april.
on december,the supreme court decided lopez gonzales,which held that a conviction for simple possession of drugs that is neither an illicit trafficking offense nor a federal felony does not constitute an aggravated felony for immigration purposes,d.arguing that this decision undermined the legal basis for his removal,ovalles filed a motion with the bia on july,to reconsider its march decision sua sponte,or alternatively,to reopen his removal proceedings sua sponte.the bia began by noting that ovalles motion,which it viewed as a motion to reopen sua sponte,was untimely.ultimately,however,the bia refused to consider the motion on the basis of d,which provides in relevant part a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.ovalles timely filed this petition for review

standard of review 
we review the bia conclusions of law and constitutional issues arising therefrom de novo.see gonzales,cir.we grant the bia interpretation of its own regulations considerable legal leeway.ashcroft,cir quoting barnhart walton,d.however,w hile an agency interpretation of a regulation is entitled to due deference,the interpretation must rationally flow from the language of the regulation.id.quoting acadian gas pipeline ferc,cir.
validity of d 
ovalles primary contention on appeal is that the bar in d is invalid,because it is contrary to the clear and unambiguous language of the provisions of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat,that t he alien may file one motion to reconsider and a n alien may file one motion to reopen.see c a,c a.in support of this argument,ovalles urges this court to follow the fourth circuit decision in william gonzales,which held that the bar in section d was invalid because it conflicted with the clear and unambiguous language of section c a of iirira.see,cir.
motions to reconsider and motions to reopen began as judicial creations and were later incorporated into regulations.see dada mukasey,d.the first version of the bar on filing such motions appeared in a regulation promulgated by the attorney general in,which provided in pertinent part as follows 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider before the bia shall not be made by or in behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.any departure of such person from the united states occurring after the making of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
codified at see in re,i n,bia.since that time,the bia has consistently interpreted the bar as a limitation on its jurisdiction to entertain motions to reopen or reconsider filed by aliens who have departed the country.in re,i n at.
in,congress imposed a similar statutory restriction on the ability of article iii courts to hear appeals from deportation or exclusion orders filed by aliens who had already departed the country 
an order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the united states after the issuance of the order.
c repealed see in re,i n at.the law surrounding motions to reopen or reconsider changed again in,when congress amended the immigration and naturalization act ina with the enactment of iirira.see william,at.iirira repealed c,replacing it with a new provision governing article iii review of deportation and exclusion orders that did not contain a bar.see see william,at.additionally,iirira codified procedures for filing motions to reopen and motions to reconsider,incorporating several of the existing regulatory restrictions on filing those motions but,notably,excluding the bar.see c see also william,at.
following the enactment of iirira,the attorney general passed a new set of regulations governing motions to reopen or reconsider that,despite the repeal of c and the lack of explicit authorization in c,again imposed a bar nearly identical to those contained in previous regulations 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider before the bia shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such a motion.
d see.this regulation,which was later redesignated d,is challenged in the instant case.see.
in gonzales,the first circuit considered whether the repeal of the statutory bar applicable to the federal courts in c abrogated or otherwise signaled congress intent to eliminate the bar in b,which applies to the immigration courts and mirrors section d which applies to the bia,cir.first,the court concluded that,because the regulatory bar existed prior to and independent of the statutory bar,the repeal of section c did not in itself abrogate the attorney general authority to continue to enforce the limitations of b.id.the court then went on to consider whether,in enacting iirira,congress nevertheless intended for the attorney general to cease enforcement of the bar.id.the court determined that iirira was silent or ambiguous on the issue,therefore it accorded deference to the agency construction of the statute under chevron id.at.ultimately,the court went on to conclude that the continued implementation of the bar was a reasonable interpretation of the attorney general authority under iirira.id.at.in the course of denying motion for rehearing,the court observed that its initial decision did not address whether the bar conflicted with c.gonzales,cir.
that argument was considered in william,in which a divided panel of the fourth circuit held that c a unambiguously provides an alien with the right to file one motion to reopen,regardless of whether he is within or without the country.at.in examining the language of section c a,the court emphasized that the statute provides that a n alien may file one motion to reopen.id.emphasis in original.the court determined that because the statute did not include any geographical limitation when referring to an alien,congress clearly meant to provide the right to all aliens meeting the requirements of section c,even those who had departed the united states.id.
the william majority bolstered its reading of section c a by examining the overall structure of section c.id.at.first of all,it presumed that congress acted intentionally when it chose to incorporate other existing regulatory restrictions on an alien right to file motions to reopen,including filing deadlines and numerical limitations,but not the bar.id.additionally,the majority pointed to section c c iv iv,which exempts alien victims of domestic violence from the usual filing deadlines for a motion to reopen if they are physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.id.it drew two conclusions from congress inclusion of this provision.id.first,it reasoned that congress placement of a physical presence requirement in c c iv iv,but not in section c a,demonstrated congress intent to do so,because where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it from another section of the same act it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.id.quoting clay united states,d.second,the william majority observed that to adopt the government interpretation of section c a would render section c c iv iv superfluous,for a finding that physical presence in the united states is required before any motion to reopen may be filed would render the physical presence requirement expressly written into subsection c c iv iv mere surplusage.id.citing trw,andrews,d.for these reasons,the william majority ultimately concluded that section d directly conflicted with the plain language of section c a and therefore was invalid.id.at.
chief judge williams wrote an extensive dissent in william,arguing that iirira was silent on the issue of the bar and therefore the court should defer to the attorney general interpretation of the statute under chevron.see id.at.he placed special emphasis on the fact that,prior to the passage of section c a,a similar regulation limiting aliens to only one motion to reopen worked alongside the bar to restrict the ability of aliens located within the country from filing repeated motions to reopen.id.at citing c.on that basis,chief judge williams observed that if congress intended to repeal the departure bar,it would have done so by doing more than merely repeating the numerical limitation already contained in the regulations,a limitation that was designed to operate alongside the departure bar to promote finality in deportation proceedings.id.at.therefore,he concluded that the majority had impute d more meaning to the codified numerical limitation than the words of the statute can bear.id.at.
in addition,the chief judge rejected the majority reliance on section c c iv iv,the exception to the filing deadline for alien victims of domestic violence,as a basis for concluding that congress intended to eliminate the bar.id.at.first of all,he observed that section c c iv iv and the physical presence requirement contained therein were added years after the passage of iirira as part of two statutes enacted in a broad legislative effort to snuff out sex slave trade and domestic violence.id.at.therefore,chief judge williams concluded that it was a mistake to rely on section c c iv iv as a means of interpreting congress intent in passing iirira,as the two were connected neither in time nor purpose.id.second,chief judge williams argued that section c c iv iv could just as easily be interpreted as an exception to the second prong of the bar regulation,which would otherwise result in the automatic withdrawal of a motion to reopen filed by an alien victim of domestic violence who departed the country after filing.id.ultimately,chief judge williams concluded that iirira was silent as to whether aliens were permitted to file motions to reopen.id.at.therefore,he afforded the agency deference under step two of chevron and found that the bar in section d was a valid exercise of the attorney general rulemaking authority id.at.
ovalles urges this court to adopt the analysis of the majority in william and to extend the majority reasoning beyond motions to reopen to encompass motions to reconsider under section c.without passing judgment on the merits of the fourth circuit decision in william,we decline to do so.in asking us to invalidate section d,ovalles invokes statutory provisions that offer him no relief.section c b provides that a motion to reconsider must be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,and section c c i mandates that a motion to reopen shall be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.the bia entered ovalles final order of removal on march,yet ovalles did not file his motion to reconsider or to reopen until july.thus,over three years had passed from the entry of the bia final administrative order of removal before ovalles filed his motion.moreover,even if we were to start the running of the allowed time period when the supreme court issued lopez on december,nearly eight months would have passed before ovalles filed his motion with the bia.therefore,ovalles motion would still have been well outside both the deadline for filing motions to reconsider and the deadline for filing motions to reopen.
this key fact distinguishes the present case from william.see mukasey,cir,unpublished.in william,the petitioner filed a motion to reopen within ninety days after the vacatur of the state conviction for which he was deported.see at.apparently,the fourth circuit determined that the vacatur restarted the limitations period,and the government did not argue that the motion was untimely.see id.therefore,unlike ovalles,william filed his motion to reopen within the statutory deadline and was entitled to whatever rights the court determined were available to him under section c.see id.at.
thus,because sections c and c of iirira do not grant ovalles the right to have his facially and concededly untimely motion heard by the bia,he can not rely on those statutory provisions as a basis for contending that the bia was required to give sua sponte consideration to the merits of his july,motion to reconsider or reopen its march decision.
interplay between a and d 
ovalles also contends that the bia unreasonably interpreted the bar in section d as trumping its sua sponte authority to reopen or reconsider cases under a.section a provides in relevant part as follows the board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.emphasis added.
citing the eleventh circuit decision in,cir,ovalles asserts that the bia sua sponte authority to reconsider or reopen cases overrides the bar in section d.however,is distinguishable,because that case involved an alien who was removed in absentia and the special provisions of sections a c iii and a c.at see in re mascoe,wl bia,unpublished.moreover,the court limited the ij and the bia jurisdiction upon reopening the proceedings to considering only whether the alien had received sufficient notice of the removal proceedings,at.
more importantly,this argument is foreclosed by our decision in ashcroft,which is directly on point.see at.in,as is arguably the case here,the petitioner was removed under a a iii for an offense driving while intoxicated that was later determined not to be an aggravated felony under the ina.id.at.moved to reopen his removal proceedings by invoking the bia authority to reopen sua sponte at any time under a predecessor to section a.id.at.despite the broad language used in section a,the bia determined that it lacked jurisdiction under the bar in d predecessor to section d.id.we upheld that decision,concluding that the bia reasoning that the prohibition on motions to reopen stated in d overrides i
