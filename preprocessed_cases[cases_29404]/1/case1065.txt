opinion of the court 
this appeal,which arises from a bankruptcy proceeding,presents only one issue,but it is an issue of first impression in this circuit and requires interpretation and reconciliation of two important and complex federal statutory schemes and their underlying policies.specifically,it requires us to decide whether under the employee retirement income security act erisa,as amended by the multiemployer pension plan amendments act mppaa,the portion of withdrawal liability that is attributable to the time period constitutes an administrative expense entitled to priority under the bankruptcy code.the district court,overturning the bankruptcy court decision,held that it does and that the portion of the multiemployer fund withdrawal liability claim against debtor marcal paper mills,was entitled to priority.marcal paper mills,llc hereafter marcal llc,who purchased the assets of the debtor marcal paper mills,hereafter marcal and assumed liability for this claim,appeals,arguing that the entire claim for withdrawal liability should be classified as a general unsecured claim.
marcal,which manufactured paper products,operated a fleet of trucks to distribute its products.the truck drivers employed by marcal were members of teamsters union local.local was the collective bargaining representative for those employees and,over the years,entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements cbas with marcal.as part of the cbas,marcal was required to participate in the trucking employees of north jersey fund tenj pension fund or fund a multiemployer defined benefit pension fund.
on november,marcal filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and marcal operated as a dip from that date,continuing to employ members of local.the cba governing the employees work and requiring marcal participation in the tenj pension fund did not expire until september.aware that the cba was set to expire,on august,dip marcal and local entered into a memorandum of understanding continuing the terms of the cba until a new contract could be negotiated.the parties were never able to negotiate a new contract.nevertheless,because the cba and pension plan were continued and dip marcal continued to employ covered employees,those employees accrued pension credits and the corresponding benefits.in addition,under the dip marcal was required to satisfy its tenj pension fund obligations.one of those obligations was that dip marcal continue to make contributions to the tenj pension fund on behalf of covered employees.dip marcal made all such contributions from november,the date of its chapter petition,until may,when dip marcal assets were sold to marcal paper mills,llc.from that date,marcal llc ceased to employ local truck drivers.accordingly,there is no dispute that marcal llc had no obligation to make contributions or provide benefits associated with work after may.
as a consequence of dip marcal cessation and the fact that marcal llc did not employ local drivers,the tenj pension fund determined that dip marcal had made a complete withdrawal from the pension fund within the meaning of erisa,as amended by the mppaa.the tenj pension fund assessed marcal with in total withdrawal liability.on july,the tenj pension fund filed a claim in marcal bankruptcy proceeding for the entire amount of withdrawal liability as a administrative claim under b of the bankruptcy code.marcal objected to the tenj pension fund claim that the withdrawal liability be classified as an administrative expense and filed a motion to reclassify it as a general unsecured claim.in response,the tenj pension fund altered its claim and only sought administrative priority for that portion of the withdrawal liability attributable to services provided by local employees to dip marcal.
notwithstanding,the bankruptcy court rejected tenj pension fund claim and reclassified the entire withdrawal liability claim as a general unsecured claim.the district court subsequently reversed and held that the portion of the withdrawal liability attributable to the period was entitled to priority.it remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court to calculate how the claim should be apportioned between pre and periods.trucking emps.of jersey welfare fund,marcal paper mills,wl,at.marcal llc appeals.
the district court had jurisdiction over the appeal of the bankruptcy court classification of the claim pursuant to a and a.under d,we have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a district court pursuant to its authority to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a bankruptcy court.we have held that because of the unique nature of bankruptcy cases,finality under d should be viewed in a more pragmatic and less technical way than it would under.airlease ii,simon in re airlease ii,cir.
to determine whether a decision is final,we consider three factors the impact of the matter on the assets of the bankruptcy estate,the preclusive effect of a decision on the merits,and whether the interests of judicial economy will be furthered.id.at.consistent with supreme court precedent,we hold that the district court decision classifying the portion of withdrawal liability as an administrative expense was final,and that judicial economy is served by resolving this issue now,rather than after the estate has been conclusively divided.see howard delivery serv.zurich am.ins,decision regarding the priority of a claim is final and appealable see also in re saco local dev,cir same.
to the extent that this appeal involves a question of law regarding whether withdrawal liability,or at least a portion thereof,can qualify as an administrative expense under the bankruptcy code,our review is de novo.schlumberger res.mgmt,cellnet data,cir.
as mentioned,the question in this case is whether withdrawal liability,as defined by erisa,as amended by the mppaa,should be apportioned between pre and periods and,if so,whether the portion qualifies as an administrative expense as defined by the bankruptcy code.accordingly,we begin with the language of the statutes.
title a of the bankruptcy code provides that administrative expenses allowed under b are entitled to priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors.section b a defines administrative expenses as the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate including wages,salaries,and commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.interpreting this provision,we have explained that in order to qualify for administrative priority,an expense must arise from a transaction with the and the expense must be beneficial to the in the operation of the business.in re envtl.energy,cir quotations and brackets omitted.pursuant to the statute terms,the expense must also be actual and necessary.id.
these requirements balance two important goals.by giving priority to those claims that help keep the functioning,sections and advance the estate interest in survival above all other financial goals.zagata fabricators,superior air,cir.by limiting priority to those claims that are actual and necessary,the code prevents the estate from being consumed by administrative expenses,and preserves the estate for the benefit of the creditors.see.dep t of envtl.res.tri state clinical labs,cir holding that chapter is intended to rehabilitate the debtor and avoid forfeiture by creditors quotations and brackets omitted.consistent with the objective of preserving the estate for creditors,the burden to demonstrate that an expense deserves administrative priority lies with the party asserting such priority,here,the tenj pension fund.see in re,at.
thus,as applied to this case,the relevant inquiry is whether any portion of the withdrawal liability owed by marcal llc to the tenj pension fund is a expense provided in exchange for a service that was actual and necessary for the continued operation of dip marcal.in this regard,it is helpful to distinguish between the nature of withdrawal liability and how withdrawal liability is calculated.both shed light on the relevant question.
the mppaa instituted withdrawal liability in response to a shortcoming in the original erisa statute regulating multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.a defined benefit plan,such as the tenj pension fund plan,is a pension plan under which an employee receives a set monthly amount upon retirement for his or her life,with the benefit amount typically based upon the participant wages and length of service.in re schering plough.erisa,cir.in other words,the employer has promised the employee a certain pension benefit.the benefit level is set by the plan trustee based on the expected resources of the plan.joint explanation of multiemployer pension plan amendments act of,cong.rec,july,joint explanation.the resources of a plan available to pay those benefits consist of assets held by the plan.id.at.those assets include,f uture contributions expected by the plan and income expected to be earned on plan investments.id.accordingly,in a defined benefit plan,the employer continuing contributions to the plan are designed to provide a subsequent benefit to the employee upon retirement 
as set forth in the joint explanation,even if an employer has made all of its contributions to date,b ecause benefit promises may be funded over many years after they are made,the withdrawing employer may not have made sufficient contributions to the plan to fund a fair share of the cost of those benefit promises.id.at.in contrast,a defined contribution plan is a retirement plan whereby the employer,employee,or both make contributions to an individual account during employment,but with no guaranteed retirement benefit,and with the ultimate benefit based exclusively upon the contributions to,and investment earnings of the plan.the benefit ceases when the account balance is depleted,regardless of the retiree age or circumstances.in re schering plough,at.
as explained in the general reasons for the bill section of the joint explanation,erisa,in its original form,allowed employers to withdraw from defined benefit plans and escape their obligations to provide benefits,crippling the plan.one of the most serious threats to the security of benefits under a multiemployer plan is an unanticipated decline in employment covered by the plan.where this occurs,the plan is unlikely to have the resources necessary to provide benefits promised to employees under erisa,an employer who has paid all required contributions to a multiemployer plan can withdraw from the plan and,if the plan does not terminate within years after the withdrawal,the employer will have no further responsibility for any part of the unfunded liabilities of the plan.joint explanation at withdrawal liability was implemented to alleviate this problem and ensure that employers could not avoid their obligation to provide a promised benefit by withdrawing,thereby hurting their employees and the entire pension fund health.
with an understanding of the purpose of withdrawal liability and the problem it was designed to repair,we can examine how it did so.the mppaa provides that if an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan,then the employer is liable for its proportionate share of the unfunded vested benefits.b.unfunded vested benefits are calculated as the difference between the present value of vested benefits and the current value of the plan assets.pension benefit guar.gray.section of the mppaa provides various methods for calculating what portion of the plan underfunding is allocable to a particular employer as its withdrawal liability.and the plan trustee possesses the discretion to choose which method of calculation to employ although the plan final actuarial calculation may be challenged by the employer.see concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust.broadly speaking,the act requires that a withdrawing employer continue funding a proportional share of the plan unfunded benefit obligations.house report,emphasis added.

to summarize,withdrawal liability is calculated by,first,determining the shortfall between the plan assets and the vested benefits the plan owes to employees.second,once the overall size of the shortfall has been determined,the withdrawing employer share of that shortfall is determined by calculating,in essence,the proportionate share owed to the withdrawing employer covered employees based on the employer contribution share over the prior five years.
based on the above analysis,it is clear that the covered employees were required to perform work in order to keep dip marcal in operation,unquestionably conferring a benefit to the estate.pursuant to the and pension plan,marcal promised to provide pension benefits in exchange for that work.the portion of the withdrawal liability which corresponds to that work is owed by marcal llc in fulfillment of the promise it assumed as part of its purchase of marcal assets to provide pension benefits in consideration for that necessary work.therefore,the requirements of b a a of the bankruptcy code are satisfied.we agree with the district court and hold that the portion of the withdrawal liability attributable to the period is entitled to administrative priority.
marcal llc advances two principal arguments in opposition to this conclusion,neither of which is persuasive.first,it argues that because the amount of its withdrawal liability will be based on a variety of factors,some of which have nothing to do with the work performed by the covered employees,withdrawal liability can not be considered an administrative expense.without question,the existence of withdrawal liability and its size will depend on how the fund assets have fared in the market,how much money has been withdrawn by retired employees,and other actuarial assumptions.but that does not alter the fact that the amount owed to the tenj pension fund is based upon marcal decision to take advantage of work provided by covered employees.in turn,the portion of that employee work that occurred was wholly dependent upon dip marcal decision to employ covered teamsters while operating as a.it is simply not seemly for marcal llc to disclaim responsibility for the vested benefits marcal created by choosing to use covered employees to perform work.
the size of the benefit owed to a particular employee is determined,in part,by the amount of time that employee worked for marcal.in re schering plough,at.to the extent that the employees worked for marcal,they continued to accrue new vested benefits under the cba and the tenj pension fund plan.the following is the district court helpful explanation 
the obligation to make a withdrawal liability payment would not exist but for the insolvent employer deliberate decision to use the services of the covered employees pursuant to the terms of compensation negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement.put differently,a portion of the accelerated pension funding the withdrawal liability is premised on the bargaining unit employees earned credit toward their future right to collect pension benefits in consideration of their work for the debtor in possession.instead of financing the deferred compensation through monthly contributions,as it would do if it continued to participate in the multiemployer fund,the withdrawing employer is required to make a lump sum payment to the fund.neither this requirement,nor the existence of insurance provided by the pension benefit guaranty corporation for benefits owed to covered employees by the fund,alter the basic character of the withdraw
