robert wilson,the,challenges the decision of an administrative law judge the alj of the social security administration,which became the final decision of the commissioner,denying wilson application for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the social security act.because the alj,by failing to articulate reasons for discounting the opinion of wilson treating physician,violated the agency own procedural regulation,we vacate the judgment of the district court affirming the alj decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
wilson worked as a deputy sheriff from until,when he retired because of a heart attack.he then found employment as a manual laborer with the howard city paper company,but he resigned from that position in.wilson did not engage in any work after leaving the paper company,but worked as the weekend manager for a flea market around.wilson insured status for purposes of dib expired on march.
wilson underwent three hernia repair surgeries in,and,respectively.wilson claims that,as a result of the surgeries,he suffers from entrapment neuropathy,a condition involving a nerve fiber tied up in a scar that causes intense pain whenever he changes positions.wilson was diagnosed with diabetes in the early.
wilson applied for dib on july,claiming disability since december,due to leg and back pain.the regional commissioner of the social security administration denied wilson application initially and on reconsideration,finding that wilson had not become disabled on or before march,when his insured status expired.wilson then filed a timely request for a hearing before an alj.following the hearing,the alj issued a decision finding that wilson had not become disabled on or before march,because,taking into account his limitations,there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that wilson could perform.
in finding that wilson had not become disabled while insured,the alj performed the required analysis.see heston comm r of soc,cir.first,the alj found that wilson has not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since his disability onset date.second,the alj determined that wilson suffered from severe impairments on the last date he was,insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy in the lower extremities,lumbar spondylosis and facet arthritis,coronary artery disease,entrapment neuropathy,and sympathetic mediated pain syndrome.third,the alj concluded that wilson impairments did not meet or medically equal any of the listed impairments.fourth,the alj found that,when his coverage expired,wilson retained the residual functional capacity to perform a significant range of light work,but that wilson could not perform any of his past relevant work.fifth,the alj determined that,given wilson residual functional capacity and vocational profile at the time his coverage expired,there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that wilson could perform,including a range of clerical jobs.based on this last finding,the alj concluded that wilson was not disabled at any time through the date he was last insured for benefits.
the appeals council of the social security administration denied wilson request for review of the alj decision,at which point the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner of social security.miles chater,cir.wilson then commenced a civil action in district court for judicial review of the commissioner final decision pursuant to g.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court affirm the alj decision.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,and wilson timely appealed.
although substantial evidence otherwise supports the decision of the commissioner in this case,reversal is required because the agency failed to follow its own procedural regulation,and the regulation was intended to protect applicants like wilson.the regulation requires the agency to give good reasons for not giving weight to a treating physician in the context of a disability determination.d.this requirement is part of the treating source regulation adopted by the social security administration in.see generally schaal apfel,cir.
pursuant to this regulation,an alj must give more weight to opinions from treating sources since 
these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed,longitudinal picture of the claimant medical impairment s and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that can not be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations,such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.
d.an alj must give the opinion of a treating source controlling weight if he finds the opinion by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record.id.if the opinion of a treating source is not accorded controlling weight,an alj must apply certain,the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination,the nature and extent of the treatment relationship,supportability of the opinion,consistency of the opinion with the record as a whole,and the specialization of the treating determining what weight to give the opinion.id.
importantly for this case,the regulation also contains a clear procedural requirement we will always give good reasons in our notice of determination or decision for the weight we give the claimant treating source opinion.id.a social security ruling explains that,pursuant to this provision,a decision denying benefits must contain specific reasons for the weight given to the treating source medical opinion,supported by the evidence in the case record,and must be sufficiently specific to make clear to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating source medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.soc.sec.rul,wl,at.the requirement of exists,in part,to let claimants understand the disposition of their cases,particularly in situations where a claimant knows that his physician has deemed him disabled and therefore might be especially bewildered when told by an administrative bureaucracy that she is not,unless some reason for the agency decision is supplied.snell apfel,cir.the requirement also ensures that the alj applies the treating physician rule and permits meaningful review of the alj application of the rule.see halloran barnhart,cir.
it is an elemental principle of administrative law that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations.as the ninth circuit well summarized in applying this principle 
the supreme court has long recognized that a federal agency is obliged to abide by the regulations it promulgates.see vitarelli seaton,d service dulles,d accardi shaughnessy.an agency failure to follow its own regulations tends to cause unjust discrimination and deny adequate notice and consequently may result in a violation of an individual constitutional right to due process.where a prescribed procedure is intended to protect the interests of a party before the agency,even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency,that procedure must be scrupulously observed.vitarelli,at.frankfurter,concurring see also note,violations by agencies of their own regulations,harv,observing that agency violations of regulations promulgated to provide parties with procedural safeguards generally have been invalidated by courts.
sameena,united states air force,cir parallel citations and circuit court citations omitted.consistent with this principle,courts have remanded the commissioner decisions when they have failed to articulate good reasons for not crediting the opinion of a treating source,as d requires.see,newton apfel,cir snell,at see also halloran,at we do not hesitate to remand when the commissioner has not provided good reasons for the weight given to a treating physician opinion and we will continue remanding when we encounter opinions from alj that do not comprehensively set forth the reasons for the weight assigned to a treating physician opinion.
