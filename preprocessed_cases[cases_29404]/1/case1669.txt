yves gelin appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the housing authority of new orleans hano on his claim for relief under.
hano is a louisiana state agency charged with providing safe,affordable housing to economically disadvantaged citizens in orleans parish.gelin is an attorney who served in various positions in the hano office of general counsel.immediately prior to dismissal,he served as general unclassified,exempt,and position.
in december,gelin informed his superior,catherine lamberg,that he would have to report a purported agency bribe to the federal bureau of investigation fbi he contends that his relationship with lamberg became strained as a result and that,in february,she terminated his employment while he was on approved sick leave.
gelin filed suit against hano in federal district court,asserting claims under,the family medical leave act,et fmla,and state law.he alleged that the agency terminated him for speaking out on a matter of public concern and failed to properly compensate him for the hours he worked.
after gelin abandoned his fmla claim,the district court granted hano motion for summary judgment on his section claim,finding no evidence that lamberg was a final policymaker for employment matters at hano and no evidence of a causal connection between gelin termination and his alleged protected activity.the district court subsequently dismissed his state claim for lack of supplemental jurisdiction.gelin appeals the grant of summary judgment.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.beattie madison county sch,cir.we affirm the judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
under section,e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress.a section claim may be brought against a state or local governing body where official policy or governmental custom is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the constitution.bennett slidell,cir see also monell dep t of soc,d holding that the word person in section includes municipalities and other local governing bodies.
normally,a plaintiff must identify a policy or custom that gave rise to the plaintiff injury before he may prevail.canton harris,d.it is,however,that a single decision by an official can be grounds for section liability where the decision was rendered by an individual with final policy making authority.jett dallas indep.sch,d see brady fort bend county,cir recognizing that a single action by an official with final policymaking authority may constitute official policy 
where liability is based upon a single decision by an official,a court task is to identify those officials or governmental bodies who speak with final policymaking authority for the local governmental actor concerning the action alleged to have caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at issue.mcmillian monroe county,d citation omitted.t he identification of those officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local governmental unit is a question of state law to be resolved by the trial judge before the case is submitted to the jury.jett,at.the sources of state law which should be used to discern which municipal officials possess final policymaking authority are state and local positive law,as well as custom or usage having the force of law.gros city of grand prairie,cir quoting jett,at.
the parties have not identified,through citations to state or local law,the entity or individual with final policymaking authority for hano personnel matters.they both assume that the hano board of commissioners board had such policymaking authority,but disagree as to whether the board delegated that authority to lamberg.we have remanded in similar cases to allow the parties to fully brief the sources of state law.see,gros,at.we find remand unnecessary here because the evidence of custom or usage provided by the deposition testimony,personnel manual provisions,and that lamberg,at least,did not wield such policymaking authority for the agency.
lamberg was the administrative receiver responsible for the day to day operations of hano.the board also designated her the appointing authority,with the power to terminate an employee on the agency behalf.the evidence indicates that these positions do not have an inherent policymaking function.although gelin argues that lamberg was also,by default,the executive director of hano,there is no record evidence that the board appointed her executive director,nor is there evidence that she exercised the full panoply of executive powers.rather,the record establishes that three jarmon,lori moon,and the various chief executive functions at hano.whether lamberg served as executive director is,moreover,wholly irrelevant because the position does not have an inherent policymaking function.under the hano policy manual,the executive director may establish and modify personnel procedures.however changes to personnel policies require board approval therefore,even if lamberg operated as executive director,she can not be considered a final policymaking authority simply because she held that position.lamberg may have wielded decisionmaking authority her position alone,however,did not bestow any final policymaking authority.see eugene alief indep.sch,cir when an official discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official making,those policies,rather than the departure from them,are the act of the municipality.
gelin suggests that,even if the board did not expressly delegate policymaking authority to lamberg,she was nevertheless the de facto final policymaking authority for termination decisions because her decisions were administratively unreviewable.he contends that the grievance procedure in hano policy manual is ineffective because it does not explicitly provide for administrative review of termination decisions and,to the extent it does,any decision is subject to review by the executive director,the same person with decision making authority respective to terminations.
in jett dallas independent school district,we addressed an argument similar to the one gelin raises here.in jett,a high school teacher brought a section action,alleging that he had been involuntarily transferred because of his race and the exercise of his first amendment rights.he argued that liability should attach because a policy adopted by the board of trustees made the superintendent the final decisionmaker on an employee challenge to his or her proposed transfer id.at.that policy provided that administrative appeals were heard at the general superintendent level,and the general superintendent shall exercise final jurisdiction.id.at.after remand from the supreme court,we rejected that argument,reasoning that the supreme court in pembaur cincinnati,d plurality opinion,and city of louis praprotnik,d plurality opinion,carefully distinguished between those having mere decisionmaking authority and those having policymaking authority.jett,at we held that the fact that the official may have been delegated the final decision in the cases of protested individual employee transfers does not mean that he had or had been delegated the status of policymaker,much less final policymaker,respecting employee transfers.id.in so doing,we specifically noted that praprotnik expressly rejected the concept of de facto final policymaking authority,id.at,and cited with approval the seventh circuit decision in auriemma rice,which stated that a particular agent is the apex of a bureaucracy makes the decision final but does not forge a link between finality and policy,cir.
