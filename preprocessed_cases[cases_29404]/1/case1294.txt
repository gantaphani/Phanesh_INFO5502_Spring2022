in this appeal,we consider the validity of an administrative regulation and its evidentiary standard under which coal mine operators may rebut a presumption of disability that otherwise qualifies certain coal miners for benefits under the black lung benefits act,through.logan coals,the operator seeks review of a decision of the benefits review board affirming an administrative law judge alj award of benefits to page bender,under the act.because bender had worked as an underground coal miner for years and suffered from a totally disabling respiratory condition,the alj applied to bender claim a rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis,as provided by c and after considering the medical evidence,the alj concluded that the operator had not rebutted the presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis by ruling out any causal relationship between bender pneumoconiosis and his disability.the alj therefore awarded black lung benefits to bender,and the benefits review board affirmed the alj decision.
in its petition for review,the operator argues that the alj erred in applying the rebuttal standard.we disagree and hold that the department of labor acted within its regulatory authority in requiring coal mine operators to show,in the case of miners who meet the statutory criteria for the presumption,that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis.d.we also hold that the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we affirm the award of benefits and deny the operator petition for review.
we begin by stating the statutory and regulatory framework,including certain pertinent history.the black lung benefits act the act,through,was first enacted in see pauley bethenergy mines,describing history of the act.the act is intended to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis black lung disease and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease.a.
in general,to establish an entitlement to black lung benefits,a miner must show that he has pneumoconiosis,in either its clinical or legal form that the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment that he is totally disabled by a pulmonary or respiratory impairment and that his pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.mingo logan coal owens,cir citing d,c.pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of a miner disability if the pneumoconiosis h as a material adverse effect on the miner respiratory or pulmonary condition or m aterially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment.c.
in,congress added to the act a rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis the presumption.see black lung benefits act of,stat,c the presumption is applicable to a miner claim if he worked for at least years in underground coal mines,if a chest does not show the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.c.section c also specifies the manner in which the secretary of the secretary can rebut the presumption 
the secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that a such miner does not,or did not,have pneumoconiosis,or that b his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.
four years after the presumption was added to the statute,the supreme court decided usery turner elkhorn mining,holding that the rebuttal provision in section c applied by its plain terms only to the secretary,not to coal mine operators opposing a miner claim for benefits.later,in,the department of labor promulgated a regulation implementing the statutory presumption and clarifying the rebuttal standard for both the secretary and the coal mine operators the original regulation.see standards for determining coal miners total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis.the original regulation set forth the rebuttal standard as follows 
where the cause of death or total disability did not arise in whole or in part out of dust exposure in the miner coal mine employment or the evidence establishes that the miner does not or did not have pneumoconiosis,the presumption will be considered rebutted.however,in no case shall the presumption be considered rebutted on the basis of evidence demonstrating the existence of a totally disabling obstructive respiratory or pulmonary disease of unknown origin.
d emphasis added.
in,however,congress entirely eliminated the statutory presumption from section c for claims filed on or after january.see black lung benefits revenue act of,stat.the original regulation was amended in to reflect this statutory change,but remained in effect as originally written for claims filed before january,
the presumption was restored to the statute in march,as part of the patient protection and affordable care act.see patient protection and affordable care act,stat.in reenacting this provision,congress used language identical to that employed in the original statute.see c.this revived statutory presumption remains in effect at the time of this appeal.
in,the department of labor promulgated a revised regulation the revised regulation,or the regulation,which is following evidentiary standard that is required to rebut the presumption 
in a claim filed by a miner,the party opposing entitlement may rebut the presumption by 
i establishing both that the miner does not,or did not,have 
a legal pneumoconiosis and 
b clinical pneumoconiosis,arising out of coal mine employment or 
ii establishing that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis 
d emphasis added.although the language of the revised regulation differs in some respects from the original regulation,both versions require that any party,including a coal mine operator,who seeks to rebut the presumption by disproving disability causation,rule out any connection between a miner pneumoconiosis and his disability.the validity of this standard as applied to coal mine operators is the primary issue presented in this appeal.
bender,who was years old at the time of the alj decision,was employed in an underground coal mine for years and ended his work in the mines around.bender also smoked between one and one half and two packs of cigarettes daily for over years,and continues to smoke three or four cigarettes per day.bender is in poor overall health,and was diagnosed with lung cancer in.as a result of his lung cancer,bender has undergone radiation and chemotherapy treatments,as well as the removal of a portion of his lung.he also suffers from diabetes,has undergone several bypass surgeries,and receives oxygen at night and after physical exertion.
bender filed a claim for black lung benefits in after a hearing conducted in august,the alj applied the presumption to bender claim in light of bender year history of underground coal mine employment and the consensus of all the medical experts that bender suffers from a totally disabling respiratory condition.under the presumption,the burden therefore shifted to the operator to disprove bender entitlement to benefits.
at the time of the alj decision,the department of labor had not yet promulgated the revised regulation imposing the current version of the standard for rebuttal of the presumption.however,the alj applied an analogous standard that this court had used in the context of a previous interim presumption,which required the operator to rule out any causal relationship between the miner disability and his coal mine employment by a preponderance of the evidence in order to rebut the presumption.see stiltner island creek coal,cir see also infra at discussing the interim presumption.
at the hearing before the alj in,the operator offered the expert opinions of three physicians to rebut the presumption of bender total disability due to pneumoconiosis.all three agreed that bender suffers from simple clinical pneumoconiosis.the operator thus sought to rebut the presumption by demonstrating that bender respiratory disability was not caused by his pneumoconiosis.
the first of the operator experts,peter tuteur,chronicled bender extensive medical history,including a multiplicity of cigarette smoke induced health problems.tuteur opined that bender lung cancer and other medical conditions,including emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,were not in any way related to,aggravated by,or caused by the inhalation of coal mine dust or the development of coal workers pneumoconiosis.tuteur explained that he would have expected to find decreased lung expansion and inspiratory crackling sounds if bender pneumoconiosis had been advanced enough to produce abnormalities on physical examination,but that these anticipated symptoms were not present.tuteur therefore concluded that bender pneumoconiosis was present but had no clinical effect.
tuteur also stated that bender disability was not caused in whole or in part by coal workers pneumoconiosis or any other chronic lung disease arising out of coal mine employment,but instead resulted from bender history of smoking,lung cancer,and cancer treatments.in applying the standard,the alj accorded tuteur opinion little weight because tuteur failed to explain how he can determine that none of bender impairment is due to coal dust exposure.
the operator second medical expert,george zaldivar,similarly testified that all of bender impairment was attributable to bender lung surgery,cancer treatments,and cigarette use.zaldivar based his opinion in part on an examination conducted seven years earlier by another doctor.at that earlier time,bender already had stopped working in the mines and was exhibiting early signs of simple pneumoconiosis,but had no pulmonary abnormalities.because bender had not worked in a coal mine since that earlier examination,zaldivar attributed bender respiratory deterioration to smoking and lung cancer.zaldivar concluded that zero percent of bender respiratory abnormalities were caused by his coal mine employment.as with tuteur,the alj accorded little weight to zaldivar analysis,because zaldivar did not adequately explain why the worsened results could not also be due to coal workers pneumoconiosis,which is a progressive disease.
and,finally,the operator offered the report of raphael caffrey,who reviewed some surgical pathology slides that included tissue taken from bender lung in.caffrey noted that lesions caused by pneumoconiosis occupied less than five percent of bender observed lung tissue.caffrey therefore concluded that bender respiratory disability was caused by the removal of lung tissue in treatment of his cancer,not by pneumoconiosis.
bender presented expert medical evidence from donald rasmussen,who directly contradicted caffrey opinion that the presence of pneumoconiosis was too minimal to cause bender impairment.rasmussen explained that a finding of limited pneumoconiosis certainly does not exclude bender coal mine dust exposure as a contributing cause of his disabling lung disease.there is no basis for a conclusion that the extent of pneumoconiosis is related to pulmonary function impairment induced by coal mine dust exposure.rasmussen further opined that although multiple factors could have contributed to bender respiratory impairment,including lung surgery,cancer treatments,and smoking,bender exposure to coal dust was a material contributor.
in considering this conflicting evidence,the alj credited rasmussen disability causation opinion over caffrey.in particular,the alj cited rasmussen explanation that a finding of limited pneumoconiosis did not exclude coal dust exposure as a cause of bender disabling respiratory impairment.the alj awarded black lung benefits to bender,based on the alj conclusion that the operator had failed to rebut the presumption by showing that bender pneumoconiosis did not in any way contribute to his disability.the benefits review board affirmed the alj decision,and this petition for review followed.
we first address the operator legal challenge to the rebuttal standard.as previously discussed,section c sets forth a rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis,as well as a rebuttal standard applicable to the secretary 
i f a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis the secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that a such miner does not,or did not,have pneumoconiosis,or that b his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.
the revised regulation implementing the statutory presumption,which is at issue in this case,states that the party opposing entitlement,which would include coal mine operators,may rebut the presumption by 
i establishing both that the miner does not,or did not,have 
a legal pneumoconiosis and 
b clinical pneumoconiosis,arising out of coal mine employment or 
ii establishing that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis 
in evaluating a regulation promulgated by an executive agency,we apply the principles of deference articulated in chevron natural resources defense council.we first examine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.elm grove coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir quoting chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we continue to the second step of the chevron analysis,and determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,according the agency considerable deference.id.at citation omitted.
the operator argues that our analysis is resolved under the first step of chevron.relying on the supreme court decision in usery,which addressed the plain meaning of section c,the operator contends that the rebuttal standard in the statute is unambiguous and applies only to the secretary.in light of this plain statutory language,the operator asserts that the statute does not allow for the same standard to be applied also to operators by way of an agency regulation.thus,the operator argues that this aspect of the agency regulation should be afforded no deference,and that a lesser rebuttal standard should be applicable to operators.in the operator view,the proper rebuttal standard for operators would be one that would allow the operator to rebut the statutory presumption by showing that the claimant pneumoconiosis is not a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.we disagree with the operator arguments,because we do not think that the holding in usery is as broad as the operator maintains.
in applying the first step of the chevron analysis,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction to ascertain congressional intent.chamber of commerce of the nlrb,cir quoting chevron,u.at internal quotation marks omitted.we begin by considering the language of section c to determine whether the statute is silent or ambiguous regarding the manner in which operators can rebut the presumption.see chamber of commerce,at.
we conclude that section c is silent regarding the standard that an operator must meet to rebut the presumption.the statutory presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis applies both to the secretary and to operators.however,in addressing the method for rebutting this presumption,the statute refers only to the secretary.although operators necessarily must meet some unarticulated standard to rebut the presumption,the statute specifies none.thus,because the statute does not speak to the standard operators must meet to rebut the presumption,congress has left a gap for the agency to fill by using its delegated regulatory authority.
this conclusion is not affected by the supreme court decision in usery,in which the court evaluated the language of the original statutory presumption before it was removed from the statute and later was revived by the patient protection and affordable care act.in usery,as noted above,the court held that it was clear as a matter of statutory construction that the limitation on rebuttal evidence is inapplicable to operators.at.
as we have explained,however,because section c does not address the standard for rebuttal by operators,that standard may be set by regulation.the court in usery did not address any regulation implementing the statute and,crucially,the court did not consider the evidentiary standard under which parties other than the secretary could rebut the statutory presumption.instead,the court merely was required to address the question whether the statutory rebuttal standard applied equally to operators,when the plain language of that portion of the statute referred only to the secretary.see id.at.in its analysis,moreover,the court expressly left open the possibility that the secretary could promulgate regulations under the statute id.at.
we also observe that the premise of the operator argument,namely,that the standard is the substantive equivalent of the statutory rebuttal standard at issue in usery,is mistaken.the rebuttal provision in the statute does not address the evidentiary standard required to show that a miner impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.c.the statute merely identifies the elements of a claim that can be rebutted.in contrast,the standard prescribes the evidentiary standard that a party must satisfy to rebut the presumption.
this distinction explains the court analytical focus in usery.at the time usery was decided,coal miners could be compensated under the act only if their disability was caused by what became known as clinical pneumoconiosis,which is a particular set of diseases recognized by the medical community.collins pine creek mining,cir defining clinical pneumoconiosis andersen,office of workers comp.programs,cir explaining the original definition of pneumoconiosis under the act.therefore,in usery,the operators argued that the rebuttal provision in section c was unconstitutional because it permitted a miner who qualified for the statutory presumption,but whose disability was not caused by a compensable disease under the act,to receive an award of benefits.see usery,at.
the supreme court avoided the operators constitutional challenge to section c by holding that only the secretary was bound by the statutory rebuttal limitations.id.at.operators thus were permitted to rebut the statutory presumption by showing that a miner was disabled by a disease related to coal dust exposure that was not pneumoconiosis.id.
following the decision in usery,congress amended the act in to define compensable pneumoconiosis to include what is now known as legal pneumoconiosis,as well as clinical pneumoconiosis black lung benefits reform act of,stat.see b.thereafter,the agency promulgated regulations further defining legal pneumoconiosis as any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment,including any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a.under this new regime,the concerns animating the court decision in usery,namely,concerns about section c preventing an operator from rebutting the presumption by showing that a miner was not disabled due to clinical pneumoconiosis but due to another respiratory disease caused by his coal mine employment,are no longer present,because all totally disabling diseases caused by coal dust exposure now are compensable under the act.accordingly,the court in usery did not consider whether the standard,as opposed to a more lenient rebuttal standard,would be a permissible evidentiary standard for rebuttal under the act.
we therefore conclude that usery did not answer either the question whether congress left a gap in section c that the agency was permitted to fill by regulation,or the question whether application of the standard to coal mine operators in a regulation would be a reasonable exercise of agency authority in filling such a gap in the statute thus,given the different issue before the court in usery,the court holding does not affect our analysis under the first step of the chevron standard.
having identified the gap in section c that the agency was permitted to fill by regulation,we proceed to the second step of the chevron analysis,under which we ask whether the agency regulation is a reasonable choice within the gap left open by congress.chevron,at.we defer to an agency if its choice represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute.id.at citation omitted.we will not disturb the agency choice unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that congress would have sanctioned.id.
additionally,to uphold application of the regulation under chevron,we are not required to conclude that the agency construction was the only one that the agency permissibly could have adopted under the statute,or was the construction a court would have placed on the statute if presented with the question in the first instance.id.at.instead,we evaluate only whether the regulation is a reasonable exercise of agency authority.id.at.
in making this determination,we first observe that the standard was made a part of the act regulatory scheme in,in the original version of.see standards for determining coal miners total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis,where the cause of death or total disability did not arise in whole or in part out of dust exposure the presumption will be considered rebutted.emphasis added.although congress necessarily was aware of this regulation when reenacting the statutory presumption in,congress did not insert a different rebuttal standard for coal mine operators into the statute,or otherwise amend the statutory language to signal its disagreement with the agency earlier construction of the statute.we therefore may assume,in the absence of a contrary showing,that congress intended to retain the agency interpretation of the prior version of the statute.see lorillard pons,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.
the standard unquestionably advances congress purpose in enacting the statutory presumption.congress instituted the statutory presumption to make it easier for those miners most likely to be disabled due to coal dust exposure to obtain benefits,in response to the high rate of claim denials that miners experienced without the statutory presumption.see pauley,at discussing the original statutory presumption as passed in regulations implementing the byrd amendments to the black lung benefits act determining coal miners and survivors entitlement to benefits,congress adopted the presumption to relax the often insurmountable burden of proving eligibility these miners faced.citation,internal quotation marks,and alteration omitted.the strict nature of the regulatory standard furthers this goal by placing a significant burden on operators seeking to rebut the statutory presumption 
we further observe that,in practice,operators will be required to satisfy the standard only in a clearly defined class of black lung claims.the standard applies only when a miner has worked for years or more in an underground coal mine,he suffers from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,and the operator can not satisfy the first method of rebuttal under section d,namely,disproving the presence of pneumoconiosis.this class of cases is indisputably serious and encompasses claimants whose disabilities likely are attributable at least in part to pneumoconiosis.
and,critically,the intent of congress in enacting the presumption would be thwarted if the operator proposed alternative rebuttal standard were applied.as noted above,in place of the standard,the operator asserts that it should be allowed to rebut the statutory presumption by showing that the claimant pneumoconiosis is not a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.
this alternative rebuttal standard,however,effectively would nullify the statutory presumption for coal miners such as bender whom congress intended to assist.instead of shifting the burden of proof to the operator to rule out pneumoconiosis as a cause of the miner disability,the operator proposed rebuttal standard would track,in the negative,the evidentiary burden placed on a miner who has not qualified for the statutory presumption,namely,to show that pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.see c mingo logan coal,at.thus,to counter an operator evidence that pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing cause of the miner disability,a miner entitled to the statutory presumption nevertheless would be placed back at square one,forced to prove the substantial impact of pneumoconiosis on his disability,which is the very situation that congress intended to eliminate in enacting the presumption.see pauley,at.
next,we observe that one of our sister circuits recently considered the present issue whether the regulatory standard lawfully applies to coal mine operators,and reached the same conclusion that we do.see big branch,ogle,cir.in its decision,the sixth circuit rejected the operator argument under usery and affirmed application of the regulatory standard to coal mine operators.id.at.the court explained that to rebut the statutory presumption of disability,an employer must show under the standard that the miner coal mine employment played no part in causing the miner total disability id.at emphasis in original.
our analysis of an earlier regulation in bethlehem mines massey,cir,further reinforces our conclusion that the present regulation is a reasonable exercise of agency authority.we reviewed in massey an interim regulation,which established a rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis when a miner had worked for at least years in coal mine employment and suffered from a chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease.see see also stiltner,at describing the interim presumption mullins coal,office of workers comp.programs,explaining the applicability of interim versus permanent regulations to certain types of claims.the presumption at issue in massey could be rebutted under the agency regulation by showing that the miner disability did not arise in whole or in part out of coal mine employment.massey,at quoting b emphasis in original.
similar to the operator position here,the coal mine operator in massey argued that it should have been allowed to rebut the interim presumption of disability under section b by showing that the claimant pneumoconiosis is but one of several factors contributing to his total disability.id.at.rejecting this argument,we explained in massey that the standard reasonably reflected the reality that the convergence of many medical and environmental factors often will cause a miner disability.see id.at.we observed that the standard was consistent with the letter and spirit of the act,by eliminating the burden of proving causation for miners who likely suffer from disabling pneumoconiosis.id.thus,we affirmed the standard in the interim regulation,concluding that the standard was within the secretary rulemaking authority and served the broad remedial purposes of the statute.id.
as reflected by our decision in massey,deference to the agency interpretation is particularly appropriate here because congress,through the act,has produced a complex and highly technical regulatory program in which t he identification and classification of medical eligibility criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns entrusted to the agency.pauley,at.thus,in the absence of explicit direction from congress,the procedures under which a claimant may establish entitlement to benefits are a quintessential policy judgment best left to the agency.see id.at when congress,through the introduction of an interpretive gap in the statutory structure,has delegated authority to an administrative agency,the extent of judicial review of the agency policy determinations is limited.
although the standard undeniably places a substantial burden on coal mine operators,we can not say that the agency acted unreasonably in issuing the regulation containing the present standard accordingly,we hold that the standard set forth in section d is a reasonable exercise of the agency authority under chevron,and lawfully applies to coal mine operators as well as to the secretary.therefore,as specifically provided in the regulation,any party opposing entitlement to black lung benefits,including coal mine operators,may rebut the statutory presumption of disability under subsection d ii of the regulation only by proving that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis.d.
the operator argues,nevertheless,that the alj decision awarding benefits is not supported by substantial evidence,because the alj improperly declined to credit the operator medical experts.the operator contends that,by explaining that bender disability was caused by his history of smoking,lung surgery,lung cancer,and cancer treatments,the operator medical experts ruled out pneumoconiosis as a cause of bender disability.because the alj applied the standard in his analysis of the evidence from the operator experts,we first explain the type of proof that the standard requires from a party opposing a miner claim.we later will address the alj evaluation of the medical evidence.
to rebut the presumption of disability due to pneumoconiosis,an operator must establish that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis.d.therefore,the standard is not satisfied by showing that pneumoconiosis was one of several causes of a miner disability,or that pneumoconiosis was a minor or even an incidental cause of the miner respiratory or pulmonary impairment.see carozza steel,cir comparing the interim presumption to section c,and explaining that congress did not intend to exclude benefits for total disability resulting from multiple causes,one of which is pneumoconiosis massey,at pneumoconiosis must be a causative factor in the miner total disability,but it need not be the exclusive causative factor rendering the claimant totally disabled.
instead,an operator opposing an award of black lung benefits affirmatively must establish that the miner disability is attributable exclusively to a cause or causes other than pneumoconiosis.see massey,at to rebut the interim presumption,an operator must rule out the causal relationship between the miner total disability and his coal mine employment.thus,to make the required showing when a miner has qualified for the statutory presumption,a medical expert testifying in opposition to an award of benefits must consider pneumoconiosis together with all other possible causes,and adequately explain why pneumoconiosis was not at least a partial cause of the miner respiratory or pulmonary disability.
in reviewing a decision of the benefits review board,we evaluate whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the board and alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.harman mining,office of workers comp.programs,cir citation,internal quotation marks,and alteration omitted.we defer to the alj determination regarding the proper weight to be accorded competing medical evidence,and we must be careful not to substitute our judgment for that of the alj.id.
in the present case,both tuteur and zaldivar opined that bender disability was caused by his history of smoking and cancer treatments.the alj discredited these disability causation opinions because the doctors did not adequately explain,as required under the standard,why bender disability was not also partially attributable to pneumoconiosis.the alj additionally found that,by emphas
