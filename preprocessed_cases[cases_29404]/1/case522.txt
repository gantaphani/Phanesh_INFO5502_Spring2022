this case comes to us under the provisions of the labor management reporting and disclosure act of lmrda,supp.v.
thomas harrington,a member of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america ubc,alleges that the functions and purposes traditionally accorded to local unions in the new england region of the ubc are now served by the new england regional council.that council,he says,must be treated as a local union and not as an intermediary body.consequently,harrington argues,the officers of that council must be elected in the manner that the lmrda prescribes for local unions,that is,by direct election by secret ballot among the union members rather than by vote of delegates who are elected from the local unions,as the ubc has chosen to do for the council.id.b,d.harrington filed a complaint with the secretary of labor asking her to require the council to hold a new election as a local union.the secretary declined for reasons stated in a brief statement of reasons.
harrington sued under the lmrda.on motion by the secretary,the district court dismissed his suit.see harrington herman,d.because the statement of reasons is insufficient to permit meaningful judicial review,we reverse the district court,vacate the secretary statement of reasons and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand to the secretary.we do not now decide whether any refusal by the secretary to bring suit as sought by harrington would be arbitrary or capricious.
the lmrda,was designed to ensure that unions would be democratically governed,and responsive to the will of the union membership as expressed in open,periodic elections.finnegan leu,d see also,at it needs no argument to demonstrate the importance of free and democratic union elections.the lmrda balances this purpose with the countervailing policy recogniz ing that unions should be free to conduct their affairs so far as possible and the government should not become excessively involved in union politics.reich local,laborers int l union,cir.
title iv of the lmrda,establishes minimum standards for the election of union officers.the lmrda provides that e very local labor organization shall elect its officers not less than once every three years by secret ballot among the members.id.b.however,these direct election requirements do not apply to the selection of officers of intermediate bodies of labor organizations id.d.instead,the act provides 
officers of intermediate bodies,such as general committees,system boards,joint boards,or joint councils,shall be elected not less often than once every four years by secret ballot among the members in good standing or by labor organization officers representative of such members who have been elected by secret ballot.
id.d thus an intermediate body may choose between direct election or representative election ubc has chosen the latter.
when a union member wishes to challenge the validity of an election,he must exhaust remedies available under the labor organization rules,and he may then file a complaint with the secretary.id.a.upon receipt of a union member complaint,the secretary investigates the allegations of that complaint.id.b.if she determines that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of title iv occurred and that the violation probably infected the outcome of the election,she must bring suit against the labor organization to set aside the election and to obtain a new election.wirtz local,glass bottle blowers ass n,d see also heckler chaney,d noting that b quite clearly withdrew discretion from the agency and provided guidelines for exercise of its enforcement power.
in,the ubc,an international union,undertook a dramatic restructuring which established a new organization of dominant and subordinate ubc bodies.the international remained at the top of the organization.below the international,the ubc established a group of strong regional entities,called regional councils.lastly,the numerous existing ubc locals were placed at the bottom,subordinate to both the international and the regional councils.it appears that before july,the regional councils did not exist.
the new england regional council nerc covers ubc members and subordinate ubc locals throughout connecticut,maine,massachusetts,new hampshire,rhode island,and vermont.the officers of nerc are not elected directly by local union members,but rather by a secret ballot of delegates who are,in turn,elected by the members of the local unions.the key officer of nerc is the executive he has exclusive authority to submit grievances to binding arbitration,hire or terminate nerc employees,chair the collective bargaining committees,appoint the membership of collective bargaining committees,and appoint the members of the trial committees convened to discipline union members.
although deprived of many of their previous functions,the ubc locals subordinate to nerc remain independently chartered,have identifiable memberships,elect their own officers,and have their own.although the locals do not negotiate collective bargaining agreements,the membership of the locals must vote to ratify the agreements.the locals hold meetings,have their own budgets and bank accounts,and collect members dues a substantial portion of which are then passed on to nerc.each local is permitted to hire one clerical staff member.grievances are administered in the early,informal stages by local stewards,but the locals can not invoke higher levels of the grievance process,including arbitration.
harrington,a ubc member in massachusetts,filed a complaint with the secretary of labor on september,pursuant to and,alleging that nerc was essentially a local labor organization because it had assumed most of the powers and functions traditionally retained by ubc locals.harrington contended that because nerc is a local,it must elect its officers by direct vote of the local union members,and not by vote of delegates from the local unions,in order to comply with the lmrda 
after conducting an investigation,the secretary concluded in a statement of reasons dated april,that nerc is an intermediate body,not a local,and is therefore permitted to elect its officers either by secret ballot among the members in good standing or by labor organization officers representative of such members who have been elected by secret ballot.d.
in the statement of reasons,the secretary noted that nerc bylaws invested it with some of the powers and functions that the union locals previously possessed,but that this was insufficient ground upon which to regard nerc as a local rather than as an intermediate body the secretary stated that there was no basis in the statute or legislative history for concluding that if intermediate bodies possess certain functions and powers,they lose the statutory choice of electing officers indirectly and must elect their officers directly.the secretary concluded that because the investigation found no violation of law in the method by which nerc elected its officers,there was no basis for bringing suit against nerc.
harrington then filed suit in united states district court challenging the secretary refusal to file an enforcement action.on april,the district court granted the secretary motion to dismiss,reasoning that the secretary decision not to initiate suit was not arbitrary or capricious.harrington,d at.harrington promptly filed this appeal.
harrington principal argument is that the secretary,in refusing to sue nerc,has retreated without explanation from her prior policies regarding the enforcement of direct election standards.specifically,harrington contends that the secretary current position is directly at odds with her established expressed in the regulations and case enforcing the direct election provisions of b against intermediate bodies that have,in reality,assumed all of the functions of a local union.harrington is supported by amicus curiae association for union democracy,inc,while the ubc and nerc,acting as amici curiae,support the secretary 
the secretary denies any inconsistency and also contends that her action is justified by the lmrda broad purposes,as expressed in its legislative history.noting that the government should be careful not to undermine within the labor movement.at,the secretary argues that she may not decide the appropriate allocation of power between local and intermediate bodies of a labor organization.she contends further that the deference to the union allocation of power is consistent with congress recognition of the fact that in some unions intermediate bodies exercise responsible governing power.id.at.
amici the ubc and nerc argue that the secretary decision ultimately may be justified by the evolving nature of labor relations in the construction industry.according to the union,the construction industry has undergone increasing regionalization over the past few decades,with construction work becoming concentrated in fewer and larger employers,and employers undertaking a greater number of projects the prior ubc organizational structure,which relied on relatively strong locals,was ill equipped to handle the realities of employers operating on a regional scale.thus,the union contends,the secretary decision to allow strong regional councils reflects a sensible response to prevailing market conditions.the ubc and nerc urge that a contrary result would not only impinge on internal union affairs but would also handicap their ability to deal with employers.see,at noting the committee belief that the act should not weaken unions in their role as agents see also estreicher,deregulating union democracy,colum.bus,arguing that excessive regulation of internal union affairs will impose unnecessary compliance costs and weaken the unions ability to engage effectively in economic struggle with employers.
the secretary decision under title iv of the lmrda not to bring an action against a labor organization for violation of is subject to only narrow judicial review.in dunlop bachowski,d,the supreme court held that the secretary decision is subject to review under the administrative procedure act for whether her decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at.quoting a and citing.the supreme court said that e xcept in what must be the rare case,the court review should be confined to examination of the reasons statement,and the determination whether the statement,without more,evinces that the secretary decision is so irrational as to constitute the decision arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
only the secretary may bring such a suit for remedies.local,furniture piano moving crowley,d.there are two principal justifications for this exclusivity to protect unions from frivolous litigation and unnecessary judicial interference with their elections,and to centralize in a single proceeding such litigation as might be warranted.trbovich united mine workers,d.although congress mandated that the secretary bring suit upon a finding that probable cause exists that a violation took place,the supreme court has implied that the secretary may decline to bring suit if the secretary is not convinced that the violation probably infected the challenged election.bachowski,at.quotation marks and emphasis omitted see also shelley brock.
the statement of reasons enables a court to determine whether the secretary refusal to act is contrary to law.bachowski,at.the courts ability to review the secretary decision,however,is not the only justification for requiring the secretary to provide an adequate statement of reasons.the supreme court in bachowski stated that congress intended that the secretary provide the complaining union member with a reasoned statement as to why she determined not to proceed.and the court noted that congress intended to compel the secretary in her statement to cover the relevant points and eschew irrelevancies,thereby assuring careful administrative consideration.id.at.
this case raises two significant questions not directly addressed in bachowski.the first is whether the secretary has departed from her prior interpretation of the act,codified at.the second is whether the secretary,if she is employing the analysis contained in,is doing so in a manner consistent with donovan national transient division,international brotherhood of boilermakers boilermakers,cir,and schultz employees federation of the humble oil refining humble oil,dist.lexis.as to the first question,the regulation provides that 
the characterization of a particular organizational unit as a local,intermediate,is determined by its functions and purposes rather than the formal title by which it is known or how it classifies itself.
because the lmrda does not define the terms local labor organization or intermediate bodies,the secretary has room to supply definitions,as she did in the regulation.
the secretary statement of reasons,however,does not cite to the language of.indeed,it has language which appears to disavow a functional approach there is no basis in the statute or in the legislative history for concluding that if intermediate bodies possess certain functions and powers,they may only elect their officers directly by secret ballot vote among the members of the intermediate body.this is seemingly inconsistent with the regulation,which requires a functions and purposes analysis.
as to the second question,other parts of the statement then purport to look at the evidence to determine what functions are performed by the two entities,perhaps applying the test in the regulations.but the statement does so without any reference to the secretary own precedents,including the precedents discussed in boilermakers and humble oil 
in boilermakers,the secretary sued to compel the national transient division ntd,a unit of the boilermakers union,to conduct elections in accordance with the provisions of the lmrda governing local labor organizations.see at.the tenth circuit held that g iven its structure and functions,we find no reason to reject the secretary characterization of ntd as a local labor organization.id.at.the court noted first that,because ntd was subordinate to the international and had no subordinate organizational units,it had the relatively simple organizational structure characteristic of local labor organizations.id.but the court reasoned that the m ost important factor supporting the secretary position was that ntd performs the functions of a local.id.emphasis added.in so holding,the court relied on the command of to examine the functions and purposes of the entity in question.id.at quoting.the functions of the ntd included the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements,enforcing the agreements,handling grievances,collecting dues from members,maintaining lists,and holding meetings at which members express their views.id 
similarly to boilermakers,the secretary in humble oil sued to force an entity purporting to be an intermediate body to conduct elections as a local labor organization.dist.lexis.the district court,accepting the secretary construction of the act,found that the supposed intermediate body,the employees federation,was a statutory local because it performed the basic local union functions.id.at emphasis added.that is,i t settle d grievances collect ed dues and establishe d wages,benefits,and working conditions by contract negotiations with the employer and discipline d its members and officers.id.even though the employees federation had numerous subordinate local bodies,the court noted that these were mere administrative arms with no separate autonomy that performed no significant collective bargaining functions.id.at.
given the similarities between this case and boilermakers and humble oil,the secretary must provide some explanation distinguishing these cases.we can not now say whether the secretary has changed her interpretation or departed from the regulation but we can say with fair assurance that substantial questions have been raised and the secretary statement is inadequate to permit us to resolve them.in that inadequacy of her statement is arbitrary.
the secretary denies there has been any change in interpretation or policy,but it is far from evident that this is so,and the statement of reasons does not adequately address this topic.the statement of reasons does not mention the governing regulation or precedents at all,contains language inconsistent with the functions and purposes approach,and,to the extent it purports to apply a functions and purposes approach,fails to address or adequately distinguish the two most pertinent precedents.
the apa provides the applicable standard of review here and it is commonplace in apa review to require an agency to accompany a change in position with an explanation.see aqueduct sewer auth.epa,cir.predictability as to how the secretary will handle these cases is of real value,and if predictability is to be thwarted in favor of other interests,there should be some explanation.an agency decision can not simply depart from the agency prior precedent without explaining its reasons for doing so.atchison,topeka santa fe ry.wichita bd.of trade,d plurality shaw supermarkets,nlrb,cir jsg trading usda.a deviation from prior interpretations without sufficient explanation may be considered arbitrary and capricious and therefore subject to judicial reversal.see ins yang,d citizens awareness network,united states nuclear regulatory comm n,cir sun oil epa,cir.while this case does not involve judicial review of either an agency adjudicatory proceeding nor of agency rulemaking,the requirement of adequate explanation is an inevitable consequence of applying the apa arbitrary and capricious standard to the secretary reviewable decision whether to initiate prosecution.that requirement distinguishes this case from heckler chaney and its progeny.chaney,at.comparing the presumption of nonreviewability of other agencies decisions not to undertake enforcement actions with the reviewability of the secretary decision under the lmrda.
the agency burden of explanation is heavier where an agency has expressed its statutory interpretation in regulations,adopted after rulemaking,and then seeks to depart from that interpretation.agencies are bound by their regulations,and to permit what may be a change in the regulation without any explanation would undermine the requirement of rulemaking 
agencies do have leeway to change their interpretations of laws,as well as of their own regulations,provided they explain the reasons for such change and provided that those reasons meet the applicable standard of review.see bowles seminole rock sand.counseling judicial deference to an agency interpretation of a rule it promulgates pursuant to statute.compare citizens awareness network,at remanding to agency because agency altered interpretation of regulation without providing reasoning or following statutory procedures,with pub.interest research group fcc,cir upholding agency change in policy where agency provided a sufficiently clear explanation.judicial deference to agency interpretations and policy choices is,in part,premised on the notion that agencies have greater expertise in their area of specialty than do courts,and that they should have flexibility to deal with changing economic and social realities.see,chevron,natural res.def.council,d.it is up to the agency in the first instance to interpret the statute and apply those interpretations to the facts.
based on the secretary statement of reasons,we are unable to determine if the secretary has changed the policy articulated in or her interpretation of that policy.we are confronted here with a different problem than was faced in bachowski,created by what appears to be an inconsistency between the secretary approach and her regulation and prior decisions,which may represent a by the secretary.her statement of reasons fails to explain whether she is departing from her prior course and,if so,the reasons for the change.
decisions about the proper meaning of lmrda statutory terms,and the proper application of the act mandate,are for the secretary to make,so long as they do not contravene the act.these decisions are not up to the courts thus,it is more appropriate for us to refrain from taking any judicial view at this point on the underlying interpretive issues in this case.respect for her authority requires a remand,rather than final court resolution of the issue now.moreover,a finding that the secretary has acted arbitrarily and capriciously as to the ultimate issue would be premature,as it is not clear on this record that the secretary is in fact repudiating her prior interpretations here.
the paucity of explanation hinders judicial review,requiring a remand to the secretary to reopen,thereby providing the secretary an opportunity to better explain her position.bachowski,at.maine civil aeronautics,cir remanding for further proceedings because t here are internal inconsistencies and a failure to clearly articulate the standard being applied in agency decision see also doyle brock,devito shultz.as the supreme court long ago said 
the basis for an administrative action must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.in other words,w e must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.
sec chenery.internal quotation marks omitted see allentown mack sales,nlrb,d the evil of a decision that applies a standard other than the one it enunciates spreads in both directions,preventing both consistent application of the law by subordinate agency personnel and effective review of the law by courts.the secretary is already committed by statute to expending resources in this area and has presumably reviewed all the pertinent factual materials presented.it is not a significant burden on her resources to ask her to explain her decision in a more reasoned fashion nor do we disrupt anything by vacating her decision vacation is a proper remedy when an agency fails to explain its reasoning adequately.see edward quirk nlrb,cir vacating and remanding for further proceedings in absence of reasoned explanation from the board gailius ins,cir vacation and remand appropriate where agency failed to give adequate explanation for conclusions see generally prestes,remanding without vacating agency action,seton hall.forthcoming,working paper available at criticizing the practice of remanding without vacating.
should she again decide not to initiate suit,the secretary must file a sufficient statement of reasons,which addresses both the application of the functions and purposes test of,and whether her decision is consistent with her precedents.if there has been a change,she should also explain whether changing labor market economics justify a modification of prior interpretation or a building construction trades exception to it,or what the other reasons for the change are.see yang,at.agency may carve out exceptions to general policy.
we are mindful of the supreme court admonition that endless litigation concerning the sufficiency of the written statement is inconsistent with the statute goal of expeditious resolution of disputes.bachowski,at.see also eskridge,note,dunlop bachowski and the limits of judicial review under title iv of the lmrda a proposal for administrative reform,yale,arguing that protracted judicial review impairs enforcement scheme.nonetheless,a remand is the appropriate remedy here.a serious question has been raised about the secretary adherence to her own articulated policies.any delay and uncertainty occasioned by remand is justified by the need for clarity,both in this case and more generally,as to her present interpretation of her statutory obligations.pension benefit guar.ltv,d.
the district court dismissal of the petition for review is reversed,the statement of reasons is vacated,and the matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the secretary for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
so ordered.
my colleagues in the majority conclude that they are presently unable to determine whether the secretary actions in this case were unlawful,and that only further clarification from the secretary will permit proper review.given this holding,as i understand it,the secretary now has three options following remand she may initiate suit she may decline to initiate suit,acknowledge that she is adopting a new enforcement policy and interpretation of the act,and provide her reasons for altering her prior policy or she may decline to initiate suit and attempt to clarify for the court why she believes her decision is consistent with the governing regulations and established past practice.
i fully agree that the secretary is entitled to pursue either of the first two options.i write separately to express my view that it would be futile for the secretary to exercise the third option.we need no additional information to correctly conclude that the secretary decision in this case does not square with her established policies and practices.since the secretary has provided no reasoned basis for the inconsistency,we should set aside her decision as arbitrary and capricious in violation of a.see honeywell int l,nlrb,without more,the agency departure from precedent without a reasoned analysis renders its decision arbitrary and capricious.
in,the secretary enacted a regulation directly governing determinations of whether a labor organization is a local or intermediate body for purposes of of the lmrda.see,july.that regulation,which remains in effect,provides that t he characterization of a particular organizational unit as a local,intermediate,is determined by its functions and purposes rather than the formal title by which it is known or how it classifies itself.emphases supplied.the secretary past commitment to the regulation functional as opposed to merely structural approach is borne out in the only reported decisions addressing the question of whether a union entity is a local or intermediate body for purposes of title iv election provisions.see donovan transient,int l of boilermakers,cir shultz employees fed of humble oil ref,dist.lexis.
by contrast,the secretary statement of reasons in the present case declares that t here is no basis in the statute or in the legislative history for concluding that if intermediate bodies possess certain functions and powers,they may only elect their officers directly by secret ballot vote among the members of the intermediate body emphases added.taking this statement as a guiding principle,the secretary then proceeds to analyze only the structure of the labor organization in question,concluding that the ubc locals satisfy the definition of local in the ordinary sense in that they are are clearly subordinate to nerc,which in turn is subordinate to the international.
i fail to see how further clarification will reconcile the secretary present position that there is no basis for conducting an inquiry of the entity functions and powers with the governing regulation which mandates an inquiry of the functions and purposes of the challenged entity the secretary has had every opportunity in this litigation to characterize her decision as consistent with past practice,and i presume that she did not hold back her best arguments.nevertheless,the secretary extended analysis of the case law is unpersuasive,and she makes no attempt to harmonize her decision with.if we are not yet convinced that the secretary has pursued a consistent approach,what more will she reveal in a supplemental statement that is likely to sway us 
to be sure,one can conceive of a statement of reasons that is so elliptical or opaque that a reviewing court simply can not discern the secretary position or rationale.and in such cases,i fully agree that further explanation from the secretary is warranted.see,donovan local.teachers union,mandating a supplemental statement of reasons where the secretary reasons for finding no violation of the act were perfunctory and cryptic.however,this is not such a case.the secretary has stated her present interpretation of the act with reasonable clarity,and her present interpretation obviously does not gibe with the readily discernible past policy and practice accordingly,we should conclude that her decision must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious.if,following remand,the secretary decides not to initiate suit,she should be required to provide a statement of reasons that acknowledges her departure from precedent.she should also have to explain her rationale for the decision and explain whether the decision is consistent with both the lmrda and any governing regulations currently in effect.
since my view does not command a majority of this panel,i must await,with morbid curiosity,a persuasive clarification of the reasons for the secretary decision that could not be articulated in the original statement of reasons,the secretary page brief,or the fifteen page submission of the amicus union.
statement of reasons of the secretary of labor 
the complainant,thomas harrington,a member in good standing of new england regional council of carpenters regional council,united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners,filed a timely complaint alleging that the regional council fails to elect its officers in compliance with title iv of the labor management reporting and disclosure act of,et the act.for the following reasons,the complaint is dismissed.
the complainant alleges that since the regional council assumed functions traditionally performed by the locals of the carpenters,the regional council is now acting as a local labor organization and must therefore directly elect its officers to remain in compliance with section b of the act,b.section b of the act states,every local labor organization shall elect its officers not less often than once every three years by secret ballot among the members in good standing.the regional council considers itself an intermediate body,and elects its officers via delegates elected by the members of locals pursuant to section d of the act,d.section d states that,officers of intermediate bodies,such as general committees,system boards,joint boards,or joint councils,shall be elected not less often than once every four years by secret ballot among the members in good standing or by labor organization officers representative of such members who have been elected by secret ballot.
the regional council was created by the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners international on july.the bylaws of the regional council do appear to invest it with some of the powers and functions the locals traditionally possessed.however,the department is unable to conclude that for this reason the regional council is no longer an intermediate body entitled to elect its officers in accordance with either of the two choices prescribed by congress for intermediate bodies in section d of the act.
congress purpose in ordering unions to conduct free and fair periodic elections was to insure that the officials who wield power are responsive to the desires of the men and women whom they represent,sess.in section d of the act,congress indicated that with respect to intermediate bodies the above purpose could be achieved either directly by a secret ballot vote among all of the members of the intermediate body or indirectly by delegates who themselves were elected directly by secret ballot vote among all the members they represent.furthermore,that same report indicates that congress recognized that intermediate bodies had varying degrees of governing power.it states,the bill recognizes that in some unions intermediate bodies exercise responsible governing power and specifies that the members of such bodies as systems boards in the railroad industry be elected by secret ballot of the members of the union or union officers elected by the members by a secret ballot.id.emphasis added.thus,congress understood that intermediate bodies could exercise governing power and still be permitted to elect officers via delegate as long as these delegates were selected by secret ballot.there is no basis in the statute or in the legislative history for concluding that if intermediate bodies possess certain functions and powers,they may only elect their officers directly by secret ballot vote among the members of the intermediate body.
further,the department investigation disclosed no evidence that would provide a basis for concluding that the r
