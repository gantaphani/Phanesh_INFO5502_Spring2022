petitioner abdelaziz kandamar,a native and citizen of morocco,seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing an appeal of a final order of removal.in its order,the bia affirmed the decision of the immigration judge ij denying petitioner motion to suppress evidence taken by the department of homeland security dhs at the special registration interview under the national security registration system nseers.kandamar claims that nseers violated his equal protection and due process rights.in the alternative,kandamar asserts that the ij erred in denying the application for voluntary departure because during the special registration dhs had taken kandamar expired passport,which was allegedly necessary to obtain a valid travel document.after careful review of the record,we deny the petition for review.
background 
facts and procedural history 
petitioner kandamar,a native and citizen of morocco,entered the united states as a nonimmigrant visitor on april.he was authorized to remain in the country until may.kandamar overstayed his visa.he has no criminal history.
on august,the department of justice issued an nseers notice for the registration of certain young male nonimmigrant aliens from designated countries,including morocco.the nseers notice required these nonimmigrants to appear before,register with,answer questions from,and present documents,including a passport and an card,to dhs.id.at.the nseers notice also specified that dhs conduct the interview under oath and record answers.id.
on january,kandamar reported to the john kennedy federal building in boston without counsel to comply with the special registration procedures under the nseers notice.as instructed,he brought his passport,which had expired,and his departure record.dhs officers took these documents.at the conclusion of the interview,kandamar was placed into removal proceedings and charged with removability under a b for remaining longer than permitted following admission as a nonimmigrant visitor.he was issued a notice to appear.
the ij continued kandamar case twice so that he could retain counsel.on july,kandamar appeared at a hearing with counsel,and the ij continued the case again at the request of counsel.on august,kandamar filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained by dhs by unlawful search and seizure,alleging that nseers constitutes racial profiling and discrimination based on national origin violates substantive due process because its use to entrap nationals of certain countries is fundamentally unfair and violates equal protection by treating legal and illegal entrants differently.
at the hearing on august,kandamar denied removability.kandamar counsel challenged the constitutionality of nseers and,alternatively,asked for voluntary departure.stating that kandamar passport had expired,he explained however,the government has his passport and the moroccan consulate wo give him a new passport without the old passport.after setting a date for a hearing on the merits of the motion to suppress,the ij returned to the issue of voluntary departure 
q.so again,at the conclusion of the merits hearing though,i will not be able to grant 
i understand.
voluntary departure if he does not have a valid document,so 
i mean,he can 
just so you aware of that.
somehow work it out with the moroccans.
i do know,but i just saying that,you know,those are the choices.
no,i understand.
kandamar counsel did not ask for a return of the passport.
at the hearing on the motion to suppress on november,counsel stated that most of her arguments were in the brief,but complained that she had just received the government opposition.the ij inquired 
well,you saying that you not ready to proceed on this opposition or do you have any additional arguments 
most of the arguments that i was going to bring up today were based on the brief,the motion that we already filed.
all right,okay.and so,those are certainly part of the record now unless there anything in addition to your motion.is there anything in addition 
no,your honor.
to the motion all right.
denying the motion,the ij held that the court is not able to rule on the constitutionality of the regulations,denied kandamar application for voluntary departure because he was not statutorily eligible for the relief due to the lack of any travel documents permitting entry to morocco,and ordered that kandamar be removed and deported to morocco.
kandamar appealed to the bia,alleging that the ij erred in denying the application for voluntary departure,that the motion to suppress should have been granted because nseers is unconstitutional,and that the ij should have conducted a factual inquiry into what transpired at the nseers interview and the circumstances of the seizure of petitioner documents.he specifically challenged the special registration interview because he was not notified of his right to representation.
on september,the bia declined to address the challenge to nseers because the board is not empowered to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations that we administer.with respect to the appeal of the denial of the motion to suppress,it agreed with the ij that petitioner had not shown that the government conduct was egregious,warranting the application of the exclusionary rule to immigration proceedings under ins,d,and dismissed the appeal.
kandamar challenges the denial of both the motion to suppress and the application for voluntary departure.
ii.discussion 
voluntary departure 
kandamar petitions for review of the ij denial of his application for voluntary departure.kandamar criticizes the bia because,in reviewing the ij denial of the request for voluntary departure,it did not consider the fact that petitioner lacked a valid passport because dhs had seized it.kandamar also criticizes the ij for adjudicating his eligibility for voluntary departure after a very brief hearing with inadequate reasoning.specifically,he contends that the ij initially indicated that she would permit voluntary departure and did not explain what changed her mind.these issues were properly raised first with the bia.
pursuant to b,the attorney general may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the united states at the alien own expense if,at the conclusion of a removal proceeding the immigration judge enters an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and makes certain findings,including that the alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the united states and intends to do so.section specifically states that n o court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure.id.f see also.moreover,a b provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under.thus,this court lacks authority to review a refusal to allow voluntary departure.karim gonzales,cir.
petitioner seeks to circumvent this jurisdictional bar by claiming that the ij gave him an inadequate hearing on his claim that his passport was unfairly taken from him at the nseers interview and that her reasoning was insufficient.a due process claim requires that a cognizable liberty or property interest be at stake.dacosta gonzales,cir citation omitted.discretionary forms of relief do not rise to the level of such a protected interest.id.adjustment of status citation omitted.thus,to the extent petitioner seeks to paint his claim in due process colors,that claim will not succeed because voluntary departure is a privilege,not a right.jupiter ashcroft,cir.citation omitted,cert.denied,d.in any event,the ij succinctly explained that the lack of a passport or any other travel document precluded voluntary departure.no greater hearing or rationale was necessary on the point.
kandamar primary protest is that the dhs improperly seized his passport at the special registration.the issue is poorly vetted in the record as the government does not cite any legal authority to support the seizure of the passport.while the special registration regulations authorize the government to require the immigrant to provide information or documentation confirming compliance with his or her visa and admission,f ii,which presumably includes the passport,they do not authorize seizure of the passport even assuming the expired passport were improperly seized,as opposed to inspected,at the nseers interview,there is no evidence in the record from january,when the passport was taken from him,until the merits hearing on november,that kandamar timely sought the return of his passport.while he alerted the ij to the fact dhs seized the passport,he did not urge the ij to order dhs to return it,although he knew a travel document would have to be produced at the merits hearing.karim,at denying voluntary departure where passport was seized at a special registration but alien did not request return from ij.moreover,the allegation that morocco would not renew the passport without the presentation of the expired one does not demonstrate that diligent efforts were made before the removal hearing to secure one.see.
b.other due process claims 
kandamar raises a attack on nseers,arguing that the evidence obtained from the nseers interview should be suppressed because nseers,both facially and as applied to him,is fundamentally unfair in violation of the fourth and fifth amendments.legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,including alleged errors related to due process claims.settenda ashcroft,cir.
in the immigration context,the supreme court has left open only a glimmer of hope of suppression.ashcroft,cir.specifically,the supreme court has concluded 
that the cost of the exclusionary rule generally outweighs its benefits in the context of civil deportation hearings.the court thus held that the exclusionary rule generally should not apply in that context,but may have left the door open in cases of egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.
id.at quoting ins,d.in setting forth that rule,the supreme court noted favorably the bia holding that evidence will be excluded if the circumstances surrounding a particular arrest and interrogation would render use of the evidence obtained thereby fundamentally unfair and in violation of due process requirements of the fifth amendment.id.at.citing matter of toro,i n.we examine kandamar claims to determine whether there is evidence of an egregious violation of the fourth amendment or other liberties.
to begin,kandamar claims that his due process rights were violated because he was not given the option of having counsel present at the nseers interview.kandamar did not present this argument to the ij either in his motion to suppress or at the hearing.while he did present the argument to the bia,the bia did not expressly address it.by regulation,kandamar does have a right to be represented by counsel at examinations by immigration officers,such as the nseers special registration.w henever an examination is provided for in this chapter,the person involved shall have the right to be represented by an attorney.b.while the regulations do provide that the alien be notified of his right to counsel at no expense to the government and be given a list of free legal services at a deportation hearing,see id.b,kandamar received this notification.however,he does not point to any parallel regulation that requires that an immigration examiner similarly explain the right to representation at the special registration interview,although it would seem to be a better practice.there is no evidence that kandamar was precluded from having counsel present at his interview.
next,although the argument is not,kandamar argues that the nseers special registration was so coercive that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.we have held that in some circumstances,statements by an arrested alien can be involuntary and coerced in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.see ins,cir reversing a deportation order where statements of alien were coerced in violation of the due process clause.kandamar claims that dhs restraint violated the regulation governing administrative detention under b because the inherent nature of special registration creates an atmosphere where a reasonable person would conclude he is not free to leave.section b provides 
interrogation is questioning designed to elicit specific information.an immigration officer,like any other person,has the right to ask questions of anyone as long as the immigration officer does not restrain the freedom of an individual,not under arrest,to walk away.
b.kandamar did not squarely present this argument that his interview was so coercive as to be tantamount to detention to either the ij or the bia.a petitioner is generally required to exhaust administrative remedies with the bia before raising an issue in a petition for review of a final order of removal.see d olujoke gonzales,cir.we have indicated that,in rare circumstances,an asserted denial of due process may be exempt from the ordinary exhaustion requirement,for example,where the claim is beyond the authority of the agency to adjudicate.dacosta gonzales,cir.when constitutional claims involve procedural errors correctable by the bia,applicants must raise such claims as part of their administrative appeal.capric ashcroft,cir.as such,kandamar failed to exhaust his administrative remedies to preserve his claim.
kandamar also argues that the ij should have granted him a hearing about what transpired at the special registration,an issue that was argued to the bia.kandamar did not proffer any specific evidence of any government misconduct by threats,coercion or physical abuse to the ij or the bia with regard to his nseers interview that would constitute egregious government conduct.there is no evidence that kandamar asked to leave,was told he could not leave,or was restrained from leaving during the interview.the allegation of an intimidating atmosphere created by armed guards seems to be gleaned from an unpublished case in another jurisdiction rather than petitioner own personal experience.most importantly,immigration counsel did not request an evidentiary hearing before the ij but rested on her brief,which did not raise this claim at all.
kandamar most interesting due process claim is the poorly developed argument made to the bia that nseers is fundamentally unfair because it violates the equal protection principles embodied in the fifth amendment,contending that it only affects nationals of certain countries and thus constitutes blatant racial profiling this is the type of fundamental constitutional claim the bia is powerless to address.hadayat gonzales,cir.
the due process clause of the fifth amendment contains an equal protection safeguard.see bolling sharpe.ins,cir.we have held that aliens are entitled to equal protection of the law under the fifth amendment.see vieira garcía ins,cir applying a rational basis for review to an equal protection analysis involving a based classification.
however,congress may permissibly set immigration criteria based on an alien nationality or place of origin.the supreme court has long held that judicial review of in the immigration context is deferential.see ins,d noting we have recognized that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context citation omitted fiallo bell,d this court has repeatedly emphasized that over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.quoting oceanic steam navigation stranahan.we have similarly stated 
nowhere is the scope of judicial inquiry more limited than in the area of immigration legislation.indeed,the supreme court has long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments largely immune from judicial control.the political character of this intrinsically executive function renders it subject only to narrow judicial review.
