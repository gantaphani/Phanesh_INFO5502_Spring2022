opinion of the court 
the secretary of labor secretary petitions for review of a final order of the occupational safety and health review commission commission.the commission order affirmed the order of an administrative law judge alj vacating citations that the secretary had issued to roy construction,roy.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the commission order.
in december,a representative of the occupational safety and health administration osha inspected the charles harwood medical complex project,one of roy construction work sites in the virgin islands.as a result of this inspection,on april,osha mailed citations to roy alleging violations of osha safety standards at the site and proposing total penalties of.on april,someone signed for the citations on roy behalf a roy office administrator later testified before the alj that the signer was not a roy employee but rather an employee of a private mail company used by roy.under section a of the occupational safety and health act of osh act,an employer has fifteen working days from receipt of a citation and assessment of penalty to notify the secretary of its intent to contest them.a.if the employer has not provided such notice within fifteen working days,the proposed citation and assessment shall be deemed a final order of the commission and not subject to review by any court or agency.id.roy did not notify osha of its intent to contest the citations within the statutory period,which expired on may.accordingly,in june osha sent a letter to roy requesting payment of the penalties plus interest.roy attempted to reopen discussion of the citations with osha by telephone and eventually received a reply that the citations were final and that the only recourse available was an appeal to the commission.in august,osha sent a debt collection letter to roy.subsequently,roy sent letters to osha on august and the commission on august announcing its intent to contest the citations.
the secretary moved before the commission alj to dismiss roy challenge to the citations as untimely.after holding an evidentiary hearing on april,the alj issued a decision and order on july,denying the secretary motion to dismiss.the alj invoked federal rule of civil procedure b,which states that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order resulting from,inter alia,excusable neglect.see rule b.in george harms construction chao,cir,we noted that the relevant factors for evaluating an excusable neglect motion include the danger of prejudice,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.see id.at quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick,d.the alj concluded that excusing the lateness of roy notice of contest noc would not prejudice the secretary who had also missed deadlines prior to the alj hearing and that roy had acted in good faith by abating the violations and attempting to ensure future compliance.he accepted roy explanation that part of its delay was the result of the company move to a new office therefore,the alj granted rule b relief to roy on excusable neglect grounds and ordered the secretary to file a complaint regarding the merits of the citations within twenty days.subsequently,at the secretary request,the alj extended the deadline for filing a complaint.
instead of filing a complaint,the secretary sent a letter to the alj on august,informing him that the secretary hereby declines to file a complaint to proceed on the merits because the secretary believes that your honor decision to allow defendant sic to file a late notice of contest was clearly erroneous.the secretary explained that her decision was intended to preserve her right to appeal and is not characterized by bad faith,nor is it intended to prejudice the respondent in this case.the alj responded on september,by ordering the secretary to show cause why the contested citation s should not be vacated for failure to file a complaint.on september,the secretary informed the alj again by letter that she would not file a complaint because she sought to put this matter in a posture suitable for appeal.consequently,on october the alj vacated the citations on november,the secretary petitioned the full commission for discretionary review of the alj decision granting rule b relief to roy and his subsequent order vacating the citations.in her petition,the secretary acknowledged that if the commission ruled in roy favor regarding the propriety of rule b relief,the alj vacatur order would stand and the secretary would be precluded from litigating the citations on the merits.
the commission issued its decision on june.noting that aljs have discretion under commission rule a,a,to rule against any party who has failed to plead or otherwise proceed as provided by these rules or as required by the commission or judge,the commission found that the alj had not abused his discretion by vacating the citations.see sec y of labor roy,cas.bna comm.the commission acknowledged that,in past cases,it had reviewed rule b rulings on their merits even after the secretary had refused to file a complaint as ordered.id.at.nonetheless,the commission concluded that it had never affirmatively approved this procedure for obtaining review and that several past cases were distinguishable.id.at.
the secretary has filed a petition with this court,asking us to review the commission decision not to reach the merits of the rule b claim and to reverse the alj grant of rule b relief.we have jurisdiction under b,which allows a ny person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the commission to obtain review in any united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or where the employer has its principal office.the secretary petition presents two questions whether the commission erred by affirming the alj vacatur order solely on the ground that the secretary failed to file a complaint,without reviewing the secretary argument that the alj improperly excused roy untimely noc if we rule in the secretary favor on the first issue,whether roy filed its motion to excuse the untimeliness of its noc within a reasonable time as required by rule b.because we rule against the secretary on the first issue,we need not reach the second question.
before addressing the secretary contention that the commission erred in its decision,we must address roy arguments that the secretary is barred from attacking the alj vacatur order at all.we find these arguments to be without merit.
first,roy argues that the secretary is barred from attacking the vacatur order as an unwarranted sanction because she did not raise this issue before the commission.our reading of the secretary brief before the commission indicates otherwise.the secretary brief argued that the alj vacatur order should be reversed,that the commission should not treat the order as a sanction for misconduct,and that the order is reversible even though the alj appropriately entered it at the secretary request.see opening brief of the secretary at,sec y of labor roy,cas.bna comm.these are essentially the same arguments that the secretary raises in the instant petition.accordingly,we conclude that no basis exists for the claim that the secretary failed to raise the necessary arguments before the commission.
second,roy contends that the secretary is judicially estopped from arguing that the alj vacatur order was in any manner improper because she made the allegedly inconsistent argument before the commission that she had actively solicited the order.we reject roy contention because we do not view the secretary arguments as inconsistent.the secretary position all along has been that she sought the vacatur order solely as a means to obtain immediate review of the alj rule b decision.she has never taken the position that the order was justified as a sanction for any alleged misconduct,and she has always made clear that her ultimate goal was to obtain a reversal of the order.moreover,even if we believed that the secretary positions have been inconsistent,we would not exercise our discretion to apply judicial estoppel because roy has not identified any other factors that justify application of this doctrine 
finally,roy claims that if we reach the merits of the alj july,decision without setting aside the alj october,vacatur order,we would be rendering an advisory opinion.roy argues further that we should not set aside the vacatur order because the secretary is foreclosed from challenging it and because it is based on grounds independent from the july decision.we have already rejected roy arguments that the secretary is foreclosed from challenging the vacatur order.as for roy contention that we should not set aside the vacatur order because it stands on independent grounds,this is essentially a restatement of the commission reasoning for affirming the vacatur order without considering the july order.accordingly,our discussion of the commission decision in the next section will address this argument.
under section of the administrative procedure act apa,a reviewing court shall set aside agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we apply this standard to our review of the commission decision.the secretary presents two arguments in support of her contention that the commission acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by affirming the alj vacatur order without reviewing the alj earlier rule b decision.first,she contends that the commission action arbitrarily and capriciously flouted the federal merger rule,which provides that interlocutory orders issued before a final judgment are reviewable at the same time as the final judgment.by reviewing the alj final order vacating the citations without reviewing the interlocutory rule b order,the secretary argues,the commission departed from the merger rule without a reasoned explanation.second,she contends that the commission arbitrarily and capriciously departed from its previous practice of allowing the secretary to obtain immediate review of an order by refusing to proceed and thereby inducing the alj to issue a final appealable order.
the secretary first argument is that the commission action arbitrarily and capriciously flouted the federal merger rule.under this rule,prior interlocutory orders merge with the final judgment in a case,and the interlocutory orders to the extent that they affect the final judgment may be reviewed on appeal from the final order.in re westinghouse sec,cir the secretary argues that because federal appellate courts apply the merger rule to review a district court interlocutory orders on appeal from a final order,the commission is similarly obligated to apply the merger rule to review an alj interlocutory orders on appeal from a final order.she argues that federal precedent on the merger rule required the commission to apply the rule to review the interlocutory rule b order despite the fact that the final vacatur order was a response to her refusal to file a complaint.she analogizes her situation to bethel mcallister,cir,in which the plaintiff,who had obtained a favorable judgment at his original trial and objected to the district court order requiring a retrial,refused to proceed at the retrial and thereby induced the district court to enter a final judgment against him for failure to prosecute.id.at.we held in bethel that the plaintiff failure to prosecute did not prevent our review of the retrial order,largely because the plaintiff had foreclosed the possibility of piecemeal litigation by renouncing any intention of proceeding at the retrial if he lost the appeal.id.at likewise,the secretary argues,her failure to file a complaint did not prevent commission review of the rule b order because she had foreclosed the possibility of piecemeal litigation by declaring she would not litigate the citations on their merits.in short,the secretary argument is that when the commission departs from an allegedly indistinguishable federal precedent such as bethel without a reasoned explanation,its action is arbitrary and capricious.
whether bethel and similar cases are distinguishable is beside the point,however,because nothing compels the commission to follow federal merger rule precedents in the first place.the federal statute governing commission procedure states simply the commission is authorized to make such rules as are necessary for the orderly transaction of its proceedings.unless the commission has adopted a different rule,its proceedings shall be in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.g.similarly,commission rule b provides in the absence of a specific provision,procedure shall be in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.b.nothing in the commission rules specifically addresses the merger rule,but the federal rules of civil procedure are also silent about it.thus,we conclude that the commission may depart from federal merger rule case law in its adjudications.
moreover,although the commission rules do not address the merger rule directly,they arguably address it indirectly through commission rule,which governs interlocutory appeals.see.in the federal judicial system,the merger rule is closely linked to the statutory final judgment rule.the final judgment rule provides that,with a few limited exceptions federal appellate courts have jurisdiction to review only final decisions of federal district courts and not interlocutory ones.see.by allowing appellate courts to review interlocutory rulings on appeal from the final judgment,the federal merger rule ensures that those rulings will not escape review.see generally charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure ed.supp.if federal appellate courts could routinely review interlocutory rulings prior to final judgment,they could be less generous in their application of the merger rule.
the commission is more tolerant of interlocutory appeals than the federal court system.under commission rule,the commission has discretion to grant a petition for immediate interlocutory review of an alj ruling if it involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and immediate review may materially expedite the final disposition of the proceedings,or if the challenged ruling might result in the release of allegedly privileged information.the only comparable provision for interlocutory appeals in federal courts is b,which permits an appellate court to grant immediate interlocutory review when a district judge states in writing that an interlocutory order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation see b.although much of the language of b is similar to that of commission rule,the two provisions differ significantly because b allows an appellate court to grant interlocutory review only when a district judge grants permission,whereas commission rule allows the commission to grant interlocutory review without an alj permission.in light of its greater discretion to hear interlocutory appeals,the commission could reasonably conclude that the merger rule should have less force in appeals of an alj final judgments,at least when those final judgments are directed against a party that refused to proceed and made no attempt to seek interlocutory review thus,commission rule bolsters our conclusion that the commission is not bound by federal precedent regarding the merger rule.
the secretary also suggests that the commission announced in its own case law that it would follow federal precedent on the merger rule.she contends that in ltv steel,cas.bna comm,the commission announced that it follows and expects its aljs to follow the federal final judgment rule and policy against piecemeal appeals.apparently,the secretary implicit argument is that these purported statements in ltv steel are equivalent to endorsement of the merger rule and the related federal case law.first,we disagree with the secretary that ltv adopts the final judgment rule.nothing in ltv adopts this rule directly and the opinion even observes that the commission may grant interlocutory review in a number of direct contrast to the federal final judgment rule heavy presumption against interlocutory appeals.see cas.bna at citing.second,although we agree that ltv endorsed the federal policy against piecemeal appeals,we do not view that endorsement as equivalent to adoption of the merger rule.ltv endorses the policy against piecemeal appeals as embodied in rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,which applies only to piecemeal appeals of final judgments related to a particular claim or party.id.at.therefore,ltv endorsement of rule b tells us nothing about the commission views on the appropriate manner in which to obtain review of a ruling accordingly,we conclude that ltv does not adopt federal case law or policy related to the merger rule.
finally,we emphasize that the commission decision did not depart altogether from the merger rule.instead,it declined to apply the merger rule in a situation where the secretary obtained dismissal by declining to file a complaint.many federal courts have held that interlocutory rulings do not merge into a judgment of dismissal for failure to prosecute,and are therefore unappealable.see john insulation,addison,adopting this approach and citing cases from other circuits that have done the same.even bethel acknowledges that dismissal for failure to prosecute generally precludes application of the merger rule,but it carves out an exception for situations where there is no risk of piecemeal litigation.at.the secretary cites no evidence indicating that bethel exception has won broad acceptance in other circuits,however thus,even assuming arguendo that federal case law generally binds the commission,we conclude that the state of federal precedent on this specific issue is not enough to justify condemning the commission approach as arbitrary and capricious.
the secretary second argument is that the commission arbitrarily and capriciously departed from its own past precedent that permitted the secretary to obtain immediate appeal of an alj interlocutory order by refusing to proceed and thereby obtaining a dismissal.specifically,she points to past commission decisions,such as northwest conduit,cas.bna comm,jackson assocs.of nassau,cas.bna comm,and byrd produce,cas.bna comm,in which the commission reviewed an alj interlocutory decision to excuse a late notice of contest despite the alj subsequent dismissal of the citations in response to the secretary failure to proceed.she also points out that the commission has permitted immediate review of other types of orders,such as discovery orders,even after the secretary refused to proceed.see,donald braasch corp,cas.bna comm.as we observed in donovan adams steel erection,cir,i t is settled that where an agency departs from established precedent without announcing a principled reason for such a reversal,its action is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion and should be reversed.id.at citations omitted.accordingly,we must conduct a inquiry,determining first whether the commission has in fact departed from past precedent,and second whether it has announced a principled reason for any departure.we conclude that although the commission departed from its precedent,it provided a principled reason for its departure and therefore did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily and capriciously.
we conclude that the commission has departed from its established precedent.below,we discuss the most significant cases cited by the secretary to illustrate the extent to which the commission decision in the present case was a departure.
in jackson assocs.of nassau,cas.bna,the commission permitted the secretary to obtain review by using the same method that it rejected in the present case.the defendant,jackson,had not filed a notice of contest to osha citations within the statutory period.cas.bna at.the alj invoked rule b to excuse jackson untimely noc and ordered the secretary to file a complaint within thirty days.id.when the secretary did not file a complaint as ordered,the alj dismissed the citations and proposed penalties for failure to file a complaint under commission rule.id.the commission reviewed the alj grant of rule b relief on the merits at the secretary request without explicitly commenting on whether the secretary failure to file a complaint was appropriate 
the commission decided byrd produce,cas.bna comm,on the same day as jackson.as in jackson,the alj invoked rule b to excuse byrd late notice of contest to osha citations and ordered the secretary to file a complaint.see byrd,cas.bna at.the secretary declined to file a complaint,requesting instead that the alj reconsider his ruling.id.upon reconsideration,the alj affirmed his rule b ruling,declared the secretary in default under commission rule now renumbered as commission rule for failure to plead,and dismissed the citation and proposed penalties.id.the commission reversed the alj rule b decision without commenting on the secretary failure to plead,and declared that the citations have become a final order of the commission under section a of the act.id.at.
in northwest conduit,cas.bna comm,in contrast to jackson and byrd,the commission explicitly addressed the propriety of the secretary refusal to file a complaint in response to an alj rule b ruling.see cas.bna at.although the commission ultimately concluded that her refusal did not preclude review of the rule b ruling given the unusual circumstances of this case,its analysis suggested that it would not allow the secretary to obtain review in this manner in all cases.id.at.northwest conduit corporation northwest had filed its notice of contest to a citation one day late,and the alj excused northwest lateness under rule b id.at.the secretary refused to file a complaint,prompting the alj to vacate the citations.id.the commission then considered and affirmed the rule b ruling without comment on the secretary refusal.see northwest conduit,cas.bna comm earlier decision.on remand,the alj initially ordered the secretary to file a complaint within twenty days.cas.bna,comm.after the secretary filed her complaint,however,the alj changed his mind and dismissed the case altogether as a sanction for the secretary earlier refusal to file.id.on appeal again,the commission set aside the alj second dismissal,citing its discretion to set aside sanctions under commission rule b now numbered as commission rule b.id.the commission noted that the secretary would not have been able to pursue an interlocutory appeal of the rule b order under commission rule due to the lack of a quorum on the commission at that particular time,and it also observed that interlocutory appeals are generally discouraged.id.the one dissenting commissioner would have upheld the alj sanctions because the secretary does not enjoy any special privilege to disregard a judge order.id.at weisberg,dissenting.the dissent distinguished jackson on the ground that the employer in that case had not raised the secretary refusal to file a complaint.id.at weisberg,dissenting.
having established that the commission has excused the secretary refusal to file a complaint in several past cases involving rule b orders,we now turn to the question of whether the commission adequately distinguished these cases or articulated principled reasons for departing from them.if not,we must deem its decision to be arbitrary and capricious.although we think that the commission certainly could have provided better explanations for its decision not to follow these cases,we conclude that they are sufficient to escape classification as arbitrary and capricious.
of the cases discussed above,the only one that the commission discusses in depth in its opinion is northwest conduit.the commission distinguished northwest conduit with the following statements 
while the commission in northwest conduit set aside the judge vacatur order,excusing the secretary failure to file a complaint,the case before us differs from northwest conduit in two key respects.first,in northwest conduit,the secretary could not have successfully petitioned for interlocutory review under commission rule,because there was only one commissioner when the judge ordered the secretary to file a complaint here,the secretary could have petitioned for such review because there were two commissioners at the relevant time.second,in contrast to northwest conduit,the secretary has foreclosed the possibility of litigating the merits of this case if we were to reach the rule b issue and decide in favor of the secretary,the noc would be dismissed and roy construction would be required to pay the penalty without the benefit of a hearing on the merits if,upon reaching the rule b issue,we were to decide in favor of roy construction,there would still be no such hearing because the secretary has waived her right to litigate the merits of the case.in addition to these factual distinctions,we emphasize that the commission in northwest conduit warned the secretary that any party who fails to comply with a commission order,does so at its peril.in light of this warning and the two distinguishing factors,we find that northwest conduit does not compel us to set aside the vacatur order.
sec y of labor roy,cas,comm citations omitted.
we agree with the commission that a valid distinction of the present case from northwest conduit is that interlocutory review was not readily available in the latter case.the specific reference in the northwest conduit opinion to the absence of the necessary quorum suggested that later decisions may consider this factor when deciding what method the secretary should use to appeal an unfavorable order.that said,we also recognize that northwest conduit cited a second factor in support of its conclusion that the secretary was not obliged to seek interlocutory review that interlocutory review is generally disfavored.see northwest conduit,cas.at.the commission opinion in the present case ignores this factor,which would be just as applicable in the present case as it was in northwest conduit.nonetheless,it is possible to read northwest to say that the commission disfavor of interlocutory review is not,by itself,enough to absolve the secretary of a responsibility to seek it rather than refuse to file a complaint.arguably,northwest treated the lack of a quorum,and not the allegedly disfavored status of interlocutory review,as the dispositive issue.this reading of northwest is plausible enough to save the commission distinction from arbitrary and capricious status.
although the existence of interlocutory review is by itself an adequate reason for the commission to treat the secretary refusal to file a complaint differently here than in northwest,the commission second factual distinction of northwest provides additional support for its decision.in northwest,the commission had already affirmed the alj rule b order,so the only obstacle to a hearing on the merits was the alj belated decision to punish the secretary for her initial refusal to file a complaint.in the instant case,because the secretary had renounced any intention of proceeding on the merits if she successfully challenged the rule b order,no hearing on the merits would occur even if the commission excused the secretary failure to file a complaint and reached the rule b issue.in trinity industries,cas.bna comm,the commission recognized the need to balance the commission obligation to enforce its orders with the principle that the public interest requires that cases be decided on their merits.cas.bna at.whereas the desirability of review on the merits provided the northwest commission with a counterweight to the interest in punishing the secretary disobedience of the alj orders,review on the merits can not provide such a counterweight in the instant case as the secretary points out,it is true that the commission has adopted a policy against piecemeal appeals,see ltv steel,cas.bna at,and that her decision to waive a hearing on the merits can be construed as an attempt to comply with this policy.but ltv never suggested that the policy against piecemeal appeals is so strong that it could mandate a decision to foreclose the option of litigating citations on their merits.thus,the commission statement about a hearing on the merits is not an arbitrary and capricious distinction of northwest from the present case.
finally,the commission in northwest suggests that its holding was intended to be limited to the unusual circumstances of the case.see cas.bna at.although it is true that,as the northwest dissent asserts,the majority never explained what these unusual circumstances may be,id.at weisberg,dissenting,this statement supports our conclusion that northwest was not an unlimited endorsement of the secretary ability to obtain review by refusing to file a complaint.rather,northwest merely recognized that the secretary may do so under some circumstances.it was not arbitrary and capricious for the commission to decide that such circumstances do not exist in the present case.
the commission provides a less convincing distinction of the cases such as jackson and byrd that permitted the secretary to obtain commission review of an alj order after refusing to file a complaint.it does not mention byrd,and all it says about jackson is the following 
although these cases northwest conduit and jackson demonstrate that the commission has not always treated the secretary failure to file a complaint as a barrier to reaching the merits of the rule b issue,the commission has never affirmatively stated that the secretary may refuse to file a complaint in order to obtain commission review.
indeed,only northwest conduit was analyzed through the lens of commission rule b.
cas.at footnote omitted.thus,the commission only explicit distinctions of jackson and implicitly byrd are that they did not affirmatively state that the secretary used an appropriate means of obtaining review and that they did not invoke commission rule b to determine whether to set aside the alj vacatur order we conclude,with some qualifications,that this is sufficient as a reasoned explanation for departing from the jackson and byrd precedents.if jackson or byrd had provided reasoning for its decision to excuse the secretary refusal to file a complaint,then any reasoned explanation for departing from these precedents would,at the very least,need to explain why this reasoning should no longer control.when there is no reasoning for the earlier decision,however,a brief explanation for the departure may be permissible.although it is a close question,we conclude that the commission these earlier cases contained no affirmative statements approving the practice and did not analyze the issue using the commission own be sufficiently reasonable so as not to be arbitrary and capricious 
a separate line of cases consists of those in which an alj dismisses citations after the secretary refuses to comply with the alj discovery order on the ground that the requested information is privileged.donald braasch,cas.bna comm,is an example of this type of case.the braasch opinion held over a dissent that despite the secretary disobedience and the alj consequent sanction,the commission should review the merits of the discovery order and lift the sanction if this order proved to be erroneous.see cas.at.braasch also noted that failure to comply with an order is not,by itself,an indication of bad faith or contumacious conduct where the party reason for refusing to comply has a substantial legal basis and its conduct did not indicate disrespect towards the commission or the issuing judge.id.at.the secretary argues that although braasch involves a discovery order rather than a rule b order,we should regard it as presenting essentially the same issue.in support of this claim,she cites a tenth circuit case stating that there is no principled distinction between sanctions imposed for discovery violations and sanctions imposed for noncompliance with other orders.see mobley mccormick,cir.
the commission explanation for distinguishing discovery cases like braasch is not extensive.referring specifically to braasch statement that failure to comply with an order is not itself contumacious,the commission states simply that o ur review of commission precedent indicates
