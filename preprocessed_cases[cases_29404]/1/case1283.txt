gabriel santos alvarez petitioner seeks review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal.the bia reached this conclusion after determining that petitioner virginia conviction for forging a public record pursuant to virginia code ann.virginia forgery was an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina.see a r defining aggravated felony as including an offense relating to forgery.petitioner challenges this determination,arguing that virginia forgery does not relat e to the federal generic definition of forgery.
as explained below,we conclude that virginia forgery is an aggravated felony under the ina because it is a categorical match with the federal generic definition of forgery therefore,the state and federal forgery crimes necessarily relat e to one another.as a result,we deny the petition for review,and we deny as moot the government request to remand this case to the bia.
petitioner is a citizen of bolivia and has been a lawful permanent resident in the united states since october.on january,he was convicted of embezzlement under virginia law and sentenced to three years in prison,all suspended.based on separate and distinct conduct,on january,petitioner was convicted of forging a public record pursuant to virginia code ann.and assigned another sentence,with all but seven months suspended.
on august,the department of homeland security dhs issued petitioner a notice to appear,charging that petitioner was eligible for removal from the united states because he had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.see a a ii at petitioner september,removal hearing,dhs filed an additional charge of removability under a a iii,claiming petitioner was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony specifically,an offense relating to forgery.id.a r.
petitioner filed an application for cancellation of removal,and dhs filed a motion to pretermit petitioner application,contending the aggravated felony conviction rendered petitioner ineligible for this relief on october,the immigration judge ij issued a written decision sustaining both charges of removability and granting dhs motion to pretermit petitioner application.the ij concluded that although virginia forgery is slightly broader than generic federal forgery,it is nonetheless an offense relating to forgery.quoting a r petitioner appealed to the bia,and a single bia judge agreed with the ij and dismissed the appeal.petitioner filed a timely petition for review with this court on june.
on october,the government filed a motion to remand based on the supreme court june,decision in mellouli lynch,construing the phrase relating to in another ina provision.we denied the motion.see order den.mot.to remand,santos alvarez lynch,cir,ecf.on december,petitioner filed an unopposed motion for stay of removal,which this court granted.see order granting stay of removal,santos alvarez lynch,cir,ecf.
we possess jurisdiction over the legal question of whether a crime qualifies as an aggravated felony.see a d espinal andrades holder,cir.although we generally defer to the bia interpretations of the ina,where,as here,the bia construes statutes and state law over which it has no particular expertise,its interpretations are not entitled to deference.omargharib holder,cir.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.we thus review the pure legal issue in this case de novo.see espinal andrades,at see also vizcarra ayala mukasey,cir.reviewing de novo the issue of whether california forgery is an aggravated felony.
in this case,we are asked to decide whether a virginia conviction for forgery of a public record is an aggravated felony under the ina,which is defined as an offense relating to forgery for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a r.if it is not,then petitioner may be eligible for cancellation of removal petitioner argues that virginia forgery is so broad that it does not even relat e to federal forgery therefore,it is not an aggravated felony.
in determining whether virginia statute is an aggravated felony,we employ the categorical approach.see mellouli lynch,omargharib holder,cir.under the categorical approach,we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.united states lopez collazo,wl,at cir.june,quoting moncrieffe holder.the federal definition must be viewed in the abstract,to see whether the state statute shares the nature of the federal offense that serves as a point of comparison.hernandez zavala lynch,cir.
a generic federal offense and a state offense categorical ly match only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.amos lynch,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.this issue is not settled simply because virginia categorizes the statute at issue as forgery.see taylor united states,in applying categorical approach,cautioning against depend ing on the definition adopted by the state of conviction.
we note that subsection r of a is one of the many aggravated felonies the ina defines expansive ly as merely relating to a generic federal crime,in contrast to others defined as match ing the comparable federal crime.denis attorney of,cir.normally,then,under the more expansive definition,the fact that the offenses do not precisely match each other is not determinative.id.in this case,however,we conclude that the offenses match therefore,the two statutes necessarily relate to each other.
generic federal forgery 
we first identify the federal generic meaning of forgery,as it is used in the ina.
the ina does not define forgery,nor has the bia.this court decision in united states jones,however,is instructive.see cir.in jones,michael everston,a supervisor at inglis,directed an accounts payable clerk to alter vendor numbers in a computer system so that checks supposed to be paid to a vendor were instead issued to everston cohort,defendant amy jones,who then deposited the checks in her own account.see id.at.this court considered whether,under,the alteration of accounts payable documents fed into a computer which resulted in the issuance of checks payable to an improper payee constituted forgery.id 
in its analysis,this court cited with approval the sixth circuit common law definition of forgery the false making or materially altering,with intent to defraud,of any writing,which,if genuine,might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability,jones,at quoting carr united states,cir,which matches other circuits analyses of the generic offense,vizcarra ayala mukasey,cir.see,vizcarra ayala,at united states mcgovern,cir.common law forgery has three elements a the false making or material alteration b with intent to defraud c of a writing which,if genuine,might be of legal efficacy.see also model penal code b ali a person is guilty of forgery if,with purpose to defraud the actor makes,completes,executes,authenticates,issues or transfers any writing so that it purports to be the act of another who did not authorize that act.
because the parties here dispute the breadth of the false making element,we focus on that aspect of the common law definition.in jones,we recognized that,at common law,a false making did not include the creation of a writing which was genuine in execution but false as to the statements of fact contained in such writing.jones,at footnote omitted.in other words,with regard to a false making,the common law term forged relate d to genuineness of execution and not falsity of content.id.quoting marteney united states,cir.
following this logic,we held that the checks jones deposited into her account were not forgeries because they were genuine instrument s containing a false statement of fact as to the true creditor.jones,at emphases omitted.other decisions and treatises reflect the same distinction forged documents or instruments must be invalid or falsely executed mere falsities present in or on the document or instrument will not suffice.see,moskal united stat
