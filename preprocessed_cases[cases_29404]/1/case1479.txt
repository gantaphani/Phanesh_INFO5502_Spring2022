nora collins collins petitions for review of the decision and order of the benefits review board the brb denying her claim for survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act,the black lung act or the act.in so doing,collins contends,inter alia,that the brb and the administrative law judge the alj erroneously failed to accord collateral estoppel effect to an earlier alj ruling that her late husband suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his work in the coal mines of southern appalachia.as explained below,we agree with collins that the brb erred in by not according preclusive effect to the alj ruling.we grant her petition for review,vacate the brb decision and order,and remand.
collins late husband,johnny collins collins,worked underground in the coal mines of southern west virginia and eastern kentucky for over years.during his extensive mining career,collins,inter alia,operated a cutting machine,a motor,and a loading machine worked on the belt laid track loaded coal and worked as a belt repairman.on february,collins was awarded benefits under the black lung act by decision and order of an alj.collins pond creek coal,the alj decision.in that proceeding,the pond creek coal company pond creek was named as the responsible operator the alj decision was premised on the alj findings that collins had established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he had pneumoconiosis commonly known as black lung disease he was totally disabled and his total disability was due to pneumoconiosis.as a result of the alj which pond creek did not.collins received black lung benefits until his death on september,
on september,collins widow filed a claim for survivor benefits under a,naming pond creek as the responsible operator.in order to be entitled to benefits,collins was obliged to show that she was collins widow,collins suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his coal mine employment,and pneumoconiosis hastened his death.see a providing that coal miner widow can receive benefits if miner death was due to pneumoconiosis c providing that miner death is due to pneumoconiosis if pneumoconiosis hastens the miner death.and,in establishing that collins had developed pneumoconiosis as a result of working in the coal mines for years,collins asserted that she was entitled to rely on the collateral estoppel effect of the alj decision.
by decision and order of december,the alj denied collins claim for survivor benefits.collins pond creek mining,the alj decision.in so doing,the alj ruled the alj decision was not entitled to collateral estoppel effect because of our decision in island creek coal compton,cir.see alj decision at.in compton,we ruled that an alj must consider all of the relevant evidence in assessing whether a coal miner suffers from pneumoconiosis.pursuant to a four subsections,a miner pneumoconiosis may be established in four ways chest biopsy or autopsy results certain regulatory presumptions not relevant here and a physician opinion based on medical evidence.our compton decision invalidated the brb practice of allowing an alj to find that a coal miner suffers from pneumoconiosis by relying on evidence falling under one of the four subsections of a such as chest,while ignoring contrary evidence belonging to one of the other three subsections such as physicians opinions.see at.that practice,as judge wilkins explained in compton,contradicted b statutory mandate that an alj must consider all relevant evidence in making a pneumoconiosis finding.id.
in this case,the alj concluded,in december,that the alj decision was not entitled to any collateral estoppel effect,and that collins therefore could not rely on it in establishing collins pneumoconiosis.the alj then considered anew the evidence concerning collins respiratory condition,and he ruled,contrary to the alj decision,that collins had never suffered from pneumoconiosis and thus that his death had not been hastened by the disease.
collins then appealed the alj decision to the brb.by its decision and order of january,the brb affirmed the alj decision collateral estoppel ruling,but it vacated the alj finding and remanded for the alj to reweigh the evidence.collins pond creek mining,black lung mb brb the brb decision.on remand,the alj again found that collins had never suffered from pneumoconiosis.collins pond creek mining,the alj decision.additionally,the alj determined that,even assuming the existence of pneumoconiosis,there was insufficient evidence that the disease hastened collins death.on collins appeal from the alj decision,the brb reiterated its earlier position that collins was not entitled to rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel,and it affirmed the alj findings of no pneumoconiosis and lack of causation.collins pond creek mining,brb bla june,the brb decision.collins has now petitioned for review of the brb decision,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to c.
we review an alj decision that has been affirmed by the brb to determine whether it is in accordance with the law and supported by substantial evidence.island creek coal compton,cir piney mountain coal mays,cir.in so doing,we confine our review to the grounds upon which the brb based its decision.see grigg,owcp,cir.as always,we review de novo the brb conclusions of law.milburn colliery hicks,cir.
collins principal contention in this proceeding is that the brb erred in failing to accord collateral estoppel effect to the ruling,made in the alj decision,that collins had developed pneumoconiosis through his coal mine employment under collateral estoppel,once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.montana united states,d.and,as we have observed,findings of fact made during administrative adjudications are to be accorded the same collateral estoppel effect they would receive if made by a court.see jones sec,cir.because collins is in the position of a plaintiff who was not a party to the alj proceeding,we must assess not only whether the general requirements for collateral estoppel have been established,but also whether application of the doctrine of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel might be unfair to pond creek in this case 
a party seeking to rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel is obliged to establish five elements that the issue sought to be precluded is identical to one previously litigated element one that the issue was actually determined in the prior proceeding element two that the issue determination was a critical and necessary part of the decision in the prior proceeding element three that the prior judgment is final and valid element four and that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum element five.sedlack braswell servs.group,cir.the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar the relitigation of factual issues where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had a heavier burden of persuasion on that issue in the first action than he does in the second,or where his adversary has a heavier burden in the second action than he did in the first.newport news shipbldg.dry dock,owcp,cir.additionally,the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to a legal ruling if there has been a major change in the governing law since the prior adjudication that could render the previous determination inconsistent with prevailing doctrine.see montana united states,at.citing comm r sunnen.
in this proceeding,collins seeks to rely on the alj decision to establish that collins developed pneumoconiosis as a result of his years in the coal mines.without question,the issue of whether collins developed and suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his work in the mines was actually determined in the proceeding element two,and that determination was critical and necessary to the alj decision element three.absent a finding of pneumoconiosis,collins could not have been awarded black lung benefits under the act in.moreover,there is no suggestion that the alj decision is invalid element four,or that pond creek did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue element five.accordingly,collins has plainly established four of the five essential elements for asserting collateral estoppel with respect to the alj decision pneumoconiosis finding.we must further assess,however,whether our compton decision in created a difference in burdens such that the issue sought to be precluded is not identical to the one previously litigated and element one is not met.see sedlack,at see also newport news,at.moreover,if the five essential elements of collateral estoppel have been established by collins,we must determine whether the alj decision pneumoconiosis finding has been rendered obsolete by a major change in the legal principles,as a result of compton.see montana united states,at.
the brb concluded that the alj decision pneumoconiosis ruling was not entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the change in the law in island creek coal compton,cir,affects the weighing of the evidence,and the issue of whether collins had pneumoconiosis was therefore not identical to the one previously litigated.brb decision,black lung mb at.as spelled out above,in compton we invalidated the brb practice of allowing aljs to find the existence of pneumoconiosis by looking exclusively at evidence within one of a four subsections,while ignoring contrary evidence belonging to one of the other three subsections.see at.in so ruling,however,we left unaltered the legal definition of pneumoconiosis the methods by which a claimant may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis,and the statutory requirement that a claimant must prove that the coal miner developed pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence.see id.at.
this case,then,is unlike those in which a difference in burdens has rendered the doctrine of collateral estoppel inapplicable.in newport news shipbuilding,for example,we declined to give preclusive effect to a prior administrative ruling that the claimant injury was not.see at.we observed that,in the earlier proceeding,the claimant was obliged to establish by a preponderance of evidence that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment,while,in the later proceeding,uncertainty concerning was to be resolved in the claimant favor.see id.citing cases see also freeman united coal mining owcp,cir declining to accord collateral estoppel effect to determination in state proceedings that claimant was not permanently disabled where claimant bore burden of establishing disability in state proceedings,but was entitled to presumption of disability in federal proceedings.
the compton decision,however,left the burden of proof in black lung proceedings unchanged.prior to compton,a black lung claimant was obliged to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence and through one of the four methods spelled out in a subsections,that the coal miner had developed pneumoconiosis as a result of his work in the mines.see beatty danri triangle,black lung mb,brb.and,in assessing whether that burden had been carried,the alj was permitted to consider whether evidence of pneumoconiosis relating to one of the four a subsections such as positive chest was discredited by contrary evidence of a different sort such as negative physicians reports.see mabe bishop coal,black lung mb,brb.that regime was left in place by compton,but an alj is now obliged rather than simply permitted to consider any relevant countervailing evidence,regardless of its form.collins thus bears the same burden a preponderance of the evidence to establish the same fact that collins suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his years working in the coal mines in the same manner through one of the four methods prescribed by the a subsections as collins bore in the alj proceeding.in these circumstances,the issue collins seeks to establish though collateral collins suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his work in the identical to the issue determined in the alj decision.and the brb,in its decision,erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.
in declining to accord preclusive collateral estoppel effect to the alj decision,the brb also relied on its unpublished decision in howard valley camp coal,brb,unpublished,which we affirmed by unpublished decision in,howard valley camp coal.cir per curiam.pursuant to our local rule c,of course,we ordinarily do not accord precedential value to our unpublished decisions.indeed,those decisions have no precedential value,and they are entitled only to the weight they generate by the persuasiveness of their reasoning.hupman cook,cir.thus,we must consider whether the reasoning of our unpublished decision in howard persuades us that the brb decision collateral estoppel ruling should be affirmed.
in howard,a coal miner widow seeking survivor benefits under the black lung act sought to rely on the preclusive effect of a award of black lung benefits made to her late husband,and establish that he had developed pneumoconiosis as a result of his work in the coal mines.see.at.her claim as a widow was denied by the alj,and that denial was affirmed by the brb.id.we denied howard petition for review,concluding,inter alia,that the brb was correct in not according preclusive effect to the pneumoconiosis determination.id.at.the analysis of that point in howard is confined to a single conclusory sentence,however,and relies on sunnen.see id.citing sunnen and concluding that the board correctly determined that the change in interpretation of the regulations for proving pneumoconiosis,which was effected by this court decision in compton,was sufficiently significant to warrant refusal to apply issue preclusion based on a determination of pneumoconiosis made under the regime.
by its sunnen decision,the supreme court concluded that a taxpayer was not entitled to rely on the collateral estoppel effect of a prior tax court judgment to establish,for all time,that certain types of assignments were not taxable to him,notwithstanding that the substantive law had changed since the prior judgment had been rendered.see at.in so ruling,the court observed that collateral estoppel is a doctrine capable of being applied so as to avoid an undue disparity in the impact of income tax liability.id.at.and the court explained that the purpose of collateral repetitious lawsuits over matters which have once been decided and which have remained substantially static,factually and legally did not justify creating vested rights in decisions that have become obsolete or erroneous with time,thereby causing inequities among taxpayers.id.accordingly,the court held that a judicial declaration intervening between two proceedings may so change the legal atmosphere as to render the rule of collateral estoppel inapplicable.id.at.the court explained,however,that where a question of fact essential to the judgment is actually litigated and determined in the first proceeding,the parties are bound by that determination in a subsequent proceeding.id.at.
sunnen thus holds that a party is not entitled to rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel to establish a legal conclusion when the underlying substantive law has materially changed it does not,however,authorize a party to revisit a question of fact that has been previously determined.see at.see also montana united states,at.explaining that,where there have been no major changes in underlying substantive law,reliance on sunnen is misplaced morgan dep t of energy,extending the sunnen exception to collateral estoppel to the instant case,where a party is seeking relitigation of the legal consequence of the very same set of facts as were previously adjudicated,would effectively gut the doctrine of collateral estoppel.rather,a party seeking to avoid the collateral estoppel effect of an earlier factual determination is obliged to make one of two showings that the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had a heavier burden of persuasion on that issue in the first action than he does in the second,or that his adversary has a heavier burden in the second action.see newport news,at.and,as explained above,collins,in the alj proceeding,bore the same burden of proof preponderance of the evidence to establish the same fact that he had developed pneumoconiosis,as defined in the act,through his work in the coal mines in the same manner through one of the four methods described in a as collins bears in the current proceeding.in these circumstances,our unpublished decision in howard is not persuasive,and we will not accord it precedential value.
collins has thus satisfied the general requirements for collateral estoppel,and the alj and the brb erred in ruling to the contrary.
additionally,because collins is in the position of a plaintiff who was a to the alj proceeding,we are obliged to assess whether allowing her to rely on the doctrine of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel might be unfair to pond creek.pursuant to the supreme court explanation of that doctrine in parklane hosiery shore,d,we are to analyze four nonexclusive factors in that regard whether collins could easily have joined in the earlier proceeding,whether pond creek had an incentive in the prior action to have defended the action fully and vigorously whether pond creek has ever obtained a ruling that collins did not suffer from pneumoconiosis and whether procedural opportunities are available to pond creek in the present proceeding that were unavailable to it in the proceeding.see in re microsoft.antitrust,cir citing parklane hosiery,at.
an assessment of each of the four parklane hosiery factors discloses that no unfairness will result to pond creek from allowing collins to rely on the alj decision.collins was unable to join collins claim for black lung benefits,as spouses of living miners with pneumoconiosis are not entitled to seek benefits under the act.moreover,pond creek had a strong incentive to fully and vigorously defend the alj proceeding.the black lung act provides that a qualifying widow shall receive benefits at the rate the deceased miner would have received such benefits if he were totally disabled,see a,and pond creek had the same incentive to defend collins claim for living miner benefits as it does to defend collins claim for survivor benefits.additionally,there has been no finding since the alj decision that collins did not have pneumoconiosis finally,there are no procedural opportunities currently available to pond creek that were unavailable to it during the alj proceedings which pond creek chose not to appeal.
without specifically mentioning the parklane hosiery decision or its factors,pond creek offers us two reasons why,in its view,a widow seeking survivor benefits may not,as a general matter,rely on the collateral estoppel effect of an earlier pneumoconiosis finding in favor of a living miner.first,seeking to rely on our decision in lisa lee mines director,owcp,cir en banc,pond creek asserts that the traditional principles of finality,res judicata,collateral estoppel,and law of the case are not applicable to an issue which is an element of entitlement in black lung cases.respondent pond creek br.at.in lisa lee mines,we concluded that,because a miner condition may worsen after he has been denied black lung benefits,a prior denial of benefits does not preclude him from initiating a subsequent claim for benefits under the act.see at.pond creek,however,has not pointed us to any evidence that a miner who has developed pneumoconiosis may somehow be cured of or recover from that disease,and lisa lee mines is therefore inapplicable.furthermore,we did not hold in lisa lee mines that principles of finality have no place in black lung proceedings,and we decline pond creek invitation to transform the already burdensome process of black lung litigation into a sisyphean endeavor 
second,pond creek contends that,due to the potential availability of some pathology,a widow should not be permitted to rely on the collateral estoppel effect of a prior pneumoconiosis determination.we should not pause over the absence of pathology in the present case,pond creek maintains,because,the c laimant alone makes the decision to obtain or not obtain an autopsy.respondent pond creek br.at.in pond creek view,allowing a coal miner widow to rely on the collateral estoppel effect of a living miner benefits award would work a manifest injustice,by permitting the widow to decline an autopsy and urge the application of collateral estoppel,thereby depriving the liable party of the due process opportunity to conclusively confirm the presence or absence of pneumoconiosis.id.
pond creek concern that a coal miner widow might decline an autopsy and urge the application of collateral estoppel ignores the fact that a widow can not succeed in her claim for survivor benefits without further establishing that pneumoconiosis hastened her husband death.see c.in so doing,she may desire or need an autopsy.and,of course,if that autopsy conclusively confirmed the absence of pneumoconiosis,it would also show that pneumoconiosis did not hasten the miner death 
in these circumstances,we agree with the seventh circuit that a coal miner widow seeking survivor benefits under the black lung act may generally rely on the doctrine of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel to establish that,as a result of his work in the mines,her deceased husband had developed pneumoconiosis.see zeigler coal,owcp,cir.and,having carefully examined the four parklane hosiery factors and pond creek contentions,allowing collins to rely on offensive collateral estoppel would not be unfair to pond creek.accordingly,the alj and the brb erred in permitting pond creek to relitigate,in the widow proceedings for benefits,the issue of whether collins suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his years of coal mine employment 
finally,in order to succeed in her claim for survivor benefits,collins is obliged to show that collins death was hastened by pneumoconiosis.see c.notably,the alj has a causation ruling affirmed by the even assuming collins proved the existence of pneumoconiosis,she failed to establish that the disease hastened her husband death.if it were supported by substantial evidence,this causation ruling would be a sufficient alternative ground on which to deny collins petition for review.in view of the reason on which the brb affirmed the alj ruling,however,we can not uphold the brb decision.
in rendering his causation ruling,the alj rejected the opinions of two physicians for collins as unreasoned and undocumented,and instead relied on the views of seven physicians for pond of whom had opined that collins did not suffer from pneumoconiosis at all much less die due to such disease after criticizing the opinions of collins physicians as cursory,the alj himself cursorily explained his reliance on pond creek physicians,as follows 
in contrast to the cursory opinions of collins physicians,pond creek physicians provided better reasoned and documented opinions regarding the death due to pneumoconiosis issue.moreover,many of the foregoing physicians explained why their opinions regarding the absence of a role of pneumoconiosis in the miner death would not change,even assuming the presence of radiological evidence of the disease.
alj decision at.on appeal to the brb,collins invoked our decision in scott mason coal,cir,for the proposition that,since she had established the existence of pneumoconiosis,it was improper for the alj to rely as he did on the causation opinions of physicians who had failed to diagnose the disease.see scott,at holding that,in wake of finding of pneumoconiosis,alj must provide specific and persuasive reasons for relying on causation opinions of physicians who have not diagnosed pneumoconiosis and,even then,can give such opinions little weight,at the most.the brb deemed scott inapposite and affirmed the alj causation ruling,concluding that because the alj did not find the existence of pneumoconiosis established in this case,he could properly rely on the causation opinions of physicians who did not diagnose pneumoconiosis.brb decision at.
of course,the brb decision rested squarely on the alj finding of no finding that we have rejected herein on the ground that collins established the presence of pneumoconiosis by collateral estoppel.upon the proper finding of pneumoconiosis,the brb should have assessed the alj causation ruling under the standards outlined by our decision in scott.in that case,the alj found that although scott a living miner suffered from pneumoconiosis,he had failed to show that any total disability was caused at least in part by that disease.see scott,at.for that ruling,the alj rejected the causation analysis of a physician who had also opined that scott was disabled by pneumoconiosis,and instead relied on the contrary opinions of two physicians who had not diagnosed scott with pneumoconiosis at all.see id.at.the brb approved the alj reliance on the latter physicians,because both doctors stated that their causation opinion would not change if scott had pneumoconiosis and because both doctors opinions were clearly stated,fully documented,and highly persuasive.id.at.
we,however,reversed the brb decision affirming the alj causation ruling as not supported by substantial evidence.writing for the court,judge widener explained that the alj could only give weight to the causation opinions of the physicians who had not diagnosed pneumoconiosis if he provided specific and persuasive reasons for doing so,and those opinions could carry little weight,at the most.scott,at citing toler associated coal,cir.in the circumstances of scott seem to compare closely to those presented alj reasons for crediting the causation opinions of the physicians were regarded to be insufficient,and the alj exclusive reliance on those opinions was deemed to be erroneous.see id.we were particularly concerned with the alj wholesale rejection of the diagnosing physician causation opinion and corresponding overreliance on the physicians contrary views.in the compelling words of judge widener 
two opinions that may hold no weight,or at most may hold the little weight allowed by toler,can not suffice as substantial evidence to support the alj determination that scott disability was not caused at least in part by pneumoconiosis.this is especially true when one causation opinion based on the proper diagnosis,even a poorly documented one,links the disability to pneumoconiosis.
id.at.although we remanded with directions to award benefits in scott,we see the appropriate course here as a remand for further consideration of the causation issue.in that regard,the brb will have the first opportunity to assess whether the alj causation ruling meets the rigorous standards outlined in scott.
pursuant to the foregoing,we grant collins petition for review,vacate the brb decision,and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.
petition for review granted order vacated and remanded.
the administrative law judge alj,affirmed by the benefits review board brb,denied collins claim for black lung survivor benefits based on two alternative,independent factual findings.first,the alj found that collins failed to prove that collins suffered from pneumoconiosis.in making this finding,the alj rejected collins assertion that pond creek mining company should be collaterally estopped by collins black lung living miner determination from relitigating the question of whether collins suffered from pneumoconiosis.second,the alj found that even assuming that collins suffered from pneumoconiosis,collins nonetheless failed to prove that his death was due to pneumoconiosis.in my view,both of the alj factual findings are supported by substantial evidence,and either is independently dispositive of collins claim.moreover,the alj decision not to apply collateral issue that relates only to the first of the two alternative factual correct under the circumstances of this case.accordingly,i dissent from the majority decision to grant the petition for review.
we review collins claim to determine whether substantial evidence supports the alj factual findings and whether the legal conclusions of the brb and the alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.bill branch coal sparks,cir.to succeed on her claim,collins bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that collins suffered from pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of coal mine employment and collins death was due to pneumoconiosis.id.generally,pursuant to a,collins may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by means of chest,biopsy or autopsy evidence,invocation of the presumptions at,or medical opinion evidence.she may establish that collins death was due to pneumoconiosis by proving that pneumoconiosis actually hastened his death.sparks,at citations omitted.
evidence in the record indicates that collins was a coal miner,as well as a cigarette smoker,for over years.approximately one year before his death in,collins heart began to fail.in september,collins went into full cardiopulmonary arrest he was resuscitated and transported to the hospital,where he was placed on a ventilator.collins remained in the hospital two weeks after his cardiac arrest.a day after being discharged from the hospital,collins again suffered an acute cardiac arrest and died at home.no autopsy was performed.
shortly thereafter,collins filed her claim for survivor benefits.proper consideration of the issues involved in collins claim requires us to examine collins claim for living miner benefits as well as our decision in island creek coal company compton,cir.
in,an alj awarded living miner benefits to collins,finding that he suffered from pneumoconiosis.considering the four methods by which a claimant may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis,the alj concluded that collins proof failed with respect to each of the first three methods.specifically,although the alj recognized that there were differing opinions concerning the chest,he accorded greater weight to the opinions of two who read collins and found no evidence of pneumoconiosis.the alj then found that there was no biopsy or autopsy evidence in the record and that the presumptions were not applicable.
the alj further found,however,that collins established the presence of pneumoconiosis under the fourth method.although one physician had opined that collins did not suffer from pneumoconiosis,the alj accorded greater weight to the opinions of two other physicians who had reached contrary conclusions.the alj stated analysis for finding,through physician reports as provided in section a,that he considered each method of proof individually without regard for the others.this decision was not appealed.
in,before collins claim for survivor benefits was decided,we decided compton,which involved a claim for living miner benefits.the alj in compton awarded benefits,finding in pertinent part that although the miner had not established pneumoconiosis by chest,he did establish pneumoconiosis by physician opinion evidence.there was no biopsy or autopsy evidence,and the presumptions described in a were not applicable.
the brb affirmed the alj decision,and the company petitioned for review,arguing in part that the alj erred in his method of weighing the evidence concerning the issue of whether the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis.at.elaborating on this argument,the company contended that the alj merely weighed the evidence within each subsection of a to determine whether a preponderance of that type of evidence established pneumoconiosis.at.instead of this analysis,the company argued that the proper method is to weigh the different types of evidence together to determine whether a preponderance of all of the evidence establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.id.
we noted that the alj did in fact evaluate the evidence within subsections a and a of to determine whether either type of evidence established pneumoconiosis,but did not weigh the evidence with the medical opinion evidence.at.we further noted that the brb approved of this practice,ruling that as long as the evidence relevant to one subsection of a supports a finding of pneumoconiosis,the rest of the evidence need not be considered.at.we then expressly rejected the brb analysis.looking to b,which governs the evidence required to establish a claim for black lung benefits,we held that all relevant evidence is to
