after the tribune company long term disability benefit plan the plan terminated the disability payments that lisa leger had been receiving since,leger filed this erisa action under a b for payment of benefits due.the district court granted the plan motion for summary judgment,and leger appealed.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.
leger suffers from osteoarthritis in both knees.over the years,several physicians have treated leger condition with a regimen of exercise and with arthroscopic surgery.between and,leger underwent three arthroscopic procedures.after the surgeries,she enjoyed increased mobility and was able to engage in a rehabilitative exercise program.
in june,however,as a result of chronic pain in both knees,leger ceased working as a program planning manager for,part of the tribune company.following several months of disability payments,the administrator of the plan,cna,approved the payment of disability benefits,which leger began receiving in december 
when leger began receiving disability payments in,she was being treated by prodromos.at that time,he believed that her knee condition had improved however,she still was complaining of pain and instability.consequently,prodromos referred leger to dehaven,who concluded that leger subjective reports of pain were not consistent with his medical observations.
in,leger was examined by another orthopedic surgeon,nuber nuber observed that leger had degenerative changes in both knees,that she used a cane for short distances and that she used crutches for longer distances.nuber recommended avoiding further surgical intervention.
later,leger received treatment from steadman.between and,leger traveled to vail,colorado,semiannually to see steadman.during this time,steadman performed a total of four arthroscopic procedures on leger knees two per knee.steadman noted that leger was happy with the results of the surgery and had an excellent range of motion in both knees.ml however,the relief proved to be only temporary.
in,after the birth of her first child,leger sought treatment from hill,whose practice was located in the chicago area.hill continues to serve as leger primary orthopedic physician.hill first prescribed a program of strengthening exercises for leger.after leger gave birth to her second child,she began experiencing more pain and less mobility in her right knee,and hill performed an arthroscopy on that knee.leger right knee then began to improve.
in,leger began to complain of pain associated with a small lump in the back of her right knee,which subsequently was determined to be a benign cyst during a examination with hill in march,hill noted that leger main discomfort at that time was associated with this cyst.
in may,in response to leger complaints of increased knee pain,hill performed an arthroscopic debridement of leger right knee.the procedure resulted in leger enjoying a full range of motion in that knee.ml.
leger returned to hill in october because her right knee was giv ing way as a result of walking her dog.ml.hill recommended decreasing her level of physical activity.between and,leger continued to see hill.a radiology report from april,concluded that leger had experienced minimal to moderate degenerative change and n o appreciable change since may.ml.
in august,leger traveled to athens,greece,to attend the olympic games.she took precautions to minimize the adverse effects that the travel and other activities would have on her knees.even so,she missed some events as a result of her condition.upon her return from athens,leger saw hill because she was experiencing knee pain as a result of her increased walking while at the olympics.hill performed another arthroscopy of leger right knee in december to repair a small meniscal tear.after the surgery,hill reported that leger was extremely happy with her surgical result and feels that she has less right knee discomfort than she had prior to surgery.ml.in a visit on january,hill noted that leger was doing extremely well,ha d minimal problems with her right knee and was ambulatory without any external aid.ml.
leger received benefits for almost fifteen years.during this time,the plan first was administered by cna and then,beginning in,by the hartford insurance company.
in,metropolitan life insurance company met life became the plan administrator.as part of a review of leger benefits,met life requested updated information from leger and her treating physician,hill.in his reply,hill stated that leger condition prevented her from sitting more than one hour during an period and from sitting for more than thirty minutes in any given hour.see ml.hill also stated that he had not advised leger to return to work because she was wheel chair bound,essentially unable to walk.id.at.these materials,as well as leger medical history,were provided to kevin smith for review.in his report,smith stated 
the medical records do not indicate objective clinical evidence on examination and testing,surgical report,diagnoses or pathology of a severity that would preclude her from gainful employment within a wide array of jobs within a sedentary work capacity level.the medical records are confusing in that she was very pleased with the surgical results on the january office visit and was noted to be wheelchair bound and unable to stand for more than hour in an time period per aps statements in late march of.the records indicate significant osteoarthritis of the knees but do not indicate findings or impairments of a severity that would preclude sedentary work in this employee.
grace choi,a vocational rehabilitation consultant,conducted an employability assessment based on smith evaluation.the assessment identified several sedentary employment positions for which leger possessed the necessary qualifications.met life therefore determined that leger was capable of performing sedentary work and terminated her benefits on october.see ml.
leger appealed the decision internally and supplied met life with additional personal information,witness statements and medical documentation she also submitted a functional capacity evaluation fce,which was prepared by a physical therapist,joseph rappa,on february.in the fce,rappa indicated that leger had exerted full effort during the tests and that her subjective reports of pain and associated disability were both reasonable and reliable.ml.in his recommendations,rappa wrote 
it is recommended that clinical vocational decision be made with the results of this report taken into consideration.
avoid squat lifting.
limit carrying for any distance.
limit shoulder to overhead lifting to a maximum of pounds.
limit knuckle to shoulder lifting to a maximum of pounds.
limit for any distance.
avoid being in a specific position seated or standing for long periods of time.
ml.hill also provided the following assessment 
lisa leger has been a patient of mine since january.she has had significant problems with both knees that date back to the late.she has had almost ten surgical procedures on each knee.she is presently severely disabled and needs crutches to ambulate.she recently had a functional capacity evaluation on february,which concurs with her ongoing several limitations.she is unable to perform any job activity which requires standing,walking or prolonged sitting greater than thirty minutes.
met life retained michael chmell,an orthopedic surgeon,to review leger file.in chmell report,he perceived some inconsistency in the information that hill had provided 
on,forms are provided by hill,the first of which is believed to be a functional capacity type of form in which it is stated that leger is only capable of sitting for one hour per day.rationale for this inability to sit for more than one hour per day is not provided records do not indicate how leger knee disorder would have any impact upon her ability to sit.a second attending physician statement provided by hill,also dated,notes that leger is wheelchair bound.it states that she is essentially unable to walk.this is in stark contrast to the office note documented above from,wherein leger was noted to have minimal problems with her knee and was encouraged to continue with an exercise program.now it is stated that she is wheelchair bound.even if leger was truly unable to walk,it would have no bearing upon her ability to carry out sedentary work.it is very confusing to me that at one point leger is noted to be doing well and then next is noted to be wheelchair bound.also,the fact that it is stated leger can not sit for more than minutes at a time,is not consistent with being wheelchair bound,which would mean that she is sitting passively.no data is presented to support the assertion that leger can not sit for more than one hour per day.
ml.with respect to leger ability to work,chmell stated 
leger would be limited in her ability to carry out any type of weight bearing activities due to the diagnosis of documented significant arthritis of both knees.she would be able to stand or walk for only brief periods of time and climb one flight of stairs only occasionally.she can lift up to pounds occasionally.she can carry up to pounds occasionally.she can push or pull up to pounds occasionally.she would be able to bend,squat,or twist only occasionally.she has unrestricted use of the upper extremities and unrestricted use of the axial skeleton and can sit for an unlimited period of time.
additional information concerning leger medical history was supplied to chmell,who then supplemented his original report.chmell stated 
on march,a letter is provided from hill,which states that leger is presently severely disabled and needs crutches to ambulate.hill writes that leger is unable to perform any job,which requires prolonged sitting greater than minutes.he does not provide any objective medical evidence of a disorder of a severity enough to preclude unlimited sitting.leger has no disorder,which would preclude unlimited sitting.this reviewer is a orthopedic surgeon in clinical practice and my practice involves the treatment of arthritic hips and knees.in no way,does leger have a diagnosis,which would preclude an unlimited ability to sit in my opinion.i am very experienced on a daily basis with taking care of such individuals with endstage arthritis of the knee and there is absolutely no reason why leger can not sit for an unlimited period of time.
ml.relying on chmell medical review,met life upheld the decision to terminate leger benefits on may.see ml.
district court proceedings 
leger commenced this action pursuant to a b to reinstate her disability benefits.after the close of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.in rendering its decision,the district court noted that the parties agreed that the plan accorded the administrator discretion,and,therefore,the standard of review applied.see at.quoting our decision in houston provident life accident insurance,cir,the court observed that it was required to uphold the administrator decision if it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome id.at.
applying this standard to the evidence before it,the court determined that the defendant ha d advanced a reasonable explanation for its decision to terminate plaintiff disability benefits.id.at.the court explained 
defendant provided plaintiff medical records to two of its physicians,who reviewed the file in its entirety,including plaintiff history of surgeries and care by numerous doctors.defendant then weighed the opinions of its doctor against those of plaintiff treating physician and made a reasonable choice among conflicting medical opinions.
id.the district court rejected leger argument that the plan decision to terminate her benefits was unreasonable because it had not documented any improvement in her condition the court noted that erisa did not require that the plan show that her condition had improved,only that the decision to terminate was reasonable.additionally,it rejected leger claim that the plan decision was arbitrary and capricious because the plan physicians had not conducted a physical examination,but only a file review.finally,the court did not accept leger argument that the physicians retained by the plan administrator were biased because they had received remuneration for their services.
leger timely appealed the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the plan.
before the district court,the parties agreed that the standard of review applied.leger now maintains,however,that the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life insurance company glenn,d,alters the way that courts must evaluate claim determinations.essentially,leger reads glenn as necessitating a more penetrating scope of judicial review than has previously been utilized.appellant reply br.
in glenn,the court considered how courts should review the denial of benefits under erisa when a single entity is both the plan administrator and the payor of the benefits.the court determined that this dual role constitutes a conflict of interest,that a reviewing court should consider that conflict as a factor in determining whether the plan administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits,and that the significance of the factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.id.at.
after reviewing the factual and legal background of the case before it,the court turned to its recent decision in firestone tire rubber bruch,d.firestone established that,when a claimant is denied benefits under a plan providing the administrator with discretionary authority to determine eligibility,the plan determination should be accorded deference,evaluated according to an standard.see id.at citing firestone tire rubber,at.the court noted that firestone also established that,when an administrator or fiduciary is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.emphasis in original quoting firestone tire rubber,at.quoting restatement second of trusts,cmt.d.
after concluding that this last principle was implicated when the same company both determines eligibility and pays benefits,the court then turned to the question of how a court should account for that conflict of interest in its review of the benefits determination.the court rejected the idea that it should abandon a deferential standard of review with respect to benefit determinations.additionally,it did not believe that it was necessary or desirable for courts to create special rules,or other special procedural or evidentiary rules,focused narrowly upon the conflict.id.at.instead,the court determined that the conflict of interest was simply one of many factors that a court must consider in conducting its review.
our study of glenn convinces us,first,that the decision is best read as an extension of the court previous decision in firestone and,second,that it is not applicable to the present case.fairly read,glenn explains how the general principle established in firestone should be applied to the more specific case in which responsibility for both claim determinations and is vested in the same entity.in such a situation,a court is required to take such an obvious conflict of interest into with all of the other relevant determining whether the entity determination was arbitrary and capricious.contrary to leger claims,the court decision in glenn did not create a new standard of heightened arbitrary and capricious standard for claims involving a conflict of interest it would be an even more serious misreading of glenn to suggest that it establishes a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard for cases in which the administrator and the payor are two separate entities.indeed,that situation simply was not before the court.
the correct standard of review to be applied in this case is the standard.see tate long term disability plan for salaried employees of champion int l,cir holding that where an erisa plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of a plan,a denial of benefits is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.under that deferential
