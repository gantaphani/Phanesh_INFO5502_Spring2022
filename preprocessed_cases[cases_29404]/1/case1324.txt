the united states of america,the united states coast guard,and the united states customs and border protection agency collectively,respondents or the government appeal the district court order,which,upon an emergency petition filed in the eastern district of virginia,altered the terms of a bond the coast guard had fixed for the release of a detained ship that was under investigation and restricted the types of penalties the government could seek for the ship potential violations of certain ocean pollution prevention statutes.as explained below,this matter was not subject to review in the district court because the coast guard actions were committed to agency discretion by law.as a result,the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition and we,therefore,reverse and remand for dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.
we begin with the international and domestic legal landscape underlying this matter.the united states is a signatory to marpol,which is a treaty aimed at achiev ing the complete elimination of international pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances.protocol of relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships.marpol requires member states to prohibit violations of the treaty through domestic laws,and to provide penalties adequate in severity to discourage violations of marpol.id.at.
in fulfilling its obligations pursuant to marpol,congress enacted the act to prevent pollution from ships apps.see.according to apps,the secretary shall administer and enforce marpol,as well as statutes and regulations designed to preserve the marine environment.id.a.the term secretary is defined as the secretary of the department in which the coast guard is operating.id.a.at all times relevant to this appeal,the coast guard operated under the department of homeland security dhs.
the regulations attendant to apps require,in relevant part,that certain ships must maintain an oil record book orb,and 
e ntries shall be made in the orb whenever any of the following machinery space operations take place on any ship to which this section applies ballasting or cleaning of fuel oil tanks discharge of ballast containing an oily mixture or cleaning water from fuel oil tanks disposal of oil residue and discharge overboard or disposal otherwise of bilge water that has accumulated in machinery spaces.

there are two petitioners in this appeal the antonis pappadakis pappadakis or the vessel,an bulk cargo carrier,which was built in and registered in malta and angelex angelex,a company that purchased the vessel on march.the vessel is angelex sole asset.angelex contracted with a third party,kassian maritime navigation agency,kassian,a greek company,to serve as the vessel operator.kassian also operates several other cargo ships and is not a petitioner in this appeal 
the events giving rise to this action began on april.on that day,the pappadakis arrived at the norfolk southern terminal in norfolk,virginia,and loaded a cargo of coal for delivery to a customer in brazil.the next day,on april,coast guard inspectors conducted a routine port state control inspection of the pappadakis.while coast guard personnel were aboard the vessel,a crewmember passed a note to one of the inspectors,which stated that the vessel oily water separator had been bypassed and oily bilge water had been discharged overboard.the letter also alleged that this discharge was not reported in the orb.upon further inspection,the coast guard discovered that the pappadakis oily water separator was inoperable,the vessel had likely been discharging bilge water overboard,and the orb was incomplete or falsified,in contravention of marpol and apps.
the coast guard referred its findings to the department of justice for possible prosecution.it also informed angelex that the pappadakis clearance to depart norfolk had been withheld,and negotiations for a security agreement between the coast guard and counsel for angelex began 
after a few days,the negotiations stalled with the coast guard requiring the posting of a million bond,a number of obligations intended to ensure the availability and cooperation of the crewmembers and officials,and consent to the united states continued jurisdiction over the matter.unable to further negotiate with the coast guard,and claiming to be losing money by the day,angelex and the pappadakis in rem then filed an emergency petition on april,in the eastern district of virginia,seeking immediate release of the pappadakis or imposition of an appropriate bond the petition 
specifically,the petition asked the court to fix an amount of security for release of the pappadakis because the coast guard was not authorized and was wrongfully withholding clearance the vessel was improperly detained the amount of surety bond being demanded was unjustified as a matter of fact,law,equity and good conscience and beyond the coast guard authority such actions were causing serious,irreparable harm to angelex and the vessel and the government was improperly making angelex act as the government proxy in detaining the crewmembers for an indefinite and unlimited amount of time,without lawful authority and in violation of their rights to due process of law.
the district court held a hearing on the petition on may.it recessed court and encouraged the parties to come up with an agreeable bond determination.the parties met for several hours and ultimately reached an agreement of million bond and other agreed conditions,subject to approval from the coast guard headquarters in washington,headquarters.but when the court reconvened,the government attorney advised that the settlement had been rejected by headquarters.according to the district court,that attorney also advised that pursuant to guidance from headquarters,the coast guard firmly refuses to accept less than the million bond it had previously offered.
on may,the district court filed a memorandum opinion,explaining that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction based on the administrative procedure act,et the apa,and federal question jurisdiction,or,in the alternative,in rem admiralty jurisdiction.it then determined that the government had acted unconstitutionally and outside its statutory authority by demanding excessive bond for clearance and by insisting that any security agreement include certain conditions.see angelex united states,cv.may,ecf.in a contemporaneous order,the district court set forth new bond conditions.specifically,the order directed angelex to post a surety bond in the sum of million.the order specified that the government could initiate either civil or criminal proceedings,but not both,and established other bond conditions,including the following 
t he owner will maintain in the eastern district of virginia,at the owner cost and expense,six named officers and crew members of said vessel for no greater than one month,and said crew members shall be functionally detained under material witness status so that their deposition may be taken 
t he owner will return,at its cost and expense,gerasimos patsalias,master of said vessel,for either the civil or criminal proceedings only one or the other brought against petitioners under apps 
t he owner agrees to provide elizabeth oliveira,of the united states coast guard,with the name,address and telephone number of the hotel or other place where each of said ship officers and crew members may be located when housed pursuant to the conditions of said bond in the eastern district of virginia.
upon the posting of the said bond all parties to this action shall take all actions necessary to immediately release said vessel from arrest and allow it to proceed from this port and issue any and all permits that may be necessary to allow it to proceed out of this port in its trade.
on may,the government requested that the district court temporarily stay the order,simultaneously filing a notice of appeal and requesting a stay from this court.the district court denied the stay motion on may.that same day,this court granted a stay that was extended,on may,to encompass the pendency of this appeal.thereafter,we implemented an expedited briefing schedule and heard argument at the greenbrier county courthouse in lewisburg,west virginia,on june,
because the district court order enjoined the united states to comply with the conditions set forth therein,we possess jurisdiction pursuant to a.in addition,insofar as the order constitutes the final decision of the district court,we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
in this appeal,the government challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court,an issue that we review de novo.see dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc.
the district court asserted jurisdiction over this matter under the apa and pursuant to the court admiralty jurisdiction.for the following reasons,neither provides the court with the power to review the coast guard actions in this case.
reviewability is a threshold jurisdictional question that must be determined before the merits of the case may be reached.sierra club larson,cir.the apa is not a statute.lee citizenship and immigration,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t he jurisdictional source for an action under the apa is the federal question statute,and the apa judicial provisions provide a limited cause of action for parties adversely affected by agency action.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because reviewability is a threshold jurisdictional question,however,we must examine reviewability through the lens of the apa to determine whether the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction.larson,at.
the apa requires a reviewing court to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the apa further provides,a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.id.of significance here,the apa provides two exceptions to judicial review of agency actions when statutes preclude judicial review,or when agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.id.a.the government argues that both exceptions apply here,and in any event,there is no final agency action of the coast guard.
because the action that occurred in this case is explicitly committed to the discretion of the coast guard pursuant to apps,we conclude that this matter was unreviewable,and thus,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the idea that courts can not review actions committed to agency discretion by law was at the forefront of two seminal supreme court cases citizens to preserve overton park volpe,and heckler chaney.volpe explained that a is a very narrow exception and applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.volpe,at.heckler further elucidated,however,that even where congress has not affirmatively precluded review,review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion and no judicially manageable standards for judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion.at.
our resolution of this matter is further informed by speed mining federal mine safety health review commission,cir.speed mining,an of a coal mine in west virginia,petitioned for review of a decision from the federal mine safety and health review commission,which upheld citations for a crane hoist accident that were issued by the secretary of labor.speed mining argued that,because the accident was caused by independent contractors,the secretary decision to cite speed mining itself was an abuse of discretion.see id.at.
this court held,
it is settled law in this and other circuits that the secretary possesses the discretionary authority to cite for safety violations committed by independent contractors.moreover,there are no manageable standards in the mine safety and health act that enable us to review the secretary discretionary exercise of her enforcement authority.
speed mining,at.as a result,the secretary discretionary decision to cite speed mining for the crane hoist accident is committed to agency discretion by law,and therefore unreviewable.id.at.additionally,t he discretionary decision as to which operator to cite for a mine act violation rests on a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within the secretary expertise.id.at.
the circumstances in this case substantially mirror those described by the supreme court in heckler and our court in speed mining.by its petition,angelex asserts that the coast guard acted arbitrarily,capriciously,and unreasonably in detaining the pappadakis,setting a bond which angelex can not post,and demanding a security agreement with terms that are not authorized by the operative statute,e.but e grants the coast guard broad discretion to deny bond altogether,and it can dictate the terms of any bond that it may accept.see giuseppe bottiglieri shipping united states,d,congress did not require the coast guard to accept a bond or other surety in any case,or grant an absolute right to a vessel owner to obtain departure clearance.
furthermore,the language of e does not provide any judicially manageable standards by which to review the coast guard actions.heckler,at.there are no specific guidelines as to when clearance should or should not be granted in apps,and congress did not outline even in the broadest brushstrokes the parameters for what form or amount a bond or other surety should take.giuseppe,d at.the reasonableness of the coast guard decision can not be determined pro forma in a vacuum,but only in the context of the standards intended by congress.as a result,this is a situation where the statute at issue is drawn in such broad terms that there is no law to apply.heckler,at quoting volpe,at see also larson,at holding that federal court could not review federal highway administration fhwa decision not to enforce certain provisions of the highway beautification act hba,explaining,t he relevant question here is whether the hba provides standards for ascertaining when the fhwa should recommend that formal enforcement proceedings be commenced or when the secretary is required to make a determination of compliance or or to institute an enforcement action.as to these points,the statute is silent.therefore,there is no law to apply and appellant has failed to overcome the presumption of unreviewability.
despite these bars to review,the district court nonetheless decided it possessed jurisdiction to review the coast guard bond determination because,even when congress has committed a specific decision to an agency discretion by law,the federal courts retain jurisdiction to review discretionary agency actions for abuse of discretion.citing elecs.of,se.power,cir littell morton,cir.but,as the government points out,to adopt this argument would be to eliminate section a from the statute,by providing abuse of discretion review for all discretionary agency decisions,regardless of whether congress has committed them exclusively to the agency or not.appellant br.in fact,heckler rejected this very argument,explaining that even though the apa sets forth an abuse of discretion review of agency action in,the a exception for actions committed to agency discretion still applies to a separate class of cases,as here,in which a statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against
