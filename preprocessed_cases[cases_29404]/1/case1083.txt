the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed omar thomas appeal from a decision of the immigration judge ij finding him removable.the bia concluded that thomas misdemeanor convictions under new york penal law constituted aggravated felonies.thomas then filed a petition for review with this court.simultaneously,thomas sought reconsideration by the bia of its dismissal of his appeal.the bia granted the motion for reconsideration,but adhered to the legal analysis set forth in its initial decision.thomas did not petition for review of the bia second decision.we have before us only the bia initial decision,and must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review it.we conclude that we do,and will grant the petition.
thomas,a native and citizen of jamaica,entered the united states in november of at the age of as a lawful permanent resident.a little more than nine years later,on december,thomas was arrested.on december,detective piazza of the new york city police department completed a written statement,the issuance of which,if false,is punishable under new york penal law.it alleged that thomas committed the criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree in violation of new york penal law,as well as criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree in violation of new york penal law.the detective averred that he had been informed by undercover informant that thomas did hand to informant two plastic bags of a green,leafy substance with a distinct odor in exchange for.thomas,who was represented by counsel from the legal aid society,appeared in the criminal court of the state of new york that same day in what was designated.his counsel advised the court that thomas was pleading guilty to in full satisfaction and that thomas waived his right to prosecution by information.the court sentenced thomas to three days of community service.
thomas was arrested again on december,for,inter alia,the criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree in violation of new york penal law.a police officer prepared a written statement for that case,also punishable if false under new york penal law,alleging that the undercover officer received from thomas and another man one bag containing a dried,green,leafy substance in exchange for.according to the certificate of disposition,thomas pleaded guilty on january,to violating 
in addition,thomas was convicted of several other controlled substance offenses.on july,he was served with a notice to appear.the notice charged thomas with having been convicted of the criminal sale of marijuana in violation of on january,and as a result thereof,being removable as a criminal alien on two grounds for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,a a iii and for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense,a b i.a form entitled additional charges of specifically cited the january,conviction,as well as four other convictions involving marijuana.
before the ij,thomas conceded he was removable on the second ground alleged in the notice to appear,that his convictions were controlled substance offenses.he challenged the averment that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,and filed an application for cancellation of removal under b.because cancellation of removal requires the alien to establish,inter alia,that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony,id.b c,the ij directed thomas to submit additional documentation regarding his criminal history.thereafter,the ij determined that thomas had failed to demonstrate that his two convictions for violating new york penal law were not aggravated felonies and therefore concluded that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal.
thomas appealed to the bia,challenging the ij determination that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to establish that his misdemeanor convictions under new york penal law were not aggravated felonies.in a decision dated november,the bia misread the ij adjudication as a determination that he was removable on both of the grounds set forth in the notice to appear,that his convictions qualified as both controlled substance offenses and aggravated felonies.furthermore,the bia stated that the ij had pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal.in its consideration of the merits of thomas appeal,the bia appropriately recognized that there were two routes to apply in determining whether a conviction is an aggravated felony,the illicit trafficking route,and the hypothetical federal felony route.see gerbier holmes,cir.the bia found support in the written statements of the police officers for the determination that thomas had sold the marijuana for remuneration and that such conduct constituted a hypothetical federal felony under the controlled substances act.as a result,the bia agreed with the ij that thomas conviction records established that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.
this timely petition for review followed.simultaneously,thomas filed a motion with the bia seeking reconsideration,which asserted,inter alia,that the bia procedural recitation was factually incorrect because the ij had found him removable only on the second ground,to wit,that his convictions qualified as controlled substance offenses.during the pendency of his petition for review filed with this court,the bia granted his motion for reconsideration in a decision dated june.the bia agreed with thomas that its initial decision mischaracterized the ground on which the ij had determined he was removable.for that reason,the bia granted the motion to reconsider in order to clarify that thomas was found removable solely on the basis that his convictions were controlled substance offenses.the bia further stated that 
a part from the aforementioned factual error,which we have now corrected,we conclude that our decision of november,properly evaluated the legal question presented on appeal,namely whether thomas and convictions for fourth degree criminal sale of marijuana in violation of penal law preclude him from qualifying for cancellation of removal.for the reasons stated in our prior decision,we continue to hold that thomas is ineligible for cancellation of removal specifically,the record reflects that thomas was convicted of making remunerative sales of marijuana,offenses that correspond to felonies punishable under the federal controlled substances act,namely marijuana distribution.
accordingly,the bia dismissed thomas appeal and affirmed the order of removal.within days of the second bia decision,the government filed a motion to dismiss the pending petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.despite that action by the government,thomas failed to file a petition for review of the bia second decision.
the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended,provides for j udicial review of a final order of removal.a.the government contends that the bia june decision granting the motion for reconsideration effectively vacated the earlier november decision.the result is,according to the government,that the bia november decision no longer constitutes a final order of removal subject to judicial review.if the government is correct,because thomas did not file a petition for review of the bia june decision,we lack jurisdiction under a.
in stone immigration naturalization service,the supreme court considered a similar argument by an alien that his motion for reconsideration rendered the bia underlying order nonfinal.based on the statutory provisions providing for judicial review in a of the ina,which has been repealed and replaced by b the court reasoned that 
b y its terms,a contemplates two petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters.the words of the statute do not permit us to say that the filing of a petition for reconsideration or reopening dislodges the earlier proceeding reviewing the underlying order.the statute,in fact,directs that the motion to reopen or reconsider is to be consolidated with the review of the order,not the other way around.this indicates to us that the action to review the underlying order remains active and pending before the court 
were a motion for reconsideration to render the underlying order nonfinal,there would be,in the normal course,only one petition for review filed and hence nothing for the judiciary to consolidate.
at.in other words,stone instructs that the initial order of the bia is final when issued,irrespective of the later filing of a reconsideration motion.id.at.
stone is controlling.accordingly,we conclude that the bia initial decision in november of constitutes a final order irrespective of the later filing of thomas motion for reconsideration.because thomas filed a timely petition for review of the november decision,we have authority under a to review that ruling.
the finality of an order,however,is not the only requirement that must exist before we may exercise jurisdiction.see jaggernauth attorney,cir declaring that stone makes clear that the finality of the bia first order was not disturbed by the filing of the motion for reconsideration,but noting that stone did not resolve the justiciability issue that arises when reconsideration is granted and the board affirms its original order.to sustain our jurisdiction in the present case,it is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when the petition for review was filed in the court of appeals.lewis cont l bank.article iii of the constitution limits federal judicial power,that is,jurisdiction,to cases and controversies.parole comm geraghty.this requirement limits the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.id.at quoting flast cohen.when the questions or issues presented are no longer live,the case is moot.powell mccormack.that is,an issue is moot if changes in circumstances that prevailed at the beginning of the litigation have forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief.artway attorney,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,there has been a change in the circumstances that existed at the time thomas filed his petition for review,the bia subsequently granted his motion for reconsideration.the bia mere grant of a motion for reconsideration,however,does not in itself render the petition for review moot.rather,it is the substance of the bia subsequent decision,upon reconsideration,that determines whether there is still a live issue for the court of appeals to resolve.for example,if the bia subsequent decision substantively altered the ratio decidendi in its earlier disposition and operated to vacate the bia earlier decision,then the petition for review of the earlier decision is without effect because there is no longer any order or decision for the court of appeals to review.on the other hand,if the bia subsequent decision did not materially alter the rationale of the earlier ruling,that ruling remains effective and subject to judicial review by the court of appeals.
our sister courts of appeals have employed this sort of substantive analysis in determining whether there is still a live controversy to be resolved.for example,in jaggernauth,the eleventh circuit concluded that the bia order granting reconsideration did not vacate the bia original decision.at.the eleventh circuit acknowledged that the second decision contained some additional commentary by the bia about the propriety of its original ruling.the court concluded,however,that this commentary did not alter the effectiveness of the original order inasmuch as the bia explicitly upheld its original order and noted that it had acted properly.id.at.furthermore,the additional commentary was not incorporated into the original order,and it did not change the substance of the original order.id.the court determined,therefore,that it had jurisdiction over the petition for review of the bia original order.id.at.
similarly,in mukasey,cir,the ninth circuit considered whether it had jurisdiction over a petition for review of a decision of the bia in light of the bia subsequent order granting the alien motion for reconsideration.the court agreed with the eleventh circuit approach in jaggernauth,declaring that 
w here the bia decision granting a motion for reconsideration expressly affirms the bia prior decision and its analysis does not significantly differ,there is little reason to require the petitioner to raise the identical issue again in a petition to review the bia decision on the motion to reconsider.desta.ashcroft,cir.stone recognizes that congress created parallel processes of administrative and judicial review of the bia decisions to expedite the removal process.once a petition for review has been filed,federal court jurisdiction is divested only where the bia subsequently vacates or materially changes the decision under review.
id.at,overruled on other grounds by.holder,cir en banc.
in contrast to jaggernauth and,the sixth circuit decided in mu ju li mukasey,cir,that the bia grant of an alien motion for reconsideration effectively vacated the bia original decision.in mu ju li,the alien sought reconsideration,contending that the bia had neglected to address her primary argument,which sought relief under a specific statutory provision.the bia acknowledged that it had failed to address this argument,granted reconsideration,and explained why the statutory provision on which the alien relied was inapplicable.the alien did not seek review of the bia second decision granting reconsideration.the government argued that the alien petition for review of the first decision was no longer reviewable because the subsequent decision effectively vacated the bia earlier decision.the court agreed.it explained that when the bia grants a motion to reconsider considering the issues a new decision addressing the arguments raised,the original order has been vacated and a new order entered in its place.id.at.based on this reasoning,the sixth circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the alien petition for review of the bia initial decision.id.at.
the question for this court,then,is whether the bia june decision vacated or materially altered its november decision.after scrutinizing the bia june decision,we conclude that the circumstances here are more analogous to those in jaggernauth and.first,it is significant that the june decision did not explicitly state that it was modifying,reversing or vacating the november decision.rather,the bia explained that it was granting reconsideration because its prior decision contains a factual error and therefore we will reconsider the decision in order to correct our error and clarify the record.in other words,the purpose of granting reconsideration was limited to correcting the factual error.indeed,in the very next sentence,the bia stated that it once again conclude d that thomas wa s removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal.after the bia corrected its factual mischaracterization of the ij order,the bia stated that its november decision properly evaluated the legal question presented on appeal.the bia then declared for the reasons stated in our prior decision,we continue to hold that thomas is ineligible for cancellation of removal.in short,it adhered to its earlier legal analysis.we conclude,therefore,that the june decision did not vacate or substantially modify the november decision.as a consequence,the petition for review of the november decision continues to present a live controversy for our judicial review.
thomas contends that the bia erred in its determination that his and his convictions qualified as aggravated felonies,a determination that rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal.whether thomas convictions qualify as aggravated felonies is a question of law subject to plenary review.evanson attorney,cir garcia attorney,cir.
an alien may obtain relief from removal if he qualifies for cancellation of removal under.in order to be eligible for a discretionary grant of cancellation of removal,an alien must satisfy four requirements.id.b.one of these requirements is that the alien has not been convicted of an offense under a.that provision renders a criminal alien deportable if he committed certain crimes,including an aggravated felony.a a iii.a ggravated felony is defined to include,inter alia,illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.the term drug trafficking crime in c means any felony punishable under three specified federal statutes,one of which is the controlled substances act.c.furthermore,the definition of aggravated felony specifies that the term applies regardless of whether the offense violates federal or state law.a.
in gerbier,we adopted the approach advanced by the bia for determining when a state drug offense constitutes an aggravated felony.at.that approach recognized two routes the illicit trafficking route and the hypothetical federal felony route.id.at.under the illicit trafficking route,a state drug conviction will not qualify as an aggravated felony unless the offense is a felony under the law of the convicting sovereign and the offense contain s a trafficking element,it must involve the unlawful trading or dealing of a controlled substance.id.at citation omitted.because thomas convictions were misdemeanors under new york penal law,see penal law,those convictions can not,by definition,be aggravated felonies pursuant to the illicit trafficking route.
the second route by which a state drug conviction could be an aggravated felony under the ina is the hypothetical federal felony route.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.under this route,a state conviction,regardless of whether it is classified as a misdemeanor,qualifies as an aggravated felony if it is punishable under one of the three specified statutes if federally prosecuted and would be punishable by a term of imprisonment of over one year.id.quoting steele blackman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,if the state drug conviction is punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act,it may constitute an aggravated felony pursuant to the hypothetical federal felony route.gerbier,at lopez gonzales,declaring that u nless a state offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not count.in evanson,we noted that under the hypothetical federal felony route a state marijuana conviction is only equivalent to a federal drug felony if the offense involved payment or more than a small amount of marijuana.at.
our analysis of the hypothetical federal felony route requires application of the formal categorical approach.id.at.this approach was described in taylor united states.in that case,the supreme court considered whether the defendant state conviction for burglary constituted a burglary for purposes of e,thereby justifying the application of a sentencing enhancement.the court concluded that the term burglary in e did not depend on the specific definition set forth by a state.rather,the term for purposes of e meant the generic crime of burglary that regardless of its exact definition or label,ha s the basic element of unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime.id.at.in order to determine if a defendant prior offense warrants the sentencing enhancement under e,the court noted that the sentencing court will apply a formal categorical approach,looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offense,and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.id.at see gonzales,applying the categorical approach to an immigration proceeding and noting that under the formal categorical approach a court should normally look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but rather to the state statute defining the crime of conviction.
taylor recognized that in some states a burglary offense was broader than the e generic definition of burglary.in that event,the court instructed,the sentencing court is permitted to go beyond the mere fact of conviction where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.id.at.this modified approach permits a sentencing court to find that a state offense constitutes a generic burglary under e if the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.id.
in this case,application of the formal categorical approach requires examination of the new york statute under which thomas was convicted,without consideration of the particular facts underlying the conviction,to determine whether it is punishable as a felony under a of the controlled substances act for knowingly distributing or possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance.garcia,at.section of the new york penal law provides,with an exception not relevant here,that a person is guilty of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells marihuana.the term sell is defined by statute as meaning to sell,exchange,give or dispose of to another.penal law.this definition gives rise to four alternative grounds for establishing criminal culpability under the statute.only selling and exchanging marijuana,however,qualify as the hypothetical federal felony of distributing marijuana in violation of a.evanson,at declaring that a state marijuana conviction is therefore only equivalent to a federal drug felony if the offense involved payment or more than a small amount of marijuana citing steele,at.merely giving or disposing of marijuana does not constitute a hypothetical federal felony.steele,at observing that one may be convicted of criminal sale under without evidence of a sale as commonly understood.therefore,because is in the disjunctive and because some criminal sales under might not constitute an aggravated felony,steele,at,we must depart from the formal categorical approach and apply the modified categorical approach.garcia,at see also evanson,at.
although taylor articulated the modified categorical approach in a case involving a conviction by jury,the supreme court determined in shepard united states,that sentencing courts could apply the modified categorical approach to convictions obtained pursuant to guilty pleas.id.at.it explained that taylor did not limit the evidence that may be considered under this modified approach strictly to charges and jury instructions since a conviction might follow trial to a judge alone or a plea of guilty.id.at.the court refused,however,to allow a sentencing court to consider under the modified categorical approach a police report submitted with the application for the issuance of criminal complaint.it held that under the modified categorical approach the inquiry 
to determine whether a plea of guilty necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant or to some comparable judicial record of this information.
thomas convictions under are dated,to say the least.the records adduced by thomas in an effort to establish that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony are sparse.with respect to the december,conviction,there is the police officer written statement,a plea colloquy,what appears to be a docket page,and a certificate of disposition.for the january,conviction,the record before us contains only the police officer written statement and a certificate of disposition.there are no documents relating to the guilty plea proceeding in the conviction.
the bia determined that it could consider the police officers written statements,which it characterized as affidavits of probable cause,because they were charging documents.it explained that in new york,a criminal action commences with the filing of an accusatory instrument and the officer statements were the accusatory instrument s prepared by the arresting officer s in connection with the filing of the criminal complaint s.because the statements indicated that thomas exchanged marijuana for money,the bia concluded that the statements established that thomas convictions involved remunerative sales that would be punishable under of the controlled substance act which makes it a crime to,inter alia,distribute marijuana 
we accept that the police officer written statemen
