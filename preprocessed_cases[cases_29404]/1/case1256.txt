opinion of the court 
alden leeds,alden leeds petitions for review of an order of the occupational safety and health review commission commission,which upheld a notification of failure to abate violations fta notification issued pursuant to section b of the occupational safety and health act of act,b.in,alden leeds was cited for instances in which pool chemicals had been improperly stored in its facility,and alden leeds entered into a settlement agreement under which it agreed to abate the violations for which it had been cited.in,the occupational safety and health administration osha,exercising power delegated by the secretary of the department of labor,issued the fta notification,which listed different instances of improper storage of pool chemicals.
alden leeds contends that the specific instances of improper storage cited in,the specific piles of chemicals described in that citation constitute the violations that had to be abated.because those particular piles no longer contravened storage requirements at the time of the reinspection in,alden leeds argues that the fta notification was unfounded.the secretary,in contrast,argues that improper storage practices in general constituted the violations and that the persistence of these practices at the alden leeds facility justified the fta notification.the secretary interprets the decision of the commission as resting on this broad reading of the earlier citation and settlement.we hold that this broad reading of the citation and settlement is arbitrary and capricious,and we thus grant the petition for review and reverse the commission decision.
the facts relevant to our decision are undisputed.alden leeds is in the business of distributing chemicals for swimming pools.its facility in south kearny,new jersey,includes three warehouses in which chemicals are stored and staged for shipping.most of the chemicals are not hazardous,but some of them are oxidizers that promote burning or even spontaneous combustion under certain conditions.the chemicals are stored in containers that are stacked in piles.inventory is constantly moved around the warehouse and turns over three or four times annually.
osha has not promulgated its own standards concerning the storage of oxidizers.instead,osha relies on three sets of privately issued guidelines a standard issued by the national fire protection association nfpa,a uniform building code for state and local governments referred to as boca,and a chemical industry guidebook known as the bluebook.although these guidelines differ in details not relevant here,they all contain certain types of requirements.among other things,they all limit the maximum tonnage in a single building,the maximum tonnage in a single pile of chemical containers,the maximum height of a pile,the minimum aisle width between piles,and the minimum distance between oxidizers and incompatible chemicals 
in the,osha conducted three inspections of the alden leeds warehouses.all three were conducted by the same compliance officer,and all three resulted in citations for similar,infractions.this case focuses on the second and third inspections,which occurred in and,respectively.the inspection also referred to as the reinspection resulted in the fta notification at issue here.
the inspection followed a fire at the alden leeds facility.the osha inspector issued a citation under the act general duty clause,a after referring to this statutory provision,the citation stated 
the employer did not furnish employment and a place of employment which were free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the employee in that employees were exposed to the hazard of fire from the improper storage of highly reactive oxidizing agents 
a jacobus and class two oxidizers were not stored in accordance with the national fire protection association nfpa document,table storage of class oxidizers in that the maximum tonnage requirements were exceeded approximately tons were stored in warehouse b.the maximum tonnage allowed for sprinklered segregated storage is tons of class two oxidizers.violation observed on or about.
the citation then went on to list other instances of improper storage.these instances related to what the secretary characterizes as seven categorical requirements,the maximum tonnage limits for warehouses and piles,the maximum height and width limits for piles,and the minimum separation distance between compatible oxidizers,between incompatible oxidizers,or between oxidizers and walls.the citation offered compliance with nfpa requirement as a feasible method of abatement.alden leeds contested the citation.under the settlement reached by the parties in july,alden leeds agreed to abate a ll violations alleged in the citation and complaint by october,exhibit 
the alden leeds facility was reinspected in december.although the specific instances of improper storage cited in had all been corrected,this time osha identified different instances of improper storage.these instances concerned six of the seven categories of requirements involved in the citation.osha issued a fta notification in june and assessed a penalty of 
alden leeds challenged the fta notification before an administrative law judge.the alj noted that the parties took sharply conflicting positions as to the nature of the violations.app.the alj observed that it was the secretary position that the citation concerned alden leeds storage practices,not specific conditions which violated nfpa.id.at.by contrast,the alj wrote,alden leeds defense focused on the fact that the specific conditions in its warehouses had been changed by the time of the reinspection in.id.interpreting the citation,the alj stated that it does not specifically refer to storage practices and that the listed violations clearly refer to specific conditions,not practices.id.at.the alj described the question before him as whether charging alden leeds with specific conditions that exposed employees to the hazard of fire from improper storage of the chemicals clearly informed alden leeds that its storage procedures were deemed hazardous by the secretary.id.at.the alj stated that the question was close,but he concluded that alden leeds had been clearly informed that its practices,not just the specific instances of improper storage,had been cited.id.the alj observed that reading the citation as limited to the specific instances mentioned would blink the reality of the hazard in warehouses where inventory is constantly changing and piles are regularly moved.id.at.
alden leeds appealed to the commission,but a divided panel affirmed,with each commissioner issuing a separate opinion.alden leads,oshc bna,app.at.the lead opinion,written by commissioner rogers,concluded that the citation gave alden leeds adequate notice that the hazard to be abated was not the specific instances of improper storage listed in the citation or even the seven categorical requirements to which the secretary now refers,but the fire hazard caused by its storage practices.app.at.see also id.at agreeing with the alj that alden leeds storage practices constituted the hazard that the secretary sought to have remedied.concurring,commissioner weisberg stated,among other things,that although it was undisputed that the specific instances of improper storage listed in the citation no longer existed at the time of the reinspection,those violations had not been abated.see id.at.commissioner weisberg observed that the record strongly suggested that the company had not taken corrective action with respect to those specific conditions but had simply moved chemicals around in the ordinary course of its business.see id.at.thus,commissioner weisberg seemed to take the position that abatement requires not only the elimination of the hazardous condition but also a specific intent to eliminate the hazard 
commissioner visscher dissented and concluded that the majority had misconstrued the citation.app.at.he stated that the only fair reading of the citation and settlement agreement is that alden leeds was charged with,and therefore required to abate,thirteen conditions specifically identifi
