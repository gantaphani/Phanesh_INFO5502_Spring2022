we have consolidated for decision three challenges,argued the same day,to district court decisions affirming denials by the social security administration of disability benefits and for persons who lack social security insurance supplemental security income benefits,which are similar.recently,in spiva astrue,wl cir,and parker astrue,cir,we criticized the social security administration handling of disability claims in several respects summarized in spiva 
opinions of administrative law judges denying benefits routinely state with some variations in wording that although the claimant medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms,the claimant statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible,yet fail to indicate which statements are not credible and what exactly not entirely is meant to signify many of the social security administration administrative law judges seem poorly informed about mental illness and in defiance of the principle of sec chenery,the justice department lawyers who defend denials of disability benefits often rely heavily on evidence not so far as appears relied on by the administrative law judge,and defend the tactic by invoking an overbroad conception of harmless error.
wl,at.we noted that similar criticisms could be found in a number of other court of appeals opinions,in this and other circuits.id.in two of the cases before us,infirmities similar to those that we found in spiva and parker require us to reverse in the third,the administrative law judge opinion was thorough and well supported.
we are mindful of the difficulties that the social security administration administrative law judges labor under.they have a very heavy median annual number of disability hearings conducted by an administrative law judge is almost the average is.social security advisory board,improving the social security administration hearing process,visited,as were all the websites cited in this opinion social security advisory board,disability decision making data and materials may,social security disability management of disability claims workload will require comprehensive planning general accounting office.staff support is inadequate.improving the social security administration hearing process,supra,at.the large number of administrative law judges more than,combined with limited administrative appellate capacity,has resulted in great uncorrected variance in denial rates across administrative law judges.see alj disposition data fy,social security online,improving the social security administration hearing process,supra,at.this in turn implies frequent inconsistency,id.at,social security administration more effort needed to assess consistency of disability decisions general accounting office,no,july,and quality problems generally.the lewin group,et,evaluation of ssa disability quality assurance qa processes and development of qa options that will support the management of the disability program final report.there thus are ominous parallels to the inadequacies in the administration of the immigration laws by immigration judges,see,benslimane gonzales,cir,a type of administrative law judge.
a study found that the district courts the reviewers of denials of social security benefits reversed percent of denials outright and ordered benefits awarded in those cases,and remanded percent of the denials,and percent of the remands eventuated in a grant of benefits.this means that a total of percent x of all appeals to the district courts from denials of benefits resulted in their eventual grant.paul verkuil jeffrey lubbers,alternative approaches to review of social security disability cases,admin.in,the percent figure rose to percent.disability decision making data and materials,supra,at.and that is apart from reversals by the courts of appeals of district courts affirmances of denials of benefits,as in two of the three cases we decide today.
since we do see cases in which social security disability benefits are granted in error,because the government can not appeal from a grant at the final administrative level,we can not quite apart from the nonnegligible possibility of judicial error conclude that administrative law judges have a percent error rate.moreover,the high reversal rate may simply reflect caution on the part of claimants lawyers,since they are unlikely to obtain a significant perhaps any fee if the appeal fails their clients invariably are impecunious.but approximately percent of denials at the highest administrative level computed from verkuil lubbers,supra,at,reporting statistics from,are appealed,which is a high appeal rate and the higher an appeal rate,the lower the expected reversal rate if the tribunal appealed from is doing a good job.
so much for background on to the cases,beginning with martinez.anita martinez,age at the time of her hearing before the administrative law judge,lives in the basement of her mother home with her five children.she suffers from severe depression,has symptoms of bipolar disorder often associated with depression,and has severe arthritic joint and bone pain throughout her body and a swelling of the hands that makes it very difficult for her to carry things,open packages,wash dishes,or write.physicians have observed worsening signs and symptoms of severe musculoskeletal pain,and have treated her by prescribing ever more potent drugs plus splints to wear on her wrists,but with mixed results.she also takes drugs for her mental conditions.unsurprisingly she has difficulty concentrating.her mother and her three eldest children help her with most household tasks,as she has to rest frequently throughout the day.daily she thinks about committing suicide,and the children are instructed to summon their grandmother if their mother seems unusually depressed or suicidal.
the administrative law judge found that martinez indeed has severe arthritis and severe depression,but also found that she can use her hands for fine and gross manipulations,has only moderate difficulties with concentration,persistence,or pace,and is not disabled,because she is capable of doing her former work she last worked in as a attendant or cashier,and could also work as a hand assembler.
the administrative law judge opinion is perfunctory.the analysis portion begins with the boilerplate recital that the claimant medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce some symptoms,but the claimant statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.there is no explanation of which of martinez statements are not entirely credible or how credible or noncredible any of them are.the next sentence is that the claimant longitudinal medical history is not necessarily consistent with his sic allegations of disability.we do understand the significance of necessarily.did the administrative law judge think martinez medical history consistent or inconsistent with her claims 
with regard to pain,all the opinion states is that a rheumatologist indicates that he detected very subtle evidence of an inflammatory process.he describes it as not well developed,and that t he laboratory tests and physical examinations were normal.he suggested that she take a long acting.in fact the suggestion for such a drug came from martinez,who wanted a drug because she was afraid to have a large quantity of strong drugs on hand given her depression and suicidal thoughts.and the rheumatologist,while stating that the results of a general physical examination of martinez were normal,observed definite evidence of a true inflammatory process and diagnosed her with inflammatory inflammation of more than one joint.and his report was only part of the evidence of the severity of martinez joint and bone pain,having been issued years before another physician treated her musculoskeletal pain,and also symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands,with strong drugs and the wrist splints.
the administrative law judge discussed so little of the evidence that her conclusion that martinez complaints of sev
