the plaintiffs in this labor dispute are trustees of an association of various benefit funds established under the relations act of lmra,and the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,and maintained for the benefit of members of the michigan regional council of carpenters,the union.they filed this action against defendants industrial contracting,llc,and lasalle group,claiming that f or all relevant purposes,the two companies are one and the same,constituting a single employer,with each being the alter ego of the other and seeking to audit the books of both defendants to verify the accuracy of the contributions that they were contractually obligated to make to the plaintiffs under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement cba between the union and industrial contracting.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,based on its determination that,as a matter of law,the alter ego doctrine was inapplicable in this case because the plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence to show that industrial was formed or operated with the intended purpose of evading any of lasalle preexisting contractual obligations.we conclude that this decision can not be reconciled with our opinion in nlrb allcoast transfer,cir,in which we held that a finding of employer intent is not essential or prerequisite to imposition of alter ego status but is merely one of the relevant factors which the courts can consider.id.at.we therefore reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
as we noted in allcoast transfer,th e factors relevant to a finding of alter ego status include whether the two enterprises have substantially identical management,business purpose,operation,equipment,customers,supervision and ownership.id.at quoting nelson electric nlrb,cir.our inquiry,then,begins with a review of the evidence,largely undisputed,that was supplied at the summary judgment stage of the litigation.that evidence established that the funds are beneficiaries of a cba signed between the michigan regional council of carpenters and employers in the construction industry.the cba requires employers to make contributions to the funds on behalf of covered employees,including fringe benefits that are calculated based on either the hours worked by covered employees or a percentage of the employees base wages.the contract also covers subcontracting n o employer shall subcontract or assign any of the work described herein which is to be performed at a job site to any contractor,subcontractor or other person or party who fails to agree in writing to comply with the conditions of employment contained in the agreement and operations.the contract clause covering the latter provides that if work of the type covered by this agreement is performed by any entity,regardless of under what name it is performed,
wherein the employer including its officers,directors,owners,partners,or stockholders exercises either directly or indirectly such as through family members any significant degree of ownership,management,or control,the terms and conditions of this agreement shall be applicable to all such work and to such successor or alter ego entity.
the controversy arose because of the overlapping establishment and convergence of the defendant companies.lasalle was incorporated in.steven palermo became a minority owner of lasalle in and a majority owner approximately five years later.although lasalle was a signatory to the cba with the union at the time palermo purchased his ownership interest,the company declined to renew the contract when it expired on june.in the meantime,steven palermo and his brother randy had formed another company in that was the predecessor to industrial contracting,llc.three years later,steven palermo sold his in industrial contracting to his former,chester jablonski,who purchased an additional percent interest from randy palermo.industrial contracting was not a signatory to any cba until it entered an agreement with the union on june,at the same time that lasalle terminated its relationship with the union.
in addition to his majority interest in industrial contracting,jablonski was lasalle chief financial officer and had previously served as its vice president,secretary,and treasurer.he managed the operations for both industrial contracting and lasalle,and he acted as the contact with the union for both companies.jablonski testified that he had the authority to sign steven palermo signature on lasalle documents for pretty much whatever i need his signature on.
according to the lasalle website as accessed in,the company was a general contractor and construction management company that had a total of field employees,including carpenters and other tradespeople.however,in a deposition taken in september,a lasalle official said that the company did not hire tradespeople directly at that time and had only ten laborers on its payroll,down from the or workers employed by lasalle on june of that year,at the termination of its collective bargaining agreement with the union.industrial contracting was a subcontractor that provided labor and supervision for construction projects,also referred to by jablonski as an employee leasing company.at the time the lawsuit was filed,industrial contracting had never supplied laborers to any company other than lasalle.
lasalle and industrial contracting shared many of the same supervisory personnel during the relevant period.for example,matthew bertrang and dave walasek were listed as employees and supervisors at both companies.dave walasek,a labor superintendent and union member,worked for lasalle until they switched over,when he was notified by wes gerecke,the field operations manager for lasalle,that he would be working for industrial contracting.he testified that his job did not change in any way after he went to work for industrial contracting and that wes gerecke continued to exercise direction over the projects on which he worked.matthew bertrang,a carpenter superintendent and union member,worked for lasalle until the middle of.after lasalle terminated its collective bargaining agreement,bertrang testified that he was given the choice of looking for another job or working for industrial contracting.bertrang,too,said that his job did not change when he moved to industrial contracting and that his direct boss was wes gerecke.gerecke also assigned bertrang to various projects and procured equipment for him.gerecke testified that he supervised industrial contracting employees and monitored their needs for material,equipment,and manpower on a basis.
at the time the dispute arose,industrial contracting and lasalle were housed in the same building and had rental agreements with the same real estate company,owned by steven palermo.lasalle paid a month for the building,and industrial contracting rented an office in the building for a month.before,industrial contracting employees received reimbursement checks from lasalle account and were covered by lasalle workers compensation insurance policy.in addition,lasalle paid for industrial contracting general liability insurance policy and industrial contracting employees continued to use lasalle telephone system and lasalle business cards.until,industrial contracting billed lasalle only for its wages and direct costs in industrial contracting began charging a markup.during the same period,industrial contracting did not own its own equipment,but instead used equipment owned by lasalle,the use of which lasalle did not track.
several lasalle documents in the record refer to industrial contracting employees as lasalle employees.for example,on the gm catering kitchen job,the daily report lists the superintendent and foreman as lasalle employees when they were actually employed by industrial contracting.likewise,on a bid for the gm hines theater project,an industrial contracting employee is listed as a lasalle employee.for the dcx walbridge aldinger project,lasalle was placed on an approved list for bids for which only union signatories were eligible,and a walbridge aldinger project manager
