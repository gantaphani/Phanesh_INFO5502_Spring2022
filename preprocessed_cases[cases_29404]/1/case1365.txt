this case involves a widow claim for survivors benefits under the black lung benefits act blba,as amended by the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca,stat.the ppaca amendments revived section l of the blba.l,which provides that an eligible survivor of a miner who was receiving benefits at the time of his death is automatically entitled to survivors benefits without having to establish that the miner death was due to pneumoconiosis.relying on amended l,the benefits review board brb ruled that the widow,elsie stacy,was entitled to survivors benefits.on appeal,petitioner west virginia coal workers pneumoconiosis fund subjects the ppaca restoration provision to a variety of constitutional and statutory challenges.finding no merit in these attacks,we now affirm.
the black lung benefits program was originally enacted in to provide benefits for miners totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.pneumoconiosis is a chronic lung disease or impairment arising out of such employment.see a.the statute,now known as the black lung benefits act,also provides survivors benefits for miners dependents.
congress has recalibrated the program eligibility requirements for survivors several times since its inception.as initially enacted,the program required a survivor to prove entitlement by showing either that the miner death was caused by pneumoconiosis or that the miner was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of his death.see.in,congress introduced blba section l,l,which provided that i n no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this title at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for benefits,or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner.black lung benefits reform act of,h,stat.under this provision,the eligible survivors of a miner who had been awarded disability benefits on a claim filed during his lifetime were automatically entitled to survivors benefits.
congress significantly tightened the blba eligibility requirements in.for one thing,the amendments added limiting language to a and l that effectively abolished automatic survivors benefits going forward.black lung benefits revenue act of,a,a,stat.the amendments also restricted the availability of benefits for survivors of miners totally disabled by pneumoconiosis by adding similar limiting language to a.id.a,stat.at.moreover,they removed from the blba general purpose section,language indicating that one purpose of the act was to provide benefits to survivors of miners who were totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of their deaths id.a,stat.at.as a result of these amendments,survivors could generally only obtain benefits by proving that pneumoconiosis caused a miner death.finally,the amendments eliminated the year presumption,blba section c,c,a rebuttable presumption benefiting miners who were employed in an underground coal mine for years or more.id.b,stat.at.
in,congress once again recalibrated the blba eligibility requirements by enacting section of the ppaca.see,stat.section a of the act revived the year presumption.further,section b reinstated automatic survivors benefits by removing from l the limiting language that had been added in.the ppaca did not,however,eliminate the corresponding language from a and a,nor did it alter the wording of.finally,section c of the ppaca provides the effective date for sections a and b,restricting their application to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of this act.id.c.
howard stacy mined coal in west virginia for olga coal company from until.shortly after leaving the mines,stacy filed a claim for federal black lung benefits.the department of labor granted the claim,finding that stacy was totally disabled as a result of pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment.petitioner as insurer for olga coal company paid blba benefits to stacy for years until his death in january.
stacy widow,elsie stacy,filed a claim for survivors benefits on february.at the time she filed her claim,the applicable regulations required her to prove that pneumoconiosis caused,contributed to,or hastened her husband death.see.following a formal hearing,the alj ruled that stacy had failed to prove that her husband suffered from pneumoconiosis accordingly,the alj denied the claim.stacy appealed the alj denial to the brb.
on march,while stacy case was on appeal,the ppaca was enacted.shortly after,stacy filed a motion with the brb requesting that her case be remanded for a determination of benefits under the newly amended blba because her husband was receiving benefits at the time of his death pursuant to a final award she had filed her claim after january,and her claim was still pending on march,when the ppaca was enacted.see,c,stat,the amendments made by this section shall apply with respect to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of this act.the director,office of workers compensation programs the director agreed that stacy was entitled to benefits under l,as amended by the ppaca amendments.
petitioner opposed stacy motion,arguing that ppaca section is unconstitutional and that the ppaca reinstatement of automatic survivors benefits does not apply to stacy claim because the operative filing date for determining eligibility is the date the miner claim was filed not the date the survivor claim was filed and because the miner claim here was filed before january,and was not pending on or after march.
on december,the brb vacated the alj decision and remanded stacy claim for the entry of an award of benefits.agreeing with the director,the brb held that the plain language of section c mandates the application of amended l to all claims filed after january,that are pending on or after march,including survivors claims.it also rejected petitioner argument that retroactive application of the ppaca amendments violates the due process and takings clauses,and it declined to hold the case in abeyance pending the resolution of other constitutional challenges to the ppaca.this appeal followed 
we begin with petitioner contention that retroactive application of the automatic survivorship provision to claims filed after january,violates substantive due process because congress did not provide any legitimate purpose for making the legislation retroactive and arbitrarily chose january,as the operative filing date.petitioner br.at.legislative acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life are presumed to be constitutional,however,and the burden is on one complaining of a due process violation to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.usery turner elkhorn mining,d.this is true even where that legislation is applied retroactively.pension benefit guar.gray,d.because retroactive application of amended section l the automatic survivorship provision is hardly arbitrary and irrational,petitioner substantive due process argument is unavailing.
our analysis is guided by usery turner elkhorn mining,d,where the supreme court rejected an argument that the blba,as amended in,violated due process by imposing retroactive liability for benefits on coal mine operators.the usery court held that the imposition of liability for the effects of disabilities bred in the past is justified as a rational measure to spread the costs of the employees disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits of their labor the operators and the coal consumers.id.at.
a substantive due process violation requires that government have acted in an arbitrary manner.id.at.that is hardly the case here.usery made plain that it is not arbitrary and irrational for congress to compel operators who have benefited from a miner labor in his productive years to care for that miner in his declining years and for his spouse or other eligible dependents after his death.indeed,the wholly rational and legitimate purpose for applying amended l retroactively is to compensate the survivors of deceased miners for the effects of disabilities bred in the past.id.at.although congress might well find on its own that the imposition of such costs on mine operators is excessive,the constitution imposes no bar on congress ability to enact remedial and humanitarian legislation such as that challenged here.
relying on usery,the third circuit recently upheld amended l against a due process challenge.see b g constr,owcp,wl cir.the court in b g construction reasoned that 
congress decision automatically to extend benefits to eligible survivors regardless of whether a miner died due to the effects of pneumoconiosis represents a legislative choice to compensate a miner dependents for the suffering they endured due to the miner pneumoconiosis or as a means to provide a miner with peace of mind that his dependents will continue to receive benefits after his death.
id.at.the third circuit continued,we have no reason to override congress implicit determination that the choice was reasonable.id.therefore,the court concluded,based on the supreme court rationale in usery,we can not say that it is irrational or arbitrary for congress to extend survivors benefit s to the dependents of miners who are receiving black lung benefits at the time of their death regardless of the cause of death.id.
similarly,the seventh circuit relied on usery in rejecting a due process challenge to the ppaca retroactive revival of the year presumption,c.see keene consolidation coal,cir.the keene court concluded that the rational purpose for applying the year presumption retroactively is to give miners and their survivors whose claims were recently filed a better shot at obtaining benefits.id.at.while mine operators may believe that congress imposed excessive financial burdens upon them,the proper forum for that argument is legislative,not judicial.simply put,congress is suited to assess programmatic costs and benefits in a way that courts are not.
the absence of arbitrariness is underscored by the measured approach congress adopted in the automatic survivorship amendments.far from arbitrarily ignoring the potential financial burden that it placed on coal operators,congress mitigated the retroactive impact of section by limiting its application to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after march,the date the ppaca was enacted,c,stat.consequently,operators must only pay automatic survivors benefits for claims filed in or after.
although this limitation on l retroactive application works to the benefit of coal mine operators,petitioner argues that congress choice of january,as the cutoff date is arbitrary and that l therefore violates due process.however,congress selection of a precise filing date is a classic exercise uniquely within the competence of the legislative branch.the supreme court has squarely rejected the proposition that such routine exercises are somehow constitutionally infirm.the court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute.this is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily engage in a process of.the task of classifying persons for benefits inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line see ret.bd.fritz,d internal citation omitted.
petitioner also relies on eastern enterprises apfel,d.that case arose out of a series of agreements between the united mine workers of america and coal operators establishing multiemployer health care funds.id.at.eastern was a signatory to every agreement executed between and,but it ceased its coal mining operations in.id.at.almost a decade after eastern had left the industry,the remaining parties agreed that the multiemployer funds would provide lifetime health benefits for retirees and their dependents.id.at.congress subsequently passed the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act,which required certain coal operators including eastern to contribute to a new multiemployer plan providing the promised lifetime coverage.id.at.the supreme court held the coal act unconstitutional as applied to eastern which had never agreed to provide lifetime benefits but no single theory attracted a majority of the court.id.at.
petitioner reliance on eastern is misplaced for two reasons.first,only one justice in that case concluded that eastern due process rights were violated.id.at kennedy,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part see ass of bituminous contractors apfel,justice kennedy concurrence in the judgment is of no help in appellant efforts to cobble together a due process holding from eastern enterprises fragmented parts.justice writing for a plurality of four resolved the case under the takings clause and explicitly declined to address the due process claim,at,and the four dissenting justices concluded that neither the takings clause nor the due process clause had been violated,id.at.
second,both justice plurality opinion and justice kennedy concurrence in the judgment emphasized that eastern liabilities under the coal act in addition to being extremely retroactive and expensive were imposed to rectify a problem that eastern had no part in creating.id.at plurality opinion noting that eastern burden was unrelated to any commitment that eastern made or to any injury it caused id.at kennedy,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part eastern was not responsible for retired miners expectation of lifetime health benefits created by promises and agreements made long after eastern left the coal business.in contrast,amended l imposes liability proportional to the incidence of totally disabling pneumoconiosis among former olga coal company employees,and thus spread s the costs of the employees disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits of their labor.id.at plurality opinion.
petitioner asserts that a t minimum,eastern stands for the proposition that retroactive legislation can fail to meet the requisite constitutional standards and may be struck down as invalid.petitioner reply br.at.however,petitioner offers no criteria or limiting principle it simply argues that congress can go too far.in the absence of some workable and principled line and in light of the substantial differences between the liability imposed on petitioner and that imposed in eastern we can not conclude that retroactive application of l violates substantive due process without inviting invalidation of all retroactive acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life.usery,at.accordingly,we reject the claim that petitioner was deprived of its substantive due process rights.
petitioner also argues that retroactive application of amended l constitutes an unlawful taking of its property under the fifth amendment.we disagree.because amended l merely requires petitioner to pay money and thus does not infringe a specific,identifiable property interest the takings clause does not apply here.
in eastern,five justices rejected the theory that an obligation to pay undifferentiated,fungible money constitutes a taking.justice kennedy,in his opinion concurring in the judgment,disagreed with the plurality conclusion that the coal act imposed an unconstitutional taking of property 
our cases do not support the plurality conclusion that the coal act takes property.the coal act imposes a staggering financial burden on the petitioner,eastern enterprises,but it regulates the former mine owner without regard to property.it does not operate upon or alter an identified property interest,and it is not applicable to or measured by a property interest.the coal act does not appropriate,transfer,or encumber an estate in land,a lien on a particular piece of property,a valuable interest in an intangible,intellectual property,or even a bank account or accrued interest.the law simply imposes an obligation to perform an act,the payment of benefits.
at kennedy,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part.likewise,the four dissenters concluded that the takings clause was not implicated because t he private property upon which the clause traditionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or intellectual property,and the case at hand involved not an interest in physical or intellectual property,but an ordinary liability to pay money id.at breyer,dissenting citations omitted.
in applying this splintered decision to takings challenges,this court has indicated that the conclusion reached by the majority of the justices in eastern that an obligation to pay money can not constitute a taking is more authoritative than the plurality conclusion.as we explained in holland big river minerals,cir,to the extent eastern enterprises worked any change with respect to takings jurisprudence,it is that liabilities like that imposed by the coal act must be considered as a question of substantive due process rather than as a takings question because no identifiable property interest was infringed by the legislation.
other circuits are in accord,and some have held that they are bound by the five justices conclusion that a monetary obligation does not implicate the takings clause.see,swisher int l,schafer,cir t akings analysis is not appropriate for the constitutional evaluation of an obligation imposed by congress merely to pay money.commonwealth edison united states,en banc thus five justices in eastern enterprises agreed that regulatory actions requiring the payment of money are not takings.we agree with the prevailing view that we are obligated to follow the views of that majority.unity real estate hudson,cir w e are bound to follow the vote against the takings claim in eastern.parella ret.bd.of the employees ret,cir upholding a statute against a takings clause challenge because a majority of justices found that the takings clause did not apply under the facts of eastern enterprises,because they concluded that a takings clause issue can arise only after a plaintiff property right has been independently established.
thus,in light of eastern,we hold that the mere imposition of an obligation to pay money does not give rise to a claim under the takings clause.if the takings clause applied to obligations of this sort,then it would seemingly apply to taxes and to all statutes and rules that routinely creat e burdens for some that directly benefit others.at breyer,dissenting citation omitted.given the views of a majority of justices in eastern,we decline to go down that road.because amended l only requires petitioner to pay money,it does not burden an identifiable property interest.accordingly,petitioner claim under the takings clause must fail.
moreover,if we are somehow mistaken and justice plurality opinion reflected the holding of eastern,we would be compelled to reject petitioner takings claim.the eastern plurality explicitly limited its conclusion to the specific circumstances of that case,id.at,and those circumstances are simply not present here.in determining that the coal act application to eastern effected an unconstitutional taking,the plurality emphasized that the act implicates fundamental principles of fairness underlying the takings clause because it singles out eastern to bear a burden unrelated to any commitment that it made or to any injury it caused id.here,in contrast,the liability imposed by amended l is proportional to the occurrence of totally disabling pneumoconiosis among former olga coal company miners.consequently,amended l does not implicate the fundamental principles of fairness on which the eastern plurality based its conclusion.thus,even under the plurality analysis,petitioner takings claim falls short.
in the course of its takings argument,petitioner complains that it could not have foreseen reinstatement of the automatic survivorship provision through an amendment hidden within the universal healthcare bill.petitioner reply br.at.this argument misfires on two grounds.first,given that the black lung benefits scheme has been amended frequently over the years,and that legislation to reinstate automatic survivors benefits has been introduced repeatedly,see petitioner br.at,petitioner had ample notice of its potential liability for automatic survivors benefits.as the supreme court has repeated,those who do business in the regulated field can not object if the legislative scheme is buttressed by subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end.connolly pension benefit guar,d quoting fha v.the darlington,d.
second,and more fundamentally,petitioner argument that the blba amendments only passed due to their inclusion in approximately pages of healthcare legislation,petitioner reply br.at,threatens the separation of powers by inviting courts to scrutinize the process by which a coordinate branch of government goes about its business.likewise,it invites every loser in a legislative fight to contest not only the constitutionality of congress final product,but the way that congress went about enacting it.such a plunge into the depths of capitol hill should be undertaken if at all only in the most extraordinary of circumstances,circumstances that are plainly not presented here.in sum,the difficulties with petitioner view are evident and legion.
we next consider petitioner assertion that the ppaca reinstatement of automatic survivors benefits does not apply to stacy claim because the operative filing date for determining eligibility is the date the miner claim was filed not the date the survivor claim was filed.this court exercises de novo review over questions of law,including statutory interpretation.see westmoreland coal cox,cir.the director,as the administrator of the blba,is entitled to deference in his reasonable interpretation of the act ambiguous provisions.see betty coal,owcp,cir.when as here the director position is being advanced via litigation,it is entitled to respect but only to the extent that it has the power to persuade.christensen harris county,d quoting skidmore swift.
our analysis begins with the text of ppaca section,which contains three subsections.section a restores the year presumption,which had been eliminated by the amendments.see c.section b reinstates automatic survivors benefits by removing the limiting language from l,which now provides that i n no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for benefits,or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner.l.finally,section c provides the effective date for both sections a and b,limiting their applicability to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of this act,stat.
construing these provisions,the director concluded that the plain language of section c mandates its application to all claims filed after january,that are pending on or after march.petitioner disagrees,arguing that because amended l specifically provides that a survivor is not required to file a claim for derivative benefits,it would contravene the plain language of the statute to determine the applicability of this provision based on the date a survivor claim was filed.
we find the director interpretation persuasive,as the definition of claim is not qualified by section c.instead,the plain language of that section requires that amended l apply to all claims filed after january,that are pending on or after march.because congress used the term claims without any qualifying language,and because both miners and their survivors may file claims under the blba,see,a a,the plain language supports the director position that amended l applies to survivors claims that comply with section c effective date requirements.
although amended l states that a survivor is not required to file a new claim for benefits,the conclusion petitioner draws from this language that the operative date for determining eligibility can not be the date the survivor claim was filed simply does not follow.amended l relieves eligible survivors of the obligation of proving that a miner died from pneumoconiosis it does not prohibit survivors from filing a claim.indeed,survivors will need to file some sort of claim in order to notify the office of workers compensation programs of the miner death and the survivor current status.see b g constr,owcp,wl,at cir s urely a widow seeking benefits under amended l must fil
