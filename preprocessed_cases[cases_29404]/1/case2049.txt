fairfield argues that the occupational safety and health review commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously by affirming a citation for violating two occupational safety and health act regulations.we affirm.
there are no disputed facts.digging a trench beside a stretch of in ohio,a highway construction crew of fairfield employees unexpectedly struck a cable.to see if the cable had been pulled loose,one of the workers,floyd wolfe,walked across the three northbound lanes of the interstate to inspect a junction box located at the median.unable to trace the cable,he then attempted to cross the three southbound lanes,was struck by a car,and sustained fatal injuries.
none of the interstate lanes had been closed for the project and there was no flagman to direct or stop traffic,but signs had been placed on the northbound side of the interstate to warn approaching motorists,who were traveling at an average rate of miles per hour,that work was being performed on the northbound shoulder.there were no signs indicating work being done on the median or on the southbound lanes.
after an osha inspection,the secretary of labor cited fairfield for three violations.during trial proceedings,the alj dismissed one of the violations and affirmed the remaining two a violation of b,the employer duty to initiate and maintain safety programs and a violation of b,the employer duty to instruct employees to recognize and avoid unsafe conditions.the alj concluded that a reasonable person could not stand at the side of a six lane interstate highway with traffic traveling between and miles per hour and rationally think they could cross safely on foot,and that the practice of crossing the highway on foot should have been prohibited.fairfield,wl,at,fairfield i.
in a split decision,the occupational safety and health review commission affirmed the violations.secretary of labor fairfield,wl,fairfield ii.although the commission disagreed with the alj conclusion that crossing the highway should have been prohibited,it found that fairfield was required,as a reasonably prudent employer,to address the practice in its safety program and employee training b ased on fairfield actual knowledge of the hazard of crossing an active highway on foot and its failure to specifically address that hazard when it was aware of at least one potentially safer alternative.id.at.
fairfield and the amicus curiae ohio contractors association raise a host of arguments related to due process,legal error,and insufficiency of the evidence however couched,the determinative issue is whether fairfield acted as a reasonably prudent employer in conforming its safety program to any known duty to correct and detect hazards.see northwood stone asphalt,wl,at,cas.bna,aff,cir.if fairfield did all it needed to do,the osha regulations were misapplied.if it did,the citations should be affirmed.

factual findings by the oshrc should be affirmed if substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole support them.eng g and contracting osha,cir.legal conclusions are affirmed unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.citing a of the administrative procedure act.there is no dispute of fact here.the parties differ as to the application of the law to the facts

violation of the osha regulations 
the secretary charged fairfield with violating two osha regulations related to safety programs and training 
b it shall be the responsibility of the employer to initiate and maintain such programs as may be necessary to comply with this part.
b the employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.
the b violation was for failing to establish policies or procedures related to the safe movement of employees across active roadways.fairfield ii,at.the b violation was for failing to instruct its employees exposed to vehicular traffic when crossing a major interstate as to a safe means of access to medians and the opposite side of the road.id.stated simply,one citation was for not making the proper policies,and the other was for not instructing employees on those policies.
neither fairfield nor the amicus dispute the hazardous nature of crossing active roadways.their myriad arguments may be distilled down to two primary contentions the commission erred by applying the regulations in an unconstitutionally arbitrary manner and without reference to industry standards and the commission erred by requiring training about the obvious hazard of crossing an active roadway on foot.
arbitrary application and industry standards 
fairfield argues that a reasonably prudent employer would not have known that the osha regulations required training employees about the hazards of crossing an active roadway.as support,fairfield notes that all three commissioners agreed that the secretary failed to prove either that fairfield fell below industry standards or that the entire highway construction industry was negligent.fairfield argument is unpersuasive in light of the factual finding that it had actual knowledge about the common practice of employees crossing active roadways.
under b,an employer may reasonably be expected to conform its safety program to any known duties and a safety program must include those measures for detecting and correcting hazards which a reasonably prudent employer similarly situated would adopt.northwood stone asphalt,wl,at.under b,an employer must instruct its employees in the recognition and avoidance of those hazards of which a reasonably prudent employer would have been aware.pressure concrete constr,wl,at,cas.bna.
in interpreting such general standards,the court examines whether a reasonable person,examining the generalized standard in light of a particular set of circumstances,can determine what is required,or if the particular employer was actually aware of the existence of a hazard and of a means by which to abate it.r r builders,osahrc lexis,at,cas.bna emphases added.as we held in analyzing the analogous osha general duty clause,t he question of whether a hazard is recognized goes to the knowledge of the employer,or if he lacks actual knowledge,to the standard of knowledge in the objective test.continental oil oshrc,cir emphasis added.
the conjunction or is important.the secretary need not prove a violation of industry standards if she proves actual knowledge of a hazard.see nelson tree services,oshrc,cir holding that employer actual knowledge of potential hazard established recognition under general duty clause,a see,brennan oshrc,cir examining recognized hazards under osha general duty clause,and noting that the term recognized was chosen by congress not to exclude actual knowledge,but rather to reach beyond an employer actual knowledge to include the generally recognized knowledge of the industry as well.
