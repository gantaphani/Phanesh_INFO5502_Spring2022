husband and wife sami and tina berri,citizens of lebanon,claim eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.the immigration judge ij denied their claims,and a member of the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion.the berris appeal the denial of their claims.they also appeal the ij denial of their motion for continuance and the bia affirmance without opinion.for the following reasons,we deny the berris petition for review.we also affirm the ij denial of a continuance and the bia use of its affirmance without opinion procedure.
petitioner sami berri sami is a native and citizen of lebanon.his wife,petitioner tina berri tina,is a native iraqi and a citizen of lebanon.in,because he was having financial problems,sami moved to kuwait in order to work.in sami opened his own business under the sponsorship of a kuwaiti citizen.sami held a work permit which only allowed him to remain for five years,but sami continually renewed the permit.
sami and tina met in kuwait,and married in.during his testimony before the ij,sami first stated that because he was shiite muslim and she was a syrian christian,they could not marry in kuwait,but rather,had to elope to lebanon.however,when later questioned by the ij,sami stated that they were in fact legally married in kuwait.tina testified that she had to feign converting to islam in order to get married.in,tina gave birth to a daughter,saly.
according to the berris,their problems began in kuwait.sami testified that in,while going home from work on his lunch break,kuwaiti security forces arrested him because they believed he was a member of amal a group believed to be working to overthrow the kuwaiti government.for nineteen days,sami was incarcerated in a small room and treated harshly.sami and tina both testified that during this period,he was not allowed to have visitors,although in his asylum application sami stated that tina visited him while he was captive.
after his confinement,sami was transferred to a hospital where he was,and then moved to a detention camp with other individuals for one or two weeks.with the permission of kuwaiti government officials,the berri family was allowed to leave kuwait and return to lebanon.sami testified that he had to leave everything behind in kuwait,although in fact,he already had an apartment in beirut.the berris returned to lebanon while the country was in the midst of a civil war,and their apartment was located on the green line between the east and west beirut,where hezbollah militias maintained checkpoints.
sami testimony regarding the hezbollah militia treatment of him varies.he testified that on the first day he arrived at his apartment,militia members accused him of being an amal member on the basis of his surname sent to spy on them,and demanded that sami give them money to support the militia.sami initially testified that he was never arrested or detained and left beirut after the militia threatened him two times,but later testified that the militia was living in the same building as his family and came to his apartment up to ten times a day.he also testified that the militia had taken him to a detention room where he was threatened,kicked,slapped,pushed and beaten to the point that he bled.
the berris also alleged that the militia was responsible for bombing their car and apartment,although outside of their testimony,they provided no evidence of this happening.with respect to the car,sami testified that it was blown up during the daytime while they were away from the house.however,tina testified that their car was bombed in the middle of the night while the family was sleeping upstairs above the building garage.in order to escape the hezbollah militia,the family sometimes stayed with friends in the suburbs of beirut.tina testified that despite being terrified while in beirut,they were safe at their friends home.
in june,the berris went to the united states in order to escape these threats.using his business contacts in the united states,sami obtained a visa for business.tina entered the united states as a visitor for pleasure.sami reentered lebanon after that for the purpose of transferring money he had in lebanese bank accounts.according to stamps on his passport and his testimony,it appears that he went back to lebanon from the united states on july,then went to syria and reentered lebanon in early august,and then came again to lebanon from the united states in october.his final entry into the united states was in november.during his travels to lebanon,he did not go back to the same area of beirut that he lived in,and was able to enter and leave unharmed.
this case was commenced on november,when the ins issued notices to appear to the berris for remaining in the united states longer than permitted under their visas.after a series of postponements,the case went before the ij on january.the berris had obtained new counsel less than two weeks prior to the hearing date,and filed an untimely motion for continuance.the ij refused to grant a continuance.the ij granted their request for voluntary departure,but denied their claims to asylum,withholding of removal,and for relief under the convention against torture.
on august,a member of the board of immigration appeals affirmed the ij decision without opinion.the berris filed this timely appeal.
we review an ij denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion.gonzales,cir.the berris case has been pending since.due to a combination of their requests and rescheduling for priority cases,their hearing was postponed several times.one to two weeks before their january hearing was scheduled,the berris obtained new counsel to represent them.seven days before the hearing,counsel filed a motion for continuance with the court for the purpose of reviewing the record more thoroughly,speaking with the berris,and retaining an expert witness.the berris concede that their motion was untimely.
even if a motion is untimely,an ij may grant a motion for continuance if good cause is shown.the berris contend that they have shown good cause,and allege that the ij was more concerned with the fact the docket was booked until,and that the ij simply did not want the berris to receive the benefit of further delay.
we agree with the ij that the berris failed to show good cause.despite the fact that this case was pending since and that the hearing date of january was scheduled nearly two years prior,the berris did not obtain new counsel until one to two weeks before the hearing date.this delay in hiring new counsel was also inexcusable given the fact that the new attorney was already representing the berris daughter in a separate proceeding.thus,he undoubtedly was familiar with the facts of their case,reducing the risk of ineffective representation.
therefore,we hold that the ij denial of the berris motion for continuance was not an abuse of discretion.
we next review the berris claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.pursuant to b b,an ij findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.this test is akin to a substantial evidence test.yu ashcroft,cir.we review legal questions involving immigration proceedings de novo.ali ashcroft,cir.when the bia adopts the ij reasoning,we review the ij decision in order to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion can be shown when the ij or board offers no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,or rests on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.denko ins,cir quoting balani ins,cir.
a.the ij credibility determination 
the berris,noting that several years have passed between the events and their trial,contend that despite minor and irrelevant inconsistencies,their core testimony was clear.appellant br.at.we disagree,and find that there are sufficient inconsistencies to support the ij finding.
sami initially said in his application that he was allowed to have visitors while imprisoned in kuwait,yet later said he was not allowed t
