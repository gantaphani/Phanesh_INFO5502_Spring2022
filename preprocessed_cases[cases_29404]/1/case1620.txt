reavley,circuit judge 
when the citizenship and immigration services cis does not grant or deny an application for naturalization days after the required examination of the applicant,the applicant may ask a district court to adjudicate the application.b.does the days begin to run after the application interview or after the background investigation is complete the district court held the latter and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.reviewing the record de novo we reverse and remand.
shabir hussein walji,a ugandan native and canadian citizen,has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since october.walji filed a form application for naturalization with the cis in september.an immigration officer interviewed walji on april,and informed walji that he passed the english language,history,and government proficiency examinations.however,the officer informed walji that action on his application would not proceed until the fbi completed a mandatory national security background check.
when walji received no answer on his application,he began asking questions.the record is replete with correspondence between walji and various officials.two years and a day after his first examination,walji filed this lawsuit and asked the district court to assume jurisdiction over and adjudicate his application for naturalization or compel the defendants to perform their duty to adjudicate his application.
the district court held that the period for approval or denial of the application begins to run only when all of the application requirements are complete and that walji application was not complete because the fbi had not concluded its background investigation.because the period was never triggered,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over walji lawsuit and dismissed it.
an applicant for citizenship must first submit a completed form application for naturalization to the cis.a.after the application is filed,cis shall if not waived conduct an investigation of the applicant that includes,at a minimum,a review of all pertinent records and police department checks.id.the examination and investigation of the applicant is prescribed in once the investigation is completed,each applicant shall appear in person before a cis officer for an examination.a.the examination includes questioning by the officer about matters the applicant has included in the written submissions in addition to tests administered on english literacy and basic knowledge of the history and government of the united states.id.c.the regulations provide that the examination is to be conducted only after the fbi has provided a definitive response that a full criminal background check of the applicant has been completed by confirming the applicant has no administrative or criminal record,the applicant has an administrative or criminal record,or the fbi can not definitively respond because the necessary fingerprints analysis can not be completed on the available information.id.b.a decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization under.id.a.
if the cis does not issue a decision within days of the examination,applicants may seek judicial relief under b,which states 
if there is a failure to make a determination on the application for naturalization before the end of the period after the date on which the examination is conducted under such section,the applicant may apply to the united states district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter.such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter,with appropriate instructions,to the cis to determine the matter.
it is this statute under which walji now seeks judicial intervention.
whether the district court has jurisdiction over walji lawsuit hinges upon the statutory application of the term examination in b.the government argues that the term examination refers to the entire investigative process,including the fbi security check of an applicant,and until that check is completed,the period referenced in the section does not begin to run.walji contends that by examination the statute refers to the interview of an applicant,which in his case occurred two over he initiated this lawsuit.walji thus argues that his time period began to run on the date of the examination by the immigration officer,notwithstanding the fact that the fbi had not completed its background investigation 
numerous district courts have decided the issue,reaching opposite conclusions.one of the earliest district courts to consider the issue adopted the position advanced by the government,concluding that an examination is not a single event,but instead is essentially a process the agency follows to gather information concerning the applicant,which includes the fbi security check.danilov aguirre,d,emphasis in original.therefore,the danilov court held,the examination can not be considered complete until after the fbi concludes its background investigation of an applicant and,as a consequence,courts lack subject matter jurisdiction before the lapse of days after the entire process has been completed.id.adopting the district court analysis in danilov,a handful of district courts have also held that the period is not triggered until all aspects of the application process are completed,including the fbi background check 
however,the majority of courts addressing this issue have concluded that the term examination in b refers to a discrete agency initial interview of the that the period begins to run as of the date that interview is concluded generally,these courts reject the danilov court interpretation of b for three reasons the plain language of b,the clear inferences to be drawn from the total statutory and regulatory scheme,and the stated legislative purpose of b.
first,the statute language that the period begins to run after the date on which the examination is conducted,b,contemplates that the examination occurs on a particular,identifiable date,d at.thus,the plain language suggests that the examination is a distinct,single date on which the interview the period,and not an ongoing fluid process encompassing the interview as well as the background investigation.id.stating that a process does not occur on one particular and identifiable date.further,the term conducted would have to be construed to mean completed or concluded to reach the conclusion that the examination required by the statute is considered the process of examination.id.refusing to consider that congress was so sloppy in its lexicography.if the statute is intended to set a certain date for the service to decide,it would have to be the time of the examination.of course,the service need not conduct the examination until after the investigation is concluded.
second,the statutory scheme contemplates a distinction between the investigation and the examination,the latter being a discrete rather than a continuous event.the organization of the ina section preceding indicates that the investigative process is separate from the examination.see entitled investigation of applicants examination of applications,with subsection a referencing what is required for the cis investigation of the applicant and subsection b separately addressing the procedural requirements for the examination of the applicant.section further differentiates between the two procedures.whereas an examination must be conducted by an employee of cis designated by the attorney general,an investigation may be conducted by an employee of cis or an employee of the united states the attorney general designates.id.
cis implementing regulations also indicate that the agency itself interprets the investigation as a separate and distinct precedent to the examination,not a s
