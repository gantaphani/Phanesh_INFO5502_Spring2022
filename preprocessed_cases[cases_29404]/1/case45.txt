the telecommunications act of requires incumbent local exchange carriers lecs,providers of local telephone service to share their physical networks with competitive lecs at rates in two ways relevant here.first,c requires an incumbent lec to lease on an unbundled basis a la carte network elements specified by the federal communications commission fcc to allow a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.in identifying those elements,the fcc must consider whether access is necessary and whether failing to provide it would impair the competitor provision of service.d.second,c mandates that incumbent lecs provide interconnection between their networks and competitive lecs to ensure that a competitor customers can call the incumbent customers,and vice versa.the interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.
in,the fcc issued its triennial review order deciding,contrary to previous orders,that c did not require an incumbent lec to provide a competitive lec with unbundled access to existing entrance facilities transmission facilities typically wires or cables that connect the two lecs networks because such facilities are not network elements at all.the fcc noted,however,that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and backhauling,and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent lecs c obligation to provide for interconnection.thus,the practical effect of the order was only that incumbent lecs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.
in,following circuit review,the fcc issued its triennial review remand order.the fcc retreated from the view that entrance facilities are not network elements,but adhered to its previous position that unbundled access to such facilities need not be provided under c.treating entrance facilities as network elements,the fcc concluded that competitive lecs are not impaired without access to such facilities.the fcc again emphasized that competitive lecs c right to obtain interconnection had not been altered.
in the remand order wake,respondent notified competitive lecs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at rates for either backhauling or interconnection,but would instead charge higher rates.competitive lecs complained to the michigan public service commission that was unlawfully abrogating their c right to interconnection.the michigan public service commission agreed and ordered to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at rates.challenged the ruling.relying on the remand order,the federal district court ruled in favor.the sixth circuit affirmed,declining to defer to the fcc argument that the order did not change incumbent lecs interconnection obligations,including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.
held the fcc has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations,that to satisfy its duty under c,an incumbent lec must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnection and this court defers to the fcc views.
a no statute or regulation squarely addresses the question.
b absent an unambiguous statute or regulation,the court turns to the fcc interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief.see,chase bank usa,mccoy.the fcc proffers a argument why its regulations require to provide access at rates to existing entrance facilities for interconnection purposes.
interpreting cfr a,the fcc first contends that an incumbent lec must lease technically feasible facilities for interconnection.
the fcc contends,second,that existing entrance facilities are part of an incumbent lec network,cfr e,and therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent lec must lease for interconnection,if technically feasible.
third,says the fcc,it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases a point does not dispute.
c contrary to arguments,the fcc interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.auer robbins.first,it is perfectly sensible to read the fcc regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent lecs networks.second,the fcc views do not conflict with cfr definition of interconnection as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic,but not the transport and termination of traffic.
d nor is there any other reason to suspect that the fcc does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.auer,supra,at.incorrectly suggests that the fcc is attempting to require under c what courts have prevented it from requiring under c and what the fcc itself said was not required in the remand order.

on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
in these cases,we consider whether an incumbent provider of local telephone service must make certain transmission facilities available to competitors at rates.the federal communications commission fcc or commission as amicus contends that its regulations require the incumbent provider to do so if the facilities are to be used for interconnection to link the incumbent provider telephone network with the competitor network for the mutual exchange of traffic.we defer to the commission views and reverse the judgment below.
the telecommunications act of act,stat,imposed a number of duties on incumbent providers of local telephone service in order to facilitate market entry by competitors.iowa utilities.the incumbent local carriers lecs owned the local exchange networks the physical equipment necessary to receive,properly route,and deliver phone calls among customers.verizon communications fcc.before the act,a new,competitive lec could not compete with an incumbent carrier without basically replicating the incumbent entire existing network.ibid.
the act addressed that barrier to market entry by requiring incumbent lecs to share their networks with competitive lecs in several ways,two of which are relevant here.first,c requires incumbent lecs to lease on an unbundled basis a la carte network elements specified by the commission.this makes it easier for a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.in identifying which network elements must be available for unbundled lease under c,the commission is required to consider whether access is necessary and whether failing to provide access would impair a competitor provision of service.d.second,c mandates that incumbent lecs provide interconnection between their networks and competitive lecs facilities.this ensures that customers on a competitor network can call customers on the incumbent network,and vice versa.the interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.it is undisputed that both network elements and interconnection must be provided at rates.see d brief for petitioner in,brief for petitioners in,brief for respondent.
these cases concern incumbent lecs obligation to share existing entrance facilities with competitive lecs.entrance facilities are the transmission facilities typically wires or cables that connect competitive lecs networks with incumbent lecs networks.the fcc recently adopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are not among the network elements that c requires incumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis at rates.see cfr e i.the commission noted,however,that it d id not alter the right of competitive lecs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to section c.in re unbundled access to network elements,fcc rcd,triennial review remand order.
the specific issue here is whether respondent,michigan bell telephone company michigan,must lease existing entrance facilities to competitive lecs at rates.the fcc interprets its regulations to require to do so for the purpose of interconnection.we begin by reviewing the commission recent actions regarding entrance facilities and then explain the particular dispute that is before us today.
in,the fcc decided,contrary to its previous orders,that incumbent lecs were not obligated to provide unbundled access to entrance facilities under c.in re review of section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,fcc rcd,triennial review order.explaining that its previous approach had been misguided and overly broad,the commission concluded that entrance facilities were not subject to the unbundling requirement because they are not network elements at all.see,entrance facilities exist outside the incumbent lec local network the commission therefore did not conduct an impairment analysis.
the fcc emphasized,however,the limits of this ruling.entrance facilities are used for two purposes interconnection and backhauling it expressly d id not alter an incumbent lec obligation under c to provide facilities in order to interconnect with the incumbent lec network.brackets omitted.thus,the commission specified that c did not require any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities,it determined in practical effect only that incumbent lecs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for the purpose of backhauling traffic.
on direct review,the circuit questioned the commission determination that entrance facilities are not network elements under c,but found the agency rulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the commission for further consideration.see united states telecom fcc,cert.denied.the court noted that if entrance facilities were in fact network elements,then an analysis of impairment would presumably follow.at.
in,the commission responded.see triennial review remand order.the commission from its view that entrance facilities are not network elements but adhered to its previous position that unbundled access to them need not be provided under c.treating entrance facilities as network elements,the commission concluded that competitive lecs are not impaired without access to them.ibid.the commission again emphasized that it d id not alter the right of competitive lecs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to section c.
in the wake of the triennial review remand order,notified competitive lecs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at rates for either backhauling or interconnection,but would instead charge higher rates.competitive lecs complained to the michigan public service commission psc that was unlawfully abrogating their right to interconnection under c.the michigan psc agreed with the competitive lecs and ordered to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at rates.
challenged the michigan psc ruling in the district court,which,relying on the triennial review remand order,ruled in favor.the michigan psc and several competitive lecs,including petitioner talk america,appealed.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed over a dissent.michigan bell telephone covad communications.at the court invitation,the fcc filed a brief as amicus curiae,arguing that the triennial review remand order did not change incumbent lecs interconnection obligations,including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.the sixth circuit declined to defer to the fcc views,at,and also expressly disagreed with the seventh and eighth circuits,at discussing illinois bell.box,and southwestern bell,missouri pub.serv.comm n,
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
petitioners contend that must lease its existing entrance facilities for interconnection at rates.we agree.
no statute or regulation squarely addresses whether an incumbent lec must provide access to entrance facilities at rates as part of its interconnection duty under c.according to the statute,each incumbent lec has 
the duty to provide,for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,interconnection with the local exchange carrier network a for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access b at any technically feasible point within the carrier network c that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary,affiliate,or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection and d on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section of this title.
nothing in that language expressly addresses entrance facilities.nor does any regulation do so.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.
contends that the statute makes clear that an incumbent lec need not provide access to any facilities much less entrance facilities to provide interconnection.the company points out that c does not mention incumbent lecs facilities,but rather mandates only that incumbent lecs provide interconnection for the facilities and equipment of any competing carrier.in contrast,notes,c requires that incumbent lecs provide unbundled access to their network elements.
we do not find the statute so clear.although c does not expressly require that incumbent lecs lease facilities to provide interconnection,it also does not expressly excuse them from doing so.the statute says nothing about what an incumbent lec must do to provide interconnection.c.t he facilities and equipment of any competing carrier identifies the equipment that an incumbent lec must allow to interconnect,but it does not specify what the incumbent lec must do to make the interconnection possible.ibid.
in the absence of any unambiguous statute or regulation,we turn to the fcc interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief.see,chase bank usa,mccoy,slip,at.as we reaffirmed earlier this term,we defer to an agency interpretation of its regulations,even in a legal brief,unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s or there is any other reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.at,slip,at,quoting auer robbins.
the commission contends that its regulations require to provide access at rates to its existing entrance facilities for the purpose of interconnection.the commission interpretation proceeds in three steps.first,an incumbent lec must lease technically feasible facilities for interconnection.second,entrance facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent must make available for interconnection,if technically feasible.third,it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases.
the commission first contends that an incumbent lec must lease,at rates,any requested facilities for obtaining interconnection with the incumbent lec network,unless it is technically infeasible to do so.section c mandates that an incumbent lec provide interconnection,at rates,at any technically feasible point within the carrier network.the fcc has long construed c to require incumbent lecs to provide,at rates,any technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection at a particular point.cfr a.
the requirement in a to provide a method of obtaining interconnection,the commission argues,encompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a competing lec.when the commission originally promulgated a,it explained that incumbent lecs would be required to adapt their facilities to interconnection and to accept the novel use of,and modification to,their network facilities.in re implementation of local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,local competition order.since then,as and its amici concede,incumbent lecs have commonly leased certain facilities at prices to accommodate interconnection.see brief for respondent brief for united states telecom association et as amici curiae.
as additional support for its assertion that incumbent lecs are obligated to lease facilities,the fcc highlights the examples in b of t echnically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection,which include m eet point interconnection arrangements.in a arrangement,an incumbent lec accommodat es interconnection by building a transmission facility from its network to a designated point,where it connects with the competitor corresponding transmission facility.local competition order.compared to that requirement,the commission argues,the obligation to lease existing facilities for interconnection is quite modest.
next,the commission contends that existing entrance facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent lec must lease for interconnection.according to the fcc,the triennial review remand order adopted a regulatory that reestablished that entrance facilities are part of an incumbent lec network.see see also cfr e.the end of every entrance facility is therefore a point within an incumbent carrier network at which a competing lec could request interconnection,c,and each entrance facility potentially provides a technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection,cfr a.
finally,the fcc contends that providing access to the entrance facilities here for interconnection purposes is technically feasible.under the commission regulations,an incumbent lec bears the burden of showing that a requested method or point of interconnection is technically infeasible.see cfr e,d see also d,c previously successful is substantial evidence of technical feasibility.does not dispute technical feasibility here 
the fcc interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.auer,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.first,we disagree with argument that entrance facilities are not a part of incumbent lecs networks.indeed,the commission view on this question is more than reasonable it is certainly not plainly erroneous.the triennial review remand order responded to the circuit decision questioning the commission earlier finding that entrance facilities are not network elements.it revised the definition of dedicated transport a type of network element to include entrance facilities.triennial review remand order see cfr e defining dedicated transport to include incumbent lec transmission facilities between wire centers or switches owned by incumbent lecs and switches owned by competing carriers given that revised definition,it is perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are a part of incumbent lecs networks.
second,we are not persuaded by argument that the commission views conflict with the definition of interconnection in.that regulation provides interconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.this term does not include the transport and termination of traffic.focuses on the definition exclusion of transport and termination of traffic.an entrance facility is a transport facility,argues,and it makes no sense to require an incumbent lec to furnish a transport facility for interconnection when the definition of interconnection expressly excludes transport.
we think reads too much into the exclusion of transport.the regulation can not possibly mean that no transport can occur across an interconnection facility,as that would directly conflict with the statutory language.see c requiring interconnection for the transmission and routing of local telephone exchange service the very reason for interconnection is the mutual exchange of traffic.cfr see also competitive telecommunications fcc,t he transmission and routing of telephone exchange service is what the interconnection,the physical link,would be used for internal quotation marks omitted.
the better reading of the regulation is that it merely reflects that the transport and termination of traffic is subject to different regulatory treatment than interconnection.compensation for transport and termination that is,for delivering local telephone calls placed by another carrier customer is governed by separate provisions and regulations.see b,d cfr.the commission explains that a competitive lec typically pays one fee for interconnection just for having the link and then an additional fee for the transport and termination of telephone calls.tr.of oral arg.see also brief for united states as amicus curiae.entrance facilities,at least when used for the mutual exchange of traffic,seem to us to fall comfortably within the definition of interconnection.see,at sutton,dissenting noting that entrance facilities are designed for the very purpose of linking two carriers networks internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,the commission interpretation of its regulations is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulatory text.contrary to assertion,there is no danger that deferring to the commission would effectively permit the agency,under the guise of interpreting a regulation,to create de facto a new regulation.christensen harris county.
nor is there any other reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.auer,at.we are not faced with a rationalization by commission counsel of agency action that is under judicial review.see see also burlington truck lines,united states,the courts may not accept appellate counsel post hoc rationalizations for agency action sec chenery,requires that an agency discretionary order be upheld,if at all,on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself and although the fcc concedes that it is advancing a novel interpretation of its longstanding interconnection regulations,novelty alone is not a reason to refuse deference.the commission that the issue in these cases did not arise until recently when it initially eliminated unbundled access to entrance facilities in the triennial review order.until then,the commission says,a competitive lec typically would elect to lease a entrance facility under c since entrance facilities leased under c could be used for any purpose,both interconnection and backhauling but entrance facilities leased under c can be used only for interconnection.we see no reason to doubt this explanation.
suggests that the commission is attempting to require under c what courts have prevented it from requiring under c and what the commission itself said was not required in the triennial review remand order.tr.of oral arg.t his is a rear guard effort to preserve pricing for things that the c ommission has said should no longer be available at such pricing we do not think that is correct.
to begin with,accusation does not square with the regulatory history.the commission was not compelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled entrance facilities at rates.
it is true that,prior to the triennial review orders,the commission twice unsuccessfully attempted to impose sweeping unbundling requirements on incumbent lecs.see local competition order in re implementation of local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,see also cfr.each time,the commission efforts were rejected for taking an unreasonably broad view of impair ment under d.see iowa utilities,at united states telecom fcc,cert.denied.in the triennial review order,the commission once again reinterpreted the impair standard and revised the list of network elements that incumbents must provide unbundled to competitors.
the commission initial decision to eliminate the obligation to unbundle entrance facilities,however,was not a result of the narrower view of impairment mandated by this court and the circuit.instead,the commission determined that entrance facilities need not be provided on an unbundled basis under c on the novel ground that they are not network elements at all something no court had ever suggested.
moreover,since its initial decision to eliminate the unbundling obligation for entrance facilities,the commission has been committed to that position.when the circuit questioned the commission finding that entrance facilities are not network elements,the commission responded by observing that the court did not reject our conclus
