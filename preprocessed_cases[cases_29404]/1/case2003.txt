this case arises from a longstanding dispute between the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and air brake systems,air brake.air brake manufactures a antilock brake system for trucks and trailers,which purports to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standard,a nhtsa regulation concerning antilock brakes.when an air brake customer asked nhtsa whether a vehicle with air brake brake only antilock brake system on the comply with standard,nhtsa acting chief counsel issued two opinion letters stating that the brake system would not satisfy the standard.nhtsa posted the letters on its website with negative consequences for air brake business,but it did not begin the statutory process for determining whether vehicles carrying such brakes were noncompliant or the statutory process for ordering a recall of vehicles with these brakes.
soon after nhtsa posted the first of these letters on its website,air brake filed this action challenging the chief counsel conclusion as well as the chief counsel authority to issue the letter.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nhtsa,reasoning that interpretive letters issued by nhtsa acting chief counsel do not constitute final agency action subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act.we agree that the tentative conclusions reached in the letters,which are based in part on air brake representations about its antilock brake system and which nhtsa acknowledges are neither binding on the industry nor entitled to any administrative deference,do not constitute final agency action regarding the meaning of standard or air brake compliance with that standard.at the same time,however,the letters do reflect final agency action with respect to the distinct question whether the chief counsel has authority to issue them,because the practice does not lend itself to further review at the agency level and has legal consequences.yet because the practice of permitting nhtsa chief counsel to issue advisory opinions in response to inquiries from the public does not exceed the chief counsel authority and indeed has much to recommend it,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of the government.
when congress enacted the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of,stat,et,it directed the secretary of transportation to prescribe motor vehicle safety standards.the secretary in turn delegated this task to nhtsa.the first federal motor vehicle safety standard was promulgated in and nhtsa has promulgated numerous other standards since then,including standard codified at,which covers the requirements for air brake systems used in heavy vehicles.
in,nhtsa amended standard to require that trucks,buses and trailers equipped with air brakes have an antilock brake system.see standard,air brake systems.the standard defines antilock brake system as 
a portion of a service brake system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip during braking by 
sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels 
transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular rotation to one or more controlling devices which interpret those signals and generate responsive controlling output signals and 
transmitting those controlling signals to one or more modulators which adjust brake actuating forces in response to those signals.
in accordance with this standard,antilock brakes also must have an electrical circuit capable of signaling a malfunction in the brakes through an external warning light.see id.nhtsa enacted the amendment amid concerns that only electronic braking systems would satisfy this provision.see standard.at.
one company concerned about the impact of the amended standard was air brake systems,which manufactures braking systems installed on trucks and trailers.after devoting ten years to developing a pneumatic antilock brake system for trucks and trailers,air brake patented its new brake in.the is a brake or,in the words of air brake,is a antilock braking system which is a combination differential pressure release valve that is installed at each braking axle into the service air lines centered between the brake chambers.at.air brake initially sold its antilock brakes on the retrofit for used trucks and trailers which is not subject to standard,but not on the market for new trucks and trailers which is subject to standard.
after nhtsa amended standard,william washington,the current president of air brake,challenged the validity of the rule in federal court.among other contentions,he claimed that the standard improperly sought to exclude antilock brakes from the market and improperly imposed design specifications rather than performance criteria,all in violation of nhtsa regulatory authority.the tenth circuit rejected washington challenge.see washington dep t of,cir.in doing so,the court noted that a manufacturer that has devised a new means of obtaining the same or better safety performance may seek an exemption from a safety standard requirements,and that no special exemption would be necessary for a new device meeting an existing standard if the standard is purely performative,as opposed to one that requires a particular type of equipment.id.at.air brake seized upon this language and at some point began marketing its product as compliant with standard,despite the acknowledged absence of a warning light.at warning light excluded pursuant to tenth circuit court of appeals case.air brake represented in its manufacturer certification that t he exclusion of a warning light in its pneumatic antilock brake system is permissible pursuant to washington dot.at.
in january,air brake tried to sell the to mac trailer manufacturing,a manufacturer of vehicles subject to standard.because air brake product was the only antilock brake system on the market,mac trailer asked nhtsa orally whether the device met the requirements of standard.nhtsa responded also orally that it did not.
a month later,william washington and consultants hired by air brake met with nhtsa to explain the operation and features of the,in an apparent attempt to persuade nhtsa that the braking system complied with the agency safety standards.during the meeting,nhtsa requested that certain tests be performed on the product and that air brake submit the test data to the agency.air brake scheduled another meeting with nhtsa for this purpose on june.
on june,eight days before the scheduled meeting,nhtsa acting chief counsel,john womack,sent a letter to mac trailer in response to its earlier oral inquiry and a subsequent written inquiry as to whether the satisfied standard.in the letter,the chief counsel noted that nhtsa does not equipment,and that the applicable statutes make the vehicle manufacturer,not the parts manufacturer,responsible for ensuring compliance with nhtsa safety standards.nonetheless,based on nhtsa review of air brake promotional materials and the principles involved in the braking system operation,he noted that the installation of the alone would not allow a vehicle to meet standard antilock brake system requirement.at.the chief counsel expressed specific concern that the does not seem to have any means of automatically controlling wheel slip during braking by sensing,analyzing,and modulating the rate of angular rotation of the wheel,and the also appears to lack any provision for illuminating a warning light providing notification of an antilock brake system malfunction.at.nhtsa posted the letter on its website.
air brake met with nhtsa as planned on june.at the meeting nhtsa recommended that air brake perform certain tests on the brakes.air brake conducted the tests and forwarded the results to nhtsa.at the same time,it asked nhtsa to post a letter from air brake counsel on its website so that air brake views about and specifically about the brake system compliance with standard could be seen by visitors to nhtsa website alongside the contrary opinion of nhtsa chief counsel.nhtsa never posted the letter.
on august,air brake sued secretary of transportation norman mineta and nhtsa collectively,nhtsa,challenging the agency determination that the did not comply with standard and seeking to enjoin nhtsa from continuing to publish the offending letter on its website.the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan denied air brake a temporary restraining order,but took air brake motion for a preliminary injunction under consideration and ordered the parties to take the steps necessary for nhtsa to complete its review of air brake product.as a culmination of these steps and as requested by the district court,nhtsa acting chief counsel issued a letter on december,to air brake containing his interpretation and application of standard to air brake pneumatic brake system.the letter superceded the june letter and essentially reaffirmed the chief counsel conclusion that the braking system would not by itself bring a vehicle into compliance with standard.
nhtsa then moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on the ground that neither the june letter nor the december letter issued by the chief counsel constituted final agency action.because the letters contain the opinion of nhtsa acting chief subordinate the plaintiff product alone will not permit a vehicle to comply with standard,the court reasoned that they represent the position the secretary is likely to take if and when proceedings are initiated,not the final action by the secretary.d at quotation and citation omitted.more importantly,the court continued,the letters do not determine rights or obligations or cause legal consequences to flow because t he letters are advisory in nature and have no legal effect.id.the district court also held that there is ample authority permitting nhtsa response to mac trailer inquiry and issuance of the letters was not beyond the authority of the agency.id.at.air brake appealed the judgment,which we now review de novo.see.peat epa,cir.
air brake raises two essential challenges.it first challenges the merits of t he findings and conclusions contained in the chief counsel letter,including the chief counsel opinion that the does not comply with standard.compl.it then challenges the chief counsel authority to issue opinions on whether a product complies with nhtsa safety standards without following the recall process see set forth in the safety act.compl.
before reaching the merits of either challenge,we must consider whether the federal courts have jurisdiction over them under the right to review created by of the administrative procedure act apa,stat,as amended,et.in accordance with that provision,federal courts may review two types of agency actions agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.in contrast,a preliminary,procedural,or intermediate agency action or ruling is not directly reviewable and may be examined by a federal court only through review of the final agency action itself.id.because no specific statute creates a right to review the agency actions in this case,as the parties agree,the jurisdictional question here is one of statutory interpretation do the letters constitute final agency action for which no other adequate judicial remedy exists see abbs sullivan,cir posner,questions of jurisdiction to review the actions of administrative agencies usually are discussed under such murky rubrics as ripeness,prematurity,exhaustion,finality,and standing.however,we can frame the issue in this case and perhaps not only this case,but generally,though that remains to be seen as a straightforward question of statutory interpretation.
as a general matter,the supreme court has instructed,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process and must not be of a tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,d quotations and citations omitted see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d stating that to be final under bennett,agency action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process,and must either determine rights or obligations or occasion legal consequences quotations omitted.the finality inquiry,we are told,is a flexible and pragmatic one.abbott labs.gardner,d.
air brake claims that we have jurisdiction to review three distinct actions by the agency the chief counsel statements in each letter that air brake product fails to satisfy the general requirements of standard the chief counsel legal interpretation in each letter of standard requirement and the authority of the chief counsel to issue the letters in the first place.as each of these issues presents a distinct finality question,we examine them separately.
the essential content of each letter,explaining why air brake product generally does not comply with standard,is not final agency action under of the apa.first and foremost,a n agency action is not final if it is tentative in nature.franklin massachusetts,d quoting abbott,at.see bennett,at.a tentative action is not final.and agency letters based on hypothetical facts or facts submitted to the agency,as opposed to made by the agency,are classically for this reason.see res.def.council faa,holding that an opinion letter issued by the faa based on a hypothetical factual situation presented to the agency by the parties was not appropriate for review ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir holding that a letter from the general counsel of the department of health and human services was not final where facts remained to be developed.
both letters suffer from this defect.by their terms,they state tentative conclusions based on limited information presented to the agency.for example,the june letter states that it represents our opinion based on the facts presented in mac trailer letter,the attachments provided with mac trailer letter and agency review of other data obtained from air brake.at.later,the letter stresses that nhtsa view about the is based on a review of the promotional materials describing the device and the principles involved in its operation.at see at the appears to lack one or more features that an abs must have to meet standard.based on the literature provided to us,the does not seem to have any means of automatically controlling wheel slip during braking by sensing,analyzing,and modulating the rate of angular rotation of a wheel or wheels.emphasis added id.in addition,the also appears to lack any provision for illuminating a warning light providing notification of an abs malfunction.emphasis added.the december letter,too,relies on materials received or obtained since june,as well as those that we had previously obtained,at,and disclaims any intent to adjudicate factual issues.see at i t is not the function of an interpretive letter to adjudicate factual issues.in this respect,the second letter also expresses an opinion based on t he test data and information provided by air brake,not based upon any factfinding by the agency.at.
by itself,the conditional nature of the chief counsel on the untested factual submissions of the that it is and.but the regulatory context in which the issue arises makes that conclusion all the more appropriate.in the world of vehicle safety requirements,conclusions about whether a product complies with nhtsa regulations generally come at the end of a recall proceeding,not before the process for initiating a recall has begun.as the applicable statutes explain,the secretary generally must follow a process for reaching a conclusion of that has the force of law.the secretary must make an initial decision that a product does not comply.see a requiring the secretary to notify a manufacturer immediately after making an initial decision that a vehicle or equipment does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard.after that,the secretary follows a specific process for making a final decision about compliance.see id.b describing the process for making a final decision that a motor vehicle or replacement equipment does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard.then,if appropriate,the secretary may order manufacturers to remedy the problem through notice to the vehicle owners and a recall or other remedy.see id.b requiring the secretary,upon making a final decision,to order the manufacturer to notify owners and remedy the noncompliance.this systematic method for making a determination whether a given product satisfies the agency safety regulations is a far cry from the informal answers provided by nhtsa chief counsel to questions from air brake potential customer.
besides being conditional and tentative and besides arising outside of the customary setting for determining safety compliance,the main body of each letter contains a related flaw an agency action is not final if it is only the ruling of a subordinate official.franklin,at.quoting abbott,at.while nhtsa chief counsel has considerable authority over purely legal interpretations of pertinent statutes and regulations,the secretary has not delegated authority to the chief counsel to make final determinations of compliance with nhtsa safety standards.compare d the authority to i ssue authoritative interpretations of the statutes administered by nhtsa and the regulations issued by the agency is delegated to the chief counsel,with id.a the authority to m ake final decisions concerning alleged defects and noncompliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards is reserved to the administrator.see br.at t he chief counsel is a subordinate agency official who may interpret the laws and regulations but may not initiate recalls or determine that a motor vehicle fails to comply with an applicable safety standard.for this reason as well,the letters do not constitute final agency action with respect to their advice about whether air brake product complies with standard.
a different analysis,but a similar conclusion,applies to the legal interpretation in each letter of standard requirement.while the letters in the main address issues based upon the materials presented to the agency by the parties requesting the opinion,they also appear to contain a statement of general applicability designed to interpret the,that standard requires all antilock brake systems,even ones,to include a warning light.
one can not lightly dismiss this legal interpretation of standard as either tentative or as the view of a subordinate agency official.there is nothing provisional about this interpretation of the standard either it requires a warning light or it does not.and there is nothing hypothetical or intricately fact dependent about the inquiry either air brake product has these features or it does not.neither are these the views of a subordinate official,at least when it comes to this interpretation.the secretary of transportation has delegated to nhtsa chief counsel responsibility to i ssue authoritative interpretations of the statutes administered by nhtsa and the regulations,safety standards issued by the agency.d.so unlike his general take on compliance,the chief counsel views about purely legal,for example,standard require a warning light may constitute the final word within the agency.bolstering the point,nhtsa website states that the chief counsel legal interpretation letters represent the definitive view of the agency on the question addressed and may be relied upon.in view of the secretary delegation of authority to the chief counsel over legal issues and in view of nhtsa public use of that authority through its website,an interpretive letter like this one or at least partially like this one may indeed represent the consummation of the agency process as to purely legal questions.
to say that a legal interpretation is final because it is not subject to further review within the agency,however,is not to say that it is final in the sense that of the apa requires it to be.if the interpretation nonetheless does not determine rights or obligations or does not have legal consequences,it remains for purposes of review under the apa.see bennett,at.neither measure of finality is availing to air brake here.an agency determination of rights or obligations generally stems from an agency action that is directly binding on the party seeking review,such as an administrative adjudication like a recall proceeding or legislative rulemaking,both of which did not happen here.
the harder question is whether the letters,while not directly binding on air brake,occasion sufficient legal consequences to make them reviewable.one reliable indicator that an agency interpretation still has the requisite legal consequence,we have held,is whether the agency may claim chevron deference for it.see franklin fed.sav.bank,office of thrift supervision,cir when an agency has acted so definitively that its actions are defended based on chevron,we believe that its action should be treated as final.id.as a general rule,final agency action includes interpretive decisions that crystalize or modify private legal rights.quoting ftc standard oil of,d stevens,concurring see also isle royale boaters ass norton,cir noting that letters from the park service to park visitors containing an interpretation of the statute the park service was charged with administering did not constitute final rulings of the agency because they would be entitled only to respect by the courts,not chevron deference chevron natural res.def.council,d holding that a court must uphold an agency reasonable interpretation of a statute that it administers unless the intent of congress is clear as to the precise question at issue or the agency interpretation is unreasonable.
decisions from other courts also have looked to the eligibility for administrative deference as a sufficient legal consequence for finality purposes.see epa,epa interpretation of fifra has a significant legal effect on.it is well settled that the authoritative interpretation of an executive official has the legal consequence,if it is reasonable and not inconsistent with ascertainable legislative intent,of commanding deference from a court quotation omitted automatic laundry cleaning council shultz,when a general,interpretative ruling in the form of a letter signed by the head of an agency has been crystallized following reflective examination in the course of the agency interpretative process,and is accordingly entitled to deference not only as a matter of fact from staff and citizenry expected to conform but also a matter of law from a court reviewing the question,there coexist both multiple signposts of authoritative determination,finality and ripeness.
this treatment of chevron deference as a relevant legal consequence remains sound even though the test for obtaining chevron deference has changed in recent years.in united states mead corporation,d,the court held that only those administrative interpretations that congress and the agency intend to have the force of law,as opposed to those merely characterized as authoritative,qualify for chevron deference.see id.at.christensen harris county,d interpretations such as those in opinion interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.under either test,the critical point is that federal courts must accept reasonable agency interpretations of an ambiguous statute even if they would have construed the statute differently had they been given the chance in the first instance.because it is the binding effect of agency interpretations eligible for chevron deference that establishes legal consequences will flow from them,bennett,at.quotation omitted,mead changes to the test for determining when chevron applies whether large or small do not alter the relevance of this inquiry.
if the supreme court recent decisions concerning administrative deference signal any change,it is that less agency action will qualify for chevron deference and less agency action accordingly may qualify for review.cases will arise involving informal agency actions that once received,but no longer receive,chevron deference in the aftermath of mead and christensen.see mead,at.i nterpretive rules enjoy no chevron status as a class.compare johnson city med.ctr.united states,cir t his court accords deference to revenue ruling under the standard set forth in chevron,with,comm r,cir in light of the supreme court decisions in christensen and mead,we conclude that revenue ruling should not be accorded chevron deference.compare automatic laundry,at holding that an opinion letter by the administrator of the wage and hour division of the department of labor interpreting the fair labor standards act was final agency action in part because it would be entitled to deference as a matter of law from a court reviewing the question,with christensen,at.holding that an opinion letter by the administrator of the wage and hour division of the department of labor interpreting the fair labor standards act was not entitled to deference as a matter of law,but only respect to the extent that it has the power to persuade.correspondingly,cases will now arise involving agency action that we once might have considered final for purposes as a result of chevron legal effect but that we will no longer consider final because chevron does not apply.but this is a small price to pay for adhering to the principle that justifies factoring eligibility for deference into eligibility for review in the first the application of chevron indicates agency interpretations will have legal consequences an approach we have taken before in this circuit,see franklin fed.sav.bank,at,and an approach we stand by today.
air brake,however,can not rely upon this principle because the chief counsel legal interpretations have no claim to deference of any sort.for one reason,they are too informal.congress does not generally expect agencies to make law through general counsel opinion letters.see christensen,at.opinion letters lack the force of law heimmermann first union mortgage,cir l etters from hud general counsel to members of congress are the kinds of informal policy positions that lack the force of law and are unentitled to chevron deference,cert.denied,d am.express united states,an interpretation contained in a general counsel memorandum that is not reflected in a regulation adopted after notice and comment probably would not be entitled to chevron deference.hosp.of,comm r,cir in mead corporation,the court found that congress had not implicitly delegated authority through the to tariff rulings made each year by different customs offices without notice and comment procedures.
for another reason,the letters interpret a regulation standard,not the statute that the agency is charged with enforcing the safety act.chevron does not apply in this setting.see christensen,at.distinguishing chevron deference accorded an agency interpretation of a the deference accorded an agency interpretation of its own regulation am.express,at w e are not dealing with an agency interpretation of a statute and issues of chevron deference,but with the irs interpretation of an ambiguous term in its own revenue procedure.
other doctrines do not advance air brake cause either.under skidmore swift,federal courts give respectful consideration to authoritative interpretations that lack the force of law,but that nonetheless have the power to persuade.id.at.see mead,at.chevron did nothing to eliminate skidmore and an informal interpretation may therefore at least seek a respect proportional to its power to persuade.quotation omitted.unlike chevron deference,however,skidmore respect is not the kind of legal consequence that may make an interpretation final for purposes of direct review skidmore permits courts to give consideration to an agency expertise and ability to persuade,not its ability to speak with legal effect.put another way,chevron allows the agency to make law,which is what gives the agency views legal consequences,while courts still determine the meaning of a law under skidmore.skidmore thus permits an agency to earn the weight given to it by the courts,while chevron gives reasonable agency interpretations controlling weight as a matter of right.see thomas merrill kristin hickman,chevron domain,geo.the result is that legal consequences do not flow from the skidmore doctrine,and accordingly its application does not assist a court in determining that an agency action is final under the apa.
the better candidate for finding the requisite legal consequences is still another rock controlling weight that federal courts generally give an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.see bowles seminole rock sand.an agency interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation see also united states cleveland indians baseball,d granting seminole rock deference to the irs longstanding interpretation of its own regulations jean nelson,d noting the similar ity between the chevron and the seminole rock presumptions.seminole rock deference appears to have survived mead.see mead,at.scalia,dissenting t he court leaves untouched today the principle that judges must defer to reasonable agency interpretations of their own regulations.united states cinemark usa,cir decision invoking the doctrine transport express,united states,cir same am.express,at holding that mead did nothing to alter seminole rock.the controlling nature of seminole rock deference,moreover,would seem to have the requisite legal consequences for apa finality purposes.john manning,constitutional structure and judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules,colum,because agency rules that comply with specified procedural formalities bind with the force of statutes,seminole rock has a significant impact on the public legal rights and obligations.footnote omitted.
nonetheless,the doctrine does not apply here.in this case,the department of justice emphatically denies that the opinion letters issued by nhtsa chief counsel are authoritative views entitled to any deference.while that position is supported by dicta from at least one case from this court,see fisher ford motor,cir t he general counsel of nhtsa opinion interpreting standard is not legally binding on the courts,cases from other circuits dealing with general counsel letters from different agencies appear to reach a different conclusion,see,am.express,at granting seminole rock deference to an interpretation contained in an opinion letter by the general counsel of the irs gavey prop.first fin.sav.loan ass n,cir holding that a published advisory letter from the general counsel of the federal home loan bank board is entitled to deference as a matter of law espinoza farah,d noting that an opinion letter from the general counsel of the eeoc expressed the interpretation of the commission.either way,as this case suggests,it is one thing for an agency general counsel to have authority to issue definitive interpretations on behalf of the agency it is another for the general counsel to invoke that authority.see mead,at.recognizing that while customs has general rulemaking power to promulgate rules with the force of law,it does not exercise that power when it issues classification rulings.we accept the government acknowledgment that the opinion letters here are not entitled to any deference in the federal under chevron or seminole thus do not have legal consequences.having no direct,binding effect on air brake and having no legal consequences for air brake by virtue of the deference courts might give to them,the chief counsel letters are not final agency action under the apa.
air brake offers several arguments in favor of reviewing the compliance and legal interpretations in the letters,all unpersuasive.it first contends that a decision not to review the letters fails to heed abbott laboratories admonition to apply the finality requirement in a flexible and pragmatic way.at.most pragmatically,air brake urges,the views expressed in the letters have devastated its business,effectively foreclosing it from selling the to vehicle manufacturers regulated by nhtsa,none of which appears willing to run the risk of a recall.while this may be so,adverse economic effects accompany many forms of indisputably government action.initiating an enforcement proceeding against a company,for example,may have a devastating effect on the company business,but that does not make the age
