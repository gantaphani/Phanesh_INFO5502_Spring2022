petitioners herbert derickson derickson and jill derickson derickson referred to jointly as the dericksons petition this court for review of the decision of the secretary of agriculture that they violated and b,the horse protection act of act,by transporting and entering in a horse show a sore horse,just american magic.the dericksons make three arguments the judicial officer jo did not have substantial evidence to find that the dericksons transported just american magic in violation of the act the jo did not have substantial evidence to find that derickson entered just american magic in a horse show in violation of the act and derickson can not be sanctioned by respondents,the animal and plant health inspection service of the united states department of agriculture aphis,because derickson has already served an appropriate penalty for his violations of the act issued by the national horse show commission nhsc pursuant to the aphis horse protection operating plan operating plan.
for the reasons discussed below,we deny the dericksons petition for review.
facts and procedure 
on march,derickson presented a horse,just american magic for preshow inspection at the annual national walking horse trainers show trainers show.upon inspection,two designated qualified persons dqps determined that just american magic was sore because he had bilateral scarring and did not comply with the scar rule the dqps disqualified just american magic from showing.two veterinary medical officers employed by the department of agriculture later confirmed the dqps finding.
derickson admits that she signed a check to pay just american magic entry fee for the show,drawn on the herbert derickson training facility account.dericksons br.at.the dericksons also assert that,prior to march,aphis and nhsc executed a written agreement,the operating plan,which was in effect during the trainers show.id.at.the operating plan outlined penalties for violations of the act that a private organization could impose on violators.it is undisputed that nhsc issued a suspension effective dates december,to december,and a fine to derickson for the bilateral soring violation,derickson second such violation this sanction was consistent with those authorized for such violations in the operating plan.
on august,kevin shea,administrator of aphis,filed a complaint against the dericksons,alleging that the dericksons violated and b of the act by transporting just american magic to the trainers show in shelbyville,tennessee,while the horse was sore,with reason to believe that the horse,while sore,may be entered for the purpose of its being shown in that horse show and entering just american magic in said show while sore.joint appendix at aphis compl.several others,including robert raymond black,ii black,were named in the complaint 
in their answer,both derickson and derickson admitted that they were at all material times herein,individuals doing business as herbert derickson training facility,aka herbert derickson stables,aka herbert derickson breeding and training facility.at ans.both denied all other allegations.
the administrative law judge alj held a hearing on june and,at which time steven fuller fuller,senior investigator with the department of agriculture,testified that he completed several portions of aphis form form,the disqualification form for just american magic from the trainers show.two such portions were items and.fuller further testified that he obtained the information to fill out form from black.item asks name and address of person s responsible for transportation and is answered same as.at form.item is answered in pertinent part robert raymond black,ii.id.
black and his wife were the only witnesses for the dericksons.during black testimony,aphis stipulated that black was employed by herbert derickson.at hr g tr.at.when asked who he understood was the owner of the business that employed him,black testified,i understood it to be herbert derickson.at hr g tr.at.
on october,the alj found that derickson violated the act by entering a sore horse.for the entering violation,the alj issued a fine and a disqualification from showing,exhibiting,or entering any horse,directly or indirectly,at alj at,but then suspended one year of the disqualification,giving derickson partial credit for the suspension imposed by nhsc.id.the alj dismissed all allegations against derickson and the transportation allegation against all respondents,finding that the evidence regarding transportation was scant,with the entry in item of aphis form being the primary evidence introduced in support of the allegations.at alj at internal reference omitted.
derickson and aphis to the jo designated as the final decision maker by the secretary of the department of agriculture.the jo found that the dericksons violated the act by entering and transporting just american magic while sore.first,the jo rejected derickson argument that the operating plan limited the ability of aphis to impose legal sanctions against derickson,stating that no signature page was attached to the copy of the plan entered into evidence that would show that the operating plan applied to the trainers show and even if the operating plan applied,the terms of the operating plan do not limit the authority of aphis to enforce the act.to support the latter finding,the jo highlighted five specific passages in the operating plan 
nothing in this operating plan is intended to indicate that aphis has relinquished any of its authority under the act or regulations.
it is not the purpose or intent of this operating plan to limit in any way the secretary authority.it should be clearly understood that the secretary has the ultimate administrative authority in the interpretation and enforcement of the act and the regulations.this authority can only be curtailed or removed by an act of congress,and not by this plan.
the department retains the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings against any violator when it feels such action is necessary to fulfill the purposes of the act.
nothing in this section is intended to limit aphis disciplinary authority under the act and the regulations.
aphis has the inherent authority to pursue a federal case whenever it determines the purposes of the act have not been fulfilled.
at jo at internal references omitted.
the jo next upon admissions made in the dericksons initial answer and several business invoices on herbert derickson training facility letterhead signed thank you,we appreciate your business and thanks,herbert and jill derickson,at business invoices that the dericksons were running a partnership known as herbert derickson training facility,aka herbert derickson stables,aka herbert derickson breeding and training facilities.
then,the jo found that herbert derickson stables was responsible for transporting just american magic to the trainers show.he based this finding on invoice,sent from herbert derickson stables to the owners of just american magic,noting no charge for the item.at invoice.the jo interpret ed the invoice to indicate that herbert derickson stables transported just american magic to the trainers show.at jo at.the jo concluded that the dericksons,as partners of the business,were liable for transporting just american magic 
the jo also found that the dericksons entered just american magic in violation of the act.in regards to derickson,the jo found that she paid the entry fee and filled out the entry form.to support his finding,the jo stated 
a lthough the signature block on the entry blank states herbert derickson,the writing is similar in style to jill derickson signature on the entry payment check,an entry payment check for the national walking horse trainers show,and an entry blank for the national walking horse trainers show.the signature on the entry blank for the national walking horse trainers show is very different from derickson signature as seen on other documents in the record 
at jo at internal references omitted.
pertinent to this appeal,the jo also found that there was insufficient evidence to hold black liable for transporting just american magic.while addressing black liability,the jo noted that fuller testimony regarding form,coupled with testimony from black and his wife,caused him to agree with the alj that there are inconsistencies that raise questions about the accuracy of some information contained in form.at jo at.
for the transporting and entering violations,the jo disqualified each derickson from showing,exhibiting,or entering horses in shows for two years one year for each violation and issued in sanctions to each derickson for each violation.the dericksons timely petitioned this court for review of the jo decision 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a decision of the department of agriculture under the act only to determine whether the proper legal standards were employed and whether substantial evidence supports the decision.gray united states dep t of,cir quoting fleming united states dep t of,cir.substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting murphy sec y of health human,cir.the record,as a whole,is considered in determining the substantiality of evidence.mcconnell united states dep t of,cir unpublished opinion.when an administrative agency disagrees with the conclusions of its alj,the standard does not change the alj findings are simply part of the record to be weighed against other evidence supporting the agency.rowland united states dep t of,cir quoting stamper sec y of,cir we defer to the jo in the matter of derivative inferences.rowland,at.
the dericksons argue that the jo did not have substantial evidence to support his findings that the dericksons are liable for transporting just american magic derickson is liable for entering just american magic and the operating plan does not limit aphis ability to impose legal sanctions on derickson.we address each argument in turn.
liability for transporting just american magic 
a person violates the act if she transports a horse while sore,with reason to believe that such horse while it is sore may be shown,exhibited,or entered for the purpose of being shown or exhibited in any horse show,horse exhibition,or horse sale or auction.see also b stating that any person who violates section of this title shall be liable to the united states for a civil penalty.person is not defined in the act,but states that,i n determining the meaning of any act of congress,unless the context indicates otherwise,the words person and whoever include partnerships.
the dericksons do not dispute that just american magic was sore when transported,but contend only that they are not liable for the transportation.dericksons br.at.in concluding that the dericksons were liable,the jo found the dericksons were operating a partnership that went by several names,including herbert derickson stables,and that they were liable for the actions taken by that partnership and herbert derickson stables transported just american magic to the trainers show.we hold that both of these findings of the jo are supported by substantial evidence.
the dericksons partnership 
under tennessee law a partnership can be implied where it appears that the individuals involved have entered into a business relationship for profit,combining their property,labor,skill,experience,or money,regardless of whether the parties intended to create a partnership.bass bass.all partners are liable for the obligations of the partnership.a 
applying bass,the jo found that the dericksons were operating a partnership which went by several names,including herbert derickson stables.the jo supported this finding with two pieces of evidence.first,he looked to the dericksons unequivocal admission that each was an individual doing business as herbert derickson training facility,aka herbert derickson stables,aka herbert derickson breeding and training facility.at jo at see also at ans.at.this admission alone would have been substantial evidence to support a finding of implied partnership under tennessee law.though the dericksons did not use the word partnership,two individuals admitting that they are running the same business under the same name is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,gray,at,that the dericksons entered into a business relationship for profit,combining their property,labor,skill,experience,or money,bass,at.however,the jo further supported his finding with several invoices that include the statements thank you,we appreciate your business and thanks,herbert and jill derickson.at jo at see also at invoices.looking at the record as a whole,we conclude that it is clear that there is substantial evidence that the dericksons were operating a partnership.
the dericksons argue that derickson operates as a sole proprietor and that the jo ignored evidence to that effect,specifically black testimony that he understood the owner of the business to be derickson,not derickson aphis stipulation that black was an employee of derickson and the lack of any testimony or documentation,including tax returns,that indicated that a partnership existed.
the dericksons argument fails.the evidence to which the dericksons refer does not render insubstantial the evidence on which the jo relied.first,black testified only that he understood derickson to be the owner of the business that employed him.at hr g tr.at.just as the parties understanding of the legal effect of their relationship is not determinative regarding whether an implied partnership exists,bass,at,black understanding of the ownership of the business that employed him is not substantial evidence of the legal effect of the dericksons relationship.
second,the dericksons mischaracterize aphis stipulation that black was employed by herbert derickson.at hr g tr.at.the questions being posed to black at the time the stipulation was made concerned his status as an employee in general.prior to the stipulation,the nature of the business relationship between the dericksons had not been discussed in this context,stipulating that black was an employee of derickson does not equate to stipulating that derickson was operating a sole proprietorship.
third,the statement that no documentary evidence was introduced to support a finding of partnership is inaccurate.as outlined above,several invoices and the dericksons own answer to the complaint were used to support the jo finding.moreover,the fact that no tax returns or other financial documents were introduced into evidence does not diminish the evidence that is in the record.the dericksons do not dispute the accuracy of the invoices or the admissions in the answer instead,they simply argue that we should hold that there can not be substantial evidence of a partnership without some evidence that directly states that the parties are running a partnership.tennessee law does not require that specific evidence.see bass,at holding that a partnership can be implied from the surrounding circumstances.
therefore,we hold that the jo relied on substantial evidence to find that the dericksons were operating an implied partnership that went by several names,including herbert derickson stables.
transporting just american magic 
the dericksons further argue that the jo lacked substantial evidence to find that they transported just american magic in violation of the act.the dericksons contend that the jo admitted in his decision that the sole evidence on this issue is aphis form,which states that black was responsible for transporting just american magic.because this was the sole evidence,the dericksons assert that black alone can be held liable for transportation.
this argument mischaracterizes the opinion below and the evidence.the jo referenced form with regard to only black liability for transportation.at jo at.the jo did not state that form was the sole evidence against the dericksons to the contrary,the jo found invoice and its statement of no charge for to be evidence of the dericksons liability.at jo at.clearly,the jo did have substantial evidence to support his finding.
the dericksons contend,however,that the line marked no charge should have indicated to the jo that neither the dericksons nor herbert derickson stables were responsible for transpo
