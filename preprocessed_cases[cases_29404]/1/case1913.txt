background 
factual background 
ded ramaj ramaj is the lead petitioner in this case,claiming asylum based on his alleged persecution in albania.vera ramaj claim for asylum is based solely on her husband application.this case turns on issues of credibility and the alleged inconsistencies between ramaj two asylum applications and his testimony.
asylum applications 
the ramaj s prepared their first application for asylum and withholding of removal in july of,but the application was not processed by the government until the fall of.in the application,ramaj sought asylum based on alleged persecution due to his roman catholic faith and political activities.the application states that he was a member of the balli kombetar political party since april of,and that he tried to prevent other albanians from investing in fraudulent pyramid schemes perpetrated by the government.he claimed to have been taken to the police station in mamurras on an unspecified date and severely beaten.in response to a separate question in the first asylum application,ramaj alleged that he was arrested in february of and was held for days.he also claims that his family was detained and beaten on several occasions.no detail is provided as to any of these incidents.the application is not clear as to whether ramaj was talking about one or two incidents of mistreatment that he endured personally.at the close of the application,the section that is to be completed by persons assisting in the preparation of the asylum application is blank.
in october of,the ramajs filed a second application for asylum,this time with the assistance of an attorney.ramaj again claimed persecution on account of his political opinions and partly because of his religious beliefs.he stated that he was elected as a representative of the democratic party for the city of raj in,a post that he allegedly occupied until october of.after ramaj resigned due to disillusionment with the party,he said that he was marginalized and was unable to find work.in,ramaj left to stay in his uncle home in mamurras.there he met vera and joined the balli kombetar political party.according to the second application,and inconsistent with the first,he joined balli kombetar in and was a member until february of.
the second application states that ramaj was twice arrested and beaten by the albanian police.the first incident allegedly occurred in december of,when he contends that he was held at the police station in mamurras overnight and beaten three times.ramaj claims that these abuses took place because he was participating in demonstrations against pyramid schemes perpetrated by the government.in february of,after allegedly participating in one of these demonstrations,he was again arrested,beaten,and held for a period of days.ramaj was finally released because the government opened the jails and we all left.according to the second application,ramaj believes that he will be arrested if he returns to albania because he is considered an outsider,a troublemaker,and a rabble rouser,because he spoke out,and set down in writing his thoughts about those people who are recreating a totalitarian society while calling it a democracy.ramaj also expressed his belief that he would be subjected to torture because albanian police routinely abuse and torture detainees.
removal hearing and exhibits 
in july of,a removal hearing was held in detroit,with the ij sitting by designation and appearing by video conference from new york.although ramaj,his wife,and a family friend all were present at the hearing,ramaj was the only witness who testified.he and his wife both conceded removability and requested asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.
the ij then discussed the various exhibits that were before the court.most were admitted without issue,but the ij challenged the ramajs method of authenticating exhibit.exhibit consists of nine pages,the first of which is a cover page,followed by two documents.the first document starts on the next page and is in a foreign language,with the english translation following.it says that ramaj was stopped by police forces of mamurras for days in december of due to his support for the national party.with the same motive he was arrested for days in february of.on the face of the english translation is a faded stamp and a signature,which ramaj alleges is the attestation of the translator.the next page,in two languages a foreign language and english,is a signature certificate saying that the translator apostol spiro signed the english translation in the presence of fatri hoxha,a public notary.finally,a united states embassy certification appears on the next page,certifying that fatri hoxha was the representative of the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of albania and that he was the person who signed the signature certificate.
the second document,also in a foreign language,follows.the english translation is on the next page,stating the citizen ded ndu ramaj resident of mamurras city is mistreated from the police.as a result of that we found damage of the articulations,edemas in the body and hematomas.he has been under our medical care on antibiotics therapy,vitamins therapy for a period of two weeks in the month of february.this verification is released as documentation.a doctor signed the statement.on the face of the english translation is a faded stamp and a signature,which ramaj alleges is the attestation of the translator.the next page is the signature certificate saying that the translator apostol spiro signed the english translation in the presence of fatri hoxha,a public notary.then comes the united states embassy certification,certifying that fatri hoxha was the representative of the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of albania and that he was the person who signed the signature certificate.
the government objected to the admission of the documents contained in exhibit because the signatures and positions of the officers who signed the translation attestations were not certified as required by or translated as required by the regulations.this argument was found persuasive by the ij,who excluded the documents for lack of proper authentication.ramaj challenges the exclusion of these documents on appeal.
after the ij resolved the dispute regarding exhibit,ramaj testified.he said that he first became involved in politics at the beginning of the democratic movement in.ramaj membership in the democratic party allegedly began in,after which he was elected as a representative of the party at the local polling station.at some point after the democratic party won the election in,ramaj said that he became disillusioned and terminated his membership.
ramaj testified that he moved from his hometown of kurbin to his cousin house moved to my uncle son in mamurras.when asked why he left his hometown,ramaj said that he left because he did feel safe in kurbin and the killing started.he claimed that these killings were perpetrated by masked people from the police.ramaj believed that he could be a target b ecause he resigned from the democratic party due to his objections.he had known some people who were killed,and he would stay with his mouth shut.but speaking out against the injustices would allegedly put him at risk.
contrary to both his first and second written applications,ramaj testified that he was accepted as a member of the balli kombetar party in mamurras in september of.he then began protesting against pyramid schemes.in december of,he said that masked police came to the home where he was staying,ransacked it,and arrested ramaj and his cousin.they were allegedly imprisoned for hours at the mamurras police department,during which time they were beaten,but not severely enough to cause ramaj any injuries on his body.the assailants warned ramaj and his cousin not to protest anymore.
in february of,ramaj was again engaged in public protest in mamurras.although in his second asylum application ramaj indicated that he was protesting against the pyramid schemes,he testified that he was also objecting to the change in the political situation in albania.he was allegedly arrested and jailed for ten days.ramaj also claimed that he was severely beaten,resulting in wounds all over his body that caused him to be treated by a doctor for several days.he said that he was finally released from confinement on february,after the democratic party fell from power.ramaj testified that the people simply opened the door of the prisons and he walked out.by the end of february,ramaj had left albania.he said that he arrived in the united states on march.contradicting himself,ramaj then said that all of this happened before the democratic party was out of power.
ij decision 
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision.the ij reiterated that he was not accepting the exhibit documents containing evidence of ramaj detention and medical treatment.according to the ij,the documents were not properly translated and were deficient because they failed to verify that the signatures were actually those of the persons who allegedly signed the documents.
the ij also noted several inconsistencies between the asylum applications and ramaj testimony,the most important of which are summarized below.in his first application,ramaj failed to state that he was a member of the democratic party let alone that he was an elected official,instead listing only his membership in the balli kombetar party.ramaj then provided widely different dates in his testimony and in his documents for when he allegedly became involved in the balli kombetar political party.he testified that he became a member in september of,but a membership document he submitted showed him joining as of january of that year.this contrasts with the two asylum applications he submitted,which state two other dates,one in and one in.
the reason that ramaj provided for leaving his hometown also changed between his applications and his testimony.he originally said that he left because he was marginalized and was unable to find work,but in his testimony he said that he left because of the killings.finally,ramaj explanation for why he was protesting in february of changed from contesting the government participation in pyramid schemes to protesting a change in the political climate in the country.
these inconsistencies led the ij to conclude that ramaj was not a credible witness.but even if ramaj were credible,opined the ij,he still would not be entitled to asylum because the conditions in albania have improved greatly since the alleged instances of ramaj mistreatment.the ij conclusion regarding the changed country conditions was based upon country reports issued by the department of state.
in the end,the ij found that the ramaj s did not qualify for asylum.because the ramaj s did not meet the standard for asylum,the ij concluded that they also failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.the ij went on to state that ramaj failed to show that any instances of mistreatment,even if his story were credible,met the definition of torture under the cat.
after the petitioners appealed the ij decision,the bia issued a per curiam order adopting the decision of the ij without further elaboration.the petitioners then filed this timely petition for judicial review.
ii.analysis 
a.the bia summary affirmance did not violate the ramajs due process rights 
the ramajs argue first that the bia failed to subject the ij decision to meaningful review when it summarily affirmed in a per curiam decision.in response,the government contends that their claim is foreclosed by this court decision in denko,cir.in denko,a challenge was made to the bia streamlining procedures,which provide for summary affirmance of the ij decision without opinion where a single bia member determines,among other things,that the decision was correct,free of prejudicial error,and squarely controlled by existing precedent.id.at.this court rejected denko argument,concluding that the bia streamlining procedures do not themselves alone violate an alien rights to due process.id.at.because denko had failed to provide tangible evidence that the bia neglected to conduct a proper review prior to issuing its summary opinion,this court refused to assume a complete in the system.id.at.it further determined that no due process violation resulted from the bia affirmance of the ij without issuing an opinion.id.at.according to denko,the rule renders the ij decision the final agency order,and we review that decision.thus,denko receives the full and fair review that she is entitled to receive.id.
in an effort to avoid the denko decision,the ramajs try to cast their argument as being something other than contending that the procedure in and of itself deprived them of due process.they claim that the ij decision was full of errors and that the bia per curiam decision does not evidence that it underwent thoughtful,independent review.w here the alien provided specific detailed,recognized reasons for the appeal,the ramajs argue,the minimum the bia should have done was address the issues present ed and explain the rationale behind its decision.the substance of their argument,however,is precisely the same as that foreclosed in denko.because denko does not require the bia to issue a reasoned opinion,and because the ramajs have failed to present any evidence that the bia failed to conduct a proper review,we find no error.see denko,at.
ramaj asylum claim 
because the bia summarily adopted the ij decision without issuing its own opinion,we review the decision of the ij as the final administrative order.hasan ashcroft,cir.questions of law involving immigration proceedings are reviewed de novo.ali ashcroft,cir.we will affirm the ij factual findings,as well as the determination that the petitioner failed to establish eligibility for asylum,if substantial evidence supports such determinations.ins,d upholding the ij rulings if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole citation omitted.under this standard,we will not reverse a factual determination of the ij unless we find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.marku ashcroft,cir emphasis in original.
substantial evidence supports the ij finding that ramaj was not credible 
adverse credibility findings are findings of fact and are therefore reviewed under the standard.yu ashcroft,cir.even so,the immigration judge conclusion must be supported by specific reasons and must be based upon issues that go to the heart of the applicant claim.in other words,if discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.chen gonzales,cir alterations,citations,and quotation marks omitted.
here,the inconsistencies relied upon by the ij do go to the heart of ramaj application and can be viewed as attempts to enhance his claims of persecution.in his second application,for example,ramaj sought asylum based primarily on his political activities,including activities in the democratic party.but his first application failed to mention that he was even involved with the democratic party,let alone that he was an elected official for a year and a half.the ij reasonably relied on this inconsistency in finding that ramaj was not credible.in a case like this where the asylum claim is based on political persecution,an inconsistency about the level of involvement in political activities especially ramaj s omission in the first application that he was allegedly an elected official goes to the heart of the claim.ramaj subsequent statements in his application and his testimony about his democratic pa
