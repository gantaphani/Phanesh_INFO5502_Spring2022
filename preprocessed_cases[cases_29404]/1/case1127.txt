opinion of the court 
bin lin bin petitions for review of a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia.after unlawfully entering the country and being placed in removal proceedings,bin applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.he grounded these claims on his alleged arrests and abuse in china for engaging in a practice called falun gong.following a hearing,an immigration judge ij denied bin claims for two reasons first,that bin testimony in support of his claims was not credible,and second,that even if the testimony were credible,it failed to meet the burdens of proof necessary for the requested forms of relief.bin then appealed to the bia.the government contends that bin failed to contest the ij credibility determination in his appeal to the bia,and that we are therefore without jurisdiction to consider bin petition to this court.
we agree that bin failed to raise the adverse credibility finding in his appeal to the bia.we hold,however,that because the bia nonetheless considered the adverse credibility determination,the issue was sufficiently exhausted to provide us with jurisdiction to review it.exercising this jurisdiction,we find that substantial evidence supports the credibility determination,and accordingly,we will deny the petition for review.
bin is a native and citizen of the people republic of china.on october,bin arrived in the united states through mexico.when approached by border patrol agents,he stated that he entered the country to find work he was subsequently placed in removal proceedings,where he admitted the factual allegations against him and conceded his removability.thereafter,bin submitted his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat 
at a february,hearing before the ij,bin testified on his own behalf.he explained that he began practicing falun gong in,when he was in the fifth grade,because he suffered from inflammatory diseases of the stomach and intestine and that neither western trained medical doctors nor chinese herbal doctors were able to alleviate his symptoms.as a result,bin began to practice falun gong when his mother friend convinced him that it would help his illnesses.no one else in his family practiced,so bin bought some books and a video on falun gong.on direct examination,bin testified that he practiced with other falun gong practitioners at a nearby park once or twice,though the ij found that bin contradicted himself on.
bin claimed that he was arrested twice for practicing falun gong,first in august and again in january.he testified that the first time,five or six police officers came to his house,took him by force,and did not give a reason for his arrest.according to bin,the officers interrogated and beat him badly,but he could not recall the substance of their questioning.bin stated that two days later,he was sent to a detention center in qwan do,china,where he was detained for more than two months.bin testified that many other inmates were detained there because they also practiced falun gong.he stated that he was beaten by the and kicked in the leg and beaten with a club.bin claimed that he was eventually released,two months later,after he signed a document stating that he would never practice falun gong again.
according to bin,he was arrested again in january and accused of practicing falun gong.the authorities detained him for one month and did not allow his mother to visit him.he claimed that he was beaten once while detained,and that he suffered bruises.he alleged that his mother was also interrogated after his detention.he was released on january,and departed china in september.
on march,the ij denied bin applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection and ordered him removed.the ij denied asylum for two distinct reasons.first,even assuming bin testimony was truthful,the evidence did not support a finding of past persecution or a fear of persecution as is required to prevail on an asylum claim.second,the ij found bin not credible due to material inconsistencies within his testimony and between his testimony and his written affidavit.specifically,the ij determined that while bin affidavit stated that the police told bin the reason for his first arrest,he testified before the ij that the police gave no reason for the arrest.in addition,the ij determined that bin testified inconsistently about where,and with whom,he practiced falun gong after his first arrest.the ij also found that bin did not meet the more exacting standard for withholding of removal or the standard for relief under the cat.
on march,bin,through his prior counsel,filed a notice of appeal with the bia.the notice of appeal did not assert which issues bin was appealing but instead stated that he would file a separate brief.in the separate brief,bin listed the following arguments 
i.the ij erred in finding that bin arrests and detention in and did not constitute persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina respondent clearly suffered persecution at the hands of the chinese government,and thus,is clearly eligible for asylum.
ii.the ij erred in finding that bin two detentions do not rise to the level of persecution bin suffered significant deprivation of freedom and liberty on account of his being a falun gong practitioner.
on may,the bia adopt ed and affirm ed the decision of the ij to the extent the ij concluded bin was not credible and did not therefore meet the burden of proof for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture.the bia did not address bin two allegations of error,having instead adopted the adverse credibility determination.
we generally have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina.see a yan lan wu ashcroft,cir.section d of the ina,however,limits our jurisdiction to cases where a petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available as of right d see abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.
where we do have jurisdiction to entertain a petition for review and the bia adopted the ij opinion,we treat that opinion as the opinion of the bia.zhang gonzales,cir.accordingly,we review the ij opinion to the extent the bia relied upon it.wang att y,cir.
review of an ij decision,including an adverse credibility determination,is conducted under the substantial evidence standard which requires that administrative findings of fact be upheld unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.chen gonzales,cir quoting b b.in other words,adverse credibility determinations are afforded deference provided the ij suppl ies specific,cogent reasons why the applicant is not credible.chukwu att y,cir gao ashcroft,cir.under the law applicable to bin petition,the inconsistencies identified by the ij must not be minor and must go to the heart of the petitioner claim.gabuniya att y,cir 
the government argues that bin did not raise the issue of the ij credibility determination to the bia,thereby failing to exhaust his administrative remedies,and thus depriving us of jurisdiction under d.bin counters that we have jurisdiction to consider the credibility determination because he did raise the issue before the bia,thereby exhausting his administrative remedies.in the alternative,bin argues that even if he did not raise the credibility determination,the bia sua sponte consideration of the issue provides us with jurisdiction.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that bin did not raise the ij adverse credibility finding to the bia,but because the bia considered the credibility issue sua sponte,we nonetheless have jurisdiction to review it.
as stated earlier,under d,a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right d.the parties dispute what congress meant by the term administrative remedies.while our jurisprudence has been less than clear as to whether the statute requires exhaustion of administrative procedures,claims,or issues,compare khan att y,cir,with zheng gonzales,cir,we are bound by those opinions that have interpreted issue exhaustion as a statutory requirement.see,kibinda att y,cir finding petitioner unraised issue unexhausted and thus precluded by d statutory exhaustion requirement abdulrahman,at same as compared to exhaustion doctrines,statutory exhaustion requirements deprive us of jurisdiction over a given case.metro.life ins.price,cir see xie ashcroft,cir.
accordingly,a petitioner is deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies,d,and thereby preserves the right of judicial review,abdulrahman,at,if he or she raises all issues before the bia.we do not,however,apply this principle in a draconian fashion.see joseph att y,cir noting the court liberal exhaustion policy.indeed,so long as an immigration petitioner makes some effort,however insufficient,to place the board on notice of a straightforward issue being raised on appeal,a petitioner is deemed to have exhausted her administrative remedies.id.quotation marks omitted see bhiski ashcroft,cir yan lan wu,at explaining bhiski and observing that when a claim is not so complex as to require a supporting brief,simply putting the board on notice through a notice of appeal is sufficient.
for example,in abdulrahman ashcroft,petitioner abdulrahman argued to the bia that the ij erred in her credibility determination and that her findings were not substantially supported by the evidence.at.before this court,abdulrahman then asserted that the ij erroneously applied the more stringent more likely than not standard,applicable to withholding of removal,to his asylum claim that he suffered past persecution.id.we found abdulrahman attempt to argue that he had raised the burden of proof issue before the bia to be in vain.id.at.neither his notice of appeal nor his written brief viewed expansively even suggest ed the issue.id.we observed that abdulrahman assertion before the bia that the ij erred as a matter of law and discretion,was a generalized claim that did not alert the board to the issue he sought to raise for the first time here.id.quotation marks omitted see joseph,at finding an issue not exhausted where petitioner did nothing to alert the bia that he wished to appeal the ij determination that he was not prima facie eligible for naturalization.as abdulrahman had failed to put the board on notice of the issue that he then raised before this court,we appropriately declined to interfere with the agency decisionmaking process by ruling on a contention the bia had not addressed.abdulrahman,at.
in yan lan wu ashcroft,petitioner yan argued in her notice of appeal to the bia that the immigration judge ignored the fact that her father was jailed and tortured by the chinese government as an underground christian in china,and erred in finding that she does have a fear of the chinese government but the local people.at quotation marks omitted.additionally,in her supporting brief yan claimed that she had presented sufficient evidence to the effect that she has face d past persecution and will face future persecution on account of her christian faith,that police raided her home,and that her home was under surveillance.id.quotation marks omitted.before our court,yan argued that the ij improperly relied on a preliminary statement she had made at the airport and that the ij decision was not supported by substantial evidence.the government contended that yan failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,asserting that yan intimates that the immigration judge reliance on the airport statement was misplaced but that this argument was never raised before the immigration judge or on appeal to the board id.we nevertheless found that yan did contend in her notice of appeal that the immigration judge conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence within the record,and thus the bia was put on notice that there was a claim of error hovering around the immigration judge findings and,consequently,her exclusive reliance on the airport interview,during its review de novo.id see also bhiski,at explaining that petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel argument was exhausted despite his failure to aver,in the notice of appeal,that he suffered prejudice,and despite his failure to file a supporting brief.
in the present case,bin current counsel seemed to concede at oral argument that bin previous counsel had failed to use any language in his notice of appeal or brief to the bia such that the bia would suspect a claimed error even hovering around the ij credibility determination.see yan lan wu,at.bin notice of appeal pressed no arguments whatsoever,but instead merely mentioned that a separate written brief would be submitted.the brief,in turn,referred only to whether bin arrests and detention rise to the level of persecution or constitute persecution within the meaning of the ina.thus,unlike in yan lan wu,bin notice of appeal and his brief did absolutely nothing to alert the bia that he was challenging the ij credibility determination.indeed,this case is the precise inverse of abdulrahman whereas the petitioner there challenged the ij factual findings before the bia but not the applicable legal standard,here,bin challenged the legal standard before the bia,but not the ij factual findings namely,the credibility determination.see at.as in abdulrahman,we reject bin argument that he raised the relevant issue in this case.
perhaps recognizing bin failure explicitly to raise the credibility issue to the bia,bin counsel makes an alternative contention since an asylum applicant without evidence corroborating his claims of past persecution must testify credibly in order to meet his burden of proof,bin appeal to the bia only makes sense if he is appealing the ij adverse credibility determination.pet r reply br.at citing lukwago ashcroft,cir.put another way,since bin can not prevail on his legal claims without also successfully challenging the ij adverse credibility determination,the latter issue is implicit in his appeal to the bia.bin is asking us,in effect,to create a rule any time an ij has made an adverse credibility determination and there is no corroborating evidence,that issue is necessarily before the bia on appeal.
we find no authority to support this position.we have said that as long as the petitioner made some effort to exhaust,albeit insufficient,we will exercise jurisdiction over the petitioner claims.bhiski,at.bin has,however,made no such effort.out of respect for the administrative process,we will not require the bia to guess which issues have been presented and which have not.likewise,we will not punish the bia by interfering in the administrative process with regard to issues that the bia did not address.considering the documents supplied by bin,we have no reason to believe that he put the bia on notice that he was challenging the ij adverse credibility determination.yan lan wu,at exercising jurisdiction over petitioner claims where we were confident that petitioner notice of appeal and brief in support of petitioner application made the board aware of what issues were being appealed.accordingly,bin failed to raise the adverse credibility issue to the bia.
having determined that bin failed to raise the issue of the ij credibility determination,we must now address bin contention that we nonetheless have jurisdiction because the bia,sua sponte,considered this issue and adopted and affirmed the ij decision on this basis.there is certainly a degree of confusion in this area.see zine mukasey,cir recognizing the disagreement among our sister circuits on the question whether a claim or issue not presented to the bia,but considered by the bia sua sponte,is jurisdictionally barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies we note,however,that of the approximately seven courts of appeals to address whether the bia decision to consider an issue provides the court with jurisdiction over the petition for review,only one per curiam opinion by the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit would find a court without jurisdiction in a case such as this one.compare att y,cir per curiam holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over a claim when an alien,without excuse or exception,fail ed to exhaust that claim,even though the bia nonetheless consider ed the underlying issue sua sponte,with sidabutar gonzales,cir holding that the bia sua sponte consideration of petitioners claims served as an agency determination that the issues were sufficiently exhausted to confer the court with jurisdiction under zine,at accepting the agency determination that the persecution issue was adequately exhausted as to both asylum and withholding of removal claims and therefore reach ing the merits of the withholding claim despite the petitioner failure to raise it explicitly on appeal to the bia pasha gonzales,cir explaining that where the bia could have summarily dismissed an appeal for failure to raise an issue with specificity,but instead affirmed on the merits,the exhaustion requirement was waived abebe gonzales,cir en banc same hassan gonzales,cir same johnson ashcroft,cir same see also singh gonzales,cir explaining that even claims not exhausted before the bia may be addressed by a court of appeals where the bia summarily affirmed the ij entire opinion,thus rendering the ij decision the final agency determination for purpose of appellate review mukasey,cir explaining that court was not deprived of jurisdiction despite petitioner failure to raise the issue before the bia where all issues presented to the ij were deemed to have been presented to the bia wilson pena,explaining,in the title vii context,that w here the agency has taken final action based on an evaluation of the merits,it can not later contend that the complainant failed to exhaust his remedies.we agree with the logic of the majority of our fellow courts of appeals on this issue and find that we have jurisdiction to address the ij adverse credibility determination because the bia considered the issue sua sponte.
for example,in sidabutar gonzales,petitioners appeal to the bia challenged the ij determinations regarding asylum,but did not contest the ij finding that petitioners were ineligible for withholding of removal or protection under the cat.at.while the court of appeals for the tenth circuit ordinarily would have found that petitioners failure to pursue the latter two grounds for relief constituted a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies,the bia sua sponte addressed and ruled on both grounds.id.the court observed 
w hile d requires that an alien exhaust all administrative remedies,the bia has the authority to determine its agency administrative procedures.if the bia deems an issue sufficiently presented to consider it on the merits,such action by the bia exhausts the issue as far as the agency is concerned and that is all d requires to confer our jurisdiction.where the bia determines an issue to warrant its appellate review,we will not that determination.indeed,it is a touchstone of administrative law that the formulation of procedures is basically to be left within the discretion of the agencies to which congress had confided the responsibility for substantive judgments.under b specificity requirement,an alien taking an appeal of an ij decision must specifically identify the findings of fact,the conclusions of law,or both,that are being challenged.nothing in the agency regulations preclude the bia from waiving this requirement.indeed,the bia has discretionary authority to dismiss and conversely,accept appeals lacking in specificity where the bia has issued a decision considering the merits of an issue,even sua sponte,the interests behind the exhaustion rule have been fulfilled.

we are persuaded by the court of appeals for the tenth circuit reasoning in sidabutar.to begin with,the bia own regulations provide that the bia may summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal that fails to specify the reasons for the appeal.d i emphasis added see also b form.this permissive language suggests that it is within the agency discretion to determine when to dismiss summarily an appeal for lack of specificity and when the bia is sufficiently apprised of the applicable issues to entertain the appeal.see esponda att y,cir bhiski,at explaining that the permissive term may in notice of appeal form suggests that the agency believes that a brief is not necessary in all cases.given the bia substantial experience dealing with appeals from an ij adverse credibility determination,this discretion is.jasch potter,cir explaining in the title vii context that w hen an agency proceeds to reach the merits of the case rather than dismiss the claim,it has determined that sufficient information exists for such adjudication.after all,the agency itself is in a strong position to evaluate whether the complainant has sufficiently complied with the agency requests.
as congress has empowered agencies to carry out their delegated functions,the administrative system contemplates that agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.sidabutar,at quoting fcc pottsville broad.given this delegation to a coordinate branch,our role is not to substitute our own preference for the optimal administrative procedure for the agency determination of its internal rules ignoring the bia determination of these issues would amount to a judicial determination that the board acted ultra vires in following its own rules.sidabutar,at see mckart united states,d.it is that agencies may waive compliance with their procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of agency business.envtl.coal.wenker,cir quoting am.farm lines black ball freight,d see weinberger salfi,d.as the bia waived compliance with its specificity requirement by choosing to address bin petition on the merits,we may not now reject the petition for review based on that requirement.see angelus milling comm r of internal revenue.if the commissioner chooses not to stand on his own formal or detailed requirements,it would be making an empty abstraction,and not a practical safeguard,of a regulation to allow the commissioner to invoke technical objections after he has investigated the merits of a claim and taken action upon it abdelqadar gonzales,cir the agency assertion that failure to preserve an issue deprives us of jurisdiction,so that we must ignore the agency own forfeiture,lacks any visible means of support.labor relations bd.monsanto chem,cir.
holding that the bia waived its specificity requirement does not run counter to the purposes underlying the exhaustion doctrine.the supreme court has explained that e xhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency processes,giving the agency an opportunity to correct its own errors,to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise,and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review.salfi,at.while these are important concerns,w here the bia has issued a decision considering the merits of an issue,even sua sponte,these interests have been fulfilled.sidabutar,at.the bia has already had an opportunity to apply its experience and expertise without judicial interference.so too,the fact that the bia has addressed the issue independently from the ij ensures that the record is adequate for our review.indeed,the sidabutar court expressly limited the application of this rule to cases in which the bia issues a full explanatory opinion or a discernible substantive discussion on the merits over matters not presented by the alien,distinguishing cases where the bia summarily affirms the ij decision in toto without further analysis of the issue.id.at citing e.
while we need not specify the precise limitations of this rule here,we note that the bia did issue a discernible substantive discussion on the merits in this case.see id.rather than issuing a streamlined opinion under.e,the bia considered bin case as a panel.it cited to matter of burbano,bia,indicating that it had conducted an independent review of the record and had exercised its own discretion in determining its agreement with the reasoning and result of the ij.see paripovic gonzales,cir,at.in exercisin
