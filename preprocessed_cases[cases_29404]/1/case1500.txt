ela,a native and citizen of the republic of congo,was admitted to the united states in january as a student to attend avila college in kansas city,missouri.after failed to return to the college following the spring semester,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear,charging her as removable for failing to comply with the conditions of her visa.subsequently applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.an immigration judge ij denied applications,concluding that she failed to meet her burden of proof on each of her claims.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision under its streamlined process of review.now petitions for review of the bia decision,arguing primarily that the ij violated our decision in camara ashcroft,cir,by disregarding corroborating evidence that she submitted in her application for asylum and withholding of removal.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition for review.
under the immigration and nationality act ina,the attorney general has authority to confer asylum on any refugee.b.to qualify as a refugee,an alien must be unwilling or unable to return to her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the fear of persecution standard contains both subjective and objective components.chen ins,cir.to satisfy the subjective component,an applicant must present candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.id.internal quotations omitted.the objective component requires specific,concrete facts that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.id.at.the applicant for asylum bears the ultimate burden of proving her status as a refugee.a.
to qualify for withholding of removal,an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution.ins stevic,d.this is a more stringent standard than that for asylum.chen,at.unlike the grant of asylum where an alien is entitled to remain in the united states,withholding of removal merely bars the deportation of an alien to a particular country.ins,d.further,while asylum is discretionary,if an alien establishes eligibility for withholding of removal,the grant is mandatory.id.at.
to qualify for protection under the cat,an applicant must prove that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.we have concluded that this standard for the cat is independent from the standard for determining asylum,and an adverse credibility finding alone can not preclude protection under the cat.camara,at.
for purposes of review of a final order of removal issued under the streamlined process,the ij reasoning becomes the final bia determination.id.at.in reviewing the bia decision regarding an order of removal,whether streamlined or not,we uphold the decision if it is not manifestly contrary to law.b c.further,we give great deference to the factual findings by the bia,as those factual findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.id.b b.for this reason,the substantial evidence test for review of the bia conclusions mandates affirmance if the evidence is not so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could agree with the bia factual conclusions.bia,cir.we also defer to the bia credibility findings that are supported by substantial evidence.camara,at.
