petitioner panagis vartelas,an alien who is a lawful permanent resident of the united states and who traveled abroad after being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or the board denying his motion to reopen a removal proceeding brought against him pursuant to a a i i of the immigration and nationality act ina or the act,a a i i,as a returning alien seeking admission to the united states within the meaning of ina a,a,as amended by a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,pub,div,stat.vartelas moved to reopen on the ground that his attorneys had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to move before the immigration judge ij for termination of the removal proceeding on the grounds a that the offense of which he was convicted was within the scope of a a ii ii and thus was not a removable offense,and b that the iirira amendment should not be applied retroactively to treat him as seeking admission.in his petition for review,vartelas contends principally that the bia applied an erroneous legal standard to his ineffective assistance claim and erred in concluding that he was not prejudiced by his attorneys failure to move for termination of the removal proceeding on the above grounds.finding no merit in his contentions,we deny the petition for review.
background 
vartelas,a citizen of greece,has been a lawful permanent resident lpr of the united states since.in,he was convicted,upon his plea of guilty,of having conspired in to make or possess a counterfeit security in violation of,see id.a.that offense carried a maximum term of imprisonment of five years.the range of imprisonment recommended by the sentencing guidelines guidelines was months the prison term imposed on vartelas was four months.
the ina provides generally that a ny alien who at the time of entry would be ineligible for admission into the united states under the law existing at such time by reason of,inter alia,having committed a offense involving moral turpitude is deportable.a a any alien who at the time of entry was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time is deportable,transferred from id.a a any alien who at the time of entry was within one or more of the classes of aliens excludable by the law existing at such time is deportable.see id.a a classes ineligible for admission include aliens who have been convicted of,or who admit having committed,crimes involving moral turpitude,or conspiracy to commit such crimes see also supp.iv repealed terming a misdemeanor for which an individual could not be imprisoned for more than six months or fined more than,or both,a petty offense.crimes involving moral turpitude include counterfeiting offenses.see,united states ex rel.volpe smith,director of immigration.
on january,vartelas returned to the united states from a trip to greece and claimed the right to return as an lpr.he was questioned by an immigration officer about his conviction,and in march he was served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings on the ground that he was inadmissible as an alien who sought entry into the united states after being convicted of,or having admitted committing,a crime of moral turpitude.
a.the proceedings before the ij and the appeal to the bia 
in,and early,vartelas appeared before an ij at a number of preliminary hearings at which various possible defenses to the charge of removability were discussed.at a hearing on june,however,vartelas informed the ij that vartelas was conceding that he was removable as charged,but that he would request relief from removal under former c of the ina,c repealed.although that section,which granted the attorney general discretion to waive certain grounds of deportability for a subset of lprs,had been repealed by iirira,it remained available to lprs whose convictions were based on guilty pleas entered before iirira effective date of april,see ins cyr,cyr ii,aff g cir cyr i.after vartelas first attorney thereafter neglected his responsibilities,vartelas changed attorneys and continued the strategy of conceding his removability and requesting a c discretionary waiver of removal.
in an oral decision delivered on june,the ij denied vartelas application for relief under c.she noted,inter alia,that vartelas had made frequent trips to greece and remained there for long periods of time had not paid his united states income taxes had not shown hardship to himself,his estranged wife,or his united states citizen children who resided in chicago with their mother and had not shown that he supported the children.the ij concluded that the equities did not warrant discretionary relief,and she ordered vartelas removed from the united states to greece.
vartelas appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that although he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude,he had been sentenced to a prison term of less than six months and that under a a ii ii his crime was thus not a removable offense and that,if removable,he should have been granted relief under c.in an opinion dated may,the board affirmed the order of removal.it refused to consider vartelas contention that his conspiracy crime was not a removable offense,because vartelas had conceded removability before the ij.the board rejected vartelas contention that he should have been granted c relief,adopting and affirming the decision of the ij.the board noted that vartelas had not taken advantage of the opportunity afforded him by the ij to clarify the facts relevant to his tax problems,and it stated that the positive equities of vartelas family ties and long residence in the united states were offset by his frequent sojourns in greece and his voluntarily maintaining his united states residence in new york,a great distance from his children.
b.the motion to reopen the proceeding 
in july,represented by new counsel,vartelas filed a timely motion before the bia to reopen,citing in re lozada,setting standard for motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,and alleging that the series of attorneys who represented him in the proceedings before the ij had failed to provide him with effective assistance.in addition to arguing that his first attorney had been and had missed certain hearings,vartelas argued principally that he had been severely prejudiced by both attorneys failure to pursue his defenses to removability.adverting to the defense the board had refused to consider on his appeal,and citing a predecessor of a a ii ii,vartelas pointed out that the sentence actually imposed did not exceed a term of imprisonment in excess of six months and stated that he was not relying on c relief when he entered his plea of guilty he was relying on the fact that the sentence imposed made his crime a crime at the time of conviction.vartelas motion to reopen and remand at.in addition,vartelas argued that iirira had changed the meaning of entry in a with respect to lprs and that his prior attorneys had provided ineffective assistance by not challenging removability on the ground that the iirira change should not be applied to him retroactively.
in an opinion dated january,bia decision reported,without pagination,at wl,the bia denied vartelas motion to reopen.the board evaluated vartelas claim under the standard that had recently been announced by the attorney general in in re compean,bangaly,compean i overruling lozada in part,vacated by in re compean,bangaly,june,compean ii.describing the compean i,the board noted that 
t o prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim,the respondent must establish that his lawyer failings were egregious and that his case was prejudiced by counsel performance.to establish prejudice,the respondent must show that but for the lawyer failing s,he likely would have succeeded on the merits of his underlying claim to remain in the united states.
bia decision at.the board concluded that vartelas did not meet this standard.it found no deficiency in the performance of vartelas second attorney and it found that even if there were derelictions on the part of his first attorney,vartelas 
failed to show that the attorney performance prejudiced his case.the immigration judge gave the respondent additional time to obtain new counsel.vartelas has failed to establish that he is not inadmissible as charged.vartelas is not eligible for the petty offense exception under section a a ii ii of the act,a a ii ii,because the maximum penalty for the crime of which he was convicted is five years imprisonment 
bia decision at.the board also rejected the contention that the version of ina a was impermissibly retroactive as applied to vartelas,noting that vartelas cited only camins gonzales,cir.it stated that his reliance on that case was misplaced because the instant case arises in the jurisdiction of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit,not the ninth circuit,and the board historically follows a court precedent in cases arising in th e circuit in which the proceeding is conducted.bia decision at.the board concluded that vartelas attorneys failure to raise the retroactivity argument thus did not prejudice him.
ii.discussion 
on this petition for review,vartelas argues principally that the bia,in considering his motion to reopen the removal proceeding,should have applied the lozada standard to his claim and should have found that standard satisfied.he contends that the bia,in concluding that he failed to satisfy the prejudice prong of his claim,erred in not concluding that his offense of conviction was a nonremovable offense under a a ii ii,see part.below and in applying the a,rather than applying the fleuti doctrine,see rosenberg fleuti,fleuti,to conclude that in returning to the united states he was not seeking entry,see part.below.
in reviewing the bia denial of a motion to reopen,we apply an standard.see,debeatham holder,cir wang bia,cir.for the reasons that follow,we see no abuse of discretion here.
a.the prejudice prong of a claim of ineffective assistance in removal proceedings 
in,the bia in lozada established a framework within which it would consider a motion to reopen a removal proceeding based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.see generally at.with regard to the substance of such a claim,the board stated as follows 
any right a respondent in deportation proceedings may have to counsel is grounded in the fifth amendment guarantee of due process ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case one must show,moreover,that he was prejudiced by his representative performance.
id.at emphasis added.
in applying lozada principles in the context of an alien claim that his attorney failed to make certain arguments,the bia has articulated a variety of standards as to what the alien must show to establish that counsel performance caused him prejudice.for example,in in re fernandez,no,wl,unpaginated,the board stated that prejudice means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred.emphasis added.in in re munroe,no,wl,unpaginated,the board described a standard considerably less stringent than,stating that evidence of prejudice is 
evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel not declined to apply for relief on his behalf or conceded the charge of removability.
emphasis added.and in applying lozada in in re chambers,no,wl,unpaginated,the board referred to yet another standard,stating that p rejudice is shown where counsel actions are so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel ineffectiveness,the outcome of the proceedings would have been different,while also stating that chambers had failed to show prejudice because he failed to demonstrate what actions his former attorney should have taken that would have warranted a different result.emphases added.
in compean i,the general vacated lozada in part,renouncing its assumption of a constitutional foundation for the right to counsel in removal proceedings,and established a clear and stringent standard for bia analysis of motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.the compean i attorney general opined that the constitution does not confer a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings.at but see,debeatham.holder,at such claims are grounded in the right to due process.the attorney general noted,however,that the alien has a statutory privilege to retain counsel,see compean i,at,and concluded that the board has discretion to reopen proceedings i n extraordinary cases,where a lawyer deficient performance likely changed the outcome of an alien removal proceedings,id.at emphasis added.he stated,i conclude that to establish prejudice arising from a lawyer deficient performance sufficient to permit reopening,an alien must show that but for the deficient performance,it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking.id.at emphasis added see also id.at finding the more likely than not standard more appropriate than the reasonable probability standard and more demanding.
in compean ii.a new attorney general vacate d compean i in its entirety,at,and called for rulemaking to evaluate the lozada framework and to determine what modifications should be proposed,see id.at.with compean i vacated,the lozada standard was expressly restored.see,id.at to ensure that there is an established framework in place pending the issuance of a final rule,the board and immigration judges should apply the standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel,regardless of when such motions were filed.
compean i was announced after vartelas filed his motion to reopen but before the board ruled on the motion compean ii vacated compean i,but not until after the board had ruled on his motion.thus,the compean i standard was the prevailing standard at the time of the board decision.vartelas contends that the board application of the stringent requirement set in compean i,rather than the standard set by lozada,denied him due process.vartelas brief on appeal at.
we conclude,however,that in this case we need not determine which of the standards of prejudice applies to an claim in removal proceedings.whatever the provenance of the right,an claim can not be established without some showing of prejudice and for the reasons stated in the sections that follow,vartelas has failed to show prejudice under any standard.
b.the petty offense exception 
vartelas contends that his crime involving moral turpitude was a nonremovable offense under a a ii ii because he was sentenced to a prison term of less than six months.we reject this contention because it disregards one of the criteria stated in that section.
section a of the ina,a,defines classes of aliens who are excludable on c riminal and related grounds.in and,when vartelas committed and pleaded guilty to,respectively,the crime of conspiracy to make or possess a counterfeit security,subsection a a provided,in pertinent part,as follows 
i in general 
except as provided in clause ii,any alien convicted of,or who admits having committed,or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of 
i a crime involving moral turpitude other than a purely political offense or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime,
is excludable.
ii exception 
clause i i shall not apply to an alien who committed only one crime if 
ii the maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was convicted or which the alien admits having committed or of which the acts that the alien admits having committed constituted the essential elements did not exceed imprisonment for one year and,if the alien was convicted of such crime,the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of months regardless of the extent to which the sentence was ultimately executed.
a a supp.iii emphases added see a a substituting inadmissible for excludable.by its terms,therefore,a a ii ii is not applicable unless,inter alia,both the prison term actually imposed was not more than six months and the maximum prison term possible for the crime emphasis added was not more than one year.
the section of the criminal code under which vartelas was convicted authorizes,inter alia,imprison ment of not more than five years.thus,following his plea of guilty,vartelas could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment.his reliance on the fact that the range of imprisonment recommended by the guidelines for his offense was months see vartelas brief on appeal at is misplaced.the plain meaning of maximum penalty possible emphases added is the highest penalty that the applicable statute allows.the maximum possible does not refer to a range of imprisonment that is less than what a court could lawfully impose.accord holder,cir maximum penalty possible is determined in reference to the relevant statutory range of imprisonment and not the federal sentencing guidelines range mukasey,cir the plain language of the statute indicates that the phrase,the maximum penalty possible,refers to the statutory maximum,not the maximum sentence under the sentencing guidelines.
as the crime of which vartelas was convicted carried a statutory maximum prison term of five years,that crime was not one for which he could not lawfully be imprisoned for more than one year,and it thus did not qualify as a petty offense within the scope of a a ii ii.accordingly vartelas was not prejudiced by his attorneys failure to argue that he was nonremovable under that section.
c.the retroactivity argument 
as indicated in part i above,a a provides that an alien who is inadmissible under the laws in effect at the time of his entry into the united states is deportable.prior to the enactment of iirira,the ina defined entry to 
mean any coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession,whether voluntarily or otherwise,except that an alien having a lawful permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as making an entry into the united states for the purposes of the immigration laws if the alien proves to the satisfaction of the attorney general that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or in an outlying possession was not voluntary.
a emphases added.
in,the supreme court in fleuti interpreted this provision as it applied to an lpr who had been served with a notice of deportation under ina a after returning to the united states following a visit of about a couple hours to mexico,at internal quotation marks omitted.the court noted that congress unquestionably has the power to exclude all classes of undesirable aliens from this country,id.at,but concluded that congress had not meant its definition of entry to encompass a resident alien return from a brief,innocent,casual foreign excursion that was not intended to disrupt his resident alien status,see id.at.the court concluded that such a trip therefore may not subject the lpr to the consequences of an entry into the country on his return.id.
effective april,the ina was amended by iirira to,inter alia,delete the above definition of entry from the statute and a was divided into subsections,the most pertinent of which provide as follows 
a the terms admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.
c an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien 
v has committed an offense identified in section a of this title 
a a and c v emphases added.the word entry is not defined and the new a omits reference to any effect that an lpr may have intended his foreign sojourn to have.
the statute itself is silent as to the intended effect of these amendments on the fleuti doctrine,and this court has not previously addressed this question.the bia,however,has interpreted iirira amendment of a as superseding the fleuti doctrine.in in re,noting that the central basis for the supreme court reasoning in fleuti was the a definition of entry and its reference to intended consequences,and that the amended section a c of the act no longer defines the term entry and no longer contains the term intended,at,the bia concluded that the fleuti doctrine,with its origins in the no longer existent definition of entry in the act,does not survive the enactment of the iirira as a judicial doctrine,id.the bia reasoned that under the plain language of the new a c v,which contains a congressional directive not contained in the previous version of that section and not before the supreme court when it decided fleuti,at,
a lawful permanent resident who has committed an offense identified in section a,who has not since such time been granted relief under certain other provisions,who departs the united states and returns,shall be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states despite his lawful permanent resident status,
at emphases added,and is to be so viewed 
without regard to whether his departure from the united states might previously have been regarded as brief,casual,and innocent under the fleuti doctrine,
as we have noted in dealing with a different iirira amendment,
i n general,when congress has delegated authority to an agency to administer a statute,and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue,we must accord substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation given by the agency and can not s imply impose our own construction on the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,u,d.the bia,through powers delegated by the attorney general,enforces and interprets the ina and thus has the authority to fill statutory gaps with reasonable interpretations.
martinez ins,cir martinez other internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.in the present case,given iirira deletion of the definition of entry,its emphasis on admission,and its specification of the conditions under which an lpr is or is not to be regarded as seeking admission,we conclude that the bia in reasonably interpreted iirira as superseding the fleuti doctrine.accord de vega gonzales,cir camins gonzales,at malagon de fuentes gonzales,cir tineo ashcroft,cir.
vartelas argues,however,that because his plea of guilty preceded iirira,the iirira amendment to a was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him.we consider the issue of retroactivity de novo,without giving deference to the opinion of the bia,as the question of whether an iirira amendment would have an improper retroactive effect in a particular case does not concern the sort of statutory gap that congress has designated the bia to fill,nor a matter in which the bia has particular expertise.martinez,at.in conducting the retroactivity analysis,we use the familiar inquiry announced in landgraf usi film products.
in the first landgraf step,we must ascertain,using the ordinary tools of statutory construction,whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.martinez,at quoting landgraf,at.if congress has expressly prescribed the relevant provision temporal reach,we need look no farther.here,we the government congress has not expressly prescribed the temporal reach of a.accordingly,we move to the second landgraf step,in which we ask whether application of the new section would have a genuinely retroactive effect,at,that is,whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment and inappropriately,contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,upsets settled expectations that were based on reasonable reliance,id.at.in making this determination,we bear in mind that a statute is not impermissibly retroactive merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment,or upsets expectations based in prior law,martinez,at quoting landgraf,at brackets in martinez,for i
