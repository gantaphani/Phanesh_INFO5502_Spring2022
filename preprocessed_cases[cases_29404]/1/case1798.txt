abdulmunaem abdullah abdulmunaem and his brother,salah abdullah motahar alghurbani salah,arrived in the united states in with visas.they had fled their native country of yemen after being threatened with death by abdulmunaem,general abu taleb,a military officer.the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against the brothers in.at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,the brothers petitioned for a grant of asylum,the withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.abdulmunaem and salah claimed that they risked being killed by the general and his military guards if they are returned to yemen.
the ij denied their applications,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision.for the reasons set forth below,we deny review of the portion of the petition requesting asylum,but grant review of the portion of the petition requesting the withholding of removal.
background 
factual background 
brothers abdulmunaem and salah were born and raised in yemen.in,they enrolled in a university in the capital city of.abdulmunaem and salah last names are spelled versus due to a translation discrepancy on the part of the american immigration authorities.while at the university,abdulmunaem met hussein mohammed mohammed abu taleb hussein.the two became close friends.hussein is a member of the hashmid clan,one of the highest kind of families in yemen.his father is a general in the yemeni army who has served as an advisor to the president of yemen.in contrast,abdulmunaem belongs to a clan associated with the industry,which is considered the lowest class in yemen.
one fateful day at the end of,hussein asked abdulmunaem to pick up hussein sister,najla,from the university,where she had begun attending classes.abdulmunaem agreed.upon their first meeting,abdulmunaem and najla instantly connected.as abdulmunaem explained,we stood there for a while,i mean,me and her.we talk.it was the beginning.he continued after i meet her for a while,you know,we start talking,i loved real i loved her and she loved me,too.she was the best i ever meet sic in my life.the two began seeing each other at the university in secret.
abdulmunaem eventually told hussein about abdulmunaem love for najla,and hussein was about it.hussein warned abdulmunaem,however,about hussein father,general abu taleb.the general took his membership in the hashmid class very seriously and would not accept the courtship of his daughter by someone from the class.abdulmunaem was nevertheless hopeful because he attended the same university where the general had sent hussein and najla.
toward the end of,abdulmunaem decided that he was going to approach general abu taleb to seek permission to marry najla.some of abdulmunaem family members were scared about how the general would react and refused to support abdulmunaem decision.two of abdulmunaem brothers,salah and mutaher,nevertheless agreed to go with abdulmunaem to the general home in.although abdulmunaem was prepared for rejection,he expected that at worst the general would be diplomatic and say that najla was not ready to get married at that time.
at first,the general was receptive to the proposal because he was confused about the particular family branch to which the brothers belonged.he thought that they were from the part of the,which apparently is a part of the family.the brothers corrected the general and told him that they instead belonged to the jezarene part,which meant the.immediately upon hearing this,the general became angry,started screaming,and asked how they dared to come into his house and ask permission for najla to marry abdulmunaem.he launched into a speech about the superiority of his family and then kicked the brothers out of his house.before they left,however,the general threatened abdulmunaem and told him to stay away from najla.in recounting this visit to the general house,salah stated that he had never been so humiliated.
after a few days,hussein came to abdulmunaem to apologize for the behavior of his father,the general.hussein told abdulmunaem that the general had struck najla after abdulmunaem left and that she had been very sick ever since.in addition,the general refused to let najla leave the house,even to go to the university.after najla had remained sick for some time,najla mother was able to persuade the general to allow najla to leave the house to go to the doctor.najla visit to the doctor gave hussein an idea about how he could get abdulmunaem and najla together and arrange for them to get married in secret.he believed that the general would then be forced to accept the marriage when abdulmunaem and najla presented him with an executed marriage contract.
to effect this plan,hussein told the general in april that hussein was taking najla to the doctor.instead,hussein took najla to a friend house,where abdulmunaem met them.hussein then acted as najla guardian and gave permission for her to marry abdulmunaem,which allowed abdulmunaem and najla to execute a marriage contract.in this way,abdulmunaem and najla were married in secret,without the knowledge of the general.
all was going relatively smoothly for the couple until najla father decided in late to have najla marry abdul rahman,her first cousin and the general nephew.according to hussein,there was no longer any chance that the general would accept najla marriage to abdulmunaem because the general had already told his family that najla was going to marry abdul rahman.hussein then advised abdulmunaem to take your wife and run away from the general.to help them,hussein took najla from the general house to meet abdulmunaem in december.abdulmunaem then traveled with najla to his mother house,but his mother refused to let them stay with her because of the danger posed by the general.salah then offered his home to abdulmunaem and najla as a place for them to stay.the couple accepted salah offer and went there that night.
after leaving najla with abdulmunaem,hussein returned to his father house and presented the general with a copy of the marriage contract.the general became so enraged that he shot his own son in the chest with a gun.fortunately,hussein was rushed to the hospital by a relative and thus did not die as a result of the gunshot wound.the general,meanwhile,took his guards to the home of abdulmunaem mother.due to his rank in the military,the general has soldiers with him at all times,acting as his personal guards.when the general arrived at the house of abdulmunaem mother and she would not let him inside,the general and his guards tried to break down the door and started shooting at the house with their guns.abdulmunaem mother called the police,but when the police arrived and saw the general,they helped him break down the door.
once inside the house,the general threatened abdulmunaem mother and told her that he would kill both abdulmunaem and najla.abdulmunaem mother still refused to disclose the location of her son.someone in the neighborhood,however,sought to curry favor with the general and told him that abdulmunaem and najla had left with salah.another neighbor overheard this conversation and warned abdulmunaem mother that the general knew with whom the couple had departed.abdulmunaem mother in turn called salah to warn him.
upon receiving his mother warning,salah suggested that abdulmunaem and najla flee to the home of salah in aden,which is in southern yemen about seven hours away from the capital.salah is from india and not well known in yemen,so salah believed that abdulmunaem and najla would be safe there.abdulmunaem and najla agreed,and they immediately hired a car to take them from to aden.after arriving at the house in aden,abdulmunaem and najla received a call from salah wife.she told them that officers of the military and the police had arrived at salah house,searched the residence,and had taken salah with them.
salah later explained what had happened after abdulmunaem and najla left.it was dark outside,and salah heard multiple cars drive up to his house.he saw that at least one car had a military license plate.immediately,salah sent his wife and son out the back door to go stay with the neighbors.according to salah,i did want them to did want my son or my wife to see me in a bad position,because i expected expected to be killed right away.
the guards of the general forced open the door to salah house.at first,only the general entered.he walked up to salah and struck salah in the face.salah face was covered in blood.the general guards then started interrogating salah about abdulmunaem whereabouts.salah told the guards that he did not know where abdulmunaem was.one of the guards,who was wearing large army boots,responded by kicking salah in the back.after this kick,salah could not walk.the guards then carried salah out of the house,threw him into one of their trucks,and drove him to a local police station.salah was detained at the police station for approximately three months.
when salah was first taken to the police station,he was placed in a small,room behind the jail that was separated from the rest of the building.salah described the four or five days that he spent locked in this room as the worst of his life.two of the general guards took shifts and stayed with salah at all times.they continually interrogated salah,trying to force him to disclose the location of abdulmunaem and najla.during this time,salah never saw any police officers,only the general personal guards.
in an effort to induce salah to reveal his brother location,the guards would talk between themselves so that salah could overhear them.they would make comments to the effect that they were supposed to kill salah if he did not talk,that some of salah family members had been in accidents,that the general men were following salah brothers,and that his mother house had been burned down.the guards would also talk about salah wife,telling salah,we can kill your family.
other measures taken by the guards to weaken salah resolve included pulling out his chest hairs and standing on his toes with the heels of their army boots.the guards deprived salah of sleep and would not allow him to use the bathroom.salah was forced to either urinate and defecate on himself or in the corner of his small cell.he was not given any blankets for warmth,even though it was the middle of the winter.on the fourth or fifth day,the guards threw a dead,rotting cat covered with bees into salah cell and told him that they were going to burn down the home of one of his brothers.at this point,salah was crying and ready to collapse.he therefore decided to make up a story.salah told the guards that abdulmunaem and najla had fled to saudi arabia.after questioning salah further about the couple exact location in saudi arabia,the general guards finally left the jail.before leaving,however,they warned salah that if they did not find abdulmunaem and najla,salah would be killed.
when the general guards left,the police moved salah into a larger room inside of the jail.but whenever an official government inspector came to the police station,salah was moved to the back room so that he would not be discovered.after about two months,one of the police officers took pity on salah and called another one of salah brothers not identified in the record to tell him where salah was.the brother in turn called the district attorney to notify the district attorney about salah detention.as a result,a government inspector came to the jail,found salah,and interviewed him.the inspector discovered that salah was being held at the behest of general abu taleb without any pending charges.at that time,the general was in saudi arabia searching for abdulmunaem and najla.because of the general absence,the district attorney was able to order salah release from the jail.the inspector advised salah,however,to leave as soon as possible,before the general return.
salah heeded the inspector advice.when salah was released from the jail in march,he left that same day without even stopping to see his wife and son at his mother house.he traveled straight to his house in aden,where abdulmunaem and najla were staying.salah remained there for one night and then stayed at various friends homes in the area for about five or six months.he was not harmed or harassed during his time in aden.
while salah was being detained at the jail in,abdulmunaem and najla lived in aden with salah.abdulmunaem left aden only once for two days in february to go to the american embassy in for the purpose of obtaining a visa to travel to the united states.so that najla could also obtain a visa,abdulmunaem sent his sister,who had previously traveled to the united states,with najla to the american embassy in.both najla and the sister were able to secure visas.all three then traveled to the united states,with abdulmunaem arriving in may and najla and abdulmunaem sister arriving in september.none of them had any trouble getting through airport security when leaving yemen.abdulmunaem explained that this was because the general thought that they were in saudi arabia and was not looking for them in yemen at that time.
salah learned of abdulmunaem plan to flee to the united states on the night that salah stayed at his house in aden.he decided that this was a good idea for himself as well,so salah briefly returned to to obtain a visa to enter the united states.during his time in,salah stayed away from his mother house to avoid trouble.he obtained a visa and traveled to the united states at the end of september.his wife and son followed him a year later.they all were able to leave yemen without being detected by the general.
none of abdulmunaem and salah four siblings who are still in yemen have been harmed.nor has any harm come to their mother after they left the country.since arriving in the united states,abdulmunaem has remained in contact with hussein.they have talked about the possibility of reconciliation with general abu taleb,but hussein has told abdulmunaem that this is not likely.according to hussein,the general is crazy and would not hesitate to kill abdulmunaem and najla.even hussein has been disowned and is no longer recognized by his father.
sometime in,abdulmunaem met with,the yemeni minister of foreign affairs,in detroit,michigan to try to repair abdulmunaem relationship with general abu taleb.abdulmunaem told about the situation with the general,and promised to do his best to resolve the problem.upon returning to yemen,met with the general,but was unable to change his views.the general said that he had no daughter because she was dead.similarly,hussein learned from his mother that the general was in complete denial of najla marriage,claimed that she was dead,and said that if he ever saw najla,he would make her dead.
more recently,abdulmunaem and najla learned that they also have reason to fear the actions of abdul rahman,the general nephew and right hand,whom the general intended for najla to marry.according to hussein,abdul rahman constantly reminds the general about najla dishonorable marriage and urges the general to wash the shame from the family.abdulmunaem and salah explained that the general would wash his honor by killing najla.
najla acknowledged that she is doomed to execution in yemen due to the shame that she has brought on the general family.the general could also elect to kill abdulmunaem because abdulmunaem was the one who assault ed the general honor.this form of honor killing remains an acceptable practice in yemen because,under law,a father can not be prosecuted for killing his daughter or son.moreover,even if it were a crime,the general would not be prosecuted because of his military authority.as described by abdulmunaem,the general is an agent of the yemen government.
salah is in the same basket as abdulmunaem and najla because he helped abdulmunaem and najla escape,and because he lied to the general guards about the couple whereabouts.significantly,the only reason that he was released from jail was because the general was out of the country at the time.when the general returned and learned that salah had been released,the general went crazy,made threats,and said that he could find najla anywhere in yemen.the general even took his guards to salah former residence to look for salah,but fortunately salah family no longer lived there.
news of abdulmunaem and salah applications for asylum in the united states has traveled back to yemen,and najla intended husband,abdul rahman,has spread this news to generate ill will toward them.in yemen,an application for asylum in another country is considered and is viewed with hostility.
based on this danger,abdulmunaem and salah seek to remain in the united states.they are also concerned about the safety of their children.since they left yemen,abdulmunaem and najla have had three children,and salah and his wife have had another child.all of these children were born in the united states and have lived in this country for their entire lives.in addition,although salah first child was born in yemen,he has lived in the united states ever since arriving with his mother in.
procedural background 
after abdulmunaem and salah had been in the united states for over three years,the ins commenced removal proceedings against them.this was in january.the ins charged abdulmunaem and salah with remaining in the united states beyond the expiration of their visas without authorization.abdulmunaem visa expired in august and salah expired in october.in response,abdulmunaem and salah conceded removability but,in february,they filed applications for asylum and the withholding of removal under sections a and b a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,b a.they claimed that they were eligible for asylum under the ina due to their fear of persecution on account of their membership in a particular social group.abdulmunaem and salah also sought withholding of removal for this reason and for protection under the cat.in the alternative,they applied for the privilege of voluntary departure from the united states.
abdulmunaem,najla,and salah appeared before the ij in february and may and testified to the facts recounted above.in support of their applications,abdulmunaem and salah also provided witness statements,personal documents,and various articles detailing the culture of yemen.the ij took these matters under advisement and issued a written decision in july,which denied abdulmunaem and salah any form of relief.
in his order,the ij found that neither abdulmunaem nor salah had filed applications for asylum within the statutory period set forth in section a b of the ina,a b,and a.in addition,they had not demonstrated the existence of changed circumstances materially affecting their eligibility for asylum,which could have excused the untimeliness of their applications.the ij was not persuaded by abdulmunaem and salah argument that the general rejection of efforts of reconciliation constituted changed circumstances.and even if he were to accept that argument,the ij concluded that they had failed to apply for asylum within a reasonable time after this purported change in circumstances,thus obviating the potential application of this exception.
putting aside the procedural defects in abdulmunaem and salah applications for asylum,the ij found that the applications should be denied on their merits.the ij reached this conclusion despite finding that abdulmunaem and salah were credible,regardless of some minor discrepancies between their personal statements and their testimony.he determined,however,that abdulmunaem and salah accounts of past persecution lack ed a sufficient nexus with one of the five protected categories.these five categories protected by the ina are race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,and political opinion.ina a a,a a.
the ij reasoned that abdulmunaem and salah fears arise from a family grudge,not membership in a particular social group as they claim.moreover,even if there was a sufficient nexus,the ij concluded that neither abdulmunaem nor salah had suffered past persecution in yemen.abdulmunaem was never detained by the general,and the ij determined that the actions taken by the general guards against salah were not severe enough to constitute persecution.because the ij decided that abdulmunaem and salah had not demonstrated past persecution,they were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.
the ij also found that even if the brothers had shown past persecution,the conditions in yemen had changed for the better since their departure.in comparing the state report with the state report,the ij determined that conditions in yemen have drastically improved in the six years since abdulmunaem and salah arrived in the united states.he continued,there have been significant improvements in human rights and there were no known political killings or disappearances.moreover,the ij noted that abdulmunaem,najla,and salah had left yemen through regular airport security checks without being detained,and their family members in yemen have remained unharmed by the general.the ij therefore concluded that even if abdulmunaem and salah had demonstrated past persecution,there was evidence in the record to rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution.accordingly,abdulmunaem and salah were found to be ineligible for asylum.in light of this determination,the ij ruled that abdulmunaem and salah necessarily could not make the more stringent showing required to demonstrate eligibility for either the withholding of removal or for protection under the cat.he also decided that the brothers were ineligible for the privilege of voluntarily departing from the united states.
abdulmunaem and salah did not challenge the ij rulings regarding the cat or voluntary departure in their appeal to the bia or in their petition for review before this court.we therefore will not address these two issues.see,ramani ashcroft,cir interpreting the requirement set forth in section d of the ina,d,to mandate that only claims properly presented to the bia and considered on their merits can be reviewed by this court in an immigration appeal.on the other hand,abdulmunaem and salah did appeal to the bia from the ij denial of their applications for asylum and the withholding of removal.
the bia affirmed the decision of the ij.regarding the ij finding that abdulmunaem and salah had not demonstrated a nexus between the claimed persecution and a protected statutory ground,the bia reasoned 
abdulmunaem and salah have failed to demonstrate that the mistreatment they suffered at the hands of general abu taleb or his guards,or any such mistreatment that they may suffer in the future,was or will be inflicted on account of membership in a particular social group consisting of their family or on account of any other protected ground.in particular,abdulmunaem and salah have not shown that general abu taleb was motivated to harm them because of their membership in the family.the respondents testified that general abu taleb did not want his daughter to marry abdulmunaem because abdulmunaem family name indicates that abdulmunaem and salah are from a meat cutter class,which is the lowest profession in yemen,whereas the general is from the ruling,wealthy hashemite tribe.however,the threats and mistreatment abdulmunaem and salah received appear to have been motivated by general abu taleb anger that his daughter dishonored the family by disobeying him and marrying without his permission.indeed,general abu taleb shot his own son hussein upon learning of the marriage and now will not recognize his son.there is no indication that this is anything other than a personal vendetta that general abu taleb has against his for marrying his daughter without his permission.
emphasis in original.
the bia also agreed with the determination of the ij that abdulmunaem and salah had failed to show a clear probability of future persecution.according to the bia,the record demonstrated that abdulmunaem and najla remained in yemen for some time without harassment and were able to leave yemen without any problems.the bia also noted that salah obtained the help of the district attorney to secure his release from detention,and then remained in yemen for six months without harm.in addition,the bia pointed out that despite being previously threatened by the general,abdulmunaem and salah mother has not been further harassed.finally,the bia determined that abdulmunaem and salah have not proven that the government of yemen is unwilling or unable to protect them.
the appeals of abdulmunaem and salah were therefore dismissed by the bia.this joint petition for review followed,in which abdulmunaem and salah argue that the bia erred in finding them ineligible for either asylum or the withholding of removal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
our task is to ascertain whether substantial evidence supports the bia determination that abdulmunaem and salah failed to sustain their burdens of establishing eligibility for asylum and the withholding of removal.where,as here,the bia reviews the ij decision and issues a separate opinion,rather than summarily affirming the ij decision,we review the bia decision as the final agency determination.morgan keisler,cir.to the extent that the bia has adopted the ij reasoning,however,we also review the ij decision.khalili holder,cir.questions of law are reviewed de novo,but substantial deference is given to the bia interpretation of the ina and applicable regulations.morgan,at.the bia interpretation of the statute and regulations will be upheld unless the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
when reviewing administrative findings of fact,we utilize the standard.ben hamida gonzales,cir.under this standard,we must affirm the factual findings of the ij as affirmed by the bia if the findings are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ramaj gonzales,cir quoting ins,d.we may not reverse such findings simply because we would have decided them differently.gishta gonzales,cir.rather,the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.ina b b,b b.in addition,because the ij in the present case found that abdulmunaem and salah were credible,we will accept the factual statements in the petitions and testimony as true.see gilaj gonzales,cir.
timeliness review 
the first issue raised by abdulmunaem and salah is whether the ij failed to afford them due process by not excusing the untimeliness of their applications for asylum.generally,to be eligible for asylum,an alien must file an application within one year of arriving in the united states.ina a b,a b.but the ij may excuse the untimeliness of a application where the alien demonstrates either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the alien eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period.ina a d,a d.
pursuant to section a a iii of the real id act of,a d,judicial review of asylum applications denied for untimeliness is authorized only where the appeal seeks review of constitutional claims or matters of statutory construction,not where the question is discretionary or factual.almuhtaseb gonzales,cir see also id.at explaining that the provision of the real id act applies to all appeals from removal orders issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment citation and internal quotation marks omitted.because the existence of changed circumstances is an inherently factual inquiry,we lack jurisdiction to review the ij and the bia factual determinations on this issue.see id.at.
due process claims 
abdulmunaem and salah attempt to avoid the jurisdictional bar by claiming that both the ij and the bia committed constitutional errors when they rejected the brothers asylum applications as untimely.specifically,the brothers assert that the ij did not adequately set forth his reasons for reaching his decision,thereby violating their due process rights.they also contend that the bia erred by failing to conduct an independent review of the record.
abdulmunaem and salah correctly assert that aliens are entitled to the due process of law in deportation proceedings.see gilaj,at.due process requires that an alien be afforded a full and fair hearing.id.to prevail on a due process claim,an alien must demonstrate that a constitutional error caused actual prejudice,that the error materially affected the outcome of the alien case.mapouya gonzales,cir.
in his order denying abdulmunaem and salah applications,the ij detailed the relevant facts and applicable law concerning the timeliness requirement for an asylum application.he explained 
the court finds that abdulmunaem and salah have not proven any reason for missing the one year deadline.they fled yemen to escape a family feud and accompanying abuse which was caused by abdulmunaem marriage to the general daughter.abdulmunaem and salah hope that the situation would cool down is no excuse for missing the one year filing deadline.to hold otherwise would render the one year requirement meaningless.
and even if abdulmunaem and salah had demonstrated a qualifying change in circumstances,the ij concluded that they had waited too long to file their applications for asylum.the only evidence of changed circumstances that they had offered was the general rejection of efforts at reconciliation.even after this rejection,however,abdulmunaem and salah waited over two years to file their applications.the ij concluded that the applications were not filed within a reasonable period of time after the purported change in circumstances.he therefore found the applications to be untimely.
in their petition for review,abdulmunaem and salah disagree with the ij statement that a finding in their favor would render the requirement meaningless,contending that this assertion was offered without reason.they also argue that the ij did not adequately explain his conclusion that they did not file their applications within a reasonable time after.finally,abdulmunaem and salah assert that the bia opinion is not convincing and reflects the same lack of rationality as that of the immigration judge.
we find no merit in the due process arguments of abdulmunaem and salah.to begin with,abdulmunaem and salah have not shown that either the ij or the bia failed to afford them the due process of law.the explanations offered by the ij and the bia are thorough enough to allow us to meaningfully review their decisions.as demonstrated by the portion of the ij order quoted above,the ij adequately set forth the underlying facts and law,as well as the basis for his decision.similarly,the opinion of the bia demonstrates that the bia independently reviewed the record.the bia detailed the arguments of the parties and the findings of the ij,agreed with the conclusions of the ij,and exercised its lawful authority to issue a brief order affirming,modifying,or remanding the decision under review.e.such treatment does not constitute a denial of due process.see gishta gonzales,cir rejecting a similar claim and noting that e authorizes the bia to summarily affirm without opinion scorteanu ins,cir what is required is merely that the bia consider the issues raised,and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,even if abdulmunaem and salah had demonstrated a denial of due process,they have failed to show any resulting prejudice.failure to reconcile the general with abdulmunaem,salah,and najla does not constitute a change in circumstances.this failed reconciliation instead shows that circumstances have not changed abdulmunaem,najla,and salah remain estranged and under the threat of death from the general.we thus find unpersuasive abdulmunaem and salah argument that the exception applies to excuse their untimely applications for asylum.a remand would not result in a different outcome.abdulmunaem and salah have therefore failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the claimed constitutional errors.accordingly,we reject abdulmunaem and salah joint petition to review the denial of their applications for asylum.
withholding of removal 
the second issue raised by abdulmunaem and salah is whether the bia erred in affirming the ij determination that they were not entitled to the withholding of removal because they failed to demonstrate persecution on account of their membership in a particular social group.to be eligible for withholding of removal pursuant to the ina,an alien must establish that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina b a,b a.the alien must establish a clear probability of persecution,meaning that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution.ins stevic,d.thus,the burden of proof for demonstrating eligibility for the withholding of removal is more stringent than the burden for establishing eligibility for asylum,which requires only a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution.gilaj gonzales,cir quoting b i b.
the issue before us is whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the bia that abdulmunaem and salah were ineligible for the withholding of removal.this requires the resolution of two issues.first,we must consider whether the record compels a finding that abdulmunaem and salah were in fact members of a particular social group for purposes of the statute.see castellanochacon ins,cir setting forth the two factors for reviewing the denial of a claim for the withholding of removal.second,we must determine whether abdulmunaem and salah have presented sufficient evidence to compel a finding that they would,more likely than not,be persecuted on the basis of that membership.see id.same.
particular social group 
the bia has defined a particular social group as a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.in re acosta,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi.w hatever the common characteristic that defines the group,it must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.see also,at,adopting the bia definition of a social group and holding that tattooed youths fall outside of that definition.
since acosta,the bia has stated that the two key characteristics of a particular social group are particularity and social visibility.in re.the essence of the particularity requirement is whether the proposed group can accurately be described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized,in the society in question,as a discrete class of persons.id.at.social visibility,on the other hand,requires that the shared characteristic of the group should generally be recognizable by others in the community.id.at.the shared characteristic must be considered in the context of the country of concern and the persecution feared.id.at see also in re,noting that for the group to be viable,we believe there must also be some showing of how the characteristic is understood in the alien society,such that we,in turn,may understand that the potential persecutors in fact see persons sharing the characteristic as warranting suppression or the infliction of harm vacated and remanded by the attorney general on january,for reconsideration in light of the final rule proposed at,which was never finalized,and again remanded by the attorney general on september,to the bia to proceed as it sees fit with its reconsideration based on the current regulations,because the proposed rule has not been made final,att y.
