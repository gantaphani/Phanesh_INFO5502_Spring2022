the only question before us in this appeal is whether sherry detata lawsuit complaining of sex discrimination at the hands of her employer,rollprint packaging products,was filed too late.everyone agrees that she properly filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc the problem centers around what happened next.the eeoc dismissed detata case,and it mailed a letter,but that letter never reached detata and was returned to the agency as undeliverable.detata learned about the agency action only when she telephoned to check on her case.at that point,the eeoc the letter and a copy of her file she filed this suit within two months of receiving those materials.the district court,however,using the date of detata phone call as the beginning of the period in which she had to file her suit,granted rollprint motion to dismiss on the ground that her suit was untimely.we conclude that,under the facts of this case,the telephone call did not satisfy the notice requirements of f.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
detata tenure at rollprint was fleeting she worked there for only eight days before the company fired her without explanation.she alleges,however,that during that short time her male colleagues subjected her to sexual advances and inappropriate comments about her physical appearance.she asserts that she experienced a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment,which management condoned,fostered,and promoted.she complained about the conduct to her immediate supervisor,and rollprint fired her a few days later.
detata then contacted jewell bracko,the director of the american civil rights trust acrt,for assistance in drafting a letter to rollprint and in filing an eeoc charge.the record reveals very little about detata relationship with bracko it is not even clear whether detata ever hired bracko to represent her before the eeoc.rollprint insists that bracko acted as detata attorney and,to support its contention,it points to a letter that bracko sent to rollprint on detata behalf.in the letter,which bracko wrote on acrt letterhead and sent on july,the day after detata was fired,bracko instructs rollprint not to contact detata for any reason.the letter further instructs that any communication should be conducted through this office,and informs rollprint that a civil rights complaint has been filed through bracko office on behalf of sherry detata with the eeoc for sexual harassment and retaliation.in fact,as of then nothing had been filed.detata did not file her official charge with the eeoc until december,and bracko name does not appear on those papers.cutting against the inference that bracko was detata lawyer is the fact that on her intake questionnaire for the eeoc,detata listed bracko as a friend and provided his address and telephone number in response to the question asking for the name of a person we can contact if we are unable to reach you.and when asked if she had sought help about this situation from an attorney,or any other source,detata wrote that she contacted the american civil rights trust regarding the matter and was advised by council sic to file a complaint with the eeoc.
on march,the eeoc dismissed detata administrative claim and issued a letter.although the eeoc correctly prepared the letter with detata name and chicago address,it sent the letter only to bracko instead,using the acrt address in mississippi.but detata contends that bracko never received the letter after three delivery attempts on march,and,the letter was returned as undeliverable,and both the original letter and the envelope were placed in detata file.more evidence would be necessary before we knew whether bracko never received the letter,or if he just refused or failed to acknowledge receipt.given our disposition of the case,we need not resolve that question here.when detata later called the eeoc to inquire about her case,the eeoc employee she reached told her that the file was a mess,that the agency had dismissed her charge of discrimination,and that it had issued a letter.the eeoc employee was not able to answer all of detata questions nor to say with certainty when her letter had been issued,because the agency had misplaced her file.detata asked that the eeoc resend her letter and,if found,a copy of her file.there was some delay in sending these materials because it took the eeoc more than a month and a half to find detata file.the eeoc eventually sent the materials on june,with a cover letter stating that a lthough the rts period has expired,you submitted your request timely and the problem was that the file could not be located by our clerk.detata received the package a few days later it included a copy of the letter dated march.the letter stated that her lawsuit must be filed within days of your receipt of this notice.
detata filed a pro se complaint in federal court on august,asserting that rollprint violated title vii by creating a hostile work environment and by retaliating against her for complaining about the sexual harassment she experienced.see.et.in her complaint detata explained that due to a miscommunication by the eeoc her letter was not delivered when it should have been,and that this delay was why she had filed her suit after the notice expired.rollprint moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely because detata had filed suit days after the eeoc initially issued its letter in march,well beyond the days permitted by f.in response detata pointed to the eeoc mishandling of her administrative claim and her own diligent efforts to prosecute her case.to support her account of the eeoc missteps,detata submitted a declaration from tyrone irvin,an eeoc employee who had reviewed detata file.irvin stated that detata had contacted the eeoc in may,and she was informed then that her claim had been dismissed and that her letter had been issued in march.according to irvin,detata requested a copy of her investigative file when she called,but it was not sent until june,due to eeoc staffing issues.irvin also stated that an eeoc investigator had communicated with bracko during the investigation of detata complaint,but acknowledged that according to the eeoc records,in february,bracko informed the eeoc that he would be out of the country,in brazil,at least until the end of march.irvin declaration does not specify on what date in may detata called,nor does it identify who spoke with her or provide any other details about the conversation or bracko role in the case.
the district court conducted a hearing on rollprint motion on october.initially the court rejected rollprint timeliness objection because the court was actually satisfied from the submissions from the eeoc that detata has acted appropriately promptly.but rollprint insisted that the timeliness question was more complicated because irvin declaration demonstrated that detata had possessed actual knowledge that the eeoc issued her letter as early as may,when she phoned the agency.without citing to any legal authority,rollprint contended that the case law is clear that the receipt of the letter is not really the precipitating event.it her actual notice.although rollprint conceded that detata did not actually receive her letter until sometime in late june,the company maintained that oral notice was sufficient and that the crucial question was when in may she had contacted the eeoc.if detata called before may,rollprint argued,then her august suit was untimely.
this prompted the district court to seek clarification.it asked detata to identify when she had learned that a letter had been issued,not when she received a physical copy of the letter.detata,who was still pro se at that time,responded that she had learned about the letter when she telephoned the eeoc in late april to inquire about her file,though no one really knew the exact date the letter had been issued because the eeoc had misplaced her file for over a month.even if she spoke with someone at the eeoc in april,detata maintained,she could take their word for it if her notice was issued or not because her case had been so mishandled.the court did not ask detata
