this case involves a claim under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,which requires that students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education fape in the least restrictive environment possible.see a.sebastian is a disabled young man with mental retardation who was enrolled in a special education program run by the king philip regional school district.when he was twenty years old,his parents became dissatisfied with his public education and placed him in a private residential facility.an administrative hearing officer determined that sebastian parents were not entitled to recover the costs of sebastian private education,and the federal district court upheld that decision.see sebastian king philip reg l sch,d.we affirm.
we set forth the background facts as supportably found by the district court.see lessard wilton lyndeborough coop.sch,cir ex rel.five town cmty.sch,cir.sebastian was born in and began receiving special education services when he was three years old.these services continued after he entered the king philip public school system,which each year developed an individualized education program iep for him,as required by the idea.see a.in,when sebastian was twelve,he was transferred to the bi county educational collaborative bico,an organization established pursuant to.laws ch,to attend to special needs students from several public school districts.the king philip school system remained responsible for sebastian education throughout his time at bico and continued to develop his annual ieps in consultation with his parents and educators.at bico,sebastian received vocational training through the work lab i,work lab ii,and life roles transition programs.his work experiences included assembling pizza boxes at a restaurant,performing light janitorial work,stamping paychecks,and helping out at an autobody shop.sebastian also received instruction in basic mathematics and personal hygiene,and he learned to use the dial a ride program to reach his work sites 
in,sebastian first year at bico,he displayed significant difficulties with several aspects of fine motor functioning,according to an occupational therapy assessment.a reevaluation conducted in the spring of,when sebastian was sixteen,indicated that his active upper extremity range of motion and strength we re both within functional limits and that he was progressing nicely with typing skills.however,sebastian continued to demonstrate and deficits,as well as deficits in receptive language skills.his language arts abilities were equivalent to a first or level,and he operated at a level in mathematics.
progress reports for the,and school years showed that sebastian was making steady progress pursuant to his ieps.for example,in november,sebastian was able to decode words at a level,and could write a five or paragraph with the use of a graphic organizer and teacher assistance.he was then seventeen years old.by june,sebastian was able to use inferential logic,with some support,to predict outcomes and solve problems,and he was show ing improvement in his ability to sound out long,unfamiliar words.he also was making strides in counting out his lunch money,and figuring out what change he should receive.
evaluations conducted in may noted that sebastian had a difficult time with both body and spatial awareness and that his visual tracking of a moving manipulative was very poor.however,sebastian was comfortable using public transportation to reach his work sites,scored at a level in word recognition and computational skills,and had learned to identify of forty safety signs,such as wet paint and fire alarm.in addition,he had demonstrated slight gains over previous testing in receptive language skills and had made a two year jump in pragmatic language skills.
despite these gains,sebastian parents became frustrated by what they perceived as poor communication from bico,and they questioned why sebastian was unable to replicate at home the achievements described in his progress reports.they also worried that sebastian was not developing independent living skills and that his increasingly aggressive behavior at home was attributable to inadequate supervision at bico.
after the academic year,sebastian parents began pressing the king philip school system to remove sebastian from bico and place him in a residential program.beginning in june,they rejected a series of ieps proposed by the school system that offered alternative accommodations,such as increased emphasis on independent living skills,weekly occupational therapy sessions,and activities.when negotiations broke down in december,sebastian parents notified the school system that they intended to unilaterally withdraw sebastian from bico.on january,sebastian began attending the cardinal cushing school,a private residential facility.sebastian parents then invoked their statutory right to an administrative due process hearing before the massachusetts bureau of special education appeals bsea,see f a,seeking reimbursement for the costs of sebastian private education,as well as compensatory services they claimed were necessitated by the failures of the king philip school system.the school system answered that sebastian parents were not entitled to the relief sought,because its proposed ieps had offered sebastian a fape in the least restrictive environment possible,as required by the idea.
a bsea hearing was held over six days between september,and january.the administrative hearing officer compiled a comprehensive record describing the nature of sebastian disabilities and documenting his educational history.on january,the hearing officer issued a lengthy decision largely favorable to the school system.in the hearing officer view,the ieps proposed by the school system complied with the idea insofar as they were reasonably calculated to permit sebastian to make meaningful progress.as a result,the school system had no financial responsibility for sebastian private education.the hearing officer explained,however,that the school system had not consistently implemented sebastian previous ieps and had,on more than an occasional number of times,assigned him tasks that were too difficult for him to complete.accordingly,the school system had to offer sebastian limited compensatory services in the form of updated evaluations and a transition plan to guide his eventual departure from the cardinal cushing school.
sebastian and his parents sought judicial review of the hearing officer decision by filing suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,see i a,naming as defendants the king philip school system and the massachusetts department of elementary and secondary education.the school system did not appeal.after both sides filed motions for summary judgment,the district court ruled against sebastian and his parents.see sebastian,d at.upholding the hearing officer decision,the district court noted that sebastian had made meaningful progress at bico under his previous ieps and likely would have continued to make such progress if the proposed ieps had been implemented.see id.at.this appeal followed.
a state receiving federal funds under the idea must offer every disabled child within its jurisdiction a fape in the least restrictive environment possible.see a.if a state is unable to provide a disabled child with a fape through a public school placement,it may be obliged to subsidize the child in a private program.see ex rel.elizabeth esposito,cir,at.
the primary vehicle for delivery of a fape is an iep,at quoting lessard,at.an iep must be to suit a particular child,see bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley,d,and must include,at a bare minimum,the child present level of educational attainment,the short and goals for his or her education,objective criteria with which to measure progress toward those goals,and the specific services to be offered,lessard,at.however,an iep need not be designed to furnish a disabled child with the maximum educational benefit possible.see,at.to comply with the idea,an iep need only be reasonably calculated to confer a meaningful educational benefit.id.
