this matter comes before us on from the district court ruling on a petition for interim injunctive relief sought by the national labor relations board nlrb pursuant to j of the national labor relations act nlra,j.for nearly forty years,since eisenberg ex rel.hartz mountain,cir,we have held that to award interim injunctive relief under j a federal district court must merely find reasonable cause to believe an unfair labor practice has occurred and must determine that the relief sought is just and proper.kobell suburban lines,cir.the district court in this case,following a thoughtful discussion of pertinent precedents,determined that our approach was inconsistent with pronouncements of the supreme court dating back nearly thirty years,to weinberger romerobarcelo,d.see chester ex rel.grane health care,d,wl,at.june.applying the familiar test applicable to generic preliminary injunction motions likelihood of success on the merits imminent threat of irreparable harm balance of equities favoring interim injunctive relief and the public interest being served by the interim relief the district court granted the requested interim bargaining order but denied the requested interim hiring of several aggrieved individuals.having carefully considered the matter,we conclude that the supreme court decisions upon which the district court relied,having arisen in completely different contexts and involving statutory schemes unrelated to the nlra,do not warrant abrogation of our approach to j petitions.furthermore,we will affirm the interim bargaining order issued by the district court,as plainly compelled under the approach.as to the requested interim hiring orders,however,we believe that the district court should,in the first instance,determine whether such relief is appropriate under our approach.
facts and proceedings 
prior to january,cambria county,pennsylvania owned and operated laurel crest nursing and rehabilitation center laurel crest,a facility located in ebensburg,pennsylvania.all of the employees of laurel crest were employed by cambria county,who as a public employer was subject to the pennsylvania state public employee relations act pera.since its certification in by the pennsylvania labor relations board,the professional and public service employees of cambria county laborers district council of western pennsylvania,local local was the representative of a unit of nonprofessional employees employed by cambria county at laurel crest.cambria county recognized local as the exclusive bargaining representative of the unit,and entered into a series of agreements with local,the most recent of which ended in december.
in september,appellant grane healthcare grane,a private entity that owns and manages several pennsylvania nursing facilities,entered into an asset purchase agreement with cambria county to purchase laurel crest.on january,the purchase became final,and grane assumed operations of laurel crest in december,grane officials conducted the initial hiring,and retained most,but not all,of the individuals who had been employed at laurel crest by cambria county and who applied to be hired by grane.among the former laurel crest employees not hired by grane were several local officers,including sherry hagerich,who was the local president,and mark mulhearn,who was a business manager of local.
in december,in anticipation of the impending sale,local requested by email that grane recognize local as the exclusive representative of the nonprofessional employees at laurel crest.by letter dated january,grane refused the local request.local then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the board.
in may,following an investigation of the charge,the board general counsel,through robert chester,the acting regional director of region director,issued a complaint and notice of hearing against grane,asserting multiple unfair labor practices in violation of a,and of the nlra,a,and.the complaint contended,inter alia,that grane refusal to recognize and bargain with local as the representative of a bargaining unit of employees was a violation of a and of the act and grane failure to hire certain applicants,including mark mulhearn and sherry hagerich,was a violation of a and of the act grane denied all of the alleged violations of the act in july and august of,administrative law judge david goldman alj goldman conducted hearings on the unfair labor practice charges.
on august,the director petitioned the district court for temporary injunctive relief pursuant to j of the act.the director requested,in pertinent part,that the judge order grane to recognize and bargain in good faith with local and reinstate hagerich and mulhearn.
the district court decided the petition on the basis of the record developed by alj goldman in the administrative proceeding below including the testimony and exhibits produced at the hearings as well as the parties factual stipulations supplemented by testimony and arguments adduced at an evidentiary hearing the district court conducted.in december,well before the court ruled on the j petition,alj goldman issued his decision in the administrative proceedings the district court observed that it was not bound to follow alj goldman conclusions,and explained that t his administrative record and decision is,at best,characterized as persuasive.chester,wl at.applying the test governing preliminary injunction motions,the district court granted the interim bargaining order but denied the interim instatement of hagerich and mulhearn.
both parties now appeal.grane appeals the temporary bargaining order,contending that the district court committed error in concluding that the test was satisfied.the director on two grounds.first,he contends that the district court erred by rejecting our established test and applying the test instead.second,he argues that the j petition qualified for injunctive relief under either the or test,and that the district court therefore erred by declining to grant the interim instatement order.
ii.standard for j injunctive relief 
we begin our analysis by addressing the threshold issue of whether the district court erred in concluding that supreme court precedent vitiates our established test for j relief.the issue of whether a district court applied the correct legal standard is a legal question,which this court reviews de novo.ahearn jackson hosp,cir.
congress vested primary jurisdiction over the elaboration of labor policy and the adjudication of labor disputes in the nlrb.see,truck drivers local union,d the function of striking the balance between conflicting legitimate interests to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility,which the congress committed primarily to the national labor relations board,subject to limited judicial review.phelps dodge.the exercise of the process of administering the act was committed to the board,subject to limited judicial review.because the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence,courts must not enter the allowable area of the board discretion and must guard against the danger of sliding unconsciously from the narrow confines of law into the more spacious domain of policy.the nlra provides for the adjudication of alleged unfair labor practices through an administrative process that involves initial and determination of the charges by an alj,whose decision is reviewable de novo by the board.the act vests courts of appeals and in certain circumstances the district courts with judicial review of final board decisions under a standard that requires considerable deference to various board determinations.see e,f.
as originally enacted in,the nlra did not include any provision authorizing the board to seek to enjoin alleged unfair labor practices pending adjudication of charges by the board thus,unfair labor practices by both unions and employers could persist while administrative processes were pursued.congress sought to remedy this problem in the taft hartley act of by mandating that the board seek interim injunctive relief in an appropriate district court for certain enumerated unfair labor practices by unions,such as secondary boycotts,jurisdictional strikes and hot cargo contracts,see l,and by authorizing,but not requiring,the board to seek interim injunctive relief for other unfair labor practices.see j.specifically j,added in,provides 
the board shall have power,upon issuance of a complaint as provided in subsection b of this section charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice,to petition any united states district court,within any district wherein the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or wherein such person resides or transacts business,for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.upon the filing of any such petition the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person,and thereupon shall have jurisdiction to grant to the board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.
j.the senate report on the bill that became j explains the purposes of this section and the concerns that motivated it as follows 
t he committee is convinced that additional procedures must be made available under the national labor relations act in order adequately to protect the public welfare time is usually of the essence in j cases,and consequently the relatively slow procedure of the board hearing and order,followed many months later by an enforcing decree of the circuit court of appeals,falls short of achieving the desired objectives of the free flow of commerce and encouragement of the practice and procedure of free private collective bargaining.hence we have provided that the board,acting in the public interest and not in vindication of purely private rights,may seek injunctive relief in the case of all types of unfair labor practices experience under the national labor relations act has demonstrated that by reason of lengthy hearing and litigation enforcing its order,the board had not been able in some instances to correct unfair labor practices until after some substantial injury has been done i t has sometimes been possible for persons violating the act to accomplish their unlawful objective before being placed under any legal restraint and thereby to make it impossible or not feasible to restore or preserve the status quo pending litigation.
in addressing for the first time the proper application of section j in hartz mountain,at,we found guidance in schauffler highway truck drivers helpers,local,cir.in schauffler,we held that to warrant l relief,a district court must find that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the nlra as charged has been committed,id.at,and that a proper exercise of judicial discretion warrants interim injunctive relief.id.in hartz mountain,we adopted the same two part approach for j petitions reasonable cause to believe that the alleged unfair labor practice was committed and relief that is just and proper,stressing that deciding what relief,if any,was just and proper would be of critical importance when relief is sought under section j hartz mountain,at.
since hartz mountain,we have consistently adhered to the standard,see,eisenberg ex rel.wellington hall nursing home,cir hirsch dorsey trailers,cir,elaborating on the reasonable cause prong in suburban lines,at,and the just and proper prong in pascarell ex rel.vibra screw,cir.we are joined by the fifth,sixth,tenth and eleventh circuits in applying this test to j petitions.see overstreet el paso disposal,cir upholding its sequential,inquiry for j injunctive relief ahearn,at the prevailing standard district courts in the sixth circuit employ when considering a j petition is the reasonable and proper standard.sharp ex rel.webco industries,cir recognizing the test as the standard for district courts in that circuit to apply to grant j relief arlook ex rel.lichtenberg,cir same.
other courts of appeals,including the fourth,seventh,eighth,and ninth,have rejected the approach,and interpret j just and proper clause as requiring the traditional equitable framework that courts apply to grant preliminary injunctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.see,muffley ex rel.spartan mining,cir kinney pioneer press,cir sharp parents in cmty.action,cir miller california pac.med,cir en banc.the first and second circuits apply a hybrid standard they apply the,reasonable and proper test,but expressly incorporate the four equitable criteria into the just and proper prong.see,pye ex rel.sullivan.printers,cir when deciding whether injunctive relief is just and proper the district court must apply the familiar,test for granting preliminary relief.hoffman inn credible caterers,cir in this circuit,injunctive relief under j is just and proper when it is necessary to prevent irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo.while this standard preserves the traditional equitable principles governing injunctive relief,we are mindful to apply them in the context of federal labor laws.citations omitted.
under our internal operating procedures,a panel of this court can not overrule an earlier binding panel decision only the entire court sitting en banc can do so.see third circuit however,a panel of our court may decline to follow a prior decision of our court without the necessity of an en banc decision when the prior decision conflicts with a supreme court decision.united states tann,cir.see also united states singletary,cir o ur respect for the uniformity of decisions within this court yields when a prior panel holding conflicts with a holding of the supreme court.planned parenthood of casey,cir,aff in part,rev in part,d a change by the supreme court in the legal test or standard governing a particular area is a change binding on lower courts that makes results reached under a repudiated legal standard no longer binding.reich sabia,cir cox dravo,cir we should not countenance the continued application in this circuit of a rule,even of our own devising,which is patently inconsistent with the supreme court pronouncements.
the district court concluded that the supreme court decisions in romero barcelo and winter natural resources defense council,d,require application of the traditional equitable test.in romero barcelo,the governor of puerto rico and residents of the island sought to enjoin the navy use of an island off the puerto rican coast for weapons training exercises,claiming that the occasional discharge of weapons harmed the water quality,and that because the navy had not obtained a permit,its conduct violated the permit requirements of the federal water pollution control act fwpca,et.see at.the first circuit held that the fwpca requires a district court to immediately enjoin conduct in violation of the permit requirements and thereby preclude the exercise of traditional equitable discretion.id.in reversing this decision,the court emphasized that the judicial authority to grant injunctive relief is fundamentally rooted in principles of equity the court has repeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.id.at.the court confirmed the test,which incorporates these equitable considerations,as the applicable standard for injunctive relief.id.at.in this regard,it described the high standard for overcoming the presumption that the test applies unless a statute,in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.id.at quoting porter warner holding.
the court reiterated this point in winter.in that case,environmental groups sought to enjoin the navy from conducting sonar training exercises off the coast of southern california on the ground that the sonar devices harmed marine mammals.at.despite the absence of any evidence that marine mammals had been harmed by the navy training exercises,id.at,the district court granted the injunction and the ninth circuit affirmed based on a possibility of irreparable injury,cir.in overturning the injunction,the court reaffirmed the equitable requirements,asserting that plaintiffs must satisfy them to qualify for injunctive relief.at.in this respect,the court rejected the ninth circuit standard as too lenient,holding that irreparable injury must be likely in the absence of an injunction,because a lower standard of a mere possibility is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.id.at.
the district court in the present matter opined that these two cases suggest a clear and consistent message to the lower courts courts are to apply the traditional test in the absence of a necessary and inescapable congressional intent to depart from traditional equitable standards.j lacks such intent.chester,wl at citing romero barcelo,at.in our view,neither romero barcelo nor winter present a conflict with our j rulings sufficient to enable us to reverse nearly forty years of precedent.
first,neither romero barcelo nor winter involved statutory schemes analogous to the nlra.notwithstanding the broad language endorsing the primacy of the test,the court rendered its decisions in those cases on facts that presented the standard scenario for courts granting injunctive relief.in both cases,plaintiffs sought injunctions from district courts that also had full jurisdiction to decide the merits of the alleged statutory violations.see romerobarcelo,at winter,at.in the context of such generic circumstances,where the courts jurisdiction over the merits was not otherwise restricted,the court had no occasion to qualify or condition its broad affirmation of the full scope of equity discretion.
nothing in these cases suggests that the court contemplated the relatively unusual scenario of interim injunctive relief in the context of a pending unfair labor practice proceeding.in light of the purposes behind this provision and the act,we believe that the holdings in romero barcelo and winter do not extend to the j context.indeed,the nlra erects a unique statutory scheme it authorizes district courts to grant interim injunctive relief in labor dispute cases,an entire category over which they have no jurisdiction to decide the merits.instead,congress designated the nlrb as the entity with the requisite expertise in unfair labor practices,and the merits of those claims are adjudicated through an administrative process that is largely independent of the courts.
this specialized scheme distinguishes j injunctive relief from the generic context,where district courts determine whether to grant relief in cases over which they possess both the jurisdiction and competence to decide the merits.congress clear purpose in creating j was not to limit the scope of the board authority to decide violations,but to preserve its powers to do so by giving the nlrb an opportunity to seek an injunction of alleged violations before an injury becomes permanent or the board remedial purpose becomes meaningless.
moreover,the board does not seek interim equitable relief to vindicate private rights,but acts instead in the public interest see vibra screw,at.this factor also distinguishes j petitions from ordinary preliminary injunction motions.section j does not so expand the scope of the district court role in labor disputes as to permit it to intrude upon the board exclusive authority to decide the merits of the cases.the legislative scheme is therefore inconsistent with a full grant of equity jurisdiction to the district courts,which would permit them to exercise their own discretion in evaluating the likelihood of success on the merits,thereby infringing on the province of the board.we do not believe the court intended its decisions in romero barcelo or winter to extend to the context of such a distinct statutory scheme.we therefore conclude that those cases are not conflicting authorities that require us to reverse our established precedent.
notably,three of our sister circuits have retained the test in spite of romero barcelo and winter.in overstreet,the fifth circuit rejected arguments advanced in the respondent briefs that romero barcelo required the test.at brief of appellant at,overstreet el paso disposal,cir.the court distinguished j from other injunctive relief when it observed that the traditional rules of equity may not control the proper scope of j relief,and explained a requirement to make the nlrb show irreparable harm and likelihood of success for j relief would raise the factual threshold that the nlrb must reach.nothing in our case law supports replacing the test we currently use with a test that incorporates the traditional test for equitable relief.at quoting boire pilot freight carriers,cir.see also ahearn,at if the current j standard were in clear contravention of supreme court precedent,it seems unlikely that this or any other circuit would have continued to adhere to it for two decades without concern.webco,at w e will not reconsider this circuit longstanding angle test in favor of a traditional equitable analysis.
indeed,even those courts of appeals that have viewed romero barcelo and winter as requiring the equitable test for j relief have made modifications to the test to accommodate the purposes and goals of the nlra.for example,the ninth circuit has explained that courts must consider the four equitable criteria through the prism of the underlying purpose of j,which is to protect the integrity of the collective bargaining process and to preserve the board remedial power while it processes the charge.miller,at.the miller court also observed that it is necessary to factor in the district court lack of jurisdiction over unfair labor practices,and the deference accorded to nlrb determinations by the courts of appeals.id.at.accordingly,that court holds that the board can make a threshold showing of likelihood of success by producing some evidence to support the unfair labor practice charge,together with an arguable legal theory.id.
the fourth circuit,holding that romero barcelo required it to apply the test to j,was careful to note but,of course,district courts should apply this test in light of the underlying purpose of j preserving the board remedial power pending the outcome of its administrative proceedings.spartan mining,at.see also bloedorn francisco foods,cir but,in evaluating the likelihood of success,it is not the district court responsibility,nor is it ours,to rule on the merits of the director complaint that is the board province.the court inquiry is confined to the probability that the director will prevail.similarly,the second circuit,which applies a hybrid test,follows the same considerations when applying the test under its just and proper prong.see,hoffman,at.
thus,even the courts that follow romero barcelo account for the relatively unique context and purposes of j,and none interprets the court precedent as permitting the district courts to have full equity jurisdiction in this context.if even the courts of appeals that apply the traditional four factors for preliminary injunctions to this context do not do so strictly,we comfortably conclude that the supreme court rulings do not so clearly conflict with our precedent as to mandate our abrogation of that precedent.
even assuming arguendo that the court decisions apply to j relief,we do not believe that our standard is necessarily incompatible with the requirements of the traditional test.the district court opined that our approach to j petitions fails to encompass the quartet of considerations ordinarily governing preliminary injunction motions.the court explicated the third circuit j standard does not even require a showing of a possibility of harm only a showing of reasonable cause that a labor violation occurred.chester,wl at.it also asserted that the test does not take into account the public interest or a balancing of harms the third circuit standard,other than references to just and proper remedies,does not explicitly countenance these two crucial equitable factors.id.it further claimed,u nder the third circuit precedents,no showing of harm is required,id.at,and merely a showing of reasonable cause that a labor violation occurred is sufficient to issue an injunction,if said relief is just and proper.id.
the district court conclusions about the test misapprehend our guidance with respect to district court consideration of j petitions.in this regard,it is simply not true that the test only requires reasonable cause to believe the director will prevail before the board.quite to the contrary,the test incorporates various considerations that correspond to each of the winter factors.
as an initial matter,it bears explaining that the reasonable cause analysis is not the deferential rubber stamp that the district court and grane characterize it to be.to establish reasonable cause in the third circuit,there must be a substantial,legal theory,implicit or explicit,in the board argument,and second,taking the facts favorably to the board,there must be sufficient evidence to support that theory.vibra screw,at.significantly,the circuits that apply the test use a substantially similar standard.see,miller,at.
moreover,t he chancellor does not abdicate his powers merely upon a showing that the regional director theories surpass frivolity.he maintains some power to do equity and mold each decree to the necessities of the case.pilot freight carriers,at citation omitted.in other words,the j inquiry necessarily subsumes equitable considerations.webco,at.
the standard we use to determine whether injunctive relief would be just and proper is informed by the policies underlying j,dorsey trailers,at,looking in particular to the general communication the bodies were attempting to send to the courts and the public in passing the relevant act.suburban lines,at.in fashioning this provision,congress sought to ensure that the board would be able to exercise effectively its ultimate remedial power.eisenberg ex rel.lenape products,cir.t he focus in a j determination is on the public interest,and the unusual likelihood of ultimate remedial failure by the nlrb.dorsey trailers,at citation omitted quoting suburban lines,at.see also vibra screw,at t he critical determination is whether,absent an injunction,the board ability to facilitate peaceful negotiation will be impaired.lenape products,at t he district court must find that the issuance of an injunction is just and proper,i,that it is in the public interest to grant the injunction,so as to effectuate the policies of the national labor relations act or to fulfill the remedial function of the board.citing wellington hall,at.
therefore,the goal of preserving the board ultimate remedial power guides the courts to focus on whether the ongoing practices would create irreparable harms,injuries that could not be remedied by the board final decision.in conducting this inquiry,the courts weigh the same kinds of harms that factor into the traditional equitable test.they consider the likelihood of harm to the bargaining process,dorsey trailers,at citation omitted,and the overall public interest in the promot ion of wholesome and mutually acceptable labor relations and the settlement of labor disputes through collective bargaining between employees and their employer.vibra screw,at citation omitted.in evaluating the net benefits of injunctive relief,the courts also weigh the relative harms it may prevent against the harms it may produce.id.at evaluating how the chilling effect of management retaliation may outlast the curative effects of any remedial action the board might take.the courts do not only weigh the harms to the board,but also the harms injunctive relief poses to the employer.see,wellington hall,at.
indeed,we have denied injunctive relief where we found insufficient evidence of irreparable harm,making interim equitable relief not just and proper.see,suburban lines,at hartz mountain,at.for instance,we affirmed the denial of j relief in suburban lines because failure to grant interim reinstatement relief could not produce irreparable injury and erroneously granted interim relief would irreparably injure certain employees and the respondent in that case.at.in lenape products,at,we held that j relief was not warranted because there was no evidence that union activity would be chilled and because the size and intimacy of the group of the employees who walked out was such that if the board ultimately orders reinstatement,its organizational efforts could be resumed.
in summary,the test does incorporate equitable factors into its analysis that other circuits consider when applying the test to j relief.the reasonable cause prong has substantial overlap with the inquiry.likewise,the just and proper prong collapses the other three equitable factors into one comprehensive analysis.under this inquiry,the court determines whether an injunction is necessary to preserve the board remedial powers,which incorporates a weighing of relative harms to the bargaining process,employees rights,and the likelihood of restoring the status quo absent injunctive relief,along with the public interests implicated by the labor disputes.in light of these substantial similarities,we think that even if the court decisions in romero barcelo and winter apply to the context of j relief,our test substantially complies with the requirements insofar as it does analyze each of the equitable factors.
the primary difference is that the test accommodates the purposes of j by granting a sufficient measure of deference to the board to prevent the district court from overstepping its bounds and deciding the merits of alleged unfair labor practices.as this court has explained,the just and proper standard in j is intended to limit the district court role the phrase just and proper is a method of cabining the otherwise unfettered discretion of the district court to fashion labor law under section j wholly according to its own notions of fairness and efficiency.suburban lines,at.see also ahearn,at a district court also must be mindful that p roceedings pursuant to j are subordinate to the unfair labor practice proceedings to be heard before the board.consequently,it is not the job of the district court,in considering a j petition,to adjudicate the merits of the unfair labor practice case.citation omitted quoting fleischut nixon detroit diesel,cir.accordingly,the district court erred in rejecting our test for j petitions.
iii.merits of j petition 
interim bargaining order 
having concluded that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard to the director j petition,we turn now to consider whether the court erred in granting the interim bargaining order.although the district court applied the incorrect standard in evaluating the director j petition,we find it unnecessary to remand this issue for analysis under the test,which involves analysis of similar factors under a less strict standard we think the undisputed facts on the record show that the interim bargaining order is plainly warranted under the test.
reasonable cause 
to establish reasonable cause to believe that the director is likely to prevail on his claim,we must find that this claim is based on a legal theory that is substantial and not frivolous and that the facts,when taken in a favorable light to the board,are sufficient to support that theory.vibra screw,at.in evaluating reasonable cause,we are mindful that it is not our role to adjudicate the merits of the underlying claim.
under a of the act,an employer has a duty to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees,subject to the provisions of section a of this title.a.a new employer has a duty under a to bargain with the incumbent union that represented the predecessor employees when there is a substantial continuity between the predecessor and successor enterprises.fall river dyeing finishing,d this includes such continuity of the workforce that the new employer would confront the same union representing most of the same employees in the same unit.burns int l sec,d.the question of whether there is reasonable cause to believe that grane conduct constitutes an unfair labor practice depends on whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the director will prevail on his claim that grane is a legal successor to cambria county,and therefore had a duty to recognize and bargain with local.
grane does not dispute that the facts on the re
