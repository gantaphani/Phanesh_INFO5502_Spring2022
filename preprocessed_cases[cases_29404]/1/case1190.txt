petitioners,igli filja,his wife,luljeta filja,and his son,endrit filja petition for review of a february,decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia or board denying petitioners motion to reopen a previous decision of the board affirming an immigration judge ij decision denying petitioners requests for asylum and withholding of deportation.we hold that the bia misinterpreted the time limitation found in c ii for motions to reopen due to changed country conditions and that its denial of the motion on other grounds was an abuse of discretion.we will grant the petition and remand the matter to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
filja was lawfully admitted to the united states on september.his wife and son were lawfully admitted on november.in,they filed a request for asylum in the united states based on prior persecution and a fear of future persecution if forced to return to their native country,albania.
a.the ij hearing on june,the ij held a hearing on petitioners applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.filja was the only witness,and what follows is a summary of his testimony.
after he completed high school in,filja,because of his and his family suspected opposition to the governing communist party,was not permitted to obtain higher education.in,through the intervention of a relative of his father,he obtained a job as a printer.the relative was a supporter of the communist party.feeling sorry for filja even though filja was a supporter of democratic principles the relative used his influence to obtain a position for him at the party newspaper called zeri i of the people.filja was relegated to the disfavored night shift and worked six nights a week.
there came a time in when filja met with to workers to discuss their low wages,housing,the politics of the government and lies that the government was printing in the newspaper.the next day he and several others who had spoken that night were taken to the secret police.the police informed them we hope these things will never repeat.on september,filja again spoke to a group of workers and was again called in for questioning.he was handcuffed for three and hours and was told he was causing a revolution inside the company,which could cause him a lifetime in jail.
despite the threat,filja promised to speak to the people again on january,a promise he carried out.instead of calling him into the police station,the authorities,who held positions in both the printing company and the government,took another tack.on june,they sent him and the three others who spoke at the meetings to canada,purportedly to receive training upon a high speed,printing machine which the newspaper was purchasing for from a canadian company called new concepts.when the four men arrived in canada they found no new machine,and filja was put to work for ten hours a day as a cleaner and folding newspapers.
in,the four were instructed to return to albania.at that time filja believed that the canadian assignment was a ploy to provide cover for the newspaper officers in albania who,filja speculated,had absconded with the appropriated for the purchase of the press.he also believed that upon the return of the four men to albania they would be arrested and charged with the theft.the four men refused to return to albania.
filja described a political change that took place after his refusal to return from canada.he and his companions had left for canada on june.at that time the socialist party which in became successor to the communist party was in power and owned and controlled the paper.in his original asylum application filja based his asylum request upon his opposition to the socialist party.the democratic party,which he supported,was out of power,and its members were under continuing attack by the socialist party.
in late,however,several months after filja refused to return from canada,the democratic party took control of the government,but the police and secret police still contained supporters of the socialist party.although the democratic party destroyed the company that owned zeri i popullit,it sold the paper to the same people who owned it socialists.
filja applied for asylum in canada,which was denied in.three months after the denial he obtained a visa and entered the united states on september.
about a month before the ij hearing there occurred a series of events that caused filja further concern.his father,who continued to live in albania,was served with what purported to be a warrant for filja arrest on charges of having caused serious damage to the state in the amount of by not returning to his duties.the father sent a copy of the warrant to filja,who received it two weeks before the hearing.this inspired new fears in filja mind,namely,that he was being pursued not only by the socialists but also by the democratic party,which,because he had worked for the socialist zeri i popullit,had concluded that he was a socialist.at the hearing filja attorney filed a supplemental statement to reflect this fear,and the ij admitted a photocopy of the warrant and a translation into evidence.
the ij january,opinion set forth the events substantially as filja testified about them.the ij stated with respect to the arrest warrant 
this document was submitted by the service to the embassy in tirana.in a fax communication signed by the honorable consul susan lively,the document in question turns out to be fraudulent.
thereupon the ij concluded that 
respondent story never happened at all.i feel that after seeing his date of arrival and his wife and son,the date when the travel documents were issued,that the respondents planned very carefully their departure from albania.respondent reasons for coming to the usa in my opinion are not related to his political activities,which i find never happened at all,but to personal reasons probably dealing with their wishes to reside and work in the usa.
respondent testimony lacks in credibility and it is rejected as incoherent and implausible,short of calling it a total fabrication in an attempt to convince the court to grant this application for asylum.
in accordance with his opinion,the ij ordered that the applications for asylum and withholding of deportation be denied.on march,the filjas appealed to the bia.
in june,the socialist party returned to power in albania.this occurred after the ij january opinion and well before the decision of the bia on the filjas appeal.
b.the bia appeal in a march,opinion the bia rejected the ij credibility determination.it held that the fact that the arrest warrant may have been fraudulent did not provide a basis for a finding that filja testimony was incredible,because the consul fax was submitted after the close of the hearing it had not been admitted into evidence and there was no indication that the ij provided filja with an opportunity to rebut it further,the bia found the ij comments about filja motivation for coming to the united states were speculative in nature and did not support a finding of incredibility.consequently,it did not affirm the ij adverse credibility finding.
nevertheless,the bia concluded that filja experiences in albania did not rise to the level of persecution.addressing filja assertion that he was being framed by his former employer by a charge of theft of,the bia found that 
even assuming the validity of the arrest warrant which the respondent himself placed into evidence,on its face the document does not squarely corroborate his claim of being accused of misappropriating or stealing in company funds.to the extent the respondent may be subject to punishment for not returning to work at his former place of employment,resulting in financial loss to the company,it has not been persuasively established that any such action taken against him would be imposed on account of a ground protected by the immigration and nationality act.
the bia determined that the filjas had failed to establish past persecution or a fear or clear probability of persecution in albania based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,actual or imputed.it dismissed the appeal.
motion to reopen on october,the filjas moved before the bia to reopen the proceedings on the grounds that there had been changed conditions in albania,and that filja was deprived of his due process rights as a consequence of his former counsel ineffective assistance.he also sought protection under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the cat.in support of the motion filja submitted a greater than page record consisting of filja and his wife affidavits documents evidencing past persecution of filja family by the affidavits of persons having personal knowledge of the family past persecution,filja activities on behalf of the democratic party,and filja assignment to the canadian printing press project and eight reports of the state department,human rights watch,and amnesty international describing continuing persecution by the albanian police and secret police of those supporting the principles of the democratic party.the record contains evidence supporting filja contention that because of the ineffectiveness of his attorney his case was not fully presented at his june,hearing before the ij.
the changed condition upon which filja based his motion was the june return to power of the socialist party.filja relied on the record he submitted to support the significance of that event and the effect it would have upon him and his family.
in his own affidavit filja describes the treatment his family suffered at the hands of the communist regime after it came to power when albania was liberated in.previously they had been prosperous.his maternal grandfather had been a first captain of the king zog regime.the communists seized their property,executed a number of the family members,interned some and deported others from their homes to work camps.two relatives escaped to the united states and have been granted asylum.in his affidavit,filja describes his family and his own participation in the democratic party,formed to oppose the communist party successor,the socialist party.he participated in toppling the statue of dictator enver hoxha on june,and ten days later left the country for canada on the mission to purchase the printing press for the socialist party paper,zeri i popullit.he informed a leader of the democratic party of the project before leaving for canada,and once in canada decided to remain.prior to his ij hearing he learned of the arrest warrant that had been delivered to his father,and,believing it to be genuine,submitted it as evidence.he later learned that it was false and was prepared by his at the paper to get him back to albania.
the exhibits include authenticated official certificates of the execution and imprisonment of filja relatives for opposing the communist regime.
filja wife affidavit recited that after filja had been in canada for three months,he telephoned her that he was not going to return.having no means of support,she went to live with her family.people from zeri i popullit came to her father and filja father to seek information about filja,and threatened her,stating,if you not going to talk to igli filja about the situation you and your son are going to pay the price and igli is not going to see his son again.she stated that unknown people attacked her,her son and her brother.she attributed the attack to those who threatened her on account of filja continued absence.we were coming out from my father house.my brother was the first one to get out.he was hit by a motorcycle.my son and i were fine.
the brother remained in a coma in a hospital for three months,but survived.fearing for her and her child lives,luljeta filja went to a friend in the democratic party,niazi kosovrasti,and sought his help obtaining a visa.he was successful,and she was able to travel to the united states in.kosovrasti,of local power in the democratic party from till,submitted a declaration dated november.it reads 
filja igli,descend from an intellectual family with democratic progressive convictions.with the coming at the power of communism in,his family was persecuted from the dictatorial regiment confiscated his properties and than imprisoning,shootings,deportations his closed members of the family.so,in is shouted with the deputies group,karbunara hysen son of sheh and his father,going on with the deportation of shehu drita who was like a parent for file suzana,igli mother.
in this atmosphere is growing up and educated filja igli,who in younger age felt by himself the pressure of communism dictatorship which not only have prisoned and persecute his relatives,but even himself denied from many social rights.he was not allowed to continue university studies,but was offered to him a difficult job,only night shift.
i have been introduced personally to file igli later during the years as a noted activist of the democratic movement in albania.he have worked for the dissemination of democratic ideas in the youth rank of the neighborhood where he lived.also,he took part in all the demonstrations that democratic party organized during the years.
in july igli went to canada with a mechanics group who will remove machinery of a printing office which social government had brought for the production of the communist newspaper zeri i popullit.igli did make this service to the communist.igli left canada and went to america.from july to march,when democratic party won the general parliamentary elections,his wife and family have been threaten from the communists.his wife,filja luljeta in the end of year,came to me,in the residency of democratic party worried from the pressure made to her,cause her husband,igli,left to america looking for protection from democratic party.after take over the power violently,on,the communist continue to be in power.
i think that the story of igli leaving on is not forget till now,so his coming in albania can be problematic.
drita shehu,one of filja relatives who had been granted asylum in the united states,submitted an affidavit that stated 
i was granted political asylum base on persecution,mistreatment and torture.my husband hysen shehu karbunara and his father were executed on death penalty with the known group of the deputies in the year from communist regime.the persecution and torture followed my family and me we were deported from our homes to a remote village where we wore forced to work in labor camps.
part of my family it is suzana igli mother and her sister,my sisters daughters,whom i took care for a long time because their mother died to young,years old.
i have known igli myself.he had a hard time growing and did not have all the privileges like every citizen had,because of his family background.because of that he grew up hating the regime on power,and in he was on front of every democratic activity.he helped and worked against the social communist regime in existence.
considering his and his family background,his hate and activities he did against the social communist regime,i think that him and his family will be in danger and it will pay for igli actions if he returns in that social communist regime.
another relative,mimoza korca,who was born in albania in,submitted a sworn statement concerning the persecution to which the family had been subjected.it reads in part 
my name is mimoza korca.i am an american citizen issuing the following statement on behalf of igli filja,who is the son of my first cousin,suzana filja.
in november of the year the communists took the power in our country and started building the harsh dictatorship regime that ruled for almost half of century.my family,as a wealthy one,was among the most persecuted ones in albania.the communists sentenced to death and executed my father,my uncle as well as two of my first cousins.my father was incriminated as a collaborator of the and executed.my uncle,my father brother,was accused as if he was member of a group that had thrown a bomb against the russian embassy in tirana,prosecuted and killed under this untrue accuse.same destiny had also the two my first cousins,one of them years old and the other in his year of life.
without a difference is as well as the political background of my husband family,who has four victims dead as a result of the communist regime his father past away under hunger strike in prison as an act of rebellion against he regime and three of his uncles were executed by the communists.according to all of those facts,my point of view is that if my cousin igli filja goes back with his family in albania,the so named socialists,in fact former communists,that are ruling the country will,without delay inflict harm to him and his family.so with him,it will recommence again from the beginning,the sad history that had started years ago with our families.
a filja friend,filip kristani,signed an affidavit providing details concerning the canadian venture.it reads 
in,i started to work in zeri popullit one of the biggest newspaper on that time.for albania,it was also one of the best propaganda for the regime.i was working as a mechanical engineer,igli and i,were working together on finishing of the newspaper for that company and we made sure all the machines were working non stop and we did work,night shift.igli filja has been a friend of mine for more than years i spend with him many evenings talking about the regime,he always use to tell me about his family how the communist regime torched his family and he used to make plans,igli knew many people who then became very important on democratic party.in the company where we worked had a project to obtain a new printing machine from canadian communist party,i think that was a rushed time for the socialist party because of the election,so we had to go in canada to specialize on the best color printing machine.igli was the first one who said we should not return for this project and that what we did we never went back to albania.i believe if igli filja goes back in albania he will be arrested because of his political beliefs.
the eight department of state country reports,human rights world reports and amnesty international reports that filja submitted in support of his motion to reopen provide evidence that albanian police and other authorities were continuing persecution of those who opposed the socialist regime.for example 
the government human rights record remained poor in many areas although there were some improvements in a few areas,serious problems remain.police beat and otherwise abused suspects,detainees,and prisoners.prison conditions remained poor.the police arbitrarily arrested and detained persons and prolonged pretrial detention was a problem.the judiciary was inefficient,subject to corruption and executive pressure on the judiciary remained a serious problem.
department of state,albania,country reports on human rights.
following a series of political crises,by albania entered a period of which appeared to be more stable and inclusive governance.nevertheless,impunity for police abuse,failures of various government branches to uphold the rule of law,trafficking in human beings,and widespread violations of children rights continued to be major concerns.
the excessive reaction against albania highest court revealed a thin commitment to the rules of law when political stakes are high.
albania executive and judicial authorities continued to fail to combat police violence.torture and physical abuse of detainees were widespread and unpunished.
human rights watch world report,albania,available at http.
several cases of torture and other serious abuse by the albanian police in highlighted the prevalence of police misconduct,particularly as it concerned children and opposition activists the dp democratic party repeatedly protested the arrests and alleged police beatings of participants in its political rallies,which sometimes turned violent.azgan haklaj,the head of the dp branch in tropoja,was brutally assaulted by the special police in january after having been arrested for his alleged role in a november attack on the tropoja police station.
human rights watch world report,albania,available at http.
detainees,including children,continued to be frequently and sometimes tortured during arrest and in police custody,usually to force confessions.judicial proceedings against police officers accused of were rare.
amnesty international,albania covering events from.
although the record contains evidence that even during the years of democratic party rule,socialist party supporters within the police and special police continued to attack democratic party activists,the situation became dramatically more dangerous for those activists when the socialist party reestablished control of the entire governmental structure in.this,of course,is the changed country condition upon which filja bases his motion to reopen.
the supporting papers seek to show why filja initial application for asylum at the june,hearing failed fully to develop the important background information concerning the longstanding persecution of filja family,filja own participation in the democratic party activities,and the continuing threats made against filja wife and son.the reason given is the ineffective representation provided to filja by his then counsel.
in his many papers filja presented a host of errors committed by former counsel i he failed to advance the facts filja recounted to him concerning his family persecution and his political activity on behalf of the democratic party,neither correcting and supplementing filja form asylum affidavit nor preparing to bring out full testimony at the hearing ii he informed filja that he did not have a case because the democratic party was then in power,failing to comprehend that even though the democratic party was in power the socialists had strong support within the police forces and were killing opposition persons to get back in power iii he failed to recognize that filja feared persecution by the socialist party and police whom the democratic party had been,and would be,unable to control iv he failed to set forth the specific mistreatment filja close,son,father,grandfather and maternal received as a result of being associated with the democratic party v he failed to develop the fact that his,gene dingu,was attacked outside the home where luljeta filja and the son were living vi he failed to call available witnesses,including filja wife,who was sitting outside the hearing room,who could have provided detail and corroboration to filja account and vii he failed to provide state department country reports and reports of human rights organizations that describe the political situation in albania and ongoing persecution of political dissidents such as filja.
d.the bia denial of the motion on february,the bia disposed of filja motion to reopen and the record offered in its support.it noted that the motion was received on october,and held it was untimely because it was not filed within days of the bia march,opinion,the final administrative order in his case,citing c.the bia rejected filja argument that he came within the exception to the rule because there had been changes in conditions in albania,stating,we note that the asserted changes,including the election of socialist party members to the government,occurred prior to our decision in march,and as such,this evidence even if deemed material was available and could have been discovered or presented at that time.see c ii.
the bia rejected filja argument that the time limitation for the filing of the motion should be tolled because he was deprived of due process as a consequence of ineffective assistance of his former counsel.the bia stated that while the respondent appears to have complied with requirements set forth in matter of lozada,bia he has failed to demonstrate that his former counsel performance was so inadequate that it prejudiced the outcome of proceedings.
the bia set forth the legal principles governing relief under the cat and held that filja failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for its protection because t he evidence of record fails to indicate that it is more likely than not that respondent will face torture upon his return to albania,and,further,his arguments,in substantial part,consist of the same arguments previously presented in support of his applications for asylum and withholding of deportation which were denied both by the immigration judge and by the board.
on march,filja filed with the bia a motion to reconsider request for en banc review.the bia denied the motion to reconsider.the filjas now petition for review of the bia february,order denying filja motion to reopen.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review

iii.discussion 
timeliness of petition to reopen the ij held the filjas asylum hearing on june,denying asylum and withholding of deportation on january.in june,the socialist party returned to power in albania.on march,the bia dismissed the filjas appeal.on october,the filjas moved under c ii to reopen and to remand to the ij to reapply for asylum and withholding of deportation due to changed country conditions and to apply for relief under the cat.the bia held that the motion to reopen was untimely,interpreting c as requiring that,although the country conditions in albania had changed subsequent to the date of the ij decision,the motion should have been made prior to the bia march,decision.
under the applicable regulation,a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed no later than days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.c.excepted from this time limitation set forth in paragraph c are motions to reopen proceedings ii t o apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.c ii emphasis added.this regulation implements c c ii,which excepts the time limitation if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding emphasis added.
interpreting the regulation,the bia held that the filjas motion to reopen was untimely because the changed country conditions were known at the time of the previous hearing before the bia,namely,its march,decision.the bia construction of the statute is entitled to deference and must be accepted by the court if it is based upon a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,natural resources defense council,d see ins,d abdulai ashcroft,cir.
the language of the statute is ambiguous,stating that the changed country conditions must not have been presentable at the previous proceeding.it does not specify whether the previous proceeding is the application heard by the ij or the appeal heard by the bia.the government relies upon chevron to support its contention that the court must accept the bia contention that the statutory language,previous proceeding,and the regulatory language,previous hearing,encompass the appellate proceeding before the bia,arguing in its brief that s ince any application to a case once it has been taken to the bia must be made to the bia,it is certainly permissible to interpret previous proceeding in the context of a motion to a bia case to refer to the previous appeal to the bia.
two considerations lead to the conclusion that the government argument and the bia holding are flawed.first,the structure that the statute and regulations create for original hearings and appellate review of asylum and withholding of removal applications permits evidentiary material to be presented only at ij hearings and not on bia review.second,when c ii is construed in conjunction with other regulations,the words previous hearing can only refer to the proceedings before the ij,and not to the proceedings before the bia.
we examine first the statutory and regulatory structure established for ij hearing and bia review on appeal of motions for asylum and withholding of removal.it is the ij who has the statutory authority to conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissability or deportability of an alien,a,during the course of which he shall administer oaths,receive evidence,and interrogate,examine,and the alien and any witnesses.b.
appellate review of ij decisions is conferred upon the bia.b.under the regulations t he board will not engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge,d i,and the board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.a party asserting that the board can not properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand.if further factfinding is needed in a particular case,the board may remand the proceeding to the immigration judge d iv.
the filjas could not have presented evidence of changed country conditions to the bia on their appeal on the merits of the ij decision.the bia faults the filjas for not filing their motion within an artificial time period that was measured by the bia issuance of its decision in a proceeding that had nothing to do with,and,in fact,precluded,new evidence.this suggests that the bia interpretation of c ii was unreasonable.
if one traces the labyrinthine path of the applicable regulations,one can only conclude that previous hearing,as used in c ii,refers to the hearing before the ij,which is totally consistent with the statutory and regulatory factfinding procedures.
the statute authorizes motions to reopen removal proceedings,c,and provides that t he motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c b.a successful motion to reopen results in a hearing,and an ij must conduct that hearing.
the usual deadline for filing a motion to reopen is days after entry of a final order of removal,c c i,except that t here is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under sections asylum or b withholding deportation of this title and is based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered,if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.c c ii.because the only proceeding at which new evidentiary material could be presented is a hearing before the ij,the reference to previous proceeding in this statutory provision must have been to the hearing before the ij.
there is a significant difference in the regulatory provisions that govern motions to reopen proceedings before an ij and the regulatory provisions that govern motions to reopen proceedings before the bia each set of regulations establishes a time limit to file such motions each contains the changed country conditions exception.the significant difference is that in the case of motions to reopen before the ij the exception applies if the new evidence was not available at the previous proceeding.the previous proceeding can only have been the hearing before the ij.in the case of motions to reopen before the bia the exception applies if the new evidence was not available at the previous hearing.the words at the previous hearing were substituted for the statutory and ij regulatory language at the previous proceeding.there is no hearing in the usual sense of the word in proceedings before the bia,and the substitution of the word hearing for proceeding recognizes that the only place the alien could have presented evidence of changed country conditions was before the ij.
thus it was unreasonable for the bia,referring to the filjas motion,to hold that the changes occurred prior to our decision in march,and
