opinion of the court 
the national labor relations board board applies to this court to enforce,and george warehouse,this court to review,an order awarding backpay to two former george employees who were terminated for unlawfully discriminatory reasons.george argues that general counsel for the board did not meet its burden of producing evidence as to the reasonableness of the discriminatees efforts to seek employment.because we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the board findings concerning mitigation,we will enforce the board order awarding backpay and deny the for review.
in march,george discharged leonard sides and warehouseman jesus jesse tharp.sides and tharp appealed their respective discharges to an alj.the alj ordered george to reinstate sides and tharp and make them whole for their losses,concluding that they had been subject to surveillance and discharged discriminatorily by george on account of their involvement in a union.in a june,decision and order,the board affirmed the alj findings and conclusions,and adopted the alj order as modified.we thereupon enforced the board order on april.cir.our judgment was later amended on june.
sides and tharp were offered reinstatement on september,but both declined.as a consequence,each was entitled to receive backpay from the date of his discharge march,for sides march,for tharp until september.george calculated the backpay it owed for that period as to sides and to tharp,and paid each accordingly.
on may,the regional director of the board issued a compliance specification and notice of hearing which estimated additional amounts of backpay due to sides and tharp.at the subsequent compliance backpay hearing on october,neither tharp nor sides testified,and general counsel who represented the discriminatees,did not call any witnesses.george called a vocational expert,donna flannery,to testify that neither sides nor tharp had adequately sought to mitigate damages by exercising reasonable diligence in seeking interim employment.flannery asserted that,based on employment statistics and newspaper advertisements,there were a substantial number of comparable jobs available to tharp and sides during their respective backpay periods.however,she admitted that she had not interviewed either of them.
in an october,supplemental decision,the alj noted in her analysis that the burden of establishing that sides and tharp had failed to mitigate their damages rested exclusively with george,and did not shift back to general counsel at any point.the alj found that george did not meet its burden of proving that sides and tharp had failed to exercise diligence in finding new work.as a consequence,the alj recommended that each be given additional backpay in the amounts of to sides and to tharp.
nearly five years later,on september,the board issued a supplemental decision and order remanding this matter to the alj.the board articulated a new standard of proof for backpay hearings while employers would continue to bear the burden of persuasion as to an employee alleged failure to engage in a reasonable search for new work,as well as the burden of producing evidence that there were substantially equivalent jobs within the relevant geographic area,general counsel and the employee would now have the burden of producing evidence that the employee took reasonable steps to pursue those jobs.in applying that new framework to the facts of this case,the board concluded that george had produced evidence of substantially equivalent jobs within the area,but that general counsel had not met its burden of production as to the employees reasonable diligence to mitigate.as a result,the board remanded to the alj to reopen the record to allow the parties to present evidence consistent with the revised burden of production,as declared by the board.
remand hearings were held before a new alj on february and march.with respect to sides claim for backpay,general counsel called sides and salvatore losauro,supervisor for the records unit at the new jersey department of labor employment service njdol employment service,as witnesses.sides testified that after being discharged from george,where he had worked for years,he went to a new jersey unemployment office and filed for benefits on april.on april,sides registered at the veterans unit of the njdol employment service for help in returning to the workforce.on may,sides was found eligible for unemployment benefits,and received his first unemployment check on june.
sides also testified that between march and october,he reviewed job listings in newspapers,primarily the sunday star ledger.sides did not own a car,and thus,his job search was restricted to positions within miles of his home and within walking distance about a mile of public transportation.he also inquired about potential openings through friends and associates.
sides found temporary work at two temporary staffing agencies,labor ready and j j staffing resources.at labor ready,sides stocked shelves from october,to november.at j j,sides unloaded three to five days a week from november or december until march.even as he worked in his temporary position at j j,sides continued to seek out employment.
sides kept records documenting his work search,which were admitted into evidence.those records indicate that from march through august,sides applied to at least positions including labor ready and j j,eight of which from may to september,were referred to him by the unemployment office.he also took a class at the njdol in september,and that he called a number of other employers to determine whether their businesses were located in an accessible area,but did not make a list of those employers because he had not been instructed to do so.
on the other hand,george produced evidence that on october,it had written to sixteen of the employers listed by sides in order to verify his records.while most employers did not respond,or replied that they did not keep such information on file,four responded that they specifically did not have an application from sides on file,and one confirmed that sides had applied.in addition,general counsel produced employers verifications of four other applications that sides had submitted.
losauro testified that he first spoke with sides on april,when sides was interviewed by the njdol about his experience and qualifications,and njdol gave sides an assessment of his employment prospects.losauro characterized sides as a very active job searcher,and testified that njdol had given sides eight job referrals between may and september.losauro also explained that verifications of applications are difficult to produce because few employers complete job bank employer reference forms,and those which are returned to the njdol are destroyed soon after.
with respect to tharp claim for backpay,general counsel called gail moskus,tharp mother,as well as collette sarro,a regional compliance officer with the board.tharp had died before the proceeding began,and thus,was unavailable to testify.
according to the documentation that general counsel entered into evidence,tharp was discharged by george on march,after working there for approximately six years.he applied for unemployment benefits the following day.on his application for benefits,he certified that he was ready,willing,and able to work full time and would be able to begin work at once.he received benefits from may,until june.most records of tharp job search were unavailable,but on a board questionnaire tharp had completed in june,he listed seven employers to whom he had applied unsuccessfully between june and june.
after tharp was discharged,he spoke with moskus on the phone twice a month.based on those conversions,moskus testified that tharp had looked for work every day in new jersey for about four months,but he became very discouraged because he could find work.then,in,tharp moved to naples,florida.collette sarro testimony confirmed that prior to moving to florida,tharp called her to tell her that he was relocating because he could find a job and could afford to pay his rent.
moskus also testified that about two weeks after tharp arrived in florida,he began looking for and warehouse positions in the area.he searched for jobs by making phone inquiries,scanning newspaper listings,and having moskus drive him to businesses to fill out applications.tharp did not own a car in new jersey or florida.from september to october,tharp applied for jobs with at least three florida employers.on october,he accepted a job offer to work as a yardman and forklift operator for naples lumber,which,among the jobs he applied for,was the closest in salary and description to his position with george.tharp held that position with naples lumber through september.
in a second supplemental decision dated may,the alj credited sides and moskus testimonies and determined that,based on the evidenced introduced by general counsel,both sides and tharp had made diligent,reasonable efforts to find new work.accordingly,the alj recommended an order awarding them the backpay amounts ordered by the first alj in the october,supplemental decision,for sides and for tharp now tharp estate.a quorum of the board affirmed the alj rulings,findings,and conclusions,and adopted the recommended order.
george petitioned this court to review the board order,and general counsel for enforcement.while the petitions were pending,the supreme court decided new process steel nlrb,holding that section b of the nlra requires that a delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the board.since the board order in this case had been entered by a panel,we vacated the board order in light of new process steel and remanded to the board for further proceedings.x,cir.we also dismissed general counsel for enforcement as moot.
on remand,a panel of the board affirmed the alj may,rulings,findings,and conclusions,and adopted the alj recommended order.
general counsel again applies to this court for enforcement of the board order,and george this court for review of same.

george challenges the backpay award to sides,arguing that based on the evidence produced by general counsel,sides search for employment did not meet the reasonable diligence standard and sides backpay should be tolled for the periods in which he did not apply for jobs.therefore,george asserts,the backpay it has already given sides fully discharged its duty to make sides whole.
george argues that a discriminatee singular reliance on unemployment office referrals is insufficient to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard.see nlrb arduini,cir nlrb puch barr,cir.however,it is in board case law that registration with a state unemployment office is prima facie evidence of a reasonable search for employment.church homes,see also,e,allegheny graphics,enforced,cir firestone synthetic fibers,accord nlrb midwestern personnel,cir.sides registration with the new jersey unemployment office therefore reflects favorably on his efforts to mitigate.
moreover,by suggesting that sides search was limited to job referrals from the unemployment office,george understates the extent of sides efforts to find interim employment.sides testified that,in addition to visiting the unemployment office approximately each week from may to september,he consulted job listings in the newspaper at least every weekend,visited employers,and asked friends to inquire about job openings on his behalf he independently applied for two openings he had found in the newspaper between march and october he registered with the njdol and,as losauro testified,was very active in soliciting that office assistance in procuring new employment and he became certified as a forklift operator in september to enhance his marketable skills.those combined efforts are consistent with reasonable diligence.see,midwestern personnel,at holding that employee who put name on union list,searched for work through friends,reviewed want ads in local newspaper,and submitted one application on his own before obtaining referral through union had conducted reasonable search canova nlrb,cir holding that workers who placed their names with state unemployment office and on union list,visited and applied to local employers,and looked through newspaper ads had diligently sought interim employment.
furthermore,from october to may,sides found employment with two temporary staffing agencies labor ready,from october,to november,and j j,from november or december to march.even while working for j j,sides applied for jobs with eight other employers,which speaks to the sincerity of his search.see allegheny graphics,at concluding that efforts of discriminatee,who applied for unemployment benefits,sought permanent employment,and continued to seek such employment even after he was hired by a temporary agency,were reasonable,as distinct from discriminatee who did not file for unemployment and only sought temporary positions.after his job through j j expired,sides applied to thirteen positions over the next months,and received a job offer in august to begin working in september.sides procurement of temporary work,his continued search for permanent work even while employed temporarily,and his subsequent efforts to find a job once his temporary positions expired evince a reasonably diligent effort to locate employment.see midwestern personnel,at concluding that employee who applied to eight employers during period,and found temporary work with one,exercised reasonable diligence during that period.
george also argues that sides unduly circumscribed the scope of his search to a limited geographic area.but the fact that sides only considered applying to jobs within miles from his home the same distance that george had been and within a mile from public transportation does not render his search any less reasonable.see,nlrb westin hotel,cir determining employee acted reasonably in choosing not to apply for available positions miles away from home because she did not have adequate transportation church homes,at discriminatees are not required to accept employment where they would encounter transportation difficulties due to the location of the employment opportunity.am.bottling,concluding discriminatees acted reasonably by declining to seek jobs in area at least from to miles from their former employment,in light of burdensome transportation problems it would pose.inasmuch as an employee need not seek employment which involves conditions that are substantially more onerous than her previous position,sides was not obligated to look for jobs substantially further than george was from his home.donlin philips ligh
