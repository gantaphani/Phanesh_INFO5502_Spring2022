in this case,we ask whether petitioners lonny and roxann menard the menards may compel respondent,the federal aviation administration faa to reverse course on two administrative decisions.the menards contend that two airspace orders made by the faa in were arbitrary and capricious,or alternatively,that the orders were subverted by prejudice,bias,or improper ex parte communications.the menards own a small turf runway in berryville,texas,as do their neighbors,who have intervened in this case on the side of the faa,and whom we refer to collectively as aero estates.the menards contend that there is only room for one airport in their neighborhood,and that the faa should be compelled to clip aero estates wings for good.we disagree,and put an end to one maneuver in the parties ongoing dogfight.
in the early,the aero estates subdivision was created in berryville,texas,near lake palestine.central to the plan was a common runway to be shared by the homeowners.the runway is oriented,and is feet wide and feet long.in,the developer of the subdivision provided notice of a landing area proposal to the faa after conducting an aeronautical study,the faa issued a no objection determination.in,isaacs,a subsequent owner of aero estates,informed the faa that he intended to deactivate the airport.on july,the faa notified isaacs that the airport would be removed from government charts as a result,aero estates was not an operational airport in the eyes of the faa from to.
around the time the faa removed aero estates from its charts,the of the menards property filed a notice with the faa of intent to establish a runway.the runway is oriented,and is feet wide and either or feet long.the runway western end is feet north of the eastern end of the aero estates runway the neighboring runways are parallel but offset.after conducting an aeronautical study,the faa indicated on july,that it had no objection to the establishment of an airport.the menards bought the property in and,inauspiciously,named their airport paradise point.
in,aero estates provided the faa with a notice of intent to officially reactivate its airport.after conducting a study,the faa on january,issued an objectionable determination,because the airport would have overlapping air traffic patterns with paradise point.in the following years,the faa reviewed several other notices concerning aero estates and paradise point.first,the menards sought to have paradise point status changed from private to public use in,to which the faa issued a no objection determination.the menards also sought to establish a seaplane base near paradise point in,to which the faa initially objected due to its proximity to paradise point and aero estates.the faa later indicated that it did not object to a seaplane base at a different location if the seaplane base traffic pattern did not overlap with paradise point traffic pattern.however,a seaplane base was apparently never added to aeronautical charts,nor were lane markers installed on lake palestine to indicate a seaplane landing area.
from onward,things really turned sour.the faa received additional complaints from lonny menard and another nearby property owner that aircraft were using aero estates runway.menard complained that use of the runway created an unsafe environment on the ground and in the air,and asked the faa to ensure that the airspace around his airport was protected.the faa investigated the complaints and met with interested parties,but found insufficient evidence to proceed with an enforcement action.see,a.the menards also contacted their congressman,who wrote to the faa on their behalf.in,aero estates sought to establish a heliport the faa issued a no objection determination,despite a complaint from the menards that this would imperil the safety of operations at paradise point.in august,aero estates again gave the faa notice of its intent to officially reopen its airport,and the faa again began an aeronautical study.lonny menard wrote to the faa to express his objection to changing the designation of the aero estates runway.he urged the faa to abide by its objectionable determination.the menards simultaneously filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the allegedly unsafe use of aero estates runway.according to the parties,that suit is still pending.
while conducting the aeronautical study for aero estates proposal in early,the faa was informed by the texas department of transportation that lonny menard had requested that the paradise point airport not be listed by the state as open to the public.because this contravened the faa designation of paradise point as a public airport,the faa sent a letter to the menards on february,asking whether they wished to have paradise point designated private.see e requiring notice to the faa of proposed changes in the status of an airport.lonny menard responded in a letter dated february,that he wanted the faa to hold publication of the airport as public at this time due to the serious safety concerns arising from aircraft operations being conducted on an adjacent property and the refusal by the pilots of those aircraft to respect the flight patterns designated by your agency.emphasis in original.the faa construed this response as a request to change status under e,and opened a new aeronautical study.in a letter dated may,lonny menard articulated his concerns in greater detail 
on june,the faa released two conditional determinations one each for the airports at aero estates and paradise point.the determinations allowed both airports to operate,provided that their respective users maintained a divided air traffic pattern.flights at paradise point were to take off and approach from the north,while flights at aero estates were to take off and approach from the south.the orders also required the users of the respective airports to approach and leave the airspace at differing altitudes,to use the common traffic advisory frequency,and to operate only during the daytime and under visual flight rules vfr.in the order for aero estates,the faa stated it was assumed that paradise point airport would continue to have a relatively short runway that would not generate enough air traffic to be a problem with operations at the aero estates airport.
displeased with these determinations,the menards filed the current petition.they contend that the june orders are arbitrary and capricious because they disregard evidence,contravene faa rules and regulations,and create a grave safety risk.the menards also argue that the process was subverted by bias,prejudice,and ex parte communications.
an order issued pursuant to is appealable under a formerly app.see sandell faa,cir.section vests this court with exclusive jurisdiction to affirm,amend,modify,or set aside any part of the order,or to order the administrator to conduct further proceedings.c.before we proceed to the merits of the appeal,we must ensure that we have jurisdiction.the faa determinations at issue here are advisory.see a.nevertheless,we have previously treated appeals of advisory faa orders as reviewable and justiciable.air line pilots ass int l faa,cir hereinafter air line pilots.
in air line pilots,we asked whether we could review an faa finding that three planned in dallas,along with certain adjustments to flight procedures for dallas love field,would not create a hazard to air navigation.id.at.the faa issued its ruling pursuant to its authority to determine whether objects affecting navigable airspace will be hazardous to air navigation.id.at citing.the faa argued that the case was unreviewable because a determination under part has no enforceable effect.id.at.applying abbott laboratories gardner,d,we held that the issue was ripe for judicial resolution,and that hardship would result for the parties if review were denied.id.at.we reasoned that even if the faa decision had only the power of moral suasion,such force was sufficiently potent to have significant practical effects on the ground and in the air.id.at.therefore,the advisory nature of the faa order did not preclude judicial review.id.at accord aircraft owners pilots ass faa.
we see no reason to differentiate between the advisory orde
