adebowale oloyede ojo,a native of nigeria and the adopted son of a united states citizen,petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia denying a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.in so ruling,the bia relied on its administrative interpretation of a provision in the immigration and nationality act the ina relating to adopted children,codified at b e i.that provision is not ambiguous in the way asserted by the bia,however,and thus does not contain a gap that congress has left for the bia to fill.moreover,the bia interpretation which summarily disregards facially valid state court orders is contrary to law.we therefore grant the petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings.
before addressing the particulars of ojo case,we briefly sketch the relevant statutory framework governing citizenship for children.section a of title provides that a child born outside of the united states automatically becomes a citizen of the united states when three conditions are satisfied 
first,a t least one parent of the child is a citizen of the united states,whether by birth or naturalization 
second,t he child is under the age of eighteen years and 
finally,t he child is residing in the united states in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.
an adopted child qualifies as a child for purposes of a if he was adopted by a united states citizen parent and satisfies the relevant requirements of b.see b.
section b e i,in turn,defines a child as an unmarried person under years of age,who was adopted while under the age of sixteen years if the child has been in the legal custody of,and has resided with,the adopting parent or parents for at least two years.the ina does not provide its own definition of the term adopted,specify any requirements for a proper adoption,or contemplate the bia involvement in any adoption proceedings.
a child who fails to obtain citizenship remains an alien.see a.the department of homeland security the dhs acting on behalf of the attorney general has the power to order certain aliens removed from the united states,including any alien who has committed an aggravated felony.see a a iii.for purposes of a a iii,an aggravated felony is defined in a.
the pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute.ojo was born in nigeria on august,and he lawfully entered the united states in august.two weeks later,on september,when ojo was just six years old,his uncle a united states citizen became ojo legal guardian.more than ten years later,on june,when ojo was sixteen,ojo uncle and the uncle wife filed a petition to adopt ojo.on january,after ojo had turned seventeen,the circuit court for montgomery county,maryland the maryland state court,entered a judgment of adoption.
between and,ojo was convicted of two offenses,either of which qualifies as an aggravated felony under a b.on may,in light of ojo convictions,and alleging that ojo had not derived citizenship as an adopted child under and b e,the dhs charged him with removability from the united states under a a iii.
on may,an immigration judge the ij determined that ojo was removable from this country by clear and convincing evidence.the ij explained that,because ojo turned sixteen on august,and was not adopted by his citizen uncle until he was already seventeen years old,he did not qualify as an adopted child under b e.as a result,ojo had not derived citizenship from his adoptive father his biological uncle pursuant to.
on june,the bia received ojo notice of appeal of the ij decision.on september,in support of a request for a remand to the ij,ojo advised the bia that his adoptive father would seek a nunc pro tunc order from the maryland state court specifying that ojo adoption became effective before he turned sixteen ojo asserted that the court would likely grant such an order because between the time ojo entered the united states at age six in and the approval of his adoption in he had lived continuously as the child of his adoptive father.
on october,the bia agreed with the ij that ojo was removable,recognizing that ojo had the burden of proving his citizenship claim and showing that his adoption occurred before his sixteenth birthday.relying on the judgment of adoption of january,the bia ruled that ojo was seventeen when adopted.accordingly,the bia decided that he did not qualify as an adopted child under b e for purposes of derivative citizenship under.the bia also concluded that ojo representation that his adoptive father would seek an order from the maryland state court making ojo adoption effective nunc pro tunc to a date before he turned sixteen did not warrant a remand to the ij.consequently,the bia dismissed ojo appeal.
on november,ojo filed a timely motion to reopen his removal proceedings,supported by a nunc pro tunc order entered on october,by the maryland state court.that order made ojo adoption effective on august,the day before he turned sixteen.by a decision of january,the bia denied ojo motion to reopen,observing that it does not recognize nunc pro tunc adoption decrees after a child reaches the age limit for both the filing of the adoption petition and decree.for that principle,the bia relied on its prior decisions in matter of cariaga,bia,and matter of drigo,bia.
in its matter of cariaga decision,the bia had established a blanket rule that t he act of adoption must occur before the child attains the age specified in the ina,thereby precluding any consideration of a nunc pro tunc order entered after the relevant birthday but made effective before that date.see at.according to the bia,t hrough the imposition of an age restriction on the creation of the adoptive relationship,congress has attempted to distinguish between bona fide adoptions,in which a child has been made a part of a family unit,and spurious adoptions,effected in order to circumvent statutory restrictions.id.thereafter,in matter of drigo,the bia relied on its cariaga decision and rejected the contention that a decree of adoption is fully effective as of the date entered nunc pro tunc and is entitled to recognition for immigration purposes.see at.the bia drigo decision emphasized that i t was congress intent that the age restriction in b e i be construed strictly.id 
in other words,on the premise that its decisions in cariaga and drigo would deter fraudulent and spurious adoptions,the bia embraced an interpretation of b e i that flouted the effective dates of adoptions set forth in facially valid nunc pro tunc orders entered by the various state courts of this country.multiple federal courts thereafter cast substantial doubt on the bia rule.see,cantwell holder,d hong napolitano,d gonzalez martinez dhs,d.
only one of our sister courts of appeals has heretofore addressed the viability of the rule in a published opinion.in amponsah holder,the ninth circuit concluded that the bia blanket rule against recognizing nunc pro tunc adoption decrees constitutes an impermissible construction of b and that consideration of nunc pro tunc adoption decrees is required.see,cir.the ninth circuit withdrew its amponsah opinion a few months later,in september,after the bia advised the court that it was considering whether to overrule or modify the rule.see amponsah holder,cir.
in support of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings,ojo invoked several of the federal court decisions discrediting the rule.the bia,however,rejected those decisions as not binding.specifically addressing the ninth circuit amponsah opinion,the bia observed that ojo reliance on amponsah is misplaced as this decision was withdrawn.the bia did not acknowledge that the ninth circuit withdrew its amponsah opinion because of the bia assurance to that court in that it was revisiting the rule the very rule on which the bia then relied in january to refuse to reopen ojo removal proceedings.
on february,ojo filed a timely petition for review of the bia decision denying his motion to reopen.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
on july,during the pendency of this proceeding,the bia modified the rule in its precedential decision in mat
