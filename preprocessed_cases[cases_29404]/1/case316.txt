this appeal has its genesis in a dramatic raid on a leather goods factory in new bedford,massachusetts.enforcement of the immigration laws is difficult and oftentimes controversial work.so it was here the raid led to the detention of hundreds of undocumented aliens and put significant strains on those involved and those who wished to help.in short order,the detainees many of whom were whisked away to distant places brought a civil action alleging abridgement of a constellation of constitutional and statutory rights.
confronted with a maze of issues,the district court patiently sorted through them and,in a thoughtful rescript,eventually dismissed the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction.aquilar immigr.customs enf.div.of dep t of homeland,d.the detainees whom we sometimes shall refer to as the petitioners now challenge that ukase.their appeal raises novel and important questions concerning the scope,reach,and interpretation of the immigration laws.in particular,it requires us to disentangle the gordian knot of jurisdictional provisions created by recent amendments to the immigration and nationality act ina.
we discern no simple,answer to the questions presented by the parties.after careful perscrutation of a scumbled record,we conclude that some of the petitioners claims are unpreserved,some are subject to a jurisdictional bar,and others are simply not actionable.the common denominator is that none of the claims can proceed in the district court.thus,while our reasoning differs somewhat from that of the court our opinion should not be read as an unqualified endorsement of the way in which immigration officials handled the affirm the judgment of dismissal.the tale follows.
we rehearse here only those facts needed to place this appeal in workable perspective.on march,federal officers conducted a raid as part of operation united front.the raid targeted michael bianco,a department of defense contractor suspected of employing large numbers of illegal aliens.immigration and customs enforcement ice agents,armed with search and arrest warrants,appeared unannounced at the factory,arrested five executives on criminal charges,and took more than employees into custody for civil immigration infractions.the ice agents cast a wide net and paid little attention to the detainees individual or family circumstances.
the government subsequent actions regarding the undocumented workers who were swept up in the net lie at the epicenter of this litigation.after releasing dozens of employees determined either to be minors or to be legally residing in the united states,ice transported the remaining detainees to fort devens a holding facility in ayer,massachusetts.citing a shortage of available bed space in massachusetts,ice then began transferring substantial numbers of aliens to faraway detention and removal operations centers dros.for example,on march,detainees were flown to a dro in harlingen,texas,and the next day more were flown to a dro in el paso,texas.
ice attempted to coordinate its maneuvers with the massachusetts department of social services dss to ensure the proper care of family members.it took steps to address concerns about child welfare and released several detainees for humanitarian reasons.still,the petitioners allege and,for present purposes,we accept that ice gave social welfare agencies insufficient notice of the raid,that caseworkers were denied access to detainees until after the first group had been transferred,and that various ice actions temporarily thwarted any effective investigation into the detainees needs.as a result,a substantial number of the detainees minor children were left for varying periods of time without adult supervision.
with respect to the detainees themselves,the petitioners aver that ice inhibited their exercise of the right to counsel.according to the petitioners,a squad of volunteer lawyers who had offered to provide the detainees with guidance was turned away from fort devens on march.the next day,the lawyers were allowed to meet with those detainees some thirty in number who had expressly requested legal advice.the petitioners allege that,notwithstanding this largesse,some detainees were denied access to counsel after they arrived in texas.
on the afternoon of march,the guatemalan consul,acting as next friend of the detainees many of whom were guatemalan nationals,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the action sought the detainees immediate release or,in the alternative,a temporary restraining order halting further transfers.the district court enjoined ice from moving any of the remaining detainees out of massachusetts pending further order of the court.
on march,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,fashioned as a class action,and withdrew their plea for immediate release.the amended complaint named ice and various other federal agencies and actors as respondents for ease in exposition,we sometimes refer to the defendants,collectively,as ice or the government.in that pleading,the petitioners alleged that ice actions had violated certain of the petitioners constitutional and statutory rights,including i the right to be free from arbitrary,prolonged,and indefinite detention ii the right to a prompt bond hearing,that is,one held in massachusetts prior to any transfer iii the right to counsel and iv the right of family integrity.the amended complaint further alleged that it was the established policy and practice of the government to conduct large scale sweeps or raids in which large numbers of persons suspected of being unlawfully present in the united states are held at facilities which are some distance from the site of arrest and under conditions where access to counsel is impracticable,if not impossible.
on march,the government filed an omnibus motion to dismiss for want of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state any claim upon which relief might be granted.in due course,the district court allowed the motion to dismiss on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.aquilar,d at.the court also dissolved the temporary restraining order that it previously had issued.
the linchpin of the lower court decision was its conclusion that the ina,as amended by the real id act of,stat,stripped it of both habeas and federal question jurisdiction to hear the petitioners claims.aquilar,d at,citing b id.at citing a b ii.in its rescript,the court rejected the petitioners attempted of their remonstrances as pattern and practice claims,that is,claims alleging a collective denial of rights collateral to removal proceedings.id.at.in that regard,the court concluded that the petitioners had failed to link these pattern and practice claims to any specific constitutional violation that might be ripe for review.id.
the district court paid special heed to the absence of any sixth amendment right to counsel in removal proceedings,the absence of any constitutional right to release on bond,and the absence of any constitutional right to have a removal proceeding held in a particular venue.id.and while acknowledging that the petitioners were entitled to the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment as well as to certain statutory protections,the district court concluded that those rights were personal to the petitioners and,as such,had to be exhausted administratively before the courts could become involved.id.
this timely appeal ensued.in it,the petitioners assign error to the lower court conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims and relatedly,to its conclusion that the petitioners are only entitled to judicial review on an individualized basis after exhausting their administrative remedies.overall,the petitioners urge us to hold that they have stated cognizable claims that are ripe for judicial review and that their action should,therefore,be allowed to proceed in the district court.
conscious of our role as a court of limited jurisdiction,we begin our analysis with the question of whether and to what extent the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petitioners claims.see steel citizens for a better env t,d bell hood.we then turn to the surviving claims.
we review a district court dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see,dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir.for that purpose,we give weight to the factual averments in the operative pleading here,the petitioners amended complaint and indulge every reasonable inference in the pleader favor.see united states,cir.where,however,those facts are illuminated,supplemented,or even contradicted by other materials in the district court record,we need not confine our jurisdictional inquiry to the pleadings,but may consider those other materials see ex rel.attica cent,cir gonzalez united states,cir.our solution to the jurisdictional puzzle may be original,that is,we may affirm an order of dismissal on any ground made apparent by the record whether or not relied upon by the lower court.see intergen grina,cir.
the petitioners contend that the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over their claims pursuant to the general grant of federal question jurisdiction,and the statutory grant of habeas corpus jurisdiction,id.in outlining this contention,they concede that congress,in enacting b,attempted to direct challenges to removal through defined administrative channels.they argue,however,that their claims lie beyond the reach of this channeling statute.
delineating the precise ambit of section b calls for an exercise in statutory construction.thus,our starting point is the statutory text.see richardson united states,d fed.refin.klock,cir.
section b is entitled consolidation of questions for judicial review.it reads in pertinent part 
judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.except as otherwise provided in this section,no court shall have jurisdiction,by habeas corpus under section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision or by any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.
the supreme court has described this provision as a general jurisdictional limitation and as an unmistakable zipper clause.reno,d.by its terms,the provision encompasses all questions of law and fact and extends to both constitutional and statutory challenges.its expanse is breathtaking.
congress purpose in enacting section b is evident.as its text makes manifest,that proviso was designed to consolidate and channel review of all legal and factual questions that arise from the removal of an alien into the administrative process,with judicial review of those decisions vested exclusively in the courts of appeals.see a ordaining that a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.in enacting section b,congress plainly intended to put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held sway in regard to removal proceedings.see,at,reprinted in.
while paying lip service to the breadth and purpose of section b,the petitioners endeavor to avoid its strictures by reading section b narrowly as stripping district courts of jurisdiction over challenges to ongoing removal more.on this basis,the petitioners claim that the district court habeas jurisdiction remains intact for all legal challenges that are unaccompanied by any challenge to a particular removal proceeding.that is wishful thinking as we explain below,such a construct belies the statute plain meaning and runs contrary to congress discernible intent.
undocumented aliens can not escape the grip of section b by the simple expedient of banding together claims consigned by law to administrative channels,declining to raise them within the ambit of removal proceedings per se,and maintaining that those unexhausted claims do not implicate a particular removal determination.the reach of section b is not limited to challenges to singular orders of removal or to removal proceedings simpliciter.by its terms,the provision aims to consolidate all questions of law and fact that arise from either an action or a proceeding brought in connection with the removal of an alien.see b.importantly,the statute channels federal court jurisdiction over such questions of law and fact to the courts of appeals and explicitly bars all other methods of judicial review,including habeas.id.
the petitioners can not skirt the statutory channel markers by lumping together a melange of claims associated with removal,each of which would be jurisdictionally barred if brought alone,and eschewing a direct challenge to any particular removal proceeding.such selected arguments in the district court and leaving others for adjudication in the immigration an obvious loss of efficiency and bifurcation of review mechanisms.these are among the principal evils that congress sought to avoid through the passage of section b.see,at,reprinted in at.it is our task to enforce the statute as congress wrote it,and we reject the petitioners invitation to read the statute in a way that would frustrate congress unmistakable purpose.
in a somewhat related vein,the petitioners insist that the challenged actions occurred prior to the institution of any formal removal proceedings and,thus,are beyond the compass of the zipper clause.although their factual premise is unarguably correct,their conclusion is not nothing in the statute limits its reach to claims arising from extant removal proceedings.reading the statute to limit the exhaustion requirement to claims that arise from ongoing removal proceedings would put an undue premium on which party rushed to the courthouse first.more importantly,such a reading would render the word action superfluous and effectively excise it from the statute.yet it is a familiar canon of construction that,whenever possible,every word and phrase in a statute should be given effect.see,united states,cir.that canon demands our fidelity here.
none of this is to imply that section b is limitless in its scope.the words arising from do not lend themselves to precise application,see hiroshi motomura,judicial review in immigration cases after aadc lessons from civil procedure,geo.immigr,and courts have debated their meaning in other settings,see humphries various fed.usins employees,cir collecting cases.one thing is clear,however those words are not infinitely elastic.louisville nashville mottley.famously reading the analogous term arising under more narrowly than plain meaning might suggest.with respect to section b,these words can not be read to swallow all claims that might somehow touch upon,or be traced to,the government efforts to remove an alien.
to us,congress choice of phrase suggests that it did not intend section b to sweep within its scope claims with only a remote or attenuated connection to the removal of an alien.courts consistently have recognized that the term arising from requires more than a weak or tenuous connection to a triggering event.see,franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d humphries,at pizarro hoteles concorde int l,cir.
furthermore,if congress had intended to accomplish so a result,it could have used broader language.mcnary haitian refugee,d suggesting that if congress intended a certain provision of the ina to be read more expansively,it could have used more expansive language.for example,congress would have used the term related to instead of arising from.see humphries,at suggesting that related to signifies a somewhat looser nexus than arising from.
such a bounded reading of the statute is also suggested by the fact that certain claims are excluded from the sweep of section b by virtue of legislative intent and judicial precedent.to illustrate,the legislative history indicates that congress intended to create an exception for claims independent of removal,at,as reprinted in at.thus,when it passed the real id act,congress stated unequivocally that the channeling provisions of section b should not be read to preclude habeas review over challenges to detention.id.indicating that detention claims are independent of challenges to removal orders.in line with this prescription,we have held that district courts retain jurisdiction over challenges to the legality of detention in the immigration context.see hernández gonzales,cir holding that detention claims are independent of removal proceedings and,thus,not barred by section b.this seemingly encompasses constitutional challenges regarding the availability of bail.see,demore kim,d.
there is no reason to believe that section b exception for independent claims is restricted to those related to detention.sissoko rocha,cir suggesting that the broad provisions of g do not foreclose aliens claims for money damages under the doctrine of bivens six unknown named agents of the federal bureau of narcotics,d.after all,section b is a judicial channeling provision,not a one the provision,where applicable,only requires exhaustion of administrative procedures and the consolidation of claims for judicial review.
we say where applicable because removal proceedings are confined to determining whether a particular alien should be deported.see id.c a.while legal and factual issues relating to that question can be raised in removal proceedings and eventually brought to the court of appeals for judicial review,certain claims,by reason of the nature of the right asserted,can not be raised efficaciously within the administrative proceedings delineated in the ina.see,mcnary,at.jupiter ashcroft,cir.requiring the exhaustion of those claims would foreclose them from any meaningful judicial review.given congress clear intention to channel,rather than bar,judicial review through the mechanism of section b,reading arising from as used in that statute to encompass those claims would be perverse.
we thus read the words arising from in section b to exclude claims that are independent of,or wholly collateral to,the removal process.among others,claims that can not effectively be handled through the available administrative process fall within that purview.this reading,we believe,is consistent with the wise presumption that congress legislates with knowledge of longstanding rules of statutory construction.see mcnary,at.that presumption traditionally requires that there be clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent before restricting access to judicial review entirely.see,abbott labs.gardner,d.
this holding fits comfortably with traditional legal principles.courts long have recognized an exception to the exhaustion requirement for claims that are collateral to administrative proceedings.see,bowen city of new york,d mathews eldridge,d.in that regard,courts have been most willing to deem claims collateral when requiring exhaustion would foreclose all meaningful judicial review.thunder basin coal reich,d see leedom kyne,d upholding injunction against agency action when petitioners lacked any other means to protect or enforce their rights.
as a further reflection of this same attitude,courts have demonstrated a particular hostility toward requiring exhaustion when adequate relief could not feasibly be obtained through the prescribed administrative proceedings.see,mathews,at.that hostility also manifests itself when a party would be irreparably injured by adherence to an exhaustion requirement.bowen,at.
against this backdrop,we now turn to the question of whether section b requires administrative exhaustion of some or all of the petitioners claims.we deal sequentially with the petitioners assertions about their constitutional right to be free from harsh and inhumane conditions of confinement,their assertions anent the right to counsel,and their assertions concerning the right to family integrity.we subsume in these discussions the petitioners attempt to package their offerings as pattern and practice suits.
we need not linger long over the claims.we assume,for argument sake,that claims challenging the conditions of an alien detention are independent of removal proceedings.hernández,at holding that the real id act does not bar claims that merely challenge the length of an alien detention.here,however,the claims were not raised below.that is a significant omission.if any principle is settled in this circuit,it is that,absent the most extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union,local,superline transp,cir.
to elaborate,the amended complaint in this case makes no mention either of harsh conditions of confinement or of cruel and inhumane treatment during detention.it only challenges the legality and duration of neither of those challenges are renewed on appeal.
going beyond the pleadings,the lone mention in the district court record of any oppressively harsh conditions of confinement is in an affidavit attached to one of the petitioners preliminary motions.that cursory reference is insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.see.mun.wholesale,cir one should not be allowed to defeat the system by seeding the record with mysterious references to unpled claims,hoping to set the stage for an ambush should the ensuing ruling fail to suit.the petitioners,who could have asked the district court for leave further to amend their complaint.a,have shown no alone a compelling would prompt us to relax the prudential rule limiting appellate consideration to issues that were squarely raised below.the claims are,therefore,procedurally defaulted.we reject them on that basis 
the petitioners claims stand on more solid procedural ground.those claims were adequately raised below.we turn,then,to their viability.
as the government repeatedly reminds us,aliens have no constitutional right to counsel in removal proceedings.see lozada ins,cir see also ins,d stating that since a deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial do not apply in a deportation proceeding.but aliens nonetheless are entitled to due process,lozada,at,and the ina provides that,in removal proceedings,an alien shall have the privilege of being represented at no expense to the government by such counsel,authorized to practice in such proceedings,as he shall choose.
in this instance,the petitioners claim that their detention and subsequent transfer by the government infringed their rights to counsel by barring their access to lawyers,interfering with preexisting relationships,and making it difficult to secure counsel of their choosing.the threshold questions are whether these claims arise from removal and if so,whether they can be deemed independent of,or collateral to,the removal process and,thus,not subject to the channeling effect of section b.our answers to these questions require us to hold that the petitioners claims must be administratively exhausted.
the shorthand response to the petitioners plaint is that claims that are based upon an alleged deprivation of an alien right to counsel in connection with a removal proceeding,whether pending or imminent,arise from the removal proceeding.by any realistic measure,the alien right to counsel is part and parcel of the removal proceeding itself.see.so viewed,an alien right to counsel possesses a direct link to,and is inextricably intertwined with,the administrative process that congress so painstakingly fashioned.
the frequency with which claims arise in removal proceedings refutes any notion that such claims are sufficiently separate from removal proceedings to be considered either independent or collateral.challenges to removal orders premised on the government putative violation of an alien right to counsel are commonplace,and such claims are often featured in petitions for judicial review of removal orders.see,michel ins,cir batanic ins,cir ins,cir.ultimately,allowing aliens to ignore the channeling provisions of section b and bring claims directly in the district court would result in precisely the type of fragmented litigation that congress sought to forbid.
in this instance,requiring the administrative exhaustion of such claims does not,in the supreme court phrase,foreclose all meaningful judicial review of the claims.thunder basin,at.the petitioners unquestionably have the right,under the ina,to raise these claims before the immigration judge,before the board of immigration appeals bia,and ultimately before the court of appeals.see,michel,at.thus,the contrast to the plaintiffs in cases like bowen and receive effective relief for their alleged violations of the right to counsel simply by navigating the channels deliberately dredged by congress.
the proof of the pudding lies in the petitioners collective experiences.see supra note.in accordance with applicable regulations,see,each petitioner who requested a continuance for the purpose of retaining counsel received one.many others have been granted changes in venue,moving their cases from texas to massachusetts.see b.each petitioner who raised an issue of this sort may seek review,first by the bia and then by the regional court of appeals,of any adverse determination impacting his or her right to counsel.
we note,moreover,that the petitioners,who assert that they will be irreparably harmed if they are required to exhaust their claims administratively,have not satisfactorily explained how or why this is so.we find irreparable harm lacking in this instance.the absence of any such harm places this case at a considerable remove from cases like bowen and mathews,in which the delay attendant to the exhaustion of administrative remedies likely would have engendered irreparable injury.see bowen,at.not requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies because doing so might trigger a severe medical setback citation and internal quotation marks omitted mathews,at.not requiring exhaustion because plaintiff physical condition and dependence on disability benefits would,in the event,damage him in a way not recompensable through retroactive payments.
the petitioners have another string to their bow they invoke the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.see ashwander tva.brandeis,concurring united states nascimento,cir.specifically,they contend that requiring exhaustion of their claims will give rise to a substantive constitutional question similar to that noted by the supreme court in mcnary.this contention can not withstand scrutiny.
the mcnary claimants alleged that the immigration and naturalization service ins the predecessor agency to conducted its special agricultural workers program and,in so doing,violated their due process rights.at.in particular,they complained that the ins i precluded applicants from presenting witnesses or otherwise challenging adverse evidence on which initial benefit denials had been predicated ii failed to furnish competent interpreters and iii neglected to arrange for verbatim recording of interviews,thus inhibiting meaningful administrative review of decisions.id.at.
the supreme court expressed understandable concern about this procedural matrix.see id.at.reasoning that because review of agency action was confined to the record made in the proceeding at the initial decisionmaking level,the lack of an adequate record ensured that there would be no complete or meaningful basis upon which to review application determinations see also id.at.explaining that barring district court review would deprive the claimants of needed factfinding and capabilities.given these deficiencies,the court questioned the application of ina exhaustion requirements to claims alleging a pattern and practice of such due process violations.see id.at.the court suggested that the claims were collateral to the review of program status determinations and,thus,not covered by the exhaustion requirements.id.at.
the petitioners analogy to mcnary is imperfect.in the last analysis,mcnary was a statutory construction case.the court held that the statute governing review of special agricultural worker program status determinations did not bar district courts from exercising jurisdiction over due process pattern and practice claims that challenged the program characteristic procedures.id.the court noted that if congress had intended to require exhaustion of such claims,it could have used clear language to that effect.id.at.stating that congress could have modeled the statute on a,which governs review of veterans benefits claims,by referring to review on all questions of law and fact.
this holding is of little succor to the petitioners.section b sweeps much more broadly than the statute at issue in mcnary.indeed,its text tracks the very language suggested by the mcnary court as a means of consolidating claims for review and channeling into removal proceedings.see b providing for judicial review of all questions of law and fact arising from removal.this language is expansive enough to cover claims brought by aliens in connection with removal proceedings.
here,moreover,the claims do not give rise to potential constitutional problems of the kind that troubled the mcnary court.in contrast to mcnary,the petitioners do not challenge the manner in which an entire writ being implemented.they do not claim that the ina basic review procedures deny aliens the opportunity to call witnesses or challenge adverse evidence.and,finally,they do not denigrate the accuracy of the administrative record normally compiled in the immigration court.whereas in mcnary,the lack of a verbatim transcript made some degree of factfinding essential to a determination of whether the initial hearing afforded due process,id.at,no such problems are apparent here.
the bottom line is that immigration judges possess ample faculties,including the authority to administer oaths,receive evidence,issue subpoenas,call witnesses,and entertain.see,b.as previously noted,they routinely take evidence on,and adjudicate,claims alleging violations of the right to counsel.see,wang ashcroft,cir ins,cir.thus,the petitioners individual claims will need no supplemental factfinding in order to create a solid platform for further administrative and judicial review.
this means,of course,that reviewing tribunals,whether administrative or judicial,can fairly hear and determine,on the basis of the record compiled before the immigration judge,charges that ice actions during and after the bianco factory raid transgressed a particular petitioner right to counsel.given this reality,we are led inexorably to two conclusions.first,mcnary is distinguishable.second,the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is not in play in this case.see ex rel att y hudson.explaining that constitutional avoidance canon applies only if grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise from a particular statutory construction.
the petitioners mount several other efforts to subvert the ina exhaustion requirements and the channeling mechanism of section b.the first of these consists of styling their claims as pattern and practice claims.they argue that their claims do not challenge any individual legal deprivation but,rather,limn violations of constitutional and statutory rights arising from an unwholesome,but institutionalized,pattern and practice of conduct on the part of ice.
this construct seems to suggest that pattern and practice claims are always substantively different from individual claims because the former challenge an established policy of the agency,not an individual constitutional or statutory deprivation.while there may be qualitative as well as quantitative distinctions between pattern and practice claims,on the one hand,and individual claims,on the other hand,see,el rescate legal,exec.office of immigr,cir,merely conglomerating individual claims and posturing the conglomeration as a pattern and practice claim does not have talismanic effects.a pattern and practice claim is not a freestanding cause of action but merely a method of proving an underlying legal violation.see,celestine petroleos de venezuella sa,cir.
nor do we think that aliens can dodge the channeling machinery of section b simply by draping individual claims in the mantle of a class action.although the class action device constitutes an important weapon in the modern litigator armamentarium,it is merely a procedural device governed by federal rule of civil procedure,and congress retains the power to restrict its availability.see,e b forbidding the certification of class actions in cases under b mckenna first horizon home loan,cir holding that class action treatment is not available for tila rescission claims.
we add,moreover,that courts must always be wary of strategic behavior designed to sidestep exhaustion requirements.see,booth churner,d coleman thompson,d.that caveat has obvious relevance when aliens seek to employ the class action format to evade the ina channeling requirements.swan stoneman,cir suggesting that a district court may consider whether a class claim has been added merely to avoid the exhaustion requirement.
ultimately,then,we must discount nomenclature and follow the precept that substance trumps form.see nashville,ry.wallace.penhallow doane adm rs,dall.sec sg,cir.put bluntly,we must look through such easy evasions as creative labeling and consider the fundamental nature of the claims asserted.we can not allow collective end runs around congressional directives.
let us be perfectly clear.we do not suggest that section b strips district courts of jurisdiction over all pattern and practice claims.as the supreme court suggested in mcnary,at,requiring exhaustion of certain pattern and practice claims might result in a total denial of meaningful judicial review.the trick is to distinguish wheat from chaff,that is,to distinguish what must be exhausted from what need not be exhausted.in that endeavor,the most salient questions involve whether the underlying claims are cognizable within the review process established by congress,and if so,whether enforcement of the exhaustion requirement will allow meaningful judicial review without inviting an irreparable injury.mathews,at.underscoring that the nature of the claim being asserted and the consequences of deferment of judicial review are important factors in determining whether a statutory requirement of finality has been satisfied.when,as in this case,the answers to these queries yield no persuasive reason for bypassing the channels that congress has created,the use of pattern and practice or class action nomenclature can not alter the result.
the petitioners remaining effort to circumvent the channeling requirements of section b rests on a contention that the administrative and judicial review provisions of the ina are constitutionally suspect because they foreclose the availability of a particular type of remedy.in essence,they suggest that channeling their claims into the immigration court might raise constitutional concerns because declaratory and injunctive relief would not be available in that forum.we reject this suggestion.
while every right,when withheld,must have a remedy,and every injury its proper redress,marbury madison,cranch,congress has wide latitude in choosing which remedy or remedies are appropriate for the violation of a particular constitutional right.see generally henry hart,the power of congress to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts an exercise in dialectic,harv.congress possesses the power to regulate the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts,see,cary curtis,how,and the supreme court has not found constitutional difficulties in congressional abrogation of certain remedies as long as others are left intact.see,lauf shinner.rejecting an argument that restrictions on injunctive relief contained in the act offend the constitution cary,at upholding congress abolition of a cause of action against a tax collector based in part on the fact that the claimant was not without other modes of redress swain pressley,d holding that the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
courts also have rebuffed litigants attempts to bypass congressionally mandated exhaustion requirements by demanding remedies that the administrative procedures can not grant.see,booth,at.holding that prisoners must exhaust administrative remedies under the prison litigation reform act regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures frazier fairhaven sch,cir exhaustion is beneficial regardless of whether the administrative process offers the specific form of remediation sought by a particular plaintiff.
to sum up,while congress probably can not nullify rights guaranteed in the constitution by prohibiting all remedies for the violation of those rights,see,webster doe,d requiring clear expression of congressional intent to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims but see id.at.scalia,dissenting asserting that it is simply untenable that there must be a judicial remedy for every constitutional violation,this is not such a case.the remedies left open by section b are neither inadequate nor ineffective to protect the petitioners rights.swain,at.limning this test in the habeas context.each petitioner right to counsel can be adequately addressed and effectively vindicated before an immigration judge who can grant a continuance,order a change of venue,or take other pragmatic steps to ensure that the right is not sullied.in turn,those orders can be meaningfully reviewed,first by the bia and then by the court of appeals.no more is exigible to uphold the district court dismissal of the petitioners claims.
before concluding this phase of our discussion,we deem it advisable to add that,in an abundance of caution,we have sifted through the petitioners pleadings,briefs,and other submissions.to the extent that they arguably have raised procedural due process claims above and beyond their as their vaguely articulated plaints about difficulties in calling witnesses and in presenting evidence at the removal find that section b mandates their exhaustion.
our reasoning is by now familiar.the petitioners procedural due process rights arise from removal in that they are part of the fabric of the removal proceedings themselves.this imbrication is borne out by the fact that,like claims,claims alleging violations of the right to procedural due process are commonplace in petitions for administrative and judicial review of removal orders.see,frech att y,cir enwonwu gonzales,cir see also bia,cir considering virtually identical due process claims on appeal from a final order of deportation.
we conclude,therefore,that given the nature of those claims and their wonted treatment,they can not plausibly be viewed as either independent of,or collateral to,removal proceedings it follows that the channeling mechanism of section b governs such claims if,indeed,they have been properly pleaded and adequately developed.
this leaves only the petitioners substantive due process claims,which allege violations of the fifth amendment right of parents to make decisions as to the care,custody,and control of their children.see,troxel granville,d.we conclude that,unlike most of the petitioners other claims,these claims are collateral to removal and,thus,outside the channeling mechanism of section b.
we set the stage.the petitioners were carted away unceremoniously at the time of the factory raid.they allege that their immediate detention,the subsequent string of transfers many of them to distant climes,and ice inadequate efforts either to notify or to work with social service agencies disrupted family units.that alleged disruption forms the centerpiece of their substantive due process claims.
to be sure,these claims bear some connection to removal.but the link is tenuous the right to family integrity is only marginally related to removal,the harm from continuing disruption may be irretrievable,and the issue is not one with which the immigration court ordinarily would grapple.thus,reading section b to mandate administrative exhaustion of a substantive due process claim that asserts this kind of family integrity violation likely would sound the death knell for meaningful judicial review.the issue of family integrity is completely irrelevant to the of issues that will be litigated in removal proceedings,and the claims have no bearing on the aliens immigration status.to cinch matters,the petitioners have no other means within their control through which to protect or enforce the asserted right.
holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction over these substantive due process claims not only would be inconsistent with the express purpose of section b which is to channel claims,not to bar also would contradict the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative actions.see abbott,at.and,finally,because the petitioners would be left without any effective remedy,they would be irreparably harmed by this proposed application of the exhaustion requirement.
in reaching the conclusion that the family integrity claims are collateral and,thus,not subject to the exhaustion requirement,we do not break with precedent.contrary to the government insinuations,this case is distinct from cases like gonzales,cir.there,the alien unsuccessfully attempted to wedge a family integrity claim into a removal proceeding.id.at.here,unlike in,the petitioners do not base their claims on the notion that their removal will split the family unit and thus violate substantive due process rather,they contend more narrowly that ice failure to allow them time to make arrangements for the care of their children before hauling them off violated their rights to family integrity and,thus,worked a substantive due process violation.
because we hold that the district court should not have dismissed this subset of claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,we must address the government alternate argument that a different statutory provision,a b ii,bars the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over all of the petitioners claims including the substantive due process claims.that statute provides in pertinent part 
notwithstanding any provision of law and regardless of whether the judgment,decision,or action is made in removal proceedings,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
ii any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security 
id.for present purposes,this language must be read in conjunction with g,which provides that t he attorney general shall arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal.
the government says that the latter statute entrusts both the timing and placement of an alien detention to the unfettered discretion of the attorney general.building on that foundation,it posits that those sorts of wholly discretionary decisions are unreviewable under section a b ii.accordingly,the government urges us to find that the district court lacked jurisdiction over constitutional and statutory claims,such as the substantive due process claims advanced by the petitioners,arising out of the petitioners detention and transfers.
we reject the government sprawling construction of section a b ii.as we have noted before,so broad a reading is not evident from the statute text.see royal siam chertoff,cir.a more natural reading would leave the petitioners substantive due process claims outside the reach of the statute.
in the first instance,there is considerable uncertainty as to whether section g encompasses the authority to transfer detainees.the first sentence of the the power to arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens detained suggests that it might the second sentence,which authorizes the attorney general to acquire land and to acquire,build and remodel,repair,and operate facilities,reflects more of a orientation.
here,however,this question of statutory interpretation is of mainly academic interest.we need not resolve it because,in all events,section g fails to specify that individualized transfer decisions are in the attorney general discretion.this is in stark contrast to other sections of the ina.see,c,a b v,c f,b d see also alaka att y,cir stating that there are no less than additional provisions in the very subchapter of the ina referenced by a b ii that make explicit the grant of discretion to the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security.if a statute does not explicitly specify a particular authority as discretionary,section a b ii does not bar judicial review of an ensuing agency action.see alsamhouri gonzales,cir.
we are aware that one respected court has stated that section a b ii pretermits judicial review of the attorney general decision to transfer detainees.van dinh reno,cir.there,the panel said that it was giving effect to the literal meaning of the statute.id.but this is a minority view as other courts have recognized,the plain language of the statute calls that statement into question.see zhao gonzales,cir concluding that van dinh misstates the statutory text and analyze s statutory language that congress did not adopt spencer,united states,cir finding van dinh reasoning unpersuasive because the plain language of section a b ii requires that discretionary authority be specified by the statute.
we share the view of the fifth and ninth circuits.consequently,we reject van dinh and hold that section a b ii does not strip the district courts of jurisdiction over substantive due process claims that are collateral to removal proceedings when those claims challenge decisions about the detention and transfer of aliens on family integrity grounds.
although the petitioners substantive due process claims survive the ina jurisdictional gauntlet,the government contends in the alternative that these statements of claim fail to limn causes of action on which relief may be granted.see.b.the district court did not reach this issue,but we can affirm its order of dismissal on any alternative ground made manifest in the record.see intergen,at.thus,we test the viability of the substantive due process claims,accepting as true all the factual averments in the amended complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the petitioners favor.educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.
we begin with bedrock.the fifth amendment mandates that no person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.v.the due process guarantee has both procedural and substantive aspects.amsden moran,cir.its substantive component is at issue here.that component bars certain offensive government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.daniels williams,d.
the criteria for identifying whether government action offends the guarantee of substantive due process hinge on the nature of the challenged government action.see county of sacramento lewis,d depoutot raffaelly,cir.when challenging executive action under the imprimatur of substantive due process,the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.lewis,at.this mantra reflects a realization that challenges to executive action must be viewed through the prism of a particular need to preserve the constitutional proportions of constitutional claims,lest the constitution be demoted to what we have called a font of tort law.id.
consistent with this need to refrain from constitutionalizing ordinary misfeasance or malfeasance,the shock the conscience standard erects a high hurdle for claimants.as a result,liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of substantive due process.id.at.indeed,the requisite arbitrariness and caprice must be stunning,evidencing more than humdrum legal error.amsden,at.that strain of exaggerated arbitrariness historically has involved deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life,liberty,or property.daniels,at.thus,e xecutive branch action that sinks to the depths of shocking the contemporary conscience is much more likely to find its roots in conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.depoutot,at quoting lewis,at.
here,the petitioners claim in essence that their immediate detention and swift transfer to distant dros wreaked havoc with their right to make decisions about the care,custody,and control of their minor children,leaving many minors unattended.but neither the petitioners amended complaint nor their briefs offer any reason to believe that ice actions were so extreme,egregious,or outrageously offensive as to cross the shock the conscience line.depoutot,at.we elaborate below.
the petitioners state cursorily in their amended complaint that the government willfully interfered with their rights.but any claim of an intentional deprivation is belied by the petitioners concession that ice took at least some measures to alleviate any resultant harm moreover,the petitioners do not make any showing that the amount of time during which they were denied the ability to make arrangements for their children was disproportionate to what was reasonably necessary to process the large number of aliens detained during the factory raid.while ice actions during and after the raid seem callous in certain respects,the facts alleged suggest no more than negligence or misordered priorities.
our thinking is influenced by a realization that the evenhanded enforcement of the immigration laws,in and of itself,can not conceivably be held to violate substantive due process.see,at de robles ins,cir.any interference with the right to family integrity alleged here was incidental to the government legitimate interest in effectuating detentions pending the removal of persons illegally in the country.see demore,at.recognizing detention during deportation proceedings as a constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process.
this is critically important because every such detention of a parent,like every lawful arrest of a parent,runs the risk of interfering in some way with the parent ability to care for his or her children.see,at.that a detention has an impact on the cohesiveness of a family unit is an inevitable concomitant of the deprivation of liberty inherent in the detention itself.so long as the detention is lawful,that deprivation of the right to family integrity does not violate the constitution.
we hold,therefore,that such an incidental interference,standing alone,is not of constitutional magnitude.to rule otherwise would risk turning every lawful detention or arrest of a parent into a substantive due process claim.that would place new and unprecedented constraints on law enforcement activities.such constraints would be unwarranted.
applying the jurisprudence of substantive due process is an exercise that is highly dependent on context and detail.depoutot,at.were a substantial number of young children knowingly placed in harm way,it is easy to imagine how viable claims might lie.but to state a cause of action for a substantive due process violation,the petitioners pleading would have to allege facts that showed a plausible entitlement to relief.bell atl.twombly,d.the petitioners have not scaled this barrier 
one further point is worthy of mention.while the shock the conscience test comprises the threshold inquiry with respect to substantive due process violations,the petitioners also must show that the government deprived them of a protected interest in life,liberty,or property.see pagán calderón,cir see also lewis,at.asserting that the inquiry may be informed by a history of liberty protection.here,the nature of the underlying right asserted by the petitioners reinforces our conclusion that they have not stated a viable substantive due process claim.
we see the matter this way.although the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their offspring is among the most venerable of the liberty interests protected by the fifth amendment,see,troxel,at.hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir,the petitioners have not demonstrated that this guarantee of substantive due process encompasses their assertions.after all,the right to family integrity has been recognized in only a narrow subset of circumstances.
to be sure,the petitioners cite cursorily to cases that deal with this right but they conspicuously fail to build any bridge between these cases and the facts that they allege.we do not think that this is an accident.the petitioners claims seem markedly different from those scenarios that courts heretofore have recognized under the rubric of family integrity.they have not alleged that the government has interfered permanently with their custodial rights.see,stanley illinois,d.nor have they alleged that the government has meddled with their right to make fundamental decisions regarding their children education,see,meyer nebraska,or religious affiliation,see,wisconsin yoder,d.taken most favorably to the petitioners,the interference alleged here is transitory in nature and in no way impinges on parental prerogatives to direct the upbringing of their children.
we have scoured the case law for any authority suggesting that claims similar to those asserted here are actionable under the substantive component of the due process clause,and we have found none that chasm is important because,given the scarcity of guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area,courts must be reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process.washington glucksberg,d quoting collins harker heights,d.
this unfortunate case is a paradigmatic example of an instance in which the prudential principle announced by the collins court should be heeded.accordingly,we dismiss the petitioners substantive due process claims for failure to satisfy the prerequisites of federal rule of civil procedure b.
we are sensitive to the concerns raised by the petitioners and are conscious that undocumented workers,like all persons who are on american soil,have certain inalienable rights.but in the first instance,it is the has the responsibility of prescribing a framework for the vindication of those rights.when congress speaks clearly and formulates a regime that satisfies constitutional imperatives,the courts must follow congress lead.in that sense,it does not matter whether a court approves or disapproves of an agency modus operandi.
we add only two comments.first,we applaud the able district judge for the skill and sensitivity with which he handled this highly charged case.second,we express our hope that ice,though it has prevailed,nonetheless will treat this chiaroscuro series of events as a learning experience in order to devise better,less ways of carrying out its important responsibilities.
the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.all parties shall bear their own costs.
this seems an appropriate place to mention that,before oral argument in this court,the government moved to supplement the record with copies of orders from immigration judges awarding continuances,changes of venue,and other ancillary relief to several of the petitioners.we grant the motion.although we generally limit appellate consideration to the record before the district court,this submission comes within an exception to the usual rule because we may take judicial notice of the proffered orders.see,fornalik perryman,cir taking judicial notice of ins actions see also.advisory committee note stating that judicial notice may be taken on appeal.as we explain later in this opinion,the orders are highly relevant to a determination of whether the petitioners have an adequate forum in which to present their claims.
congress knows how to bar claims in the immigration context when it desires to do so.see,g declaring that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the attorney general to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders.
although the petitioners amended complaint asserts that ice violated their due process rights by removing them from massachusetts prior to holding bond hearings,that claim has not been squarely raised on appeal.the petitioners brief only mentions the right to a bond hearing in passing,and it is settled that issues adverted to in a perfunctory
