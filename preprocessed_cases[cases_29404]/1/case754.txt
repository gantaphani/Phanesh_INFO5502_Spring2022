cesar espinal,an inmate of the new york state department of correctional services docs,filed a lawsuit,under,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging,inter alia,that the defendants used excessive force against him and denied him medical treatment in violation of the eighth amendment,that they did so in retaliation for espinal prior lawsuits,and that they conspired to assault him and deny him medical care in violation of his constitutional rights.the district court george yanthis,issued an order,entered on september,that granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion for summary judgment the district court dismissed all claims against twelve of the fourteen defendants on the ground that espinal failed to exhaust administrative remedies,under the prison litigation reform act of,by failing to name those defendants in his grievance.the district court granted summary judgment,in part,in favor of the two remaining defendants,surber and frasher,because espinal failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on the conspiracy claims and because there were no triable issues of material fact on the retaliation claims.the district court denied summary judgment as to espinal excessive force claims against surber and frasher.a jury returned a verdict in favor of surber and frasher on the excessive force claims.espinal appealed the order granting summary judgment in part and an order,made by oral decision and entered on january,that denied his motion for a new trial.
after the district court order granting summary judgment in part,the supreme court held in jones bock that exhaustion under the prison litigation reform act does not require a prisoner grievance to identify the parties responsible for misconduct unless an identification requirement is provided in the state grievance procedures,d.because the new york docs grievance procedures do not require an inmate to specifically name responsible parties,espinal did not fail to exhaust his administrative remedies by omitting the names of the defendants from his prison grievance.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment on this ground.we also reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of surber and frasher on the conspiracy claims and the retaliation claims.we affirm the district court denial of espinal motion for a new trial,and deny espinal request for a temporary restraining order 
background 
espinal makes the following allegations in his section complaint.on the morning of december,espinal got into a dispute with another inmate,but was not harmed.he was then taken to the medical clinic for a fight exam.officer williams,who is not a defendant in this action,escorted espinal to the clinic.espinal was allegedly confronted by sergeant wilson,corrections officers surber,rosario,frasher,ayotle,and several additional officers,who brought him into the room of the clinic.surber,ayotle,and frasher repeatedly slammed espinal into the wall.the officers asked espinal whether he had been in a fight.before espinal answered,rosario told him to,and surber struck him on the side of his head.the officers then informed espinal that they would hit him if he did not answer their questions in the affirmative.surber and rosario allegedly punched espinal several times on the side of the head when he did not respond to their questions.
when officer williams returned to ask whether espinal was ready to be brought into the clinic,the defendants informed williams that they were not finished with espinal.the officers continued to hit espinal and kicked him in his right leg where he was previously injured by a gun shot.espinal was taken into the clinic at approximately after a beating,and was warned not to tell anyone what happened.espinal had previously filed a lawsuit against several docs defendants,including surber,in june.espinal alleges that he was told by the officers during the december,incident that this is what happens to i nmates when they submit law suits against us,and that they threatened to kill him.
at the clinic,espinal was first seen by nurse healy.espinal informed healy that the officers caused his injuries,but healy was told by surber that the injuries resulted from the fight with the other inmate.espinal was then seen by a doctor,defendant chakravarty,who tried to examine espinal,but espinal refused treatment because chakravarty method of examination was causing him pain.espinal would not sign a form and asked to be seen by another doctor.chakravarty denied the request.espinal then asked sergeant hafford if he could be seen by another doctor and be taken to the mental health unit.hafford denied these requests because espinal medical charts showed that he had refused medical treatment and did not indicate any mental health problems.
espinal was then left in a room with surber and ayotle who verbally harassed him.specifically,surber threatened to kill espinal if espinal did not attempt suicide.espinal was taken back to his cell at around espinal asked to go to emergency sick call several times,but defendant martucello denied his requests.later that day,around,espinal was again brought to the clinic and was reevaluated.an inmate injury report was prepared that listed injuries to espinal head,right leg,and wrists.subsequently,espinal had several appointments to be seen by the medical department during december,january,and february.espinal alleges that the officers and defendant rodas did not permit him to attend those appointments.
the defendants denied espinal allegations in their answer,and asserted failure to exhaust administrative remedies as an affirmative defense.the record contains two internal grievances filed by espinal that are pertinent to this lawsuit.in the first grievance,filed on december,espinal claimed that,on that morning,in the sick call room,he was handcuffed and beaten severe ly to the head,face,and body,by officer surber,officer frash e r and other countless security officers,as they were slurring racial comments and threats of killing me,and that the beating was retaliation against him.on february,defendant christopher artuz,of green haven correctional facility,denied the grievance,finding espinal was not refused medical attention,rather,espinal himself refused medical assistance,and there was no evidence to substantiate espinal allegations of unprofessional conduct and threats.on february,espinal appealed,and on april,his appeal was denied.
in the second grievance,dated january,espinal stated that he was making a complaint against green haven medical for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in connection with various m andatory c linic a ppointments,and asserted that the conduct of prison officials and medical personal sic denied him access to medical care.on march,artuz denied the grievance,reasoning that medical personnel had seen espinal times since october,and granted the grievance to the extent that espinal would continue to receive treatment as prescribed.on april,espinal appealed,and on april,his appeal was denied.
in october,the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that all of espinal claims,except the excessive force and retaliation claims against surber and frasher,should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the prison litigation reform act and the excessive force and retaliation claims against surber and frasher should be dismissed because espinal raised no triable issues of material fact.the district court found that espinal failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to all defendants except surber and frasher because he never specifically named those defendants in his grievances.the district court noted that espinal grievances referred to the countless security officers involved in the december,incident,and to deliberate indifference by green haven medical,prison officials,and medical personal sic in connection with the alleged denial of medical appointments.but the district court considered these references insufficient to exhaust claims against unnamed defendants,particularly given the fact that espinal was able to remember the names of the officers he claim ed to have taken part in the incidents when he drafted his complaint in this lawsuit.the district court also dismissed the conspiracy claims against surber and frasher because,inter alia,espinal never asserted the existence of a conspiracy to assault him or deny him medical care in either of his grievances.
the district court then turned to the remaining claims against surber and frasher.espinal alleged that the beating by the officers was perpetrated in retaliation for a previous lawsuit against several docs defendants,including surber,that was filed in june and was dismissed on june.the district court found that espinal retaliation claims did not raise any triable issues of material fact.the district court considered the outcome of the grievance hearing on the december,incident,espinal history of misbehavior,and the length of time between the filing of the lawsuit and the incident a year and a half after filing the lawsuit and six months after dismissal.the district court determined,however,that espinal raised triable issues of material fact on the excessive force claims against surber and frasher.
the excessive force claims were tried before a jury on october,and november.espinal was represented by counsel at trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.espinal counsel moved for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court denied the motion for a new trial in an oral decision.
espinal filed a timely appeal of the september,order granting summary judgment in part and the january,order denying the motion for a new trial.
discussion 
exhaustion of administrative remediesa.the scope of the plra exhaustion requirement 
the prison litigation reform act of plra states that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.the plra exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life,whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes,and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.porter nussle,d.prisoners must utilize the state grievance procedures,regardless of whether the relief sought is offered through those procedures.booth churner,d.
in woodford ngo,the supreme court held that the plra exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion,d.the prisoner in woodford argued that administrative remedies were unavailable once the prison rejected his grievance as untimely.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument.the court held that p roper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency deadlines and other critical procedural rules as a precondition to filing a federal lawsuit.id.at.woodford explained that compliance with state procedural rules is necessary to achieve t he benefits of exhaustion that can be realized only if the prison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the grievance.id.at.
in jones bock,d,the supreme court was again confronted with several questions regarding the scope of the plra exhaustion requirement.one of those questions was whether a prisoner fails to exhaust a claim against a particular defendant by failing to name that defendant in the internal prison grievance.id.at.the supreme court explained that woodford held that to properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules rules that are defined not by the plra,but by the prison grievance process itself.id.at.quoting woodford,at.citation omitted.it follows,as recognized by the court,that t he level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim,because it is the prison requirements,and not the plra,that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.id.
the exhaustion inquiry thus requires that we look at the state prison procedures and the prisoner grievance to determine whether the prisoner has complied with those procedures.see jones,at.woodford,at.in jones,a unanimous supreme court,employing this approach,found that michigan grievance procedures did not require the prisoner to specifically identify in his grievance those officials responsible for alleged misconduct,and only offered the general guidance that prisoners should be as specific as possible and b e brief and concise in framing their grievances.id.at.quotation marks omitted.the court also noted that the inmate grievance forms did not prompt prisoners to name the responsible parties.id.because plra exhaustion only mandates compliance with the state procedural rules and michigan procedures ma de no mention of naming particular officials,there was no authority for a court to impose such a requirement.id.the court explained that the rationale for an identification to a particular official who may later be not one of the primary benefits of exhaustion,which seeks to promote the ability of the prison system to respond to complaints,to reduce litigation,and to improve the record when litigation nonetheless commences in the courts.id.at.the court concluded that exhaustion is not per se inadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in the grievances.id.
new york docs inmate grievance program 
the second circuit has yet to address the question presented in jones as applied to new york docs inmate grievance program that is,whether new york docs inmate grievance program regulations require a prisoner,in a grievance,to name particular officials who are allegedly responsible for misconduct,in order to later bring suit against those officials in federal court.the question is presented here because the district court found as to twelve of the fourteen defendants based exclusively on espinal failure to specifically name those defendants in either of his grievances.
we look first to the new york docs inmate grievance program igp procedures.the relevant regulations in this case are those that were in place during and when espinal filed the grievances at issue.those igp regulations were repealed and new regulations were adopted in.see,tit,et.however,as noted by the state in its brief,there are only minor differences between the former and the current regulations.hence,although we consider the regulations in place during and when espinal filed his grievances,we note that our analysis is equally applicable to the regulations in place today.
the igp has a regular process for adjudicating inmate complaints the prisoner files a grievance with the inmate grievance resolution committee igrc,the prisoner may appeal an adverse decision by the igrc to the superintendent of the facility,and the prisoner then may appeal an adverse decision by the superintendent to the central officer review committee corc,tit,the igp also has an expedited process for harassment grievances,id.which pertains to e mployee conduct meant to annoy,intimidate,or harm an inmate,id.a.see also hemphill new york,cir.a harassment grievance is sent directly to the superintendent.id.b.if the grievance is a bona fide harassment issue,the superintendent must initiate or request an investigation,id.b,and render a decision,id.b,after which the prisoner could then appeal to the corc,id.b.espinal grievance with respect to the december,incident was handled through the expedited procedure for harassment grievances,whereas the grievance charging that espinal was not allowed to attend scheduled medical appointments was addressed through the regular procedure.
the igp regulations provide that an inmate must submit a complaint on an inmate grievance complaint form,or on plain paper if the form is not readily available,tit,a.the regulations state that the c ontent of the grievance should include the inmate name,department identification number,housing unit,and program assignment,id.a i,and spaces for this information are included on the complaint form.this provision further states that the grievance must contain a concise,specific description of the problem and the action requested and indicate what actions the grievant has taken to resolve the complaint.id.the complaint form also provides spaces for the inmate to include a d escription of p roblem,which is to be as brief as possible,and the a ction requested.
the new york igp regulations do not state that a prisoner grievance must name the responsible party.like the policy in jones,at,the igp regulations offer the general guidance that a grievance should contain a concise,specific description of the problem,tit,a i,and the complaint form does not instruct the inmate to name the officials allegedly responsible for misconduct.the supreme court in jones held that similarly broad regulatory language in michigan grievance procedures was insufficient to convey an identification requirement.at.we find that new york igp also does not contain an express identification requirement.the scope of proper exhaustion under the plra is determined by reference to the state grievance system procedural rules.jones,at.woodford,at.because new york igp does not articulate an identification requirement,it is plain that a new york state prisoner is not required to name responsible parties in a grievance in order to exhaust administrative remedies.
the state acknowledges the jones decision but does not meaningfully address it.the state also has not pointed to any provision of the igp regulations that constitutes an identification requirement.it might have pointed us to the section of the new york igp regulations on harassment grievances which states that t he employee who allegedly committed the misconduct shall be a direct party to the grievance,tit,a direct party is defined as a n individual so uniquely affected by the grievance that fair play dictates that should be afforded the opportunity to provide input prior to any decision and also to appeal any disposition rendered.id.h.a direct party,under the igp regulations,is entitled to appear at hearings,to present information at hearings,to receive notice of hearing decisions,and to appeal adverse decisions.id.a i,iv,v,b,c,b.
the direct party provision,however,can not be construed as an identification requirement.nowhere in the regulations does it say that the prisoner must name each direct party in their grievance.to be sure,the state must be aware of the identity of a direct party to inform the employee that a claim has been made,that the employee is entitled to present information at a hearing,and that the employee may appeal adverse decisions.but the regulations do not clearly indicate that the onus of identification lies with the prisoner making a grievance.it is plausible that an identification requirement is absent from the regulations because there are cases when an inmate is unable to name responsible parties.moreover,as long as the prisoner provides enough information about the alleged misconduct,which is a requirement already included in the igp regulations,id.a i,the state will normally be able to identify any direct party to a grievance on its own through investigation.
the pro se prisoner can not be expected to infer the existence of an identification requirement in the absence of a procedural rule stating that the grievance must include the names of the responsible parties.where new york grievance procedures do not require prisoners to identify the individuals responsible for alleged misconduct,neither does the plra for exhaustion purposes.see jones,at.
espinal grievances 
given the foregoing analysis of new york grievance procedures,espinal was not required to specifically identify the responsible parties in his grievance in order to later name them as defendants in this lawsuit.espinal only had to provide a specific description of the problem,tit,a i.we find that espinal has complied with this requirement and exhausted his claims against the defendants.
espinal first grievance,in addition to alleging the involvement of surber,frasher,and countless other security officers in the beating,included the specific date,time,and location of the incident about which he complained,and that he was beaten for retaliatory reasons.these allegations provided enough information to alert the prison to the nature of the wrong for which redress was sought,johnson testman,cir quoting strong david,cir alteration omitted,and to afford time and opportunity for the state to address the complaint internally,id.quoting porter,at.this is apparent from the prison officials initiation of an investigation of espinal complaint.the investigator claims to have conducted interviews with all officers involved,but does not specify the names of officers other than surber and frasher.whether this means that no other officers were involved or that the investigator omitted other officers from the report is unknown.the point is that prison officials had the necessary information to investigate the complaints and the opportunity to learn which officers were involved in the alleged incident.espinal grievance was sufficient to advance the benefits of exhaustion.jones,at.
we find that espinal exhausted his excessive force and retaliation claims as to all defendants allegedly involved in the december,incident.the district court separately found that espinal failed to exhaust administrative remedies as to his conspiracy claims because he never asserted in his grievance the existence of a conspiracy to assault him.we do not read the requirement in the igp that the grievance describe the problem to imply that the prisoner must articulate legal theories.see johnson,at quoting strong,at.espinal did not have to assert the existence of a conspiracy to exhaust his conspiracy claim it is sufficient that his grievance adequately described the alleged misconduct.
the state argues that espinal did not exhaust his claims against the defendants who allegedly denied medical care on december.while espinal grievance with respect to the december,incident does not explicitly discuss the misconduct by medical personnel which is alleged in the complaint,it is clear that the state considered these allegations when reviewing espinal grievance.superintendent artuz denied the grievance,in part,because espinal was not refused medical attention,but rather himself,refused medical assistance.espinal thus exhausted his claims with respect to the alleged denial of medical treatment on december.
espinal second grievance also exhausted his claims that he was denied medical care in violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.the grievance alleged that green haven medical department,its medical personnel,and prison officials refused to allow espinal to attend his scheduled medical appointments.this was a sufficient description of the alleged wrong.the state assertion that the grievance failed to provide prison officials with sufficient notice of wrongdoing to cause them to investigate any such claim can not be squared with the conclusion of the investigator report.the investigator found that medical personnel had seen espinal times since october and the superintendent denied the grievance based on this finding.this grievance enabled the state to investigate espinal claim that he was denied access to medical care.espinal has thus exhausted his eighth amendment claims.
on remand,the district court should consider whether espinal claims against the defendants present triable issues of fact.
ii.espinal retaliation claims 
to prove a first amendment retaliation claim under section,a prisoner must show that that the speech or conduct at issue was protected,that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff,and that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse action.gill pidlypchak,cir quoting dawes walker,cir,overruled on other grounds,swierkiewicz sorema,d there is no dispute that espinal earlier federal lawsuit,filed in june and dismissed in june,was a protected activity.see colon coughlin,cir holding that prison officials are prohibited from retaliating against prisoners who exercise the right to petition for redress of grievances.while the district court appears to have assumed that the alleged beating was an adverse action for purposes of a
