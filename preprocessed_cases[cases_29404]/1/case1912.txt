petitioner,kentucky resources council,seeks review of the epa administrator final rulemaking action approving revisions to the kentucky state implementation plan sip.under the revisions,kentucky was allowed to move its vehicle inspection and maintenance program for three northern kentucky counties from the active or regulatory portion of its sip under the clean air act to the contingency measures portion of the kentucky sip.because we find the epa action is entitled to deference,we affirm.
statutory and regulatory background 
enacted in and substantially amended in and,the clean air act caa establishes a comprehensive program for controlling and improving the nation air quality through a combination of state and federal regulation.caa a,a.title i of the caa charges the epa with the responsibility of identifying air pollutants that endanger the public health and welfare,and with formulating the national ambient air quality standards naaqs that establish maximum permissible concentrations of those pollutants in the outside or ambient air.the epa has established naaqs for six pollutants,including ozone.see.with regard to ozone,the epa promulgated a ozone standard in,at a concentration of parts per million,measured over a period.see.the ozone standard was revised in to a standard of parts per million measured over an period.see.the standard applies throughout the nation,including the northern kentucky area.id.
pursuant to the act,as amended in,the epa designated areas of the country as attainment or nonattainment,depending upon whether or not they met the naaqs for a particular pollutant,or unclassifiable if there was insufficient information available to classify an area.see d.under the amendments,ozone nonattainment areas are further classified as marginal,moderate,serious,severe,or extreme depending on the severity of the ozone problem.a.air quality planning requirements increase cumulatively as the severity of the classification increases.included among those requirements is the obligation to adopt and implement either a basic or an enhanced program,depending upon the population of the area and its specific nonattainment designation.
under a,each state has primary responsibility for ensuring that the ambient air meets the naaqs for the identified pollutants.this responsibility includes the requirement that the states submit legally enforceable state implementation plans sips.the sips and any revisions thereto must be adopted by the state after reasonable notice and public hearing.a.each sip must comply with the various substantive requirements set forth in a the epa reviews each proposed sip,and a sip becomes federally enforceable once it is approved by the epa.the kentucky sip is codified at.
for all nonattainment areas,a state must submit an attainment demonstration to show that the area will achieve the naaqs by no later than the area statutory attainment deadline.see attainment demonstrations c attainment dates.the attainment demonstration must include an emission control strategy,which includes enforceable emission limitations,and other such control measures,means or techniques as well as schedules and timetables for compliance,as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of such standard in such area by the applicable attainment date.c.when a previously designated nonattainment area can demonstrate to the agency that it has met the naaqs and certain other criteria,it may be redesignated to attainment.d e.as part of the requirements for redesignation to attainment,the act requires the state to submit and implement a maintenance plan that includes those regulatory programs that will be placed or remain in effect in the area to maintain continuing attainment.
sips for areas that have been redesignated to attainment also must contain contingency measures to assure prompt correction of any violation of the standard that may occur following redesignation.d.the sip contingency provisions must include a requirement that the state will implement all control measures for the naaqs of concern that were contained in the sip prior to redesignation to attainment status.this means that such contingency measures would only take effect if the area has a violation of the standard after being redesignated to attainment.id.
the epa is charged with the responsibility of reviewing and adopting sips.see k.within months after the state submission is found to be complete,either by epa or by operation of law due to the passage of time,the epa is required to act on the submission.if the epa determines that the sip is complete,the administrator shall approve the sip within months of such determination if it meets all of the applicable requirements of the act.k.if the epa determines that the submitted sip does not meet the statutory requirements,it can issue a conditional approval,a partial approval and disapproval,or a full disapproval.k.finally,the caa contains an provision,which prohibits the epa from approving any revision to a sip if the revision would interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.l.
as discussed above,the epa revised the standard for ozone in to a new value of parts per million to be measured over an period.see.on april,the epa published a final rule containing air quality designations and classifications for every area in the united states under the new ozone naaqs.see part.the rule went into effect on june.april.additionally,the epa adopted provisions for implementation of the standard which specifically guide the transition of areas from the naaqs to the naaqs.see.
sets forth specific requirements for the transition to the new standard for areas based upon their designations under both the old and new standards.for areas,like northern kentucky,designated as nonattainment for the naaqs and maintenance for the naaqs,the regulation requires the following 
an area designated nonattainment for the naaqs that is a maintenance area for the naaqs at the time of designation for the naaqs for that area remains subject to the obligation to implement the applicable requirements as defined in f to the extent such obligations are required by the approved sip except as provided in paragraph b of this section.applicable measures in the sip must continue to be implemented however,if these measures were shifted to contingency measures prior to designation for the naaqs for the area,they may remain as contingency measures,unless the measures are required to be implemented by the caa by virtue of the area requirements under the naaqs.the state may not remove such measures from the sip.
the exception mentioned in the above provision refers to subsection b,which provides 
a state remains subject to the obligations under paragraphs a i and a of this section until the area attains the naaqs.after the area attains the naaqs,the state may request such obligations be shifted to contingency measures,consistent with sections l and of the caa however,the state can not remove the obligations from the sip.
b.the northern kentucky situation 
the northern kentucky area is presently designated as nonattainment for the naaqs and is a maintenance area for the naaqs as of the time of promulgation of the naaqs.prior to the revisions presently at issue,kentucky sip contained a basic program for the northern kentucky area,april.this was a basic program that resulted in emissions reductions nitrogen oxides nox,volatile organic compounds vocs and carbon monoxide co id.the program was originally required under the caa amendments because the northern kentucky area had been designated as a moderate nonattainment area for the ozone standard.see a b.however,effective august,the area was redesignated to attainment for the naaqs.see.july.
kentucky has an approved maintenance plan under for the northern kentucky area,and the area is thus referred to as a maintenance area for the ozone standard.the vehicle program was continued by the state of kentucky as part of the maintenance plan for the air quality region.see id.
kentucky submitted its proposal for the sip revisions at issue here on november,and on april,the epa proposed a rule approving the sip revisions.april.the proposed revision sought,among other things,to move the northern kentucky area program from the active or regulatory portion of the sip to the contingency measures portion of the kentucky sip.id.the agency received public comments on the proposed rule and published the final rule approving the sip revisions on october,to be effective november.october.
the epa also approved revisions to kentucky rule.admin.regs,new solvent metal cleaning equipment,and a new rule.admin.regs,commercial motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing operations.id.the revisions respecting new solvent metal cleaning equipment require the use of solvents with lower vapor pressures in batch cold cleaning machines in specific facilities in the northern kentucky area.id.those revisions also include additional operating requirements to minimize voc emissions,october.the new rule regarding commercial motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing operations requires the use of high efficiency transfer application techniques at autobody repair and refinishing operations to minimize the emissions of vocs.the new rule also provides for training in such techniques and procedures,october.
petitioner kentucky resources council krc attacks the epa approval of the kentucky sip revision on three grounds.first,petitioner argues that the approval of the sip revision violated a.petitioner also maintains that the approval of the sip revision violated the language of section l of the clean air act.finally,petitioner contends that even assuming the substitution of other control measures is permitted under section l,that the proposed substitute measures in this case do not achieve equivalent emissions reductions to offset the loss of the program.
standard of review 
this petition for review is brought under b.the appropriate standard of review is set out in d a,and provides that the court may reverse any action of the epa administrator that it finds to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.the standard is deferential and prohibits a court from substituting its judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.nevertheless,the court must still assess whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.id.internal citations omitted.
regarding an agency interpretation of its own regulations,the supreme court stated that provided an agency interpretation of its own regulations does not violate the constitution or a federal statute,it must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.stinson united states,d citations omitted.

applicability of c,a 
the epa relies on c in support of its rule approving kentucky request to move the program into the contingency measures portion of the sip.see,october.the regulation provides 
c redesignation requests.any nonattainment area that epa determines would otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment shall receive full approval of a state implementation plan sip submittal under sections a b or b if the submittal contains the following elements 
legal authority to implement a basic program or enhanced if the state chooses to opt up as required by this subpart.the legislative authority for an program shall allow the adoption of implementing regulations without requiring further legislation.
a request to place the plan if no program is currently in place or if an program has been terminated,or the upgrade if the existing program is to continue without being upgraded into the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.
a contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the governor or the governor designee to adopt or consider adopting regulations to implement an program to correct a violation of the ozone or co standard or other air quality problem,in accordance with the provisions of the maintenance plan.
a contingency commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adoption and implementation of the program,and appropriate milestones.the schedule shall include the date for submission of a sip meeting all of the requirements of this subpart.schedule milestones shall be listed in months from the date epa notifies the state that it is in violation of the ozone or co standard or any earlier date specified in the state plan.unless the state,in accordance with the provisions of the maintenance plan,chooses not to implement,it must submit a sip revision containing an program no more than months after notification by epa.
the epa reads this provision with some flexibility.in that the northern kentucky was an area that otherwise qualified for redesignation,the epa found the regulation did apply.
governs the transition of areas from the naaqs to the naaqs.subpart a of that section is titled what requirements that applied in an area for the naaqs continue to apply after revocation of the naaqs for that area and sets out the specific requirements for each area depending on its and designations.section a speaks to areas that,like northern kentucky,have been designated nonattainment for the naaqs and were in maintenance for naaqs.the provision reads 
naaqs nonattainment naaqs maintenance.an area designated nonattainment for the naaqs that is a maintenance area for the naaqs at the time of designation for the naaqs for the area remains subject to the obligation to implement the applicable requirements as defined in f to the extend such obligations are required by the approved sip,except as provided in paragraph b of this section.applicable measures in the sip must continue to be implemented however,if these measures were shifted to contingency measures prior to designation for the naaqs for the area,they may remain as contingency measures,unless the measures are required to be implemented by the caa by virtue of the area requirements under the naaqs.the state may not remove such measures from the sip.
petitioner krc argues that the northern kentucky program falls under applicable requirements as used in the above quoted regulation and as defined by f and therefore the area remains subject to the obligation to implement them.section f provides that a pplicable requirements means for an area the following requirements to the extent such requirements apply or applied to the area for the area classification under section a of the caa for the naaqs at designation for the naaqs and then lists thirteen specific air quality control measures,including,inspection and maintenance programs.f.as programs are explicitly included in the regulatory definition of applicable requirements,it is clear that the northern kentucky program is an applicable requirement.
thus,at first blush,it would appear that section a does require that the northern kentucky program remain in place as it was at the time of designation of nonattainment under the naaqs.however,the epa maintains that such is not the case because the definition of applicable requirements includes the phrase to the extent such requirements apply or applied under the relevant designation at the time of the area designation under the naaqs.see cfr f.
by use of the phrase to the extent such requirements apply or applied the epa contends that some regulatory flexibility remains in place after the application of the regulations,in that the requirements only apply to the extent they did before.in other words,the applicable requirements may be modified to the extent they could have been modified under the standard,and an area can meet the applicable requirements obligation imposed by section a by satisfying the requirements of section c.thus,in the case of northern kentucky program,epa urges that the area met the conditions for moving the program into the contingency measures portion of the sip under section c,and that is sufficient to fulfill the obligations imposed by section a to implement the applicable requirements because of the to the extent language.
we note that the epa reading of section a is not necessarily the most natural in light of the provisions of section as a whole.for instance,immediately following the applicable requirements language is the following statement 
except as provided in paragraph b of this section.applicable measures in the sip must continue to be implemented however,if these measures were shifted to contingency measures prior to designation for the naaqs for the area,they may remain as contingency measures,unless the measures are required to be implemented by the caa by virtue of the area requirements under the naaqs 
a emphasis added.
the regulation explicitly names two exceptions to the continuing obligation to implement the applicable requirements.first is the situation where an area had shifted the program to the contingency portion prior to designation as nonattainment for the naaqs.the second is paragraph b,which provides 
b does attainment of the ozone naaqs affect the obligations under paragraph a of this section a state remains subject to the obligations under paragraphs a i and a of this section until the area attains the naaqs.after the area attains the naaqs,the state may request such obligations be shifted to contingency measures 
b emphasis added.
the language introducing these two exceptions suggests exclusivity.h owever,if,and except as provided in paragraph b,seem to indicate that any other exceptions were left out of the regulation deliberately.
however,the standard of review does not require or allow the court to impose its own preferred reading of the text.in reviewing an agency reading of its own regulations,the court is particularly deferential.in united states larionoff,d,the court observed that the reviewing court job is not to tarry over the various ambiguous terms and complex interrelations of the regulations.in construing administrative regulations,the ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation,which becomes of controlling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.at.
no language in explicitly precludes application of section c to the applicable requirements language.while the expression of such specific examples of exceptions to section a requirements as discussed above may give rise to an expressio unius type argument,that maxim is not a rule of substantive law.thus,while the epa urges a somewhat strained reading of a,it can not be said to be plainly inconsistent with the wording of the regulations,as the standard of review requires.because the epa interpretation does not clearly subvert the language of section a,it warrants deference.accordingly,the final rule approval of the movement of the program to the contingency portion of the kentucky sip,as buttressed by the epa interpretation of is own regulations,does not violate the regulations under.
clean air act l 
caa section l provides 
each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under this chapter shall be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing.the administrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with an applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress as defined in section of this title or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.
the question of whether the approved sip revisions violate the statute depends in part upon the meaning of the phrase would interfere.as stated above,we analyze this question under the chevron framework.
at the threshold,we observe that petitioner krc suggests in its brief that to comply with the statute,the state should have demonstrated that removal of the provision will not interfere with attaining the standard.this is simply not correct.the statute prohibits approval of a revision that would interfere with an applicable requirement.petitioner reading of the phrase would substitute could for would.on this point it seems fairly clear that congress did not intend that the epa reject each and every sip revision that presents some remote possibility for interference.thus,where the epa does not find that a sip revision would interfere with attainment,approval of the revision does no violence to the statute.
a more difficult question is what the statute contemplates in terms of the meaning of interfere.petitioner urges that the epa can not know what would interfere with attainment of the naaqs at this point since an attainment demonstration for the naaqs is not due until june.as discussed above,the attainment demonstration serves to spell out what control measures are necessary to achieve attainment of a particular air quality standard by the applicable attainment date.see petitioner krc reasons that the attainment demonstration for the naaqs must come first before the sip can be legally revised because the attainment demonstration is the only way of knowing what additional controls will be required to attain the new naaqs.only then,petitioner argument goes,can the agency know what the effect of the sip revisions will be on attainment of naaqs.petitioner would have the court find this is the clear meaning of the statute under chevron step one.again,however,this reading of the statute places the agency in a more active role than the actual language demands.
indeed,the statute does not directly speak to how a determination of interfere nce is to be made,particularly when an area is in the process of transitioning to a new air quality standard.there is no mention in the statute of an attainment demonstration or any other specific methodology.it is also unclear from the face of the statute whether interfere is meant to include that which does not advance,as suggested by krc,or whether it simply means to hinder or make worse,as urged by the epa.a court searching for the meaning of interfere or for a clearly preferred mechanism for determining that which interferes wades into ambiguity,the only solution to which is the deferential chevron step two.
the critical question for this court becomes whether the epa interpretation that the caa l allows the agency to approve a sip revision unless the agency finds it will make the air quality worse is a permissible reading of the statute.this reading of the statute is reasonable and thus entitled to deference.
the epa employed the same interpretation of caa l in its may rulemaking approving certain revisions to the kentucky sip with regard to the jefferson county,kentucky,area and the jefferson county program.see,may.there the agency explained 
prior to the time when the control strategy sip revisions are due,to demonstrate no interference with any applicable naaqs or requirement of the clean air act under section l,epa has interpreted this section such that states can substitute equivalent or greater emissions reductions to compensate for the control measure being moved from the regulatory portion to the contingency provisions.as long as actual emissions in the air are not increased,epa believes that equivalent or greater emissions reductions will be acceptable to demonstrate.epa does not believe that areas must wait to produce a complete attainment demonstration to make any revisions to the sip,provided the status quo air quality is preserved.
under this lo
