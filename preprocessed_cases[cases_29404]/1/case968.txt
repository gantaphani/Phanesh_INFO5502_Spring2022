background 
woodcrest is a limited liability corporation engaged in the business of operating a rehabilitation and nursing facility.on january,the union filed a petition for an election to determine whether certain employees of woodcrest would unionize.the election was held on march,and the employees voted to unionize.woodcrest filed objections to the election,and the union filed a charge against woodcrest alleging that woodcrest committed various unfair labor practices in violation of a and a.the nlrb issued a first amended complaint against woodcrest,and the case was tried before an administrative law judge alj in newark,new jersey.
the alj found that woodcrest committed unfair labor practices by withholding benefits from employees and by engaging in three coercive interrogations of employees,but that woodcrest did not create an unlawful impression of surveillance in another exchange with an employee.woodcrest,the nlrb,and the union each filed exceptions to the alj decision.on appeal,the board affirmed the alj decision with respect to the benefit withholding and interrogation claims,but it reversed with respect to the surveillance claim.thus,the union emerged successful on all of the charges.woodcrest appeals,and the nlrb for enforcement of the order.
ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over woodcrest petition for review pursuant to f of the nlra and over the nlrb for enforcement pursuant to e.see e f 
iii.standard of review 
we afford considerable deference to the board.grane health care nlrb,cir.the supreme court has emphasized often that the nlrb has the primary responsibility for developing and applying national labor policy.nlrb curtin matheson scientific,d.courts will uphold the board interpretation of the nlra as long as it is rational and consistent with the act.id.at.thus,in addressing the benefit withholding issue,we ask whether the board rules are rational and consistent with the nrla.
the supreme court has also explained that,if the board application of such a rational rule is supported by substantial evidence on the record,courts should enforce the board order.fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,d see also e.substantial evidence has been defined by the supreme court as simply such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.hedstrom nlrb,cir en banc quoting consolo fed.maritime comm n,d.we will not displace the board choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.universal camera nlrb.in sum,our standard of review is highly deferential.united food commercial workers union local nlrb.thus,our question regarding the claims of coercive interrogation and unlawful impression of surveillance is whether,under this highly deferential standard,substantial evidence supports the board conclusions.
iv.discussion 
benefit withholding 
woodcrest was found to have violated a and a of the nlra by withholding benefits from employees eligible to vote in the union election.section a establishes that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section of this title.a.section a establishes that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.id.a.
background 
the parties stipulated before the alj as to the evidence relevant to the benefit withholding issue.healthbridge management,llc healthbridge manages woodcrest,along with three other health care centers.the four health care centers provide a common health insurance plan for their employees.effective january,that plan underwent changes resulting in reduced benefits and increased costs for employees.healthbridge received numerous complaints about these changes and decided to adopt certain improvements to the health insurance plan,as well as to reduce employee premiums.
four days before the union election,on march,woodcrest administrator directed the distribution of a memorandum to all woodcrest employees,except those eligible to vote in the march election.the memorandum announced that improvements would be made to the health insurance plan for employees not eligible to vote in the upcoming election and that the changes would be retroactive to january.
employees discovered that their coworkers were receiving these improvements,and they inquired,shortly after the election,as to their eligibility for these benefits.woodcrest told the employees that we can not negotiate your contract,your benefits,your insurance because right now you are in the critical period with the union and we can not discuss this matter at this time.
the alj found that t he evidence establishes woodcrest took the action it did,toward certain employees,because they were not involved in a representation campaign and failed to take action toward other of its employees specifically because they were involved in such a campaign.because woodcrest would have granted the improvements to the employees but for the election,the alj found that woodcrest conduct violated a and a of the nlra.however,the alj did not make any finding as to woodcrest motivation or its justification for its actions.
the alj explained that,a s a general rule,an employer,in deciding whether to grant benefits while a representation election is pending,should decide that question as it would if a union was not in the picture.id.he noted that the board jurisprudence had created a safe harbor in these situations whereby an employer may postpone such a wage or benefit adjustment so long as it makes clear to employees that the adjustment would occur whether or not they select a union,and that the sole purpose of the adjustment postponement is to avoid the appearance of influencing the election outcome.id.first alteration in original quoting retlaw broad,internal quotation marks omitted.woodcrest did not follow the course set forth in the safe harbor,which,the alj reasoned,left its unit employees with a clear impression they were deprived of these system wide benefits because of their section rights.id.in effect,the safe harbor was treated as a sword woodcrest violated the nlra because it did not comply with the safe harbor.
the board,on appeal,affirm ed the alj findings,for the reasons set forth in his decision,that woodcrest violated section a and of the act by announcing and implementing a reduction in healthcare premiums and copays for all employees except those who were eligible to vote in the representation election.the board provided no discussion of its own regarding the relevant law 
section a makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.id.a emphasis added.thus,to find a a violation,consideration must be given to the employer motive.the supreme court has held,time and again,that a violation of a normally turns on an employer antiunion purpose or motive.that congress intended the employer purpose in discriminating to be controlling is clear.radio officers union of commercial telegraphers union,nlrb.emphasis added see also am.ship.nlrb,d it has long been established that a finding of violation under this section will normally turn on the employer motivation.nlrb brown,d we have determined that the real motive of the employer in an alleged a violation is decisive quoting associated press nlrb.congress intent is clear both in the plain text of the statute and in the legislative history.see,nlrb great dane trailers,d the statutory language discrimination to discourage means that the finding of a violation normally turns on whether the discriminatory conduct was motivated by an antiunion purpose.alterations in original quoting a radio officers union,at describing the nlra legislative history 
however,under certain circumstances,actual proof of an improper antiunion motive has been held to be unnecessary.specifically,two categories of a violations do not require proof of motive.nlrb hudson transit lines,cir emphasis added.first,if an employer conduct is inherently destructive of important employee rights,no proof of motivation is needed and the board can find an unfair labor practice even if the employer introduces evidence that his conduct was motivated by business considerations.id.at.second,if the employer conduct could have adversely affected employee rights to some extent,the employer must establish that he was motivated by legitimate objectives,and,if he does not,the conduct constitutes an unfair labor practice without reference to intent.id.at quoting nlrb fleetwood trailer,d.if the employer does proffer a substantial and legitimate business justification for the different treatment,however,it can be overcome by proof of antiunion motive,notwithstanding an otherwise legitimate justification.
in great dane,the supreme court provided a thorough explanation of how the board should analyze an alleged violation of a.at.as a threshold matter,it must make a finding as to whether the employer engaged in one of two kinds of discriminatory conduct which could have adversely affected employee rights to some extent.id.at.that is,first,if the board finds the employer conduct to be inherently destructive of important employee rights,then the board may presume an unlawful motive.id.the employer then would have the opportunity to demonstrate counter explanations for its conduct,although the board may nevertheless draw an inference of improper motive from the conduct itself and find an unfair labor practice,if doing so would strike the proper balance between the asserted business justifications and the invasion of employee rights in light of the act and its policy.id.at.second,if the board finds instead that the employer conduct fell short of the inherently destructive category,the adverse effect of the discriminatory conduct on employee rights is comparatively slight then the burden shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of legitimate and substantial business justifications for the conduct.id.at.if it does not do so,it will be found to have violated a.id.however,if the employer meets this burden,then the burden shifts back to the charging party or the nlrb to present specific evidence of the employer intent to discourage union membership.see also brown,at describing when specific evidence of intent to discourage union membership is necessary to establish a violation of a.
we are at a loss as to why the board operative test tailored to the safe harbor failed to address any of these issues.the board failure to make a finding as to the nature of the effect on employee rights or the reason for,or purpose of,woodcrest different treatment of the employees can not be reconciled with what the supreme court has instructed the alj and the board to do.instead,the board treated the a and a inquiry as a but for test,asking only whether the employees would have received benefits but for the union presence rather than considering the nature of the discrimination or the employer purpose.see,mccormick longmeadow stone,i n withholding the wage increase because of the union failure to waive its right to file a charge,the company deprived them of benefits they would have enjoyed but for their resort to.this violates section a and hence violates section a.see also noah bay area bagels,llc,honolulu sporting goods.this test is inconsistent with what the board was required to do,and the record was not developed regarding the issues that should have been determinative 
given that we are specifically disapproving of the reasoning that the board has repeatedly relied on in finding benefit discrimination to violate a and a,we will remand for the board to consider these issues in the first instance.see united dairy farmers coop.ass nlrb,cir.remand is appropriate because we are requiring the board to modify its longstanding mode of analysis in order to comply with the supreme court equally longstanding precedent to the contrary.see united states kikumura,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states fisher,cir.
b.the interrogations 
section a of the nlra also prohibits an employer from coercively interrogating its employees that is,interrogating them in such a way as to suggest to the employees that the employer may take action against them because of their sympathies.frito lay,nlrb,cir see also graham architectural prods.nlrb,cir an employer questioning becomes coercive and runs afoul of section a when it suggests to the employees that the employer may take action against them because of their sympathies.quoting frito lay,at.although the questioning must reasonably have tended to coerce under the circumstances,it need not have actually had any coercive effect.graham architectural,at.whether an employer actions meet that test is a question of fact for the board and its determinations are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.nlrb armcor,cir.as noted above,substantial evidence is a highly deferential standard of review.united food commercial workers union,at.
here,three interrogations form the basis of the coercive interrogation charge.the participants in these three interrogations were certified nursing assistant jeffrey jimenez and company attorney james monica certified nursing assistant judith dolcine and assistant director of nursing ansel vijayan and licensed practical nurse donna duggar and supervisor janet lewis.the alj found that each of these interrogations was coercive.he explained that t he applicable test for determining whether questioning an employee constitutes unlawful interrogation is the test.he used the bourne factors to assess the totality of the circumstances.id.citing bourne nlrb,cir.these factors,which we discuss below,include an examination or consideration of the background of the interrogation the nature of the information sought the identity of the questioner the place and method of the interrogation and,the truthfulness of any reply.id.applying these factors,the alj concluded that woodcrest had engaged in coercive interrogations and ordered it to cease and desist from i nterrogating its employees about their union membership,activities,and sympathies and to post a notice that woodcrest will not coercively interrogate you regarding your union membership,activities,and sympathies.
on appeal,the board agree d with the alj,for the reasons he states,that woodcrest violated section a of the act by coercively interrogating employees both during the union campaign to organize employees at woodcrest rehabilitation and nursing facility and after the union certification as the employees bargaining representative.
the facts of the three interrogations are set forth below.
jimenez monica 
jimenez was a vocal and visible supporter of the union.approximately two weeks after the election,jimenez supervisor approached him while he was caring for patients.the supervisor told him that the director of nursing wanted to see him in her office.he obliged and went to her office,but only monica was there.monica said he was an attorney for woodcrest investigating whether any supervisors engaged in objectionable conduct in favor of the union.he handed jimenez a form document,which jimenez signed.the form document included the following language t he only purpose i have in interviewing you is to investigate whether any objectionable conduct occurred in connection with the election held here at woodcrest on march,and the events leading to that election during the previous weeks and months w e are not interested in determining whether you are for or against the union or if,or how,you voted in the election and w e positively assure you that you have the right to join or not to join any labor organization without fear of reprisals.monica asked jimenez whether any supervisors had been involved with the union,had passed out cards for the union,or had influenced him in any way to change his vote.he asked if any representative for the union had gone to jimenez house and if jimenez knew any employees who were involved in a union or passing out cards.he also asked jimenez if he had signed a card for the union.jimenez refused to identify the employees who had supported the union.jimenez left the room but then returned,clearly upset,tore up the signed form document,and threw it in the garbage.
approximately five days later,jimenez supervisor approached him,again while he was caring for patients,and informed him that monica wished to see him in a conference room.when jimenez arrived,monica told jimenez that he did not believe his answers during their first meeting and wanted to give him a second chance to be truthful.monica repeated many of the same questions,but also asked why jimenez wanted to form a union.jimenez answered monica questions,and the interrogation ended without further incident.
dolcine vijayan 
in the month before the election,vijayan approached dolcine while she was on duty at her workstation and asked to speak with her privately.vijayan was a manager.years prior,vijayan had hired dolcine.during their meeting,vijayan handed dolcine a do vote union flyer and asked her if anyone from the union had visited or telephoned her at her home.she answered no but said she supported the union.vijayan asked her why she needed the union,and she responded that she needed someone to back her up if something happened or she was fired.vijayan told her that was not going to happen.
duggar lewis 
sometime before the election,lewis,who was not a manager,attended a management meeting in which woodcrest management discussed whether certain employees supported the union.an attorney at the meeting mentioned that duggar supported the union.lewis,who was friends with duggar,was surprised and so decided to ask duggar if the attorney statement were true.when asked,duggar told lewis that she did not support the union.the conversation was amicable.lewis then reported to management that duggar did not support the union.there is no evidence that lewis told duggar about the management meeting or indicated that she would report duggar response.
given our deferential standard of review as to whether substantial evidence supports the board finding that woodcrest violated a by coercively interrogating its employees,we will affirm that at least one of these interrogations was coercive.specifically,substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that the monica jimenez interrogation was coercive.
section a provides it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section of this title.a.the board considers the bourne factors in determining whether,under the totality of the circumstances,the questioning was coercive.see,rossmore house.the bourne factors are 
the background,is there a history of employer hostility and discrimination 
the nature of the information sought,did the interrogator appear to be seeking information on which to base taking action against individual employees 
the identity of the questioner,how high was he in the company hierarchy 
place and method of interrogation,was employee called from work to the boss office was there an atmosphere of unnatural formality 
truthfulness of the reply.
bourne,at.the bourne factors provide a framework,albeit not a required checklist,to use when assessing a purportedly coercive interrogation.rossmore house,at see also united servs.auto.ass nlrb,requiring the board to address each of the bourne factors would transform a flexible tool for organizing section a analysis into a rigid hurdle divorced from its purpose of ensuring that interrogation is not deemed an unfair labor practice.the factors are useful in assisting the adjudicator to consider the totality of the circumstances,so we hold that the alj and the board use of the bourne factors to assess whether a given interrogation is coercive is rational and consistent with the nlra.
here,notwithstanding that the board found that three interactions constituted unlawful interrogations,it takes just a single coercive interrogation to support the remedy ordered by the board namely,a cease and desist order and the posting of a notice that woodcrest will not coercively interrogate its employees.because the order gives only a single remedy for all three violations,as long as at least one of the three interrogations amounted to coercion,we will enforce this part of the order.
the alj and the board conclusion that at least one of the interrogations violated a is supported by substantial evidence.specifically,we will not disturb the conclusion that the monica jimenez interrogation constituted a coercive interrogation in violation of a.the interrogation was initiated by woodcrest ostensibly to determine whether any supervisors had engaged in improper conduct.jimenez supervisor told him that the director of nursing wanted to see him in her office,but,when jimenez entered the director office,she was not there.instead,monica,a lawyer for woodcrest,was there to conduct an exceedingly formal interview.monica gave jimenez a written statement that he was asked to sign.the written statement assured jimenez that t he only purpose i have in interviewing you is to investigate whether any objectionable conduct occurred in connection with the election held here at woodcrest and the events leading to that election,and that w e are not interested in determining whether you are for or against the union or if,or how,you voted in the election.however,the lawyer asked him whether he had signed a card for the union and whether he knew any other unit employees,employees,not supervisors who were involved in the union or passing out cards.these unwanted questions upset jimenez so much that he returned to the office after leaving the meeting and tore up the document and threw it in the garbage.then,approximately five days later,jimenez supervisor again approached jimenez while he was working and told him to meet with the lawyer in a private conference room.the lawyer told him that he did not believe jimenez s answers during their first exchange and wanted to give him a second chance.he asked jimenez why he wanted woodcrest to unionize and whether certain supervisors had campaigned for the union.
woodcrest argues that the monica jimenez interrogation was found to be coercive solely because monica asked jimenez why he wanted a union at woodcrest.but we disagree.the alj and the board found the interrogation to be coercive based on the totality of the circumstances,properly applying the bourne factors.woodcrest citations are.woodcrest cites hughes hatcher,nlrb for the proposition that i nterrogation of employees concerning their membership in the union,membership of,or the general activity of the union,absent interference or coercion,does not violate the act,cir.however,the circumstances here were not so benign.monica questioning of jimenez regarding topics that monica was purportedly not to inquire about,along with the accusation that jimenez had not told the truth,crossed the line.nlrb prof l tape,cir this was not a mere inquiry to determine union support.the continuous questioning of hawkins and okryesik suggested that the employees were being accused of lying about the union activities and in so doing,the company created an atmosphere of antagonism toward the union.indeed,the alj and the board found that the circumstances of monica questioning,taken as a whole,reasonably tend to interfere with the free exercise of employee rights under the act and were coercive.given the substantial evidence standard,we are not inclined to disturb this conclusion.
moreover,the monica jimenez interrogation has parallels to an interrogation discussed in graham architectural,which we held was unlawful.there,the interrogation of david reisinger by michael lehr was not part of an ordinary casual conversation rather,lehr specifically requested reisinger to come to his office.graham architectural,at.the supervisor also indicated that he had prior knowledge of the employee union activities.id.furthermore,that interrogation involved two mitigating factors that are not present here the individuals friendship and the occurrence of the conversation in an open plant area.id.yet we,nevertheless,enforced the board order.id.at.here,jimenez did not know monica,and the interrogation occurred first in jimenez boss office and then in a private conference room.
the monica jimenez interrogation was also similar to a second interrogation found to be unlawful in graham architectural the interrogation of diana oberdick by her supervisor,robert reichard which also involved not a casual inquiry into a feelings,but a request from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that it was aimed at securing specific information concerning the genesis of the union campaign and the identity of the leaders,making it not unreasonable for the board to conclude that under these circumstances reichard question may have conveyed to oberdick the message that the company was contemplating retaliation against the union activists who were responsible for the organizing campaign.id.at.jimenez could easily have assumed that monica question regarding which unit employees were engaged in union activities indicated that woodcrest was contemplating taking some action against the employees who were responsible for the organizing campaign.accordingly,substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that this interrogation was unlawful 
the coerciveness of the remaining two interrogations is less clear,although,as stated above,woodcrest loses if a single interrogation was coercive.in particular,the conversation between duggar and lewis hardly seems coercive.all we know about the lewis duggar conversation is that sometime after february,but before the representation election,at some unstated place,lewis asked duggar if she was in favor of the union,and duggar replied truthfully that she was not.lewis was not a manager,and she and duggar telephoned each other outside of work and are friends.
this conversation is analogous to a conversation that we found to be lawful in graham architectural the interrogation of darlene stambaugh by greg nash.there,a supervisor called stambaugh over to his desk and asked her whether she was for the union.graham architectural,at.they then had an extended discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the union.id.like here,t he question itself contained no veiled threat or implication that the company contemplated reprisals against union supporters.id.here,the only evidence that the alj found of coercion was that lewis reported duggar response to management,yet there is no indication that lewis gave duggar any reason to suspect that she would do so.thus,that fact can not be relevant to whether the questioning must reasonably have tended to coerce under the circumstances.id.at.the nlrb only case law to the contrary is from another interrogation in graham architectural in which we said that,considering all the other indicia of coercion,a supervisor friendly manner is insufficient to overturn the board finding that substantial evidence supports a finding of coercion.see id.at.but here,there were no other indicia of coercion.
the vijayan dolcine conversation falls between these two extremes.unlike the lewis duggar conversation,the vijayan dolcine conversation involved a manager,who approached a unit employee at her workstation while she was on duty and asked to speak with her privately.vijayan gave dolcine an antiunion flyer and ask ed about her union activities including why she needed a union.given the formality of the conversation,the power dynamic,and the fact that vijayan made it clear to dolcine by giving her the antiunion flyer what vijayan views were and what dolcine answer should be,the board may well have had substantial evidence to support its conclusion that the interrogation was coercive,although we need not find more than one interrogation coercive for the result here.
because at least one interrogation was coercive,we will affirm and enforce this part of the order 
unlawful impression of surveillance 
woodcrest was found to have violated a of the nlra by creating an unlawful impression of surveillance.conduct which gives the impression of surveillance violates section a if the conduct reasonably tends to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their section rights.hanlon wilson nlrb,cir.
background 
here,the surveillance claim relates to two interactions between jimenez and assistant director of recreation vladamir guerrero that occurred after the election.in the first interaction,guerrero told jimenez,i heard your name your name has been popping out a lot.in the second interaction,which occurred approximately a month later,guerrero saw jimenez in the lunch room and said,oh it the famous boy.id.jimenez followed guerrero into the latter office.guerrero said that the director of nursing had distributed a memorandum about a newspaper article containing statements by jimenez and had mentioned his name several times at a management meeting.crucially,guerrero then told jimenez,they pretty pissed about the article,so watch your back,be careful,careful about what you say,you know,do what you have to do,come to work early,and then just,you know,do your job and go home.he said jimenez should tone it down a little bit and keep his views under wraps.
the alj explained that the board test for claims is whether an employee would reasonably assume from the statement s in question that his or her union activities have been placed under surveillance.the alj rejected the claim of unlawful impression of surveillance because jimenez was a very visible and vocal supporter of the union and guerrero statements do not establish that woodcrest was observing or monitoring him or his activities more closely.id.
on appeal,the board reversed under a totality of the circumstances test.the board faulted the alj for not address ing jimenez uncontradicted testimony that guerrero warned him to watch his back,be careful,careful about what you say do what you have to do,come to work early,and then just do your job and go home,or guerrero testimony that he advised jimenez to tone it down a little bit,and to keep his views about the union under wraps.alterations in original.these comments would reasonably be understood by jimenez as a warning that woodcrest was moving from routine observation to closely monitoring the degree and extent of his union activity,open or not,and if he continued to engage in such activity,he could face reprisals.id.
the board remedy for this violation was for woodcrest to cease and desist from creating the impression that employees union and other protected concerted activities were under surveillance.the board also amended the required notice to employees so that it reads woodcrest will not create the impression that your union and other protected concerted activities are under surveillance.id.
section a prohibits employers from giving the impression of surveillance if doing so reasonably tends to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their section rights.hanlon wilson,at.there need not be actual interference or coercion to have a section a violation.id.the significant fact is whether the supervisor
