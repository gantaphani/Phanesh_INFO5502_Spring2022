at issue is an order of the surface transportation board stb finding that one railroad acted reasonably in light of rail safety concerns when it imposed restrictions upon another railroad operating on its lines.
the petitioners in this case are the railroad subjected to restrictions,the railroad company mbrr,and its only customer,the granite state concrete company granite state.the respondent is the stb.the intervenors are the other railroad which imposed those restrictions,the boston and maine corporation,and springfield terminal railway company,two subsidiaries of guilford transportation industries collectively referred to as guilford.
mbrr petitions for review of the stb final order,which rejected mbrr claims that guilford unreasonably interfered with mbrr ability to service granite state in violation of,and that guilford failed to meet its own service obligation to mbrr,in violation of.the stb found that restrictions were indeed imposed by guilford but were not unreasonable given safety concerns and the information available to guilford,and that guilford did not fail to meet its service obligations.granite state concrete,stb docket,wl served september,granite state ii.
to prevail,mbrr must convince us that the stb findings and conclusions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we summarize mbrr arguments and our responses.mbrr argues that there were no plausible safety issues untrue on the face of the record that the stb was required to ask another agency to determine if there were any safety issues not so that the stb failed to follow its own precedents none were binding or even applicable that the stb exuberant language in its order establishes that the stb abandoned its usual reasonableness standard of review for a new ad hoc not necessarily so egregious standard of review while the stb should be more precise,it did not apply the wrong standard of review that the stb ignored relevant facts we are unconvinced and that the stb,having found petitioners had been harmed,was required as a matter of law to award damages there is no such requirement.the stb order was far from arbitrary or capricious it was a sensible resolution of the case before it.
we recount the facts as found by the stb and shown by the record.
guilford owns the first miles of a rail line running northwest from nashua to bennington,new hampshire.the other section of the to owned by the state of new hampshire and leased by petitioner mbrr.
petitioner granite state operates a stone quarry north of wilton,new hampshire,and a stone processing center located several miles to the south,in milford,new hampshire.both communities lie along the rail line.mbrr transports granite state crushed stone from the wilton quarry to the milford processing center indeed,mbrr only shipping customer is granite state.the first part of the shipping route lies on mbrr section of the line.the last three miles of the route,approximately,is on guilford portion of the track.in order to serve granite state,mbrr has trackage rights which permit it to use guilford line to finish the journey to milford.
the problem here started with mbrr decision in to contract with a scenic railroad,wilton scenic railroad wilton scenic,to run passenger trains over its own tracks adjacent to the guilford line.those operations began on may.even before these operations started,guilford and mbrr were at odds about them.as the stb found 
wilton scenic uses passenger cars that are stored on mbrr track near the point where the mbrr line and the guilford line connect.at that point,there is a steep downhill grade that continues over the length of the guilford track.the existence of this grade,along with the presence of wilton scenic passenger equipment,apparently raised safety concerns for guilford.after guilford and mbrr failed to reach a meeting of the minds about how to deal with those concerns,guilford installed a derailment device,first on the mbrr side of the point where the lines connect and subsequently,after mbrr allegedly refused to activate the first derailment device,on the guilford side of the point of connection.the derailment device has the effect of requiring mbrr to stop its trains before they move onto guilford line.
granite state ii,wl,at 
both sides had problems.guilford,having examined the site more closely,had concerns that the wilton scenic cars or freight cars could break free and roll down the to downhill grade on the track leading into the junction onto its tracks and cause injury and damage.after all,mbrr did not continuously monitor the site and there had been an earlier incident of a trespasser on mbrr tracks causing an accident with a small rail inspection car which had resulted in serious injury.
mbrr also had a problem because the derailment device required its train to stop,and the engineer to get out to trip and reset the device each time the train passed over it.this in turn slowed down the schedule and this was an important issue because granite state had been given only limited hours to operate by the town of wilton further,wilton scenic thought the continued use of the derailment device would be infeasible once it expanded its operations from the weekends to weekdays,as it planned to do.it appears that mbrr engaged in some mbrr left the device open when its freight trains were running and sometimes even removed this derail device without notifying guilford.guilford first discovered that the derail device was not being used properly on june,when guilford conducted an inspection of the intersection in response to wilton scenic request for all three carriers to meet and come up with a plan to resolve safety concerns.
given mbrr refusal to keep or use the derail device on the mbrr side of the intersection and its refusal to tell guilford,guilford decided that to ensure safe operation,it needed to completely separate the operations of mbrr and guilford over the guilford line.it implemented a number of measures to accomplish this goal.only limited time window for mbrr use of guilford the focus of the petitioners arguments to this court.
starting on june,mbrr was given the window from to each day to operate its trains guilford explains that the nighttime window for mbrr was designed to make sure mbrr and guilford trains and maintenance crews were never on guilford tracks at the same time and to allow guilford,the owner of the track,to inspect and maintain the tracks during the day.
this operating window,combined with the hours limitation on the granite state quarry,reduced mbrr service to only one trip a day.mbrr believed that it could not operate its trains at the granite state quarry outside the quarry normal operating hours.guilford was not initially aware of the permitting restrictions on granite state and,in any case,did not understand that mbrr could not operate outside granite state operating hours.
on june,mbrr and granite state requested informal assistance from the stb office of compliance and enforcement in resolving this dispute.mbrr explained that the operating window was preventing it from effectively serving granite state though service never ceased.guilford disputed this claim and offered to temporarily serve granite state itself,pending resolution of the dispute,based on the stb determination of reasonable terms and conditions for service.granite state and mbrr refused guilford offer 
once mbrr made clear why the to operating window caused it difficulty in serving granite state,guilford,on july,offered to change the operating window to between and guilford explained that this new window should allow mbrr to make more round trips between the two granite state facilities each day,give guilford enough time to serve its customers,and still keep the operations of the two railroads separate to address its safety concerns.on july,guilford informed mbrr that the new operating window from to would go into effect starting july.mbrr concedes that the new window allowed mbrr to complete two round trips on most days.
still dissatisfied with the new window,mbrr and granite state filed a formal complaint with the stb on july,claiming that guilford actions poor maintenance,installation of the derail device,instituting the operating window caused mbrr and granite state to only be able to move a fraction of the gravel that would be moved normally,and threatened to effectively shut down both mbrr and granite state.mbrr and granite state asked for an emergency service order under and directing guilford to permit mbrr to serve granite state between am and pm.mbrr and granite state also argued that the time restrictions constituted an unreasonable rule or practice under a breach of the duty to provide service under and asked the stb to enjoin guilford from imposing such unreasonable time restrictions in the future.finally,mbrr and granite state sought damages.
the stb denied the request for an emergency service order on september,noting that substantial traffic continue d to move.granite state concrete,stb docket,wl,at,served september,granite state i.but it also denied guilford motion to dismiss the complaint and scheduled further proceedings to consider whether guilford has acted to interfere unreasonably with mbrr ability to meet its common carrier obligations.id.at.
after that,guilford took further ameliorative actions.while the new operating window was in effect,guilford performed repairs on the tracks after mbrr was done with the line for the day,and by october,had successfully rehabilitated the track to increase the speed limit from five to ten miles per hour.guilford then discontinued the operating window on november,and replaced it with an absolute block system so that only one train or maintenance crew at a time would be allowed within the relevant portion of the line.this,in effect,continued to keep the two railroads operations completely apart.
despite the improvements,mbrr and granite state continued to pursue the complaint before the stb,arguing,inter alia,that guilford absolute block system was unreasonable and unnecessary.granite state ii,wl,at.
on september,the stb rendered its final decision in this case.the stb denied mbrr and granite state complaint in its entirety.in doing so,the stb framed the question before it as whether actions taken by guilford were unreasonable.id.at.it answered that question in the negative,finding that the complainants have not shown that the measures taken by guilford to address its concerns were necessarily unreasonable.id.it also concluded that it could not find,based on the facts in the record,that guilford unreasonably interfered with mbrr ability to carry out its common carrier obligation to serve granite state.id.at.the stb elaborated that while some of guilford actions made it more difficult for mbrr to provide service,its actions did not preclude rail service.in short,mbrr and granite state have not shown that guilford actions were so egregious as to warrant a finding that they violated the statute.id.
the stb also determined that it should continue to keep tabs on the situation.w hile guilford conduct toward complainants has not risen to the level of violating our statute,the record of this conduct shows that granite state does merit immediate access to the board processes to protect the shipper from the risk of market power abuse.in particular,complainants should be able to seek prompt relief if guilford were to impose unworkable restrictions.id.at.accordingly,the stb refused to exempt the traffic handled by mbrr for granite state from its regulations id.
the petitioners then timely petitioned this court for review of the stb decision.
under the administrative procedure act,a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.the stb decision is not arbitrary or capricious if a rational basis for the decision exists in the facts on the record.see berkshire scenic ry.museum,icc,cir.we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment but t he court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.bowman,freight,d quoting citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d.
stb use of the improper standard 
the petitioners argue that the stb applied the wrong legal standard in determining that guilford decision to impose an operating window for mbrr trains was reasonable under and.if that were true,we would remand the matter to the agency and not reach the other issues,unless the error was clearly harmless.
the proof of this erroneous legal standard,the petitioners say,is in the language of the stb order itself,which said at various times that the petitioners failed to show that guilford actions were necessarily unreasonable or so egregious as to constitute a violation of the statute.granite state ii,wl,at.
the correct standard,as counsel for the stb argues,is whether a particular service is adequate or a particular practice is reasonable.guilford had a common carrier obligation under a to provide the transportation or service on reasonable request,and an obligation under,as to mbrr trackage rights,to establish reasonable rules and practices in matters related to that transportation or service.the two statutory provisions at issue here do not provide precise definitions for the operative standards section does not define what would constitute adequate service on reasonable request,and section does not define what would be reasonable rules and practices.the stb has been given broad discretion to conduct inquiries to give meaning to these terms,which are not,in the wide variety of factual circumstances encountered.see,decatur county comm rs surface transp,cir inquiry in determining reasonableness of embargo under section gs roofing prods.surface transp,cir same.
on the facts alleged,the questions the stb had to address under and were whether guilford had imposed restrictions on mbrr ability to service its customer whether,under section,the restrictions were unreasonable in light of the factual circumstances and whether,under section,the restrictions amounted to a violation of guilford service obligations.as we discuss in the next section,when we review the stb analysis,we are convinced that despite its rhetorical excess,the stb applied the correct standard.it did say that the key question before it was whether actions taken by guilford were unreasonable.granite state ii,wl,at.the stb determined that there were restrictions,but concluded that they represented a reasonable accommodation between guilford safety concerns and the petitioners service needs.id.at.the stb examined the relevant factors and grounded its decision in the record.but we urge the stb to be more careful in its choice of language in the future.
another argument as to incorrect standards may be quickly dispatched.the petitioners complain that the stb decision fails to cite,much less differentiate,between the two statutory sections at issue.but,since the claim alleging guilford had failed to meet its service obligations required a showing that guilford had unreasonably restricted petitioners access,there was no need for separate analysis.in fact,though,the stb did deal separately with guilford common carrier obligation in accommodating mbrr requests for service and found no violation.see id.and we know of no rule that an agency opinion must specifically cite the statutes at issue.
the petitioners also argue that the stb used the wrong standard because it failed to apply a balancing test,articulated in illinois central gulf,wl for evaluating adequacy of service.the test reads as follows 
in determining whether a railroad has violated its duty under to provide adequate service,we will apply a balancing test similar to the test applied in abandonment proceedings we will weigh the public need for service over the line at the level sought in the complaint and compare that need with the burden on the carrier and on interstate commerce of providing service at that level.in applying this test we will consider such factors as the traffic and revenue potentials of the line,the availability of alternative transportation,the condition and type of t
