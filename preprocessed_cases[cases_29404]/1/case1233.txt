opinion of the court 
on december,the international union of united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers of america uaw petitioned the occupational safety and health administration osha to take immediate action to protect workers from the health effects of occupational exposure to machining fluids.uaw urged osha to promulgate a rule that would establish a standard for occupational exposure to machining,or metalworking,fluids mwfs.osha did not formally respond to uaw petition for rulemaking until more than a decade later when,by letter dated december,john henshaw,assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health,denied uaw petition.
the december response was submitted together with a brief to this court,for on october,understandably impatient with the delay,uaw,now joined by the united steelworkers of america,petitioned this court,pursuant to section f of the occupational safety health act of,f osh act,to review what they described as the unreasonable delay of respondents osha and the secretary of labor in issuing the requested standard under section b of the osh act.the administrative procedure act apa,together with the osh act,permit a petition to the federal courts of appeals to review federal agency action or inaction.f.we,thus,have jurisdiction over the petition before us which the parties,and the court,agree is appropriately recharacterized as a petition to review final agency action.see in re international chemical workers union,when a petition to compel rulemaking was pending and the agency denied rulemaking,it was appropriate to treat the pending petition as a petition for review of the denial.
for the reasons that follow,we find that the secretary denial of the request for rulemaking proceedings on mwfs was neither arbitrary nor capricious.we,therefore,will deny the petition for review.
background 
metalworking fluids are used in a wide variety of industries as coolants and lubricants for metal machining,grinding,cutting,forming,tooling,and treating in manufacturing operations.approximately million workers including,among others,machinists,mechanics,and metal workers,who are employed at approximately establishments,are exposed to mwfs by means of skin contact or by breathing or otherwise ingesting particles from mists or aerosols.
there is little doubt,and it is not disputed here,that exposure to mwfs can have debilitating health effects.the nature and prevalence of health effects from mwf exposure is,however,hotly disputed.asthma,hypersensitivity pneumonitis hp,other respiratory diseases,and cancer are among the effects or potential effects that uaw claims result from mwf exposure.while there is little debate about the link between mwf exposure and respiratory disorders and dermatitis again,the debate is over the severity and prevalence,the evidence supporting a connection to cancer is equivocal.
initially,osha responded in december,albeit informally,to uaw petition when it designated mwfs as a regulatory priority.in,osha empaneled a metalworking fluids standards advisory committee mwfsac or committee.the committee of members had five labor representatives,five industry representatives,and five public representatives.on july,the committee issued its final report and recommendations.
the committee unanimously recommended that osha take action to limit worker exposure to mwfs.the recommendation was based upon the demonstrated health effects of exposure to mwfs dermatitis,asthma,hp,and other respiratory disorders.the committee members,however,did not agree on the best way to limit worker exposure to mwfs.a majority of the committee recommended that osha promulgate a rule,while a minority thought that guidelines and educational programs would better address the problem.a majority of the committee also concluded that exposure to old formulations of mwfs caused skin cancer and cancer at other sites.only a minority of the committee,however,concluded that there was adequate evidence to link exposure of current formulations of mwfs to skin cancer or cancer at other sites.in sum,the committee unanimously recognized a link between mwf exposure and illnesses,dermatitis,respiratory disorders,hp,and asthma and,based upon this recognition,a majority recommended promulgation of a rule.the committee recommended course of action was not premised on a connection between mwfs and cancer.
beginning in,and seemingly in response to the committee recommendation,osha began to include mwfs in its published regulatory agenda.mwfs were identified as a long term action item,meaning that the issuance of a standard was anticipated in a year time.by,however,no standard had been issued,and osha removed mwfs from its regulatory agenda,publishing,instead,a mwf best practices guide.the guide is and unenforceable.
in october,uaw filed the petition for review now before us,asserting that the secretary of labor and osha had failed,by virtue of an unreasonable delay,to act,as required by b,to assure that no employee suffer material impairment of health.in the henshaw letter of december,which accompanied its brief to this court,osha uaw petition requesting action.in the letter,osha gave two main reasons for deciding not to promulgate a rule for mwfs now or in the foreseeable future.first,osha concluded,and we summarize broadly,that regulating mwfs was not appropriate because the science regarding mwf exposure neither adequately illuminated an effective way to determine an appropriate permissible exposure limit,nor supported the conclusion that mwf exposure causes cancer.second,osha identified three agency priorities to regulate toxic substances that pose more serious health risks than do mwfs,and asserted that agency resources could not accommodate the enormous resource commitment that a rulemaking on mwfs would require.osha found,however,that various measures will enable exposures to mwf hazards to be controlled effectively,and that those measures were in large part already underway.
ii.discussion 
in considering the petition for review,we examine the relevant statutory framework,assess whether osha had a statutory duty to regulate mwfs,and evaluate whether osha refusal to regulate mwfs was arbitrary and capricious.
statutory background 
there are two statutes relevant to our review the occupational safety and health act and the administrative procedure act.
the osh act 
congress enacted the osh act,to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions.b.the act authorizes the secretary of labor to establish,after notice and opportunity to comment,mandatory nationwide standards governing health and safety in the workplace.american textile mfrs.institute,donovan,d citing a,b.when the secretary decides to promulgate a rule dealing with toxic substances or harmful physical agents,the rule must adequately assure,to the extent feasible,on the basis of the best available evidence,that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even after a lifetime of exposure.b.the agency priorities are judicially reviewable.public citizen health research group chao,cir.a reviewing court is instructed,however,that determinations of the secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.f.and while the secretary is accorded a broad measure of discretion in setting the agency agenda,the secretary does not have absolute discretion.in determining the priority for establishing standards the secretary shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries,trades,crafts,occupations,businesses,workplaces or work environments.id.at g.the act also requires that the secretary give due regard to the recommendations of the secretary of health,education,and welfare.id.
finally,under the act,the secretary may appoint an advisory committee to assist in the development of a rule.b.where an advisory committee is appointed and the secretary determines that a rule should be issued,he shall publish the proposed rule within sixty days after the submission of the advisory committee
