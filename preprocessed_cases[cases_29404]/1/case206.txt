plaintiffs redondo waste systems,and big blue collectively redondo appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint alleging various malfeasance by the puerto rico environmental quality board eqb.because redondo complaint states no plausible claim against any identifiable defendant,we affirm.
redondo is a puerto business engaged in the treatment and disposal of regulated biomedical waste sometimes abbreviated rbw.on november,redondo filed the complaint at issue against the members of eqb governing board,specifically javier rua,carlos lópez freytes,angel berrios silvestre,eugene scott amy,and julio rodríguez colón.whatever its legal weaknesses,the complaint tells a somewhat coherent story that we will now sum up 
until,redondo main method of waste disposal was incineration that year,it invested in more environmentally friendly shredding equipment.a year later,redondo began experiencing problems with its shredder.it therefore requested and received defendant julio rodríguez colón approval to use autoclaves which treat waste using water vapor rather than the shredder.this arrangement apparently worked for a few years,but in august eqb inspector and maría de los angeles ortiz recommended that eqb issue an order shutting down redondo operations.on the same date,ortiz threatened to fine the operator of the yauco landfill if it received waste from redondo.in november,eqb ordered redondo to stop collecting waste and to select an alternative facility for destroying the waste it had already accumulated.
for the next month,redondo tried to work with eqb to get up and running again,but eqb remained mute or unhelpful.in late december,redondo sought a injunction requiring eqb to certify a replacement shredder redondo had purchased.redondo complaint alleges that the court required eqb to certify redondo shredder,but the district court docket shows that all redondo requests for injunctive relief were denied.in any event,redondo resumed treating and disposing of waste in january.
in february,redondo second shredder broke.around the same time,an eqb inspector determined that redondo had been sending inadequately treated waste to the yauco landfill again the landfill stopped receiving waste from redondo.redondo sought a waiver from eqb a request that eqb never acted on and a injunction ordering the yauco landfill operator to resume receiving treated waste from redondo which the court denied.in march,eqb inspected redondo facility and determined that its shredder was in working order.eqb accordingly certified the shredder but ordered redondo not to receive any more waste until it had dealt with the four million pounds that had accumulated while its equipment was broken or decertified.eqb rejected several of redondo proposed plans for dealing with this accumulated waste,finally appointing a company called western medical to do the job 
redondo complaint alleges that eqb treated redondo competitor much more favorably than it treated redondo.before,did not properly destroy any regulated biomedical waste but only once received a violation notice from eqb.nor did eqb ever stop any landfill from receiving waste from.apparently because eqb would not act on its own to make conform to puerto rico laws,haydee redondo an owner and corporate officer of redondo filed a complaint with eqb in.but it does not appear anything came of this complaint instead,eqb actually authorized to dispose of inadequately treated waste in the humaco landfill in.redondo makes no allegations about any other aspect of eqb treatment of after,save for the implication that in began properly destroying waste.
redondo complaint asserts four claims unmoored from any predicate factual allegations a request for declaratory judgment acknowledging that eqb administrative adjudication process violates due process because of actual or structural bias an assertion that eqb retaliated against redondo because of its protected speech,in violation of the first amendment and an assertion that eqb deprived redondo of property without notice or hearing,in violation of the fourteenth amendment and and an assertion that eqb arbitrarily treated redondo differently from its competitors,in violation of the fourteenth amendment and.on may,the defendants responded to the complaint with a rule b motion to dismiss.on june,redondo conceded portions of the motion to dismiss opposed others,and suggested that it would amend its complaint but did not actually file a proposed amended complaint.
on march,the district court granted the motion to dismiss,relying primarily on the complaint failure to link any claim to any particular defendant.on april,redondo filed a motion to alter or amend judgment,finally attaching its proposed amended complaint.the defendants objected,and on june,the court denied the motion.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under.
we review de novo the district court order dismissing redondo complaint rios colón toledo davila,f d,cir.we must reinstate the complaint if it has facial plausibility in other words,if redondo has pled factual content that allows us to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant s are liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft.iqbal.for us to draw such an inference,redondo complaint must allege facts linking each defendant to the grounds on which that particular defendant is potentially liable.id.at.if the complaint fails to do so,then we must affirm the dismissal order.id.
the complaint fails the plausibility test spectacularly.not only is no defendant specifically linked to any actionable conduct,but one of the captioned defendants is not even mentioned in the body of the complaint.here is a summary of every mention of each 
javier rua appears in the caption as executive director of eqb and president of its governing board.the complaint never mentions him again.
carlos lópez freytes appears in the caption as former executive director of eqb and president of its governing board.the complaint alleges that he supervised the other defendants in all their unspecified but allegedly illegal acts.apparently when redondo purchased a shredder,the financing bank contacted lópez.additionally,redondo sent lópez a letter requesting that an eqb inspector visit its facility to certify its new shredder lópez did not answer the letter.and finally,after eqb shut down redondo operations in,lópez publically threatened to fine companies that sent redondo regulated biomedical waste anyway.
angel berrios silvestre appears in the caption as an associate member of the governing board of eqb.the complaint mentions him once following the case caption.this mention reads in its entirety berrios is an associate member of the governing board of the eqb and is being sued in his official and personal capacity.as a member of the board,he acted under color of law in enforcing puerto rico and federal environmental laws.according to redondo complaint,he enforced the laws that is all.
eugene scott amy appears in the caption as vice president of the governing board of eqb.the complaint alleges that scott worked for the law firm that represents before he worked for eqb.as a result of this work,he continues to have a strong friendship and ties to the partners and associates of said law firm.the complaint contains no other mention of scott.
julio rodríguez colón appears in the caption as manager of the land program of eqb and alternate member of its governing board.the complaint alleges that rodríguez was supervised by defendant lópez.rodríguez,in turn,supervised maría de los angeles ortiz and maría janice sostre rivera.the complaint contains some conclusory allegations he wrongful ly refus ed to issue a written authorization enabling the plaintiffs to dispose sterilized and destroyed rbw in eqb authorized landfills he conspired with the to deprive the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights and grant rights and privileges and preferential treatment and he actually promoted mara ortiz unlawful and constitutional revocation of redondo operating permits by ordering the closing of multiple landfills that had contracted disposing services with the plaintiff s.the complaint specific alleg
