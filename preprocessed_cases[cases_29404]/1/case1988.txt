gallatin steel company manufactures steel and harsco corporation processes slag a steel byproduct on adjacent pieces of property in rural kentucky.in addition to steel and slag,both operations produce a considerable amount of dust,what has come to be known in the regulatory world as fugitive dust,a phrase that loses its redundancy when applied to dust particles that migrate from one piece of property to another.unhappily for the ellis family and for laverne brashear,the dust particles from these manufacturing operations migrated to the ellis family farm and to brashear residence,both of which neighbor the gallatin and harsco operations.
the itinerant dust prompted several private and governmental lawsuits.the ellises and brashear sued the two companies under four legal theories,among others the companies violated kentucky emission rule,which constitutes a violation of the clear air act the companies failed to obtain a state prevention of significant deterioration psd permit as a precondition to construction of a major emitting facility,which also constitutes a violation of the clean air act the companies were jointly and severally liable for response costs incurred by the ellises under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla and the companies violated kentucky nuisance law.
the environmental protection agency of the united states epa also sued the companies under the clean air act and eventually entered into consent decrees with gallatin and harsco.the decrees required gallatin and harsco to implement compliance measures and to pay civil penalties.concluding that the decrees barred the private plaintiffs claims that the entry of the decree,the district court dismissed all of these claims.concluding that the consent decrees and state administrative proceedings precluded the psd claims and that the cercla claim was meritless,the district court dismissed these claims as well.as to the private plaintiffs claims that the consent decree,the district court awarded injunctive relief based on the clean air act and nuisance and compensatory and punitive damages totaling based on nuisance.we affirm all of these rulings with one exception the district court award of injunctive relief under the clean air act.as to that claim,the private plaintiffs have not shown that they were entitled to injunctive relief and have not shown that they complied with the notice requirements of the clean air act.that one ruling,accordingly,must be reversed.
factual background.vernon ellis lives on a farm in gallatin county,kentucky.his sons,richard and thomas,also live on the farm in separate residences along with each of their spouses and children.laverne brashear lives across the road highway from them on a plot of land.
in april,gallatin steel company and harsco corporation began operating a steel manufacturing facility and a slag processing plant,respectively,in an industrially zoned area located a down to the west of the ellises and brashear.gallatin and harsco are separate legal entities.
that same month,the ellises began to notice an unfamiliar dust on the farm,which they attributed to gallatin and harsco operations.with the arrival of the dust,the ellises say,they have experienced more respiratory problems,headaches,itchy throats and infections than they had in the past.to try to mitigate these medical problems,richard and thomas ellis kept their children indoors,they discarded their swimming pools and they stopped hunting on their land.
in,richard and thomas began documenting the dust problems by among other things taking photos of the dust crossing gallatin and harsco property lines.all told,they spent over hours monitoring the steel manufacturing and slag processing operations.in addition to the visible dust,the ellises noticed that explosions occur at the harsco slag plant,throwing heavy chunks of slag out like a volcano and shaking the ground like an earthquake.op.at.these explosions regularly vibrate plaintiffs houses,knock objects over and on one occasion broke brashear water pipes.
procedural history.the fugitive dust and slag explosions prompted seven different proceedings.the ellises filed two citizen lawsuits against gallatin and harsco under federal environmental protection laws and later amended their complaint to include nuisance claims.brashear filed a similar citizen suit against harsco and also later amended her complaint to include nuisance claims.the united states filed two enforcement actions against the corporations.and gallatin and harsco filed various permit applications that resulted in state administrative proceedings to determine whether they had the proper permits for their operations.the proceedings arise in the following statutory and regulatory context.
the federal clean air act is a model of cooperative federalism.it requires each state to establish a state implementation plan sip to limit emissions in accordance with national ambient air quality standards set by the federal epa.b,a.in compliance with this requirement,kentucky sip prohibits the discharge of visible fugitive dust emissions beyond the lot line of the property on which the emissions originate.admin.regs.other kentucky laws implement the clean air act by prohibiting the construction of a major emitting facility in designated attainment areas regions,such as gallatin county,that meet national air quality standards without first obtaining a psd permit.admin.regs.the kentucky division of air quality manages the psd program and grants the requisite permits.the federal epa and state agencies may enforce these regulatory requirements on their own initiative or at the suggestion of private citizens.see a federal epa enforcement authority.admin.regs.state regulations citizen suit provisions see also her majesty the queen city of detroit,cir state implementation plans are enforceable in federal court.
to supplement these enforcement provisions,the clean air act allows citizens to file actions to enforce its provisions when two requirements have been met.first,citizens can not commence their own suits unless they have given notice to the administrator of the epa,to the state,and to the alleged violator.b a.second,citizens can not commence independent suits if the epa or the state has already commenced an enforcement action and is diligently prosecuting the violation,though they may intervene in these actions.b b.
on april,the kentucky division of air quality issued a air emission permit to harsco for its slag operation.in,the same kentucky agency determined that gallatin and harsco were not a single emitting source and issued gallatin a psd permit.the resulting permit covered gallatin steel operations only and did not include harsco slag processing plant.
in anticipation of filing a citizen suit under the clean air act,the ellises sent a notification letter,dated december,to the epa,the attorney general and the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet.less than days later,on february,the united states filed its first enforcement action,civil action,in the district court for the eastern district of kentucky.the enforcement action charged gallatin with violations of the clean air act and several regulations.
on july,the ellises filed their first citizen suit,civil action,against gallatin and harsco alleging numerous violations of the clean air act,the clean water act,cercla,and the resource conservation and recovery act.four months later,on december,the ellises filed a second citizen suit,civil action,against gallatin and harsco alleging numerous violations of the same four federal statutes.
on january,the district court granted summary judgment against the ellises on all but three of the claims in their first citizen suit because they had failed to give proper notice of the claims.see.op.at.the district court consolidated the three surviving counts two cercla claims and a clean air act claim into the ellises second citizen suit.
on june,the kentucky division of air quality reversed its earlier determination that gallatin and harsco were not a single source.as a result,the agency issued a revised psd permit to gallatin.and because harsco did not have a psd permit it had a air emission permit,the agency sent harsco a letter on july,asking the company to submit a psd permit application for its slag processing plant.in august,gallatin and harsco filed administrative appeals to the agency determination that their facilities composed a single source.
on october,the united states amended its complaint and proposed a consent decree to resolve the federal claims.as the ellises concede,the united states added claims that overlapped with the ellises existing claims in their second complaint.ellis br.at.
at this point,brashear entered the picture.on december,she filed a complaint against harsco alleging four violations of the clean air act.
the district court granted the ellises and brashear motion to intervene in the united states enforcement suit.on june,the district court granted the united states motion to enter the gallatin and harsco consent decrees.the gallatin consent decree included various compliance measures,such as the use of a vacuum truck and the installation of a dust suppression system,designed to reduce fugitive dust emissions gallatin also agreed to pay a civil penalty of.harsco consent decree also included compliance measures,as the company agreed to relocate its slag dumping,to install a containment facility around its slag operations and to install a system.harsco agreed to pay a civil penalty of.
the next major development came in september,when the district court ruled on opposing motions in the remaining citizen suits.the court concluded that the harsco consent decree operated as a res judicata bar to the private claims predating its entry,which is to say the consent decree barred citizen claims regarding all past violations and all continuing violations up to the date the court entered the decree.it also concluded that the gallatin consent decree operated as a res judicata bar to the citizens psd permit claims.
three months after the entry of the consent decrees,the court held a bench trial concerning the second citizen suit.after the trial,the court held that the plaintiffs had no right to enforce the consent decree against harsco.but since the plaintiffs showed that fugitive dust had crossed the ellises property lines after the entry of the consent decrees on june,the court held that those violations constituted a nuisance under state law.to remedy the nuisance,the court awarded each plaintiff in compensatory damages for the reduction in the rental value of their property and a lump sum of in punitive damages to the plaintiffs collectively.the court apportioned liability for the compensatory and punitive damages,finding harsco liable and gallatin liable.to prevent future violations of the clean air act and future nuisance violations,the court granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction against harsco and gallatin and assigned a expert to monitor harsco and gallatin compliance with the injunction.
we initially consider gallatin and harsco challenges to the compensatory and punitive damage awards under state nuisance law.the companies raise three challenges gallatin claims that the evidence does not support the compensatory damage award in favor of brashear harsco challenges the admission of expert testimony on the appropriate amount of compensatory damages and both companies challenge the award of punitive damages.
compensatory damages to brashear 
gallatin first argues that the evidence does not support the district court award of nuisance damages to brashear.even if the evidence tends to show that dust from harsco slag processing and dumping operations created a nuisance on her property,gallatin argues that the evidence does not tie its operation to this problem.
the district court,however,found that d ust from gallatin and harsco has interfered with brashear use and enjoyment of her property.op.at,emphasis added a finding that the evidence supports and that thus is not clearly erroneous.see eeoc paint,cir.contrary to gallatin suggestion,it is not true that brashear testimony and evidence lacked any reference to emissions or activities at gallatin steel and instead focused solely on harsco slag processing operations.gallatin br.at.at trial,brashear said the following 
brashear,are you getting dust on your property from the harsco and gallatin steel companies.
can you tell us about that 
the court as of now,you mean 
brashear,as of today,are you getting dust on your property from these two companies 
i most certainly am.
can you tell us about that 
a.last night,i went out and i cleaned my patio furniture,and i have the cloth that i cleaned it off with.i had metallic dust on it.i had the gray dust,and it was all on there last night when i cleaned.
ja emphasis added.
in the course of these questions and answers,brashear asserts not once,but twice,that dust from gallatin landed on her property.that she could identify gallatin and harsco as sources of the dust should not be cause for surprise in view of the difference in color between the companies emissions red and gray.bolstering brashear testimony,an expert testified that particulates found on brashear property came from gallatin operations.
also unconvincing is gallatin contention that brashear failed to show that gallatin just harsco with her use and enjoyment of the property.the company offers no explanation,to say nothing of providing any evidence,as to why harsco gray dust would interfere with brashear use and enjoyment of her property but gallatin red dust would not.the district court,moreover,fully accounted for any proportional difference in the degree of interference caused by gallatin and harsco dust through its allocation of nuisance damages for harsco and for gallatin.
expert testimony 
harsco challenges the award of compensatory damages on a different ground,arguing that the district court should have excluded the testimony of the plaintiffs expert,roger meade,on the appropriate amount of damages.we review the district court admission of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.kumho tire carmichael,d.
harsco first argues that the district court failed to apply any of the daubert factors for evaluating expert testimony.contrary to harsco argument,though,daubert makes clear that the factors it mentions do not constitute a definitive checklist or test.id.at.emphasis in original.a district court does not err in failing to mention the daubert factors when they are not pertinent to assessing the reliability of a particular expert.id.here,for example,an accurate assessment of a local market does not require peer review or extensive scholarly writing.
second,harsco argues that meade initially applied the wrong legal standard diminution in market value in his calculations before he later applied the correct legal standard diminution in the value of use of the property.see.ann.b setting out damages measurements.but the record shows that meade considered the correct standard for damages at trial,and,more importantly,that the district court awarded damages based on the value of use of the property.op.at.as the district court use of the correct standard when actually awarding damages demonstrates,any flaw in meade initial testimony was corrected by the weight given that testimony in the bench trial.
third,harsco claims that meade failure to consider alternative sources that might have caused the dust renders his testimony unreliable.not true.in order to be admissible on the issue of causation,an expert testimony need not eliminate all other possible causes of the injury.jahn equine services,psc,cir.
punitive damages 
gallatin and harsco next challenge the award,taking the district court to task for applying the wrong legal standard,for making its determination without sufficient factual support and for awarding the wrong amount.we disagree.
under kentucky law,punitive damages may be awarded for gross negligence when there has been a failure to exercise reasonable care,and then an additional finding that this negligence was accompanied by wanton or reckless disregard for the lives,safety or property of others.see phelps louisville water.applying this test,the district court found that,b ased upon the entire record,harsco conduct is in wanton or reckless disregard for the lives,safety or property of others.op.at.the court finding that gallatin conduct warranted punitive damages immediately follows the court statement of this standard.
in arguing that the district court applied the wrong legal standard,gallatin and harsco point to the standard set forth in.ann.the kentucky supreme court,however,invalidated six years ago,see williams wilson,and,contrary to the companies suggestion,bowling green municipal utilities atmos energy,does not resurrect the statute.in bowling green,the kentucky supreme court applied the statute to avoid retroactive application of a new court decision because had been in effect at the time of trial.see id.at see also burns level.no such retroactivity problem exists here.neither is gallatin correct in arguing that kentucky statutes declared unconstitutional somehow remain in effect,as opposed perhaps to remaining as artifacts on the books,until repealed by the legislature.gallatin br.at.see spanish cove sanitation,county metro.sewer,explaining that any statute passed in contravention of the kentucky constitution is void ab initio.
satisfied that the district court identified the correct legal standard for punitive damages,we review its application of the standard for clear error.sterling velsicol,cir.the district court found that harsco and gallatin acted with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives,safety or property of the ellises and brashear.as to harsco,the district court found that it operated its slag processing facility for seven years without air pollution controls sufficient to stop its air pollution,all the time knowing that its dust created a nuisance but refusing to take action until the district court ordered it.the court also found that harsco built its slag pit in the open even though it knew explosions would result from rain hitting the molten slag and that the company neglected to cover the pit to stop the explosions until the court ordered the construction of a containment building.as to gallatin,the district court found that it knew dust from its operations drifted onto plaintiffs land but did not abate the nuisance.the record contains sufficient evidence to support these findings.in arguing that they took steps to ameliorate the nuisance,harsco and gallatin merely offer an explanation why a district court might not reach the conclusion it did,not an explanation why this district court conclusions rose to clear error.see anderson city of bessemer,d see franklin aycock,cir appellant burden to meet the clearly erroneous standard is not met by showing a conflict in testimony.
harsco and gallatin also challenge the district court calculation of the amount awarded as punitive damages,which we review for an abuse of discretion.smoot united transp.union,cir.harsco argues that the district court abused its discretion in making this calculation by failing to apply.ann,which sets out five factors the trier of fact should consider.emphasis added.while the district court did not cite,it did explicitly consider two of the statutory factors when it discussed the duration of the misconduct and the defendants refusal to consistently take the steps to stop fugitive dust from crossing their property lines.op.at.a district court need not prepare detailed findings on every possible issue rather it simply needs to provide a justification upon which its final conclusion reasonably can be based.orlett cincinnati microwave,cir.these two references,taken in conjunction with the court other references to the defendants conduct and with the discretionary language of the statute the trier should consider,satisfy us that the court did not fail to apply the correct legal standard.no abuse of discretion occurred.
harsco,finally,argues that the district court impermissibly based the award on nuisance and the clean air act.because the act does not authorize punitive damages,harsco argues,an award based on this theory even in part must be reversed.but in making the award,the district judge independently relied on both theories,and no one argues that the theories applied to different events or violations.for these reasons,a decision invalidating the clean air act theory for the punitive damages would leave untouched the nuisance theory,which is sufficient to establish that any error was harmless and thus to uphold the award.all four of the cases cited by harsco,in contrast,involve general jury verdicts,where the jury returned a damages award in response to multiple theories of liability without identifying the theory upon which they had relied.see virtual,prime computer,cir robertson oil phillips petroleum,cir asbill housing auth.of choctaw nation of oklahoma,cir square liner,chisum,cir.in that setting,unlike this one,reviewing courts can not determine whether the damage award rests on all of the theories or just one,creating the possibility that the reversal of one theory would eliminate the sole theory upon which the jury rested its decision.no such problem exists here.
injunction 
the companies also appear to challenge the entry of the injunction,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in granting prospective injunctive relief on the nuisance claims.ample the threat of continuing violations by gallatin and the existence of actual violations by that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting this injunction under state law.
claims between consent decree filing and entry 
turning to the federal law claims,the ellises first challenge the district court res judicata ruling regarding their claims under the clean air act.while they concede that the harsco consent decree barred many of their claims,they argue that res judicata does not apply to those violations occurring between the date the parties filed the consent decree with the court august,and the date the district court entered the decree june.
the language of the consent decree,however,defeats this argument.in consideration of the payments and the compliance measures made by harsco,it says,the united states covenants not to sue or bring any administrative action against harsco based on the claims in the complaint up through the date of entry of this consent decree.ja emphasis added.by its terms,in other words,the decree covers all claims up through the date of entry of the decree,language that picks up claims filed before the parties submitted the consent decree to the court and claims filed before the court entered the decree.
but even if there were ambiguity in this language which there is not,the district court interpretation of its own decree as applying to all claims filed before the entry of the decree.op.at,would further undermine this argument.a district court interpretation of a consent decree that it has approved deserves substantial deference.see huguley motors,cir.because the ellises had an opportunity to fully litigate the issues encompassed by the consent decree as intervenors in that law suit.op.at,res judicata bars their subsequent claims,huguley,at.
the ellises offer two responses,each unpersuasive.they initially argue that the epa and harsco could not have actually adjudicated any claims for violations that occurred after the date they filed the consent decree with the court since the court entered the decree without any alterations and without any increase in the penalty imposed on harsco.the touchstone of res judicata effect,however,is the consent decree itself,which resolves all claims through the date of entry of the decree.nor do the cases cited by the ellises alter this conclusion.those cases conclude only that the preclusive effect did not extend to claims that arose after the entry date of a consent decree.see lawlor screen serv.citizens legal envtl.action network premium standard farms,wl,at,hereinafter clean old timer,city sanitation,d,chesapeake bay,bethlehem steel.in the end,the fact that the epa did not increase the penalty in light of the violations that may have occurred between the time the consent decree was filed with the court and the time the court entered it no more shows that it did not actually adjudicate claims for these violations than it shows that the epa believed the existing civil penalty was appropriate given the defendants overall pattern of behavior.
the ellises next contend that res judicata does not apply to this consent decree because the government has not diligently prosecuted the clean air act action.the diligent prosecution requirement,however,represents a limitation on a citizen ability to file suit,not a limitation on the effect of subsequent governmental action on a citizen right to maintain the suit.see b no action may be commenced b if the administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action to require compliance.emphasis added.one court,it is true,has looked to diligent prosecution as a criterion for whether the government and the citizens were in privity for res judicata purposes.see clean,wl,at t he citizens are the same party as the state only as to that which the state has diligently prosecuted.but even if we were to apply that rule here,which we ultimately need not consider,the fact remains that the plaintiffs intervened in the suit between harsco and the government and had an unchallenged opportunity to fully litigate the issues in the earlier proceeding.op.at,making privity irrelevant to the disposition of this particular argument.
decree claims 
harsco and gallatin challenge the district court decision to grant injunctive relief on the ellises clean air act claims three months after the court entered the consent decree.in support,they argue that the ellises did not satisfy the traditional standards for obtaining injunctive relief particularly a showing of irreparable harm because they never notified the epa about the violations,never asked the agency to enforce the consent decree and did not give the remedial requirements of the consent decree sufficient time to work and that these alleged violations constitute new claims that must separately comply with the notice provisions of the clean air act,b.we agree and therefore reverse this aspect of the least to the extent it relies on federal rather than state law.
in entertaining these claims,the district court did not dispute that they stemmed from the same types of allegations that led to the consent decrees.in its view,the consent decrees did not afford sufficient relief because the plaintiffs had no rights to enforce the consent decrees even though they are the ones who daily live with the dust problems.op.at.the epa,which may enforce the decree,the district court added,does not monitor the situation on a regular basis.id.having chosen to entertain the ellises new fugitive dust claims,the court determined that harsco had continued to send dust across its property line and that harsco and gallatin had failed to take adequate measures,even after the consent decrees were entered,in violation of the clean air act.due to the threatened irreparable harm caused by actual and threatened violations,the court awarded injunctive relief under the clean air act.
the injunction entered by the district court essentially mimicked the harsco consent decree by requiring harsco to continue using the enclosed slag dumping containment structure and water spray system to minimize dust emissions.ja.the court went beyond the consent decrees,however,in one respect.it appointed a special master to monitor the visible situation at harsco and gallatin whether visible is crossing their property lines for violations of the clean air act.ja.the consent decree between the epa and harsco,by contrast,required harsco only to allow the epa access to its facilities in order to inspect and verify compliance with the consent decree.ja.
in advancing the essential goal of protect ing and enhanc ing the quality of the nation air resources,b,the clean air act relies on three sources of enforcement authority.the act entrusts the epa with primary responsibility for promulgating national ambient air quality standards.it then requires the states to develop their own implementation plans to ensure that these standards are met and permits states to enforce these plans.see id.if states fail to enforce their plans,the statute authorizes federal epa action and private enforcement actions or citizen suits.see id.a.
under the provision,the key provision at issue in this dispute,individuals may sue for violations of an emission standard or limitation under a state implementation plan,such as kentucky mandate that n o person shall cause or permit the discharge of visible fugitive dust beyond the lot line of the property on which the emissions originate.admin.regs.see a f.before bringing such an action,however,private parties must notify the epa,the state in which the alleged violation occurred and the alleged violator.see id.b.the notice must describe the proscribed activity including the dates and locations of specific incidents,and it must identify the person responsible for the violations and the applicable standard.see.no action under the clean air act provisions,the statute mandates,may be commenced within days of when the plaintiffs have satisfied these notice requirements,b a limitation that the courts may not excuse,hallstrom tillamook county,d construing similar notice provision in resource conservation and recovery act as mandatory walls waste res,cir same,resource conservation and recovery act and clean water act.
comparable notice provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act,the supreme court has said,serve two functions to allow government agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environmental regulations and to give the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance.hallstrom,at.the notice provisions demonstrate that congress has authorized citizen suits only when environmental officials fail to exercise their enforcement responsibility and has provided an interstitial role for private parties in enforcing the statute.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d emphasis added see also atlantic states legal found.eastman kodak,cir the purpose of the citizen suit is to stop violations of the clean water act that are not challenged by appropriate state and federal authorities.the statute,however,does not permit citizen suits to seek types of relief that the government chose to forgo otherwise,administrative discretion to enforce the statute in the public interest would be curtailed considerably and the nature of the citizens role would become potentially intrusive.gwaltney,at.
in the face of these carefully reticulated enforcement requirements,the ellises claims for violations of the clean air act suffer from at least two defects.first,the ellises do not dispute that they were required to satisfy the traditional requirements for obtaining an,establishing a risk of continuing irreparable injury if the court fails to issue the injunction.united states szoka,cir.whether in the district court or in this court,the ellises have failed to explain why the june,consent decrees do not adequately deal with these claims.the parties agree that the decrees cover the same types of claims covered by the injunction that the decrees are forward looking and apply to continuing violations of the clean air act,ja,that the decrees reserve all rights to deal with anything that happens in the future,ja that the decrees impose monetary penalties of to per violation that there is no evidence that the epa failed to enforce the decrees and that the epa was not notified that additional violations had occurred.see harthman witty,cir reversing grant of a second injunction as unnecessary because an injunction granted less than two months earlier already prohibited future pollution.on top of this,the decrees were just three months old when the district court entered its injunction,meaning that the remedial requirements imposed by the decrees either had just been completed or had not yet been completed at all.the decrees specifically contemplated some time for implementing their terms as they required the remedial changes to be put in place between and days.under these circumstances,the district court committed reversible error in concluding that a risk of continuing irreparable harm had been shown.see anderson davila,cir requiring a showing of a real or immediate threat of recurrent violations of legal rights ladd thomas,d,refusing to find an immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again where the court had previously awarded declaratory relief against the defendant.
second,the ellises have not explained in their briefs and did not explain at oral argument why a consent decree dismissing the same types of claims that they had previously filed does not require them to satisfy the traditional requirements for commencing an action regarding new notice and a showing when there is government involvement that the government is not diligently prosecuting the action.if it is true that citizens must notify the epa before commencing an action in the first instance,surely it is true that they must notify the epa before commencing an action that turns on the alleged inadequacy or alleged of a consent decree proposed by and negotiated by that very agency.see atlantic states legal foundation,united musical instruments,cir one of the important purposes of the notice requirement under environmental statutes is to facilitate dispute resolution by epa negotiation and thereby reduce the volume of costly litigation.quotation omitted.generally speaking,when the contours of a private plaintiff suit and the government suit the district court determined they did here and as the ellises concede the former must be dismissed.see epa city of green forest,arkansas,cir upholding district court decision to dismiss a private plaintiff clean water act claims that overlapped completely with a government consent decree see also clean,wl,at lockett epa,cir a llow ing the citizen suit to proceed based on continued violations for which the state agency had already begun to take action would eviscerate the bar on citizen suits where the state is diligently prosecuting an action under comparable state law.
the notice requirement is doubly important here because the ellises not only sought to obtain an injunction on the same terms as the consent decrees but they also sought to obtain relief on more stringent terms than those worked out by the epa.green forest,at.such of the epa assessment of an appropriate mere three months after the entry of the to respect the statute careful distribution of enforcement authority among the federal epa,the states and private citizens,all of which permit citizens to act where the epa has failed to do so,not where the epa has acted but has not acted aggressively enough in the citizens view.see gwaltney,at.citizens can not seek the civil penalties that the epa chose to forgo comfort lake ass n,dresel contracting,cir private plaintiffs can not collaterally attack a state environmental agency decision that a certain level of civil penalties suffice for the same violations alleged in the citizen suit orange env t,county of orange,citizens can not overrule the judgment of the epa and demand an additional and different type of remediation than that settled upon by the federal authorities.
in ruling to the contrary,the district court expressed concern that the ellises may not directly enforce the consent decrees and have no apparent remedy for continued problems because the epa does not monitor the fugitive dust situation on a regular basis under the decrees.why these concerns made a difference in this case,however,is not clear,as the court simultaneously granted the ellises ample injunctive and monetary relief regarding the continuing fugitive dust under kentucky nuisance law.even if that relief had not been available,however,there are two answers to the district court concern.as a starting point,it is well to remember that the clean air act primarily serves public,not private,interests.citizens acting as private attorneys general to enforce the clean air act,as the phrase implies,seek relief not on their own behalf but on behalf of society as a whole,and accordingly personalized remedies are not a first priority of the act.see orange env t.at noting that t he fact that the remediation order in an environmental suit does not meet the desires of private parties is not crucial,as the purpose of the clean water act is to provide society with a remedy,not to secure personalized relief for individuals.
more importantly,the ellises and the public interest they represent are not without a federal remedy.three avenues of relief remained open to them.the ellises could have petitioned the epa to enforce the consent decrees.they could have petitioned the epa or the court to obtain a modification of the consent decree.and they could have filed a new lawsuit after supplying the requisite notice to the epa,to kentucky and to harsco and gallatin.what the ellises can not do once the epa becomes involved is wait until the epa has resolved its own claims against the polluter,then obtain stricter enforcement than the government negotiated.if,in other words,the ellises had notified the epa that violations of the clean air act had persisted after the entry of the consent decrees and if the government did not enforce the decrees or otherwise prosecute these claims,the ellises could file a new complaint and comply with the statute notice requirements,in part by showing that the government is not diligently prosecuting its suit,not enforcing the consent decrees.in view of the mere three months that elapsed between the entry of the consent decrees and the district court injunction and in view of the ellises decision not to raise the issue with the epa,it can hardly be said that the government in this instance was unwilling or unable to enforce the decrees.clean,wl,at prosecutions under the clean air act are heavily presumed diligent.
also unavailing are the ellises arguments in defense of the district court decision.they claim that citizen plaintiffs have the right to seek injunctive relief after a government settlement if the violations continue and notice to the epa is not required for violations that are of the same type as those identified in the initial notice.ellis reply br.at.
in support of their first proposition,eastman kodak,at,and comfort lake,at,say that citizen plaintiffs may maintain their lawsuits after the government has resolved claims regarding earlier violations when there is a realistic prospect of the alleged violations continuing.but neither of these cases establishes that a court may issue a injunction when consent decrees concluded by the government grant prospective injunctive relief covering the same ground,much less allow such claims before the decrees have been allowed to work.the ellises have not drawn our attention to any case that allows private parties to seek relief that requires a court to revisit and revamp territory tread by environmental authorities three months earlier,particularly when those authorities have not even been told about the alleged violations.
in making their second additional violations that are part of an ongoing pattern need not independently comply with the statute notice ellises again overlook the significance of the consent decrees.it may well be true that private plaintiffs need not send additional notice letters for violations of the same type once they have filed a complaint.see pub.interest research group of new jersey,hercules,cir.but because the government consent decrees required the dismissal of the ellises claims for injunctive relief of the same type,the notice requirements for commencing a new suit if the ellises could demonstrate that the government has actually failed to enforce the decrees assuredly apply.see b no action may be commenced prior to days after the plaintiff has given notice of the violation.
the ellises challenge the district court decision rejecting their federal permit claims that gallatin and harsco failed to get a psd for their manufacturing operations.in the ellises view,harsco violated this rule because it should have obtained a separate psd permit for its and dumping operations it instead obtained a air emissions permit for its operations in and gallatin and harsco violated this rule because they should be c
