in this age discrimination case,the question is whether the mississippi river pilot associations are employers of the member pilots for the purposes of the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.the question is difficult and yields no straightforward answer.the defendant associations are,peculiarly conducted institutions recognized by statute,owned and governed by their member pilots,and serving as a sort of clearinghouse and dispatching service for the river pilots.there is no doubt that if the plaintiff suffered age discrimination,it was administered by the hands of the defendant associations because of their policies.yet,there is an absence of any traditional employer relationship,traditional relationship,relationship,or relationship between the associations and the pilots.
terry coleman coleman,born october,brought suit against the new orleans baton rouge steamship pilots association nobra and the crescent river port pilot association crescent,as well as the board of river port pilot commissioners the crescent board,alleging that these entities unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age in violation of the adea.they did so,he claims,by refusing to elect him into their respective pilot apprenticeship programs because he was too old under their membership qualifications.the district court granted summary judgment in these separately filed actions to nobra,crescent,and the crescent board,holding that these entities are not employers within the meaning of the adea and therefore can not be held liable under the adea.because both cases present similar legal issues,we consider them together in this opinion.
we hold that nobra,crescent,and the crescent board are not employers of river pilots within the meaning of the adea.these entities are therefore not subject to the adea prohibitions on age discrimination in employment.accordingly,we affirm the district court grants of summary judgment to nobra,crescent,and the crescent board.
in our effort to determine whether any of the defendants meet the definition of employer under the adea,we must first understand louisiana body of rules and regulations governing the licensing of mississippi river pilots and the relationship among pilots,boards of examiners,and pilots associations in the operation of the pilot apprenticeship programs.only then can we fully understand the organizational structure of the defendant pilots associations and its bearing on the question of liability under the adea.
louisiana state law requires that local pilots guide foreign ships along louisiana waterways,including the mississippi river.the louisiana portion of the mississippi river is divided into three zones.see generally hendrix louisiana public service commission,so d.bar pilots or associated branch pilots guide vessels in and out of the entrance of the mississippi river between pilottown and the gulf of mexico,et.river port pilots guide vessels between pilottown and new orleans,et.new orleans and baton rouge steamship pilots guide seagoing vessels from the port of new orleans to the port of baton rouge and intermediate ports,et.an individual who wishes to serve as a pilot in any of these zones must receive a commission from the governor of louisiana entitling him to work as a pilot on a particular stretch of the river.receiving a commission is a process.
regulation of the process of applying to be a pilot is mainly the responsibility of the state regulatory boards created for this specific purpose.the board of river port pilot commissioners crescent board is authorized by statute to hold examinations under such rules and regulations,and with such requirements as they shall have provided,to certify to the governor that applicants are qualified to be river port pilots.the board of examiners for the new orleans and baton rouge steamship pilots nobra board is similarly authorized to certify qualified applicants to the governor to be new orleans and baton rouge steamship pilots.each of these boards is comprised of three citizens holding commissions for the appropriate stretch of the river.the governor appoints individuals to serve on the commissions.id.
an individual must first petition the appropriate board for a determination of his qualifications a few specific requirements for qualified pilots are set out by statute.before the crescent board may certify the candidate to the governor for commissioning,river port pilots are required to be of good moral character,be a voter of the state of louisiana,and have completed an approved apprenticeship program.new orleans and baton rouge steamship pilots are required by statute to be of good moral character,be a voter of the state of louisiana,have a first class pilot license issued by the united states coast guard,and complete a apprenticeship.
the crescent board and the nobra board are authorized by statute to provide additional requirements for individuals seeking to become pilots.among myriad licensing and educational requirements,the crescent board requires that the individual must not have reached his fortieth birthday prior to the first day of balloting on apprentices by the river port pilots.admin.code tit.c emphasis added.the nobra board requires that the individual shall not have reached his or her birthday before being commissioned.admin.code tit,emphasis added.
an individual applying to be an apprentice first submits his application to the appropriate board of for certification that the individual is a qualified apprentice candidate.because apprenticeships must be completed under the supervision of a commissioned pilot,and because only a limited number of pilots are allowed by law,certification by the board as a qualified candidate does not guarantee an individual a place in the apprenticeship program.the individual must then be elected to apprenticeship by a majority vote of the pilots association for the respective stretch of the river.
once elected,the candidate completes a apprenticeship program under the supervision of commissioned pilots.the boards retain the right to require satisfactory completion of the apprenticeship program,extend the apprenticeship,or terminate the apprenticeship when deemed necessary.admin.code tit,l.upon completion of the apprenticeship program,the boards examine the apprentices as to their knowledge of pilotage and their proficiency and capability to serve as commissioned pilots.admin.code tit,m.if the board deems the apprentice qualified,the board certifies the apprentice to the governor for commissioning.the governor may then appoint,in his discretion,the individual to an existing vacancy.
the pilots associations that elect individuals to apprenticeships exist pursuant to louisiana law giving pilots the right to form themselves into an association or associations as to them may seem fit,not in conflict with law.crescent and nobra periodically hold elections for apprenticeship when each respectively determines that a need exists for new pilots.the associations select only the number of apprenticeship candidates commensurate with the number of new pilots needed 
crescent and nobra are incorporated under the laws of louisiana as corporations.et.crescent charter provides that the objects and purposes of the corporation are,in relevant part 
to provide efficient means for dispatching crescent river port pilots to ships and vessels assigned and requiring the services of such pilots on an equitable basis,providing for the collection and disbursement of fees and charges of whatsoever nature and kind incident to the performance of such services,and making distribution thereof among the shareholders of this corporation after deducting all legitimate and approved expenses of the operation of same.
to provide for a pension and welfare plan for retired shareholders of this corporation,and for their families.
to inculcate,secure and maintain skill,discipline,merit and efficiency in the pilots engaged in piloting vessels over the pilotage waters assigned to the crescent river port pilots,promoting and assisting the commerce and prosperity of the port of new orleans.
nobra charter similarly provides,albeit with much less specificity,that the purpose of the association is 
to carry on the business of piloting and other vessels on the mississippi river,between the mississippi river ports of new orleans and baton rouge and return,for fees,and to shift vessels in the harbors of harahan,avondale,rose,destrehan,good hope,norco,reserve,burnside,gramercy and other harbors to and including baton rouge,louisiana,in accordance with act of the legislature of of the state of louisiana louisiana revised statutes,et sequitur and to inculcate,secure and maintain skill,discipline,merit and efficiency in the pilots engaged in this business,and to thereby promote and assist the commerce and prosperity of said ports and intermediate ports.
each association is owned by its members each member pilot holds one share of the association stock.
the primary business of both associations is to receive requests for pilotage from ship agents and dispatch pilots to those vessels.the associations also collect the fees from the shipping companies for the pilotage work performed.the receipts,minus general overhead expenses,are remitted monthly to member pilots in accordance with an established formula based on the number of days each individual was available for piloting.the associations do not withhold tax or fica on the monies distributed to pilot members,and pilots pay is reflected on irs form,rather than irs form.
membership in an association is not required by law,but most,if not all,pilots currently commissioned in the nobra and crescent stretches of the river are members of the appropriate association.
despite the complexity of the interrelationships and the working arrangements among the associations and the pilots,the facts underlying coleman claims are simple.coleman,born on october,is an experienced ship captain who sought to become a commissioned pilot on the nobra and crescent stretches of the mississippi river.
coleman submitted an application for the apprenticeship program to the nobra board in.nobra held an election for apprentices in,but coleman name did not appear on the ballot as a certified candidate for apprenticeship.at the time of the nobra election,coleman was years old.nobra requires that an applicant not have reached his birth date.
coleman also submitted an application for the apprenticeship program to the crescent board in.crescent held an election that same year,but coleman name did not appear on the ballot as a certified candidate for apprenticeship.at the time of the crescent election,coleman was years old crescent charter requires that an applicant shall not have reached his fortieth birthday prior to the day of the first ballot for his election as an apprentice.
after filing an eeoc charge against nobra and receiving a letter,coleman filed an action against nobra alleging that the association unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age in violation of the adea by failing to elect him into the river pilot apprenticeship program.nobra moved for summary judgment asserting that it is not an employer under the adea.the district court granted nobra summary judgment,finding that coleman did not present a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether nobra is an employer of river pilots within the meaning of the adea.coleman new orleans baton rouge steamship pilots association,wl.june.the district court summarily adopted the reasoning of ehret state of louisiana,a case holding that crescent lacked control over its member pilots and therefore was not their employer.ehret,in turn,had found persuasive the analysis in the tort case mckeithen v.the ss frosta,which held that nobra was not vicariously liable as an employer because it exerted no control over a pilot once he took the helm of a vessel.mckeithen likened nobra to other professional associations and found nobra pilots to be independent contractors.
coleman also received letters from the eeoc for his charges against crescent and the crescent board.coleman then filed separate actions alleging violations of the adea against crescent and the crescent board,which were consolidated before the district court.crescent and the crescent board both moved for summary judgment arguing in part that they are not employers or joint employers.relying on the same reasoning as the opinion in the nobra proceeding,the district court granted crescent and the crescent board summary judgment.coleman crescent river port pilot association,wl.june.
coleman now appeals both judgments thus,we have before us the two appeals presenting mutually dispositive issues.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard applied by the district court.hall gillman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
a primary purpose of the adea is to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment.b.to accomplish this purpose,the adea prohibits certain practices by employers,employment agencies,and labor organizations.a c.in relevant part,the adea makes it unlawful for an employer 
to otherwise fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of such individual age.
a.an employment agency may not 
fail or refuse to refer for employment,or otherwise to discriminate against,any individual because of such individual age,or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the basis of such individual age.
b.finally,it is unlawful for a labor organization 
to exclude or expel from its membership,or otherwise to discriminate against,any individual because of his age 
to limit,segregate,or classify its membership,or to classify or fail or refuse to refer for employment any individual,in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,or would limit such employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee or as an applicant for employment,because of such individual age 
to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an individual in violation of this section.
c.although the prohibitions of the adea are broad in scope,the reach of the adea is limited by the statute own definitions of employer,employment agency,and labor organization.see.if an entity is not an employer,employment agency,or labor organization,it is not subject to the prohibitions of the adea against age discrimination in employment.
the question that confronts us is whether crescent and nobra are entities that are subject to the prohibitions of the adea.the answer to this question is not immediately apparent.we begin by considering each possibility of coverage under the adea.
we first observe that nobra and crescent can not be considered employment agencies or labor organizations under the adea.coleman has not made such an assertion,but at first glance,nobra and crescent share characteristics with employment agencies and labor organizations as they are commonly understood.the dispatching function of the associations,matching pilots with vessels needing piloting,may be analogized in a general way to the usual purpose of an employment agency or union hiring hall.however,we must deal specifically with the definitions in the adea.nobra and crescent are not labor organizations because they do not exist for the purpose,in whole or in part,of dealing with employers concerning grievances,labor disputes,wages,rates of pay,hours,or other terms or conditions of employment d.although the adea refers to hiring halls,its reference is only to explain that a labor organization is deemed to be in an industry affecting commerce if it maintains or operates a hiring hall or hiring office which procures employees for an employer or procures for employees opportunities to work for an employer e.
moreover,labor organizations interact with the employer of the members of the organization.a shipowner or charterer i
