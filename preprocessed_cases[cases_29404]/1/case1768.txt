factual and procedural background 
bloemker worked as a laborer and was a member of the laborers local union the union.he participated in the laborers local pension plan the plan,a defined benefit erisa plan,and had years of service credit on january.the plan provides that participants can be eligible for benefits when they take normal retirement,early retirement,late retirement,or disability retirement.the plan sets out the requirements a participant must meet to be eligible for each of these forms of retirement and provides formulas for calculating benefits under each of these options using the participant information and actuarial calculations.generally,an employee is eligible for normal retirement when he reaches age and has at least five years participation in the plan.a participant can become eligible for early retirement at as early as age if he has participated in the plan for at least five years.the proper formula for calculating early retirement benefits under the plan depends on the age of the participant and his number of years with the plan.the plan provides participants with annual benefits statements which estimate the benefits to which they would be entitled at normal retirement age.
on january,bloemker received his annual statement of status,which estimated that if he retired he would be entitled to a monthly benefit pension of.the statement also explained that this was only an estimate of benefits.based on this information,bloemker contacted jennifer bielamowicz of stoner associates stoner,the administrator of his plan,who acted as a pension administrator,to discuss the possibility of early retirement.he received a letter from her stating that if he were to retire on april,he would be eligible for approximately per month,single life annuity,payable for your lifetime only.the letter also explained that once stoner received an application,it would send bloemker an estimate of his joint and survivor benefits.
bloemker applied for early retirement benefits on february,and selected basic joint and survivor as the type of his benefit.on march,bielamowicz drafted a document titled laborers local pension plan benefit election form bef.the bef was stamped by stoner and contained a certification stating 
based on our records of your hours worked under the plan and the contributions which have been made on your behalf,we hereby certify that you are entitled to receive the retirement benefit specified above,and that the amount shown for any optional forms of payment are equivalent to your basic benefit.
it stated that bloemker would receive per month for his life and that his wife would receive per month if she were still living after his death.
bloemker commenced early retirement and began receiving benefits under the plan in the amount certified in the bef.he later received a letter from stoner on plan letterhead dated september,indicating that stoner had recently conducted an audit and had determined that it may have erred in calculating his early retirement benefits.in december,he received another letter from stoner.this letter explained that a computer programming error caused it to incorrectly calculate bloemker early retirement benefits.it further explained that his benefit should be per month instead of the per month he was currently receiving and that his benefit amount would be reduced to effective january.the letter also stated that he had been overpaid the amount of per month for months and that he was required to repay the that he was overpaid.it set out several options for him to repay this amount including by making a single lump sum payment or by having his monthly benefit reduced even further to account for the overpayment.
bloemker exhausted his administrative remedies under the plan and commenced suit.in his complaint bloemker claims that he had a contract with the plan,which was executed through stoner,for the larger amount of early retirement benefits.he argues that the plan and stoner made material misrepresentations to him on which he relied to his detriment.finally,he contends that the plan and stoner breached their fiduciary duties to him under erisa.while stoner and the plan urged the district court that the first two of these claims were preempted by erisa,see thurman pfizer,cir,the district court construed the first two claims as being brought under erisa rather than state law and accordingly not preempted the district court also construed the complaint as asserting a claim of equitable estoppel under federal common law.the district court concluded that bloemker could not make out a contract claim or a claim to recover benefits under erisa.it also held that stoner was not a fiduciary and that bloemker failed to plead that the plan or its trustees breached a fiduciary duty.finally,the district court noted that estoppel claims were limited to welfare benefit plans,not retirement benefit plans like the one in question here,and that even if bloemker could bring an estoppel claim,his complaint failed to sufficiently allege such a claim.the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss each of the claims,and denied bloemker motion for summary judgment as moot.
discussion 
equitable estoppel 
the district court construed bloemker complaint as stating a claim for federal common law equitable estoppel.we have recognized that equitable estoppel may be a viable theory in erisa cases,and have treated promissory estoppel in the same way.sprague motors,cir en banc.yet we have not previously recognized equitable estoppel as a viable claim in the pension opposed to the welfare.see id.at citing armistead vernitron,cir.our reluctance to extend estoppel has been based on the following observation from armistead 
p ension benefits are typically paid out of funds to which both employers and employees contribute.contributions and are determined by actuarial assumptions reflected in the terms of the plan.if the effective terms of the plan may be altered by transactions between officers of the plan and individual plan participants or discrete groups of them,the rights and legitimate expectations of third parties to retirement income may be prejudiced.
at.following a number of other circuits,we now conclude that this interest is not sufficiently weighty to defeat estoppel claims in pension cases where the representation was made in writing and where the plaintiff can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.
