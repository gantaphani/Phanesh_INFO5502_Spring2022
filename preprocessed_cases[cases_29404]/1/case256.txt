in,houng saysana was taken into custody by immigration and customs enforcement ice and held without bond.after agency proceedings in which bond was again denied,he filed this petition for habeas corpus in the district court,challenging the conclusion of the board of immigration appeals bia or board that he is subject to the mandatory detention provision in c.the district court concluded that the board had misinterpreted the statute,and it granted the writ.the government timely appealed.because we conclude that the government has adopted an interpretation contrary to the plain meaning of the statute,we affirm the judgment of the district court.we also hold,in the alternative,that,even if the statute were ambiguous,the position of the government is not a reasonable one.
background 
facts and agency proceedings 
saysana is a native and citizen of laos who entered the united states as a refugee in.in,he was convicted of indecent assault and battery in massachusetts state court.he was sentenced to five years imprisonment,three months of which were served.he was released in.
in,saysana again was arrested,this time for failing to register as a sex offender as required by massachusetts law because of his offense.the charge later was dismissed,and saysana was released from state custody.
in,ice took saysana into custody pursuant to c,and held him without bond.on the same day,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings,contending that saysana conviction qualified as an aggravated felony crime of violence,see a f,and rendered him removable,see id.a a iii the ij held a bond redetermination hearing and ordered saysana released on bond.saysana posted the bond.
the dhs appealed the bond decision to the bia.in its precedent decision,matter of saysana,i n bia,the board concluded that the mandatory detention provision of c applied to any alien with a qualifying conviction who was released from any criminal custody after the effective date of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat,codified as amended in scattered sections of,here october.see infra note.in the board view,because saysana had been released from state custody in,he was subject to the mandatory detention requirement,even though the charge that formed the basis for his arrest,failure to register as a sex offender,was not the crime that formed the basis for his removal proceedings.after the bia reversed the ij bond decision,ice took saysana back into custody.saysana then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
opinion of the district court 
the district court concluded that the board interpretation of c was erroneous 
this court does not agree with the board of immigration appeals bia interpretation of c,as applied to petitioner case.i find chief judge kane decision in thomas hogan,wl,factually analogous and persuasive.i adopt her reasoning as to why the mandatory detention provision of iirira does not apply to aliens released from custody in circumstances similar to those of petitioner.
order of,at internal citation omitted.the thomas decision cited by the court had relied on a significant body of case law holding that the board position is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.wl,at.the district court in this case therefore granted the writ and remanded to ice with instructions to hold an individualized bond hearing within ten days.the government now appeals,urging us to accept the agency construction of the statute.
ii.discussion 
at the heart of this appeal is an interpretation of the mandatory detention provision set forth at c section c,which is not retroactive,see iirira b stating that the amendments to the detention provisions apply to aliens released after the effective date,subject to statutory extensions of time,is part of a provision that addresses the apprehension and detention of aliens.it states,in relevant part 
apprehension and detention of aliens 
a arrest,detention,and release 
on a warrant issued by the attorney general,an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the united states.except as provided in subsection c of this section and pending such decision,the attorney general 
may continue to detain the arrested alien and 
may release the alien on 
a bond of at least with security approved by,and containing conditions prescribed by,the attorney general or 
b conditional parole but 
may not provide the alien with work authorization including an employment authorized endorsement or other appropriate work permit,unless the alien is lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise would without regard to removal proceedings be provided such authorization.
c detention of criminal aliens 
the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who 
a is inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense covered in section a of this title,
b is deportable by reason of having committed any offense covered in section a a ii,a iii,b,c,or d of this title,
c is deportable under section a a i of this title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been sentence d to a term of imprisonment of at least year,or 
d is inadmissible under section a b of this title or deportable under section a b of this title,
when the alien is released,without regard to whether the alien is released on parole,supervised release,or probation,and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.
the attorney general may release an alien described in paragraph only if the attorney general decides pursuant to section of title that release of the alien from custody is necessary to provide protection to a witness,a potential witness,a person cooperating with an investigation into major criminal activity,or an immediate family member or close associate of a witness,potential witness,or person cooperating with such an investigation,and the alien satisfies the attorney general that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding.a decision relating to such release shall take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the severity of the offense committed by the alien.
emphasis added.
we must decide whether the mandatory detention provision applies only when an alien is released from a criminal custody the basis for which is one of the offenses listed in c a d or,alternatively,whether it applies whenever an alien,previously convicted of an offense that falls within c a d,is released from any criminal custody regardless of the reason for that detention.resolution of this issue centers on the when released language in c.
the bia adopted the latter interpretation.it reasoned 
t he language of the last sentence of subsection c does not identify the form of detention from which an alien must be released.rather,we have interpreted the statute to require that the release be from a custodial setting.a reading of the statute as a whole does not suggest that congress intended to further limit the custodial setting to criminal custody pursuant to a conviction for a crime rendering an alien removable.indeed,as we have observed before,under sections c a and d,an alien need not be convicted of any offense in order to be removable as charged and subject to mandatory detention.requiring that an alien release from criminal custody be directly tied to the basis for detention under section c would therefore be inconsistent with congress mandate to take into custody those aliens who are released,yet who may never have been in custody because they are inadmissible under the covered grounds set forth in sections c a and d.thus,we find that the language and scope of section c do not support limiting the custodial setting solely to criminal custody that is related to,or that arises from,the basis for detention under that section.
saysana,i n at footnote omitted.in the bia view,the purpose of the section is to impose a duty on the dhs to continue to detain criminal and terrorist aliens pending the completion of proceedings to remove such aliens from the united states once they are no longer in the custody of another entity.id.at.the bia observed that congress was presumably aware that aliens may commit multiple offenses and may come into custodial authority in a variety of ways.id.the bia concluded that it was illogical to suppose that congress would not have wanted to require the dhs to detain a criminal or terrorist alien as set forth in sections c a d pending completion of proceedings to remove the alien from the united states solely because the alien had been released from custody for an additional offense.id.emphasis in original.the bia also believed that the history of the provision supported its interpretation 
thus,for well over a decade congress has expressed through legislation its intent that criminal and terrorist aliens should generally,if not always,be detained until the completion of their immigration proceedings.the legislation indicates that congress views criminal and terrorist aliens as threats to persons and property in the united states who should be segregated from society until a decision can be made regarding whether they will be allowed to remain in this country.it further reflects that congress views them as poor bail risks who have little likelihood of relief from removal and who therefore have little incentive to appear for their hearings if they are released from custody,regardless of family and community ties.while the released language of the iirira limits to manageable proportions the numbers of such aliens that come into contact with the dhs,it should not be light of the predominant statutory confer any additional substantive restriction on the categories of aliens that congress considered subject to mandatory detention,beyond the requirement that they have been released from custody.
id.at footnote omitted.thus,the bia held,w e find that the language of section c does not support limiting the custodial setting solely to criminal custody tied to the basis for detention under that section.id.at.
the ruling of the bia implicates the holding of the supreme court of the united states in chevron usa,natural resources defense council,d.chevron requires us to conduct a inquiry.as we have explained in succar ashcroft,cir 
we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d.if so,courts,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.as the supreme court has said in the immigration context 
the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.

in determining whether a statute exhibits ambiguity,and hence warrants deference to the attorney general interpretation of the statute,courts look at both the most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the interpretive clues congress provided.dynamics land.at.in determining the meaning of a statute,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.see leocal ashcroft,d w e construe language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it.id.another regular interpretive method is reference to statutory history to see if any serious question even about purely textual ambiguity is left.dynamics land.at.
succar,at parallel citations omitted alterations to text in original emphasis added.if,after applying these interpretive tools,we conclude that the statute is ambiguous,we turn to the second question,id.at,specifically,whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron,at.in applying the second step,we must defer to an agency interpretive regulation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
clarity of statute 
the first step of chevron requires that we focus on the statutory language.following the counsel of succar,we give the words of the statute their ordinary meaning unless the context of the statute suggests otherwise.mccarthy bronson,d.when the plain wording of the statute is clear,that is the end of the matter.bedroc,llc united states,d.we must remember,however,that the plain meaning of a statutory provision is often made clear not only by the words of the statute but by its structure as well.alexander sandoval,d.
in our view,a natural reading of the statutory provision from top to bottom makes clear that the congressional requirement of mandatory detention is addressed to the situation of an alien who is released from custody for one of the enumerated offenses.the statutory language embodies the judgment of congress that such an individual should not be returned to the community pending disposition of his removal proceedings.both the language and the structure of the statutory provision state this mandate in a clear and straightforward manner.as explained by one of our colleagues in the district court in oscar gillen,d tauro,
the when released provision immediately follows the list of enumerated offenses,indicating that the former modifies the latter.additionally,c provides that the alien shall be detained upon release regardless of whether he is subsequently arrested for the same offense,reinforcing the notion that the entire clause applies to the list of enumerated offenses immediately preceding it.
the government submits,however,that when released is susceptible to another interpretation.the government believes that the released language must embrace a broader meaning than a release from custody for an enumerated offense because the statute requires mandatory detention for individuals who are removable or inadmissible based on the commission of certain offenses,whether or not they were convicted of those offenses.see c a d referring to other portions of the immigration and nationality act ina not requiring a conviction saysana,i n at.it elaborates that there are a variety of offenses for which an alien may be inadmissible under and,therefore,subject to mandatory detention under c a,but that may never give rise to a formal charge,let alone an indictment,trial or conviction emphasis added.appellant br.at see also saysana,i n at.under these circumstances,the government continues,aliens who committed these offenses would not necessarily be subject to criminal or other custody.appellant br.at.thus,the government concludes,because c a d includes offenses for which aliens might not be incarcerated,when released must have a broader meaning than the offenses enumerated in the statute.
we believe that this reading of the statutory language is a strained one.while it is true that a conviction is not always a necessary predicate to inadmissibility or removability,see c a d other sections of the immigration and nationality act not requiring a conviction,the plain language of the statute does not render the term when released meaningless as applied to these subsections.individuals may be released in connection with the offenses listed without any resulting conviction and be subject,therefore,to mandatory detention,consistent with the statute.for example,an alien could be arrested and released without charges.that an alien might have committed a listed offense but never come into any form of custody from which release triggers mandatory detention does not justify a reading that attaches the serious consequences of the statute to a subsequent,otherwise wholly inconsequential,incident of criminal custody.
a far more natural reading is that the when released language applies to an alien who has been detained criminally for one of the listed activities.this reading not only relates the when released to the prior language in the subsection,but it also explains
