robert zimmerman was riding his motorcycle on a summer evening in.he approached a railroad crossing,but it was dark and a building obscured the tracks.when he was less than feet away,he noticed that a train was approaching.he tried to stop,but his front brake locked and he flew over the handlebars,colliding headfirst with a locomotive.the collision left him partially paralyzed.he sued norfolk southern corporation in federal court,asserting three state tort claims 
railroads are among the most heavily regulated american industries.unfortunately for zimmerman,many of these regulations preempt state tort claims.the federal railroad safety act frsa contains a provision that outlines the scope of preemption.the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania relied on this provision in granting summary judgment for norfolk southern,concluding that most of zimmerman claims were preempted.we will reverse in part and affirm in part.
diller avenue is a road that runs diagonally through new holland,pennsylvania.in the southern part of town,diller avenue intersects a railroad track owned and operated by norfolk southern.because of the location of a tavern northwest of the crossing,southbound motorists have a difficult time seeing eastbound trains.for example,a motorist who is feet away can see only feet down the tracks.the speed limit on diller avenue is miles per hour,while the speed limit on the tracks is subject to some disagreement.norfolk southern argues that the limit is at least and maybe forty miles per hour,but zimmerman argues that it is ten miles per hour.
the diller avenue crossing has been the scene of a number of accidents over the years.five accidents were reported at the crossing in the.a decade later,the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the crossing former owner installed two white signs,called crossbucks,with the use of federal funds.since the installation of these signs,five more accidents have been reported.at the time of zimmerman accident,there was a crossbuck fixed on each side of the track there was also a yellow warning sign on diller avenue,feet north of the crossing,together with painted warnings on the street.zimmerman contends that these warnings had fallen into disrepair tree branches covered the signs on the north side and the street markings had faded.
on june,zimmerman celebrated his birthday.after a game of church softball and a trip to his mother house,he headed for home on his motorcycle.it was dark,and zimmerman was wearing a helmet and riding within the speed limit.he turned south onto diller avenue and approached the crossing a crossing he did not believe was still active.meanwhile,an eastbound norfolk southern train consisting of only two engines approached the crossing travelling miles per hour.it sounded its horn.
zimmerman apparently failed to notice that the train was about to enter the crossing until he was less than feet away at that point,he was too close to the track to stop one of the train operators noticed zimmerman around this time but could not stop the train soon enough to avoid the collision.zimmerman aggressively applied the brake of his motorcycle,causing the front wheel to lock.he flipped over the handlebar and flew headfirst into the gas tank of the lead engine.the collision left him partially paralyzed.
zimmerman sued norfolk southern in the eastern district of pennsylvania under pennsylvania tort law.his complaint listed four counts failure to warn failure to maintain a safe crossing failure to ensure that the crossing devices complied with federal regulations and punitive damages.on august,the district court granted norfolk southern motion for summary judgment,concluding that some of zimmerman claims were preempted and that others did not create a genuine issue of material fact.

the doctrine of preemption permeates zimmerman appeal.norfolk southern argues that various federal regulations preempt zimmerman claims under the frsa preemption provision.we have interpreted the provision a few times over the years,but congress changed it in.we begin our discussion by providing a framework for analyzing preemption under the amended frsa.we do so because we have yet to interpret the amendment and because this analysis is relevant to each of zimmerman claims.we then turn to those claims.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution is the source of preemption.const.art.vi,cl.under the supremacy clause,federal law trumps or preempts state law whenever the two are in conflict.preemption can be express or implied either way,the effect is the same preemption renders the relevant state law invalid.see gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d holk snapple beverage,cir recognizing that implied preemption comes in two varieties field preemption and conflict preemption.we tend to interpret federal statutes in a way that avoids implied preemption.holk,at citing bates dow agrosciences llc,d.the same is not true of express preemption.
here,the frsa expressly preempts state railroad law.subsection a outlines the scope of frsa preemption laws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.a.yet the frsa does not preempt all state railroad law a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety or security until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.id a.moreover,states may adopt a more stringent law if it is necessary to eliminate a local safety or security hazard.id.a a.as the supreme court has noted,the frsa displays considerable solicitude for state law.csx,easterwood,d see also norfolk ry.shanklin,d.
before the amendment,we held that a federal regulation preempts state law under subsection a if the regulation substantially subsume s the subject matter of the relevant state law.strozyk norfolk,cir quoting easterwood,at quotation marks omitted.the regulation must do more than simply touch upon or relate to the subject matter of the state law.id.at quoting easterwood,at internal quotation marks omitted.
congress amended the frsa preemption provision in by adding subsection b,which is a c larification regarding state law causes of action 
nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt an action under state law seeking damages for personal injury,death,or property damage alleging that a party 
a has failed to comply with the federal standard of care established by a regulation or order issued by the secretary of transportation or the secretary of homeland security,covering the subject matter as provided in subsection a of this section 
b has failed to comply with its own plan,rule,or standard that it created pursuant to a regulation or order issued by either of the secretaries or 
c has failed to comply with a state law,regulation,or order that is not incompatible with subsection a.
the question before us is how to interpret the frsa preemption provision in light of the amendment.zimmerman argues that the amendment restricts the scope of preemption and thus supersedes all prior cases interpreting subsection a,including our decision in strozyk and the supreme court decisions in shanklin and easterwood.norfolk southern agrees that the amendment restricts preemption in some respects but argues that it preserves cases interpreting the phrase covering the subject matter of the state requirement.id.a.we agree with norfolk southern interpretation.
statutory interpretation requires that we begin with a careful reading of the text.see bruesewitz wyeth,cir noting that this court decline s to employ legislative history if a statute is clear on its face hay,acquisition,cir.the scope of the amendment is clear from the text it clarifies that claimants can avoid preemption by alleging a violation of either a federal standard of care or the railroad own plan,rule,or standard that it created pursuant to a regulation or order.b a b.the amendment otherwise preserves the analysis for deciding whether a regulation preempts state law.
for starters,the amendment did not change the language of subsection a.federal regulations still preempt state law if they cover the subject matter.id.a.the continued use of this language indicates that the analysis remains the same.in fact,the amendment explicitly preserves the right to seek damages for violating state law,as long as the law is compatible with subsection a.see id.b c.moreover,the title of the new subsection b is clarification regarding state law causes of action.the word clarification suggests that the amendment attempted to resolve an ambiguity rather than change substantive law.see henning union pac,cir t he title indicates congress sought to resolve an ambiguity rather than effect a substantive change.the amendment thus preserves cases such as strozyk and shanklin that analyzed whether a regulation covers state law.the amendment is significant for a different reason it clarifies that even when a regulation covers the subject matter of a claim,the claim can avoid preemption if the railroad violated a federal standard of care or its internal rule.see b a b 
we therefore conclude that the preemption analysis under the amended frsa requires a process.we first ask whether the defendant allegedly violated either a federal standard of care or an internal rule that was created pursuant to a federal regulation.if so,the plaintiff claim avoids preemption.see b a b.otherwise,we move to the second step and ask whether any federal regulation covers the plaintiff claim.see id.a.a regulation covers and thus preempts the plaintiff claim if it substantially subsume s the subject matter of that claim.easterwood,at noting that the regulation must do more than touch upon or relate to the subject matter.in this step,we rely on precedent including cases that predate the amendment.this approach is consistent with the text of the amended frsa and its history,and is similar to approaches in the eighth and tenth circuits.grade bnsf ry,cir henning,at.
we address each of zimmerman claims in turn.
zimmerman first claim is that norfolk southern negligently failed to warn him of the approaching train.in zimmerman complaint,this claim has at least three parts the train failed to obey the speed limit the train failed to use its light and horn and norfolk southern failed to provide motorists with an adequate view of the track.but zimmerman conceded during oral argument that he lacks evidence that the train failed to use its light and horn,and the duty to provide adequate sight distance is a separate duty,as discussed in part.zimmerman first claim thus boils down to a single claim excessive speed.
zimmerman claim is not preempted because creates a federal standard of care.
railroads have a duty under pennsylvania law to warn motorists of approaching trains.wilson.this duty requires railroads to avoid excessive speeds,since motorists are less likely to see speeding trains,and sight is an important warning method.see id.explaining the relationship between a train speed and its warning and noting that speeding trains have less time to stop see also conner,cir.
norfolk southern allegedly violated this duty by operating its train at more than double the speed limit.a federal regulation establishes the speed limit for each class of tracks ten miles per hour for freight trains on class tracks,miles per hour on class tracks,forty miles per hour on class tracks,and so on.both sides agree that the train was travelling no more than miles per hour when it entered the crossing.zimmerman alleges that the track at the crossing was class,which would mean the train was travelling in excess of the speed limit.norfolk southern responds that the track was class or,which would mean the train was travelling within the limit.
the initial question is whether preempts zimmerman claim.we note at the outset that no other federal court of appeals has considered whether such claims are preempted under the amended frsa provision.before the amendment,the supreme court held that speeding claims are preempted when a train is travelling below the federally mandated speed limit.easterwood,at concluding that the plaintiffs claim was preempted when the train was travelling,at most,fifty miles per hour on tracks with a limit of sixty miles per hour see also waymire norfolk ry,cir relying on easterwood to conclude that an claim was preempted under the frsa when the train was travelling below the speed limit.but easterwood is inapposite here because zimmerman alleges that the train he collided with was travelling above the speed limit.
zimmerman claim avoids preemption if creates a federal standard of care.a regulation creates a standard of care for frsa preemption purposes if it establishes the degree of care that the defendant in most cases,the railroad must exercise.see black law dictionary ed defining standard of care as the degree of care that a reasonable person should exercise see also henning,at concluding there is no federal standard of care if the regulation takes the final authority to decide what action is needed out of the railroad hands internal quotations marks and citations omitted grade,at same.
the minot derailment cases provide a good example of regulations that create a federal standard of care.indeed,at least some members of congress had these cases in mind when amending the frsa.see,at,reprinted in,noting that the goal of the frsa amendment was to rectify the federal court decisions related to the minot,north dakota accident that are in conflict with precedent.the plaintiffs in mehl canadian pacific railway alleged that the railroad had violated a number of regulations,including and,which require railroads to inspect tracks and freight cars.see d.in prescribing how these inspections should be carried out,the regulations create a federal standard of care because they establish the degree of care that railroads must exercise.by contrast,a regulation does not establish a federal standard of care if the state is responsible for compliance.see grade,at concluding that various regulations did not create a federal standard of care because they place the responsibility for implementing adequate warning devices on the state,thereby preempting any cause of action alleging a railroad failed to properly install an adequate warning device.after all,if the state is responsible,railroads can not,as a matter of law,fail to comply with the regulation.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that the speed limits in create a federal standard of care.section establishes the degree of care that railroads must exercise on each class of tracks trains should not exceed ten miles per hour on class tracks,miles per hour on class tracks,and so on.like the regulations in mehl and unlike the regulations in grade,railroads are ultimately responsible for compliance they must ensure that their trains are travelling within the limit.as a result,zimmerman speeding claim is not preempted.because his claim avoids preemption in the first step of the frsa preemption analysis,we need not consider the second step.
the district court improperly excluded eight crossing reports.
zimmerman claim has cleared the preemption hurdle,but it must also clear an evidentiary hurdle.zimmerman acknowledges that the train was travelling within the speed limit for class and class tracks.he alleges,however,that the track was class.there is some evidence to support this allegation.
the record contains two types of documents that help zimmerman crossing reports from the department of transportation national crossing inventory and accident reports from a similar database.the crossing reports state that the speed limit is ten or fifteen miles per hour,and at least some of the accident reports suggest that the track is class.the district court nevertheless excluded these documents based on two evidentiary privileges and.zimmerman argues that the district court misconstrued these privileges.we consider the crossing reports here and the accident reports in the next section.
the national crossing inventory is a database of crossings in the united states.the inventory contains reports on each crossing,which include information such as the number of trains that pass through daily,the typical train speed,and the maximum speed.zimmerman accessed the database and obtained nine reports on the diller avenue crossing the oldest from and the most recent from.the nine reports were submitted to the national inventory by different entities four by the commonwealth of pennsylvania,two by norfolk southern,and two by conrail,the prior owner of the crossing.it is unclear who submitted the initial report.the reports state that the typical train speed over the crossing is five to ten miles per hour and that the maximum time table speed is ten or fifteen miles per hour 
according to these crossing reports,norfolk southern train was travelling too fast at the time of the collision.nevertheless,the district court excluded them based on the privilege created by 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,reports,surveys,schedules,lists,or data compiled or collected for the purpose of identifying,evaluating,or planning the safety enhancement of potential accident sites,hazardous roadway conditions,or crossings,pursuant to sections,and of this title or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing highway funds shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a federal or state court proceeding or considered for other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports,surveys,schedules,lists,or data.
though pleonastically expressed,this statutory privilege clearly has two parts.the first part excludes reports,data,and the like if they were compiled or collected to identify,evaluate,or plan the safety enhancement of potential accident sites,hazardous roadway conditions,or crossings,pursuant to sections,and of title.the second part excludes such documents if they were compiled or collected to develop any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing highway funds.the district court concluded that the crossing reports were privileged under the first part of.
like all evidentiary privileges,we interpret this privilege narrowly.pierce cnty.guillen,d concluding that courts should interpret narrowly because it impede s the search for the truth.moreover,the party invoking an evidentiary privilege has the burden of proof.see in re grand jury investigation,cir a party who asserts a privilege has the burden of proving its existence and applicability.
we begin with the first part of the privilege.both sides agree that the reports from the national crossing inventory were collected to evaluate crossings.they disagree,however,that the reports were collected pursuant to sections,and of title.zimmerman asserts that collection of the reports was not pursuant to any section,while norfolk southern asserts that they were collected pursuant to.
congress passed the federal aid highway act in,stat.the act created the federal railroad administration and imposed various obligations on states that accept federal funds.some of these obligations are now codified in.in particular,subsection d requires states to maintain an inventory of railroad crossings within their borders 
each state shall conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad crossings which may require separation,relocation,or protective devices,and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.at a minimum,such a schedule shall provide signs for all crossings.
d.when it was first passed,the act did not require any federal agency to maintain a national crossing inventory.
despite the absence of a statutory requirement,various federal agencies,state highway departments,and private railroad associations formed a voluntary cooperative effort to create the national crossing inventory.federal railroad administration,dot national highway rail crossing inventory policy,procedures and instructions for states and railroads.manual.railroads and the department of transportation agreed to share the costs,and the federal railroad administration became responsible for maintaining the national inventory.see federal railroad administration,highway rail crossing inventory instructions and procedures manual to,manual.
over the next few decades,states and railroads voluntarily submitted information to the inventory.the submission process changed over time states and railroads sometimes submitted information independently,and railroads sometimes submitted information to states,which then passed it along to the national inventory.compare id.at t he state transportation agency should be the party who forwards all data item changes for any and all crossings to the federal railroad administration.emphasis omitted,with manual at indicating that railroads should send some information directly to the federal railroad administration.many states willingly submitted information to the national inventory because they were able to meet their duty to create a statewide inventory under d by participating in the national inventory.see manual at.
the cooperative effort notwithstanding,gaps remained in the national crossing inventory thirty years later.see letter from norman mineta,sec y of,to dennis hastert,speaker of the house of representatives july.the department of transportation urged congress to pass legislation that would force states and railroads to fill the gaps.id.congress eventually responded by passing the rail safety improvement act of,stat.this act requires states and railroads to independently submit information to the secretary of transportation on a regular basis.significantly,the act codified the submission requirements in separate places the requirement in and the requirement in.
as noted above,the record in this case contains two reports submitted to the national crossing inventory after the passage of the rail safety improvement act in.both were submitted in,one by the commonwealth of pennsylvania,the other by norfolk southern.the question,again,is whether they were collected or compiled pursuant to.
we conclude that after the act,reports are collected pursuant to,but reports are not.as a result,only state reports are privileged under the first part of.our conclusion is textually based states must submit crossing reports to the national inventory under l which references,while railroads must submit under which does not reference.state reports are thus collected pursuant to section,and railroad reports are not.congress could have placed the requirement in alongside the state requirement in that case,railroad reports would be similarly privileged.but congress instead chose to place the requirement in a different title of the united states code.we regard that drafting choice as meaningful.congress may well have had a stronger interest in protecting states,rather than railroads,from litigation.see guillen,at indicating that the primary goal of is to protect state and local governments.whatever the reason,the text is plain.accordingly,the pennsylvania report is privileged under the first part of and the norfolk southern report is not.
the record also contains seven reports submitted prior to the passage of the rail safety improvement act of some submitted by the commonwealth of pennsylvania,others by various railroads including norfolk southern.at first blush,the analysis is straightforward.neither l nor existed before.states and railroads voluntarily participated in the national crossing inventory,so they did not submit reports pursuant to or any other statute.even so,a few factors complicate the analysis.
the first complication is that d has long required states to maintain statewide inventories of railroad crossings.state inventories are thus compiled pursuant to section and so are privileged under.to be sure,the pre reports in this case are from the national inventory.but states presumably rely on their own inventories when submitting reports to the national inventory.it is therefore possible that the pre pennsylvania reports from the national inventory either were originally collected pursuant to or rely on data originally collected pursuant to 
the second complication is that before the act,railroads often submitted crossing reports directly to the states.the states used the railroad reports to create their inventories and then passed them along to the national inventory.see manual at.such railroad reports were thus collected by the states pursuant to section.again,the pre railroad reports in this case are from the national inventory,but it is possible that the commonwealth originally collected these reports to create its own inventory pursuant to d.
these complications raise the following question do reports originally collected pursuant to d and therefore privileged under lose the privilege when voluntarily submitted by a state to the federal government zimmerman contends that the answer is found in guillen.there,the county sheriff prepared an accident report after a deadly car crash.at.the county public works department later acquired the report and used it to apply for funding under,which was one of the statutes listed in at the time.the court concluded that the report was privileged in the hands of the public works department because the department collected it pursuant to.id.at.the court nevertheless concluded that the same report was not privileged in the hands of the sheriff because he did not collect it pursuant to any statute listed in.id.
guillen indicates that the question is whether the immediate source of the documents here,the federal railroad administration collected them pursuant to sections,and of title.but there is one important difference between the case before us and guillen.the pre reports in our case might have been originally collected pursuant to d,whereas the report in guillen was not originally collected pursuant to any statute listed in.see at.the eighth circuit has suggested that this difference is meaningful.see robertson union pac,cir excluding a newspaper article that relied on privileged data to prevent circumvent ing the purpose of the statute.
we need not decide this difficult question.norfolk southern bears the burden of proving that the privilege applies.see in re grand jury investigation,at.and it has failed to show that the seven national reports from before were ever collected pursuant to section.as we have pointed out,it is certainly possible that the reports either were originally collected pursuant to d or relied on data collected pursuant to d.but norfolk southern has offered no evidence that they were,and we construe the available evidence in the light most favorable to zimmerman.as a result,we conclude that the district court improperly excluded the seven pre crossing reports at the stage.
although eight crossing reports are not covered by the first part of the privilege,they will still be inadmissible if they fall within the second part that is,if they were compiled or collected for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing highway funds.we turn to this second part.
there are two plausible interpretations of the relevant language in.the broad interpretation is that a report was collected for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project if the agency collected the report with the understanding that someone might use it to improve highway safety in a later construction project the narrow interpretation is that a report was collected for the statutory purpose if the agency collected it with the intent to use it for a particular construction project.in short,the broad interpretation would privilege any document that was collected to improve highway safety such as reports in a database while the narrow interpretation would privilege only those documents that were collected for a particular project.
we follow the supreme court example and adopt the narrow interpretation.see guillen,at noting two plausible interpretations of a separate clause in and adopting the narrower view.first,statutes establishing evidentiary privileges must be construed narrowly because privileges impede the search for the truth.id see also in re grand jury investigation,at recognizing the general constructional rule that evidentiary privileges should be narrowly construed.
furthermore,the narrow interpretation is more faithful to the text.the broad interpretation renders much of redundant if the second part privileges any document that might be used to improve highway safety in a later construction project,there would be no need for the first part to privilege documents compiled or collected for the purpose of identifying,evaluating,or planning the safety enhancement of potential accident sites,hazardous roadway conditions,or crossings.after all,these specific purposes all deal with information that might be used to improve safety in a later project.so every document that is privileged under the first part would also be privileged under the second part.we eschew the broad interpretation to avoid redundancy.see gustafson alloyd,d t he court will avoid a reading which renders some words altogether redundant.ki se lee ashcroft,cir recognizing the goal of avoiding surplusage in construing a statute.
and the privilege uses different verbs in the first and second parts identifying,evaluating,or planning in the first and developing in the second.the first part seems to privilege documents that deal with both potential and actual projects,while the second part appears to privilege only those documents that deal with actual projects.or to put it another way,the second part privileges documents prepared when the agency already has a construction project in mind and not simply documents that might be used to plan later projects.
we conclude that the second part of excludes only those documents that were collected for a particular construction project.here,there is no indication that the diller avenue reports were collected for a particular project instead,they were collected to establish a national database that might be used in future projects.the second part of does not apply.
in sum,zimmerman has nine crossing reports that suggest the norfolk southern train was going too fast when it entered the diller avenue crossing.the district court excluded all nine reports under.it should,however,have excluded only the pennsylvania report.we now consider zimmerman other evidence of excessive speed.
the district court improperly excluded nine accident reports.
zimmerman obtained ten department of transportation accident reports.the reports cover accidents that occurred at the diller avenue crossing over the past few decades,from a minor collision in to zimmerman crash in.the reports describe the conditions of the accident weather,number of injuries,time of day,and so on.and they list the classification of the track at the crossing four reports state that the track was class,one that it was class,and five all from the that it was class.the ten reports provide at least mixed evidence that the crossing was class and thus that the norfolk southern train was speeding.even so,the district court excluded the reports based on another evidentiary privilege that contained in this statute states in part 
no part of an accident or incident report filed by a railroad carrier under section of title may be used in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report.
the parties agree that the accident reports were filed by a railroad carrier under.but zimmerman argues that the privilege excludes only the report of his accident,not the nine other reports.his argument is textual the privilege does not exclude accident reports from all civil cases.it merely excludes reports from civil cases that result from a matter mentioned in the report.in zimmerman view,his civil action for damages arose from the accident mentioned in his report,but it did not arise from the accidents mentioned in the remaining nine reports.we agree that these reports fall outside the privilege.
norfolk southern urges us to broadly interpret the term matter.in norfolk southern view,matter mentioned in the report does not simply mean the accident mentioned in the report,as zimmerman implicitly argues.it also means the location mentioned in the report.the privilege therefore excludes all ten reports,since zimmerman lawsuit is a civil action for damages resulting from a matter or location,the diller avenue crossing mentioned in the report s.this argument is unpersuasive because norfolk southern takes the word matter completely out of context.the phrase damages resulting from appears directly before the word matter,indicating that a matter is the event that caused the harm discussed in the report.see lee passenger amtrak,cv,wl,at,holding that does not apply to prior accident reports at the same crossing.we conclude that excludes the report of zimmerman accident but not the nine other reports.
norfolk southern also argues that the privilege excludes the accident reports.again,the privilege has two parts.the first part excludes reports collected to identify,evaluate,or plan the safety enhancement of potential accident sites,hazardous roadway conditions,or crossings,pursuant to sections,and of title.this part plainly does not apply because the accident reports were collected pursuant to not pursuant to any section of title.
the second part of excludes reports if they were collected to develop any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing highway funds.as we concluded above,the language excludes only those documents that were collected for a particular construction project.like the reports in the national crossing inventory,accident reports are collected for a variety of reasons.one reason is to provide data for future safety projects.in most cases,however,accident reports are not collected for a particular construction project.nor does norfolk southern point to any evidence that the diller avenue accident reports were collected for a particular project.therefore,nine of the ten accident reports are admissible.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that most of the crossing reports and accident reports are admissible.these reports suggest that the speed limit at the crossing was ten miles per hour or,equivalently,that the track was class.that said,zimmerman claim is far from a.other evidence suggests that the track was class or class.norfolk southern claims that it reclassified the track but failed to update the crossing reports.this claim is consistent with the accident reports the most recent reports list the track as class or class.but acceptance or rejection of norfolk southern explanation is the province of a jury.for now,the conflicting evidence results in zimmerman claim surviving summary judgment.
zimmerman alternative claim of track misclassification is preempted.
zimmerman advances an alternative argument.if the track was in fact classified as class or class,zimmerman claims that norfolk southern should be liable for misclassification.according to zimmerman,the limited sight distance imposed a duty on norfolk southern to classify the track as class or higher.
the first question and,as it turns out,the only question is whether zimmerman alternative claim avoids preemption.zimmerman argues that norfolk southern violated a federal standard of care.see b a.he points to pt,which contains regulations for each class of tracks.but none of the regulations discuss track visibility.zimmerman curiously cites two regulations that have nothing to do with visibility.see setting standards for control circuits,regulating the activation of warning systems.he also points to a regulation in title that mentions the term sight distance.e.but this regulation merely states that a flashing signal might be necessary if the sight distance is unusually restricted.it does not require railroads to select a track class based on sight distance nor does any regulation establish the sight distance necessary for each track class.quite simply,no relevant federal standard of care exists.
despite the absence of a federal standard of care,zimmerman may still avoid preemption if his claim falls outside the scope of the original frsa preemption provision.see a.as we have previously made clear,state claims are within the scope of this provision if federal regulations cover or substantially subsume the subject matter of the claims.strozyk,at citing a easterwood,at.the regulations must do more than touch upon or relate to that subject matter.easterwood,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the regulations in pt.subsume zimmerman misclassification claim.these regulations establish varying requirements for each class of everything from gage,alinement,and elevation,to crossties,curve speed,and rail joints.see explaining the proper method for measuring gage,creating alinement standards,establishing the maximum speed based on track elevation and curvature,requiring more crossties for higher track classes,noting that rail joints must be of a structurally sound design.
the regulations are part of a broad scheme to standardize railroad tracks.admittedly,there is no regulation that classifies tracks based on sight distance.but the breadth of the scheme implies a decision not to classify on that basis.at the very least,it implies that the federal government did not want states to decide how tracks would be classified.we doubt that the federal government would create a detailed system with the expectation that states would impose extra classification requirements especially given the risk that the requirements would vary from state to state.this regulatory scheme preempts zimmerman misclassification claim.
zimmerman second claim is that norfolk southern failed to maintain a safe crossing area.as before,we must address the threshold question of preemption.we then consider whether zimmerman produced sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment.
zimmerman claim of failure to maintain a safe crossing area is not preempted.
zimmerman makes two allegations in support of his claim.the first is that norfolk southern negligently maintained the crossing devices at diller avenue in particular,the sign that warned of the approaching crossing was covered by tree branches,the pavement markings no longer existed,and the crossbucks had been allowed to fall into disrepair.appellant br.at.zimmerman second allegation is that norfolk southern failed to provide adequate sight distance 
strozyk is directly on point.there,we considered a claim for wrongful death resulting from a crash at a railroad crossing.at.the decedent estate alleged that the railroad had failed to keep the crossing safe.we interpreted what is now subsection a of the frsa preemption provision and explained that a railroad may still be liable for other negligent conduct,such as the failure to maintain a working crossing arm id.at quoting evans timber cent.of,see also terrell soo line r,cv,wl,at,noting that preemption would improperly insulate railroads even if the crossbucks had fallen to the ground and were unobservable by a passing motorist.we also concluded that b does not preempt claims,even though the regulation mentions unusually restricted sight distance as a factor that might require states to install flashing lights.we reasoned that the plain language of the regulation indicates that the subject matter is the adequacy of warning devices,not the considerations involved in choosing them or state negligence law more broadly the bare mention of conditions such as sight distance does not indicate an intent to regulate those conditions.strozyk,at.
the frsa amendment did not supersede strozyk and thus both parts of zimmerman claim avoid preemption.see id.at the plantiffs claims that the defendant failed to maintain a safe grade crossing and relatedly failed to ensure clear sight lines of oncoming trains are not preempted.even if strozyk were not binding,zimmerman allegation would avoid preemption because creates a federal standard of care governing the maintenance of crossbucks.b a see each sign mounted on a grade crossing signal post shall be maintained in good condition and be visible to the highway user,indicating that railroads are responsible for maintaining signs under 
zimmerman produced sufficient evidence that norfolk southern failed to maintain the crossing devices and that the sight distance was inadequate.
the district court agreed that at least part of zimmerman second claim avoided preemption.the court nevertheless granted summary judgment on his entire claim,concluding that he had failed to satisfy the elements of negligence.in particular,the court concluded that norfolk southern did not have a duty to remove a privately owned building that potentially obscure s sight lines.zimmerman norfolk,cv,wl,at.zimmerman argues that the district court ignored his allegation and misconstrued pennsylvania law on the question of sight distance.we agree with zimmerman both parts of his second claim survive summary judgment.
we first consider zimmerman allegation that the warnings had fallen into disrepair.the elements of negligence are,of course,duty,breach,causation,and damages.under pennsylvania law,railroads have a duty to maintain railroad warning devices.geelen,a railroad company is under a duty to maintain a public crossing in a state of good repair.see also conner,at stating that under pennsylvania law,a railroad might be liable for failing to maintain crossing devices buchecker reading,considering evidence that the signal was not operating at the time of the accident 
according to zimmerman,norfolk southern breached this duty because the sign that warned of the approaching crossing was covered by tree branches,the pavement markings no longer existed,and the crossbucks had been allowed to fall into disrepair.appellant br.at.viewed in the light most favorable to zimmerman,the record supports these allegations.
photographs suggest that there once was a white line north of the crossing,but that the line had faded by the time of zimmerman collision.see,other photographs indicate that tree branches covered both the crossbuck and the yellow advanced warning sign.for example,a photograph shows that tree branches covered the yellow warning sign although the picture is too dark and grainy to be conclusive.see id.and a series of photographs from show that a tree standing next to the warning sign partially obscures the crossbuck at least from the perspective of someone who is more than feet away.see id.at,both parties cite an expert statement that tree branches covered the crossbuck,see appellant br.at citing appellee br.at same,but the expert report mysteriously contains no such statement.either way,a reasonable jury could accept zimmerman narrative based on the photographs.
norfolk southern also argues that there is insufficient evidence of causation.darkness had fallen by the time zimmerman began riding home.he may well have hit the train even if the obscuring branches had been pruned and the white line had been repainted.yet in his deposition,zimmerman said that he had crossed the track many times before the accident and that he believed the crossing was inactive.i did not know that that track had a regular train on it.i have never seen a train on that track i certainly was expecting to my knowledge,it was an unused track.from this testimony and from the other evidence that the crossing was poorly maintained it is reasonable to infer that state of disrepair at least contributed to his belief that the crossing was inactive.see intervest,bloomberg,cir when analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence,the court must view the facts and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.as a result,it is also reasonable to infer that on the night of the accident,he approached the crossing with less caution than he otherwise would have.
we now turn to the allegation that norfolk southern failed to provide adequate sight distance.this allegation also survives summary judgment.under pennsylvania law,railroads have a duty to ensure that motorists are able to see approaching trains.see fallon penn cent.transp.the district court cited our opinion in strozyk and concluded that the duty merely requires railroads to remove excess vegetation,as there is no duty to modify or remove a privately owned building which is located off the railroad right of way.zimmerman,cv,wl,at citing strozyk,at.
but pennsylvania courts have held that the duty extends well beyond the removal of vegetation.in johnson,a motorist view was obstructed by buildings,utility poles,and a hedge.the pennsylvania supreme court concluded 
a railroad company may,in some instances have no choice as to location of crossings,but where,as here,physical conditions visually blanket the speeding train until several short seconds before it sweeps,like a steel and iron tornado,into a crossing,a due responsibility for the safety of mankind dictates that something be done to alert the public of the omnipresent danger 
id.at.in fallon,the pennsylvania supreme court found sufficient evidence of negligence where the plaintiffs view was obstructed by a building.at.according to the court,it was difficult if not impossible to gain an adequate view of the track without putting one car in or dangerously close to the swath of an oncoming train.id see also buchecker,at i t is proper for the jury to take into consideration the physical conditions at the crossing and the nature of the surroundings.citing cummings.to be sure,no pennsylvania court has expressly held that railroads have a clear duty to modify private buildings.but cases such as johnson and fallon have indicated that the jury should consider privately owned buildings when deciding whether the railroad breached its duty to provide adequate sight distance.
we conclude that the building in this case is relevant in deciding whether norfolk southern provided adequate sight distance.the jury can decide whether norfolk southern should have asked the building owner to remove a sign that was along diller avenue.norfolk southern even had a policy for doing so if an obstruction is located off the,the owners of the land containing the obstruction should be contacted personally and an appeal made to the landowner to remove the obstruction.the personal contact should be followed up with a letter,with a copy to the appropriate state agency.if the appeal fails,the matter should be referred to the law department for guidance,id,presumably to decide whether to use eminent domain under.allowing public utility corporations such as railroads to use eminent domain.
the jury can also decide whether norfolk southern should have enlisted the help of the commonwealth or used eminent domain.and if the jury decides that norfolk southern breached its duty,norfolk southern policy and.might be evidence of causation.they suggest that norfolk southern could have improved conditions at the crossing in a way that would have prevented the accident 
zimmerman second claim is far from overwhelming the evidence of disrepair is conflicting,and it is unclear whether norfolk southern inaction caused the sight distance to remain inadequate.all the same,we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to zimmerman.there is sufficient evidence of each element to allow the claim to go forward.
zimmerman third and final claim is that norfolk southern was negligent per se for violating various requirements in b in particular,subsection b i states that crossings with limited sight distance and high train speeds must have adequate warning devices,defined in the statute as automatic gates and flashing lights.and subsection b states that all traffic control devices must comply with the manual on uniform traffic control devices.zimmerman asserts that norfolk southern violated both provisions.the district court decided that the claim was preempted.
we agree that zimmerman third claim is preempted.for starters,neither regulation creates a federal standard of care.see b a.we analyze the regulations separately.subsection b i c states 
adequate warning devices on any project where funds participate in the installation of the devices are to include automatic gates with flashing light signals when the following conditions exist high speed train operation combined with limited sight distance at either single or multiple track crossings.
zimmerman argues that subsection b creates a federal standard of care one that requires norfolk southern to install automatic gates and flashing lights because the sight distance at the diller avenue crossing is limited.
the eighth and tenth circuits have rejected similar arguments.see grade,at concluding that b and preempt claims against railroads for installing inadequate warning devices at railroad crossings henning,at same.subsection b does not impose on railroads an ongoing,it displace s state and private decisionmaking authority.henning,at quoting easterwood,at internal quotation marks omitted.more importantly,subsection b place s the responsibility for implementing adequate warning devices on the state,thereby preempting any cause of action alleging a railroad failed to properly install an adequate warning device.grade at.railroads can not,as a matter of law,fail to comply with subsection b.id.quoting henning,at.
we find this reasoning persuasive.the commonwealth of pennsylvania installed crossbucks at the diller avenue crossing with the use of federal funds and the help of the crossing previous owner.norfolk southern,as the current owner,has a duty to maintain the crossing devices.see strozyk,at.but the commonwealth is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the devices comply with subsection b.as a result,subsection b does not impose on norfolk southern a federal standard of care.
the same is true of subsection b.zimmerman tries to avoid grade and henning by asserting that norfolk southern also violated subsection b 
all traffic control devices proposed shall comply with the latest edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways supplemented to the extent applicable by state standards.
zimmerman argues that subsection b imposes on railroads an ongoing duty to update their crossing devices.norfolk southern violated this supposed duty by failing to update the crossbucks to comply with the latest manual on uniform traffic control devices.this argument is inconsistent with the text,which requires that proposed devices not already existing devices comply with the manual.moreover,subsection b is part of the same scheme as subsection b.both subsections create rules that states must obey to receive federal funds.neither imposes on railroads a standard of care.
absent a federal standard,zimmerman can avoid preemption only if there are no federal regulations that cover the subject matter of his claim.a.unfortunately for zimmerman,the supreme court has already concluded that subsections b and b cover the subject matter of such claims.see shanklin,at citing easterwood,at.these regulations are preemptive because they displace state and private decisionmaking authority by establishing a requirement that certain protective devices be installed or federal approval obtained.easterwood,at.zimmerman tries to escape preemption by citing the supreme court statement that subsection b does not state tort actions.shanklin,at.but this language does not save zimmerman claim subsections b and b clearly preempt his claim.it is of no consequence whether subsection b does the same.
zimmerman is unable to avoid preemption by asserting that norfolk southern installed the wrong warning devices even though he was able to avoid preemption by asserting that norfolk southern failed to maintain them.see supra part.while it may seem that this scheme is internally inconsistent,it is nonetheless the scheme congress has established.
accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on zimmerman first and second claims but affirm its grant of summary judgment on zimmerman third claim.
robert zimmerman appeals from an order of the district court,which granted norfolk southern corporation motion for summary judgment.he had filed a civil complaint against norfolk southern corporation norfolk southern in the district court seeking damages for injuries sustained when he abruptly applied his motorcycle brakes at a railroad crossing and flew over the motorcycle handlebars,colliding with the side of a lead train engine proceeding over the crossing.he bottomed his personal injury claim against the railroad on negligent failure to warn of an approaching train negligent failure to maintain a safe grade crossing area and negligence per se for violating various portions of b adequate warning devices.i would affirm the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in its entirety.
accordingly,i join that portion of the majority opinion that affirms the district court determination that zimmerman negligence per se claim,set forth above as the third issue,is preempted.i concur also in the majority approach to analyzing the federal railroad safety act frsa preemption provision,codified at.i am unable to agree with the majority reversal of the judgment on the two other issues presented to us.i therefore join parts ii and iii c of the majority opinion and dissent as to parts iii a and 
on the evening of june,robert zimmerman was operating his motorcycle southward on diller avenue in new holland,pennsylvania.he was wearing a helmet with a visor and was familiar with the diller avenue railroad crossing because he had traveled down diller avenue and through the crossing hundreds of times before this incident.app.at approximately that evening,two locomotives owned by norfolk southern engine and engine approached diller avenue.the engineer,douglas eppley,and the conductor,stephen romberger,were stationed in the head of the lead locomotive,engine.as the train entered the diller avenue crossing,zimmerman,who had been traveling on his motorcycle approximately to miles per hour,abruptly applied his brakes and flew over the handlebars of his motorcycle.his body struck the side of the fuel tank portion of the lead engine.as a result of the collision,zimmerman sustained extensive injuries and was airlifted to lancaster general hospital.he was subsequently transferred to a rehabilitation center,where he remained until his discharge in october.he was left partially paralyzed.
norfolk southern operates the railroad crossing at diller avenue.the crossing protects southbound motorists with a on the side of the road in accordance with the manual on uniform traffic control devices mutcd.this was a reflectorized crossbuck installed in.norfolk southern also placed a crossing sign approximately feet north of the crossing.the company neither possesses nor controls any land or property in the vicinity of the diller avenue crossing other than its.
train conductor romberger was positioned in the lead locomotive of a train.positioned on the left side,he saw the motorcycle approaching when zimmerman was approximately feet from the crossing,and he realized that,given zimmerman speed,he was going to collide with us.app.zimmerman body collided with the fuel tank of the lead engine of the train approximately feet from its front leading edge.the crossing is only feet wide.the lead engine,therefore,was already through the crossing at the time zimmerman collided with the train.
zimmerman has no present recollection of the incident two independent witnesses,seth huyard and chad kaufman,who were traveling in a truck approximately feet behind zimmerman on diller avenue,both heard the train blowing its horn as they approached the railroad crossing.app.huyard,the truck driver,stated that as the train entered the intersection the motorcycle rider appeared to apply his front brake causing him to go over the handlebars.app.kaufman,who was riding in the truck,saw the train cross diller avenue.he then saw the motorcycle go into the side of the train.app.
at the time of the collision,each locomotive was equipped with a digital recording device,known as an event data recorder edr,which recorded information such as speed and horn activation.according to the edr,the train was traveling at approximately miles per hour at the time of the collision.the edr also recorded that the train horn was activated beginning at a point of approximately mile prior to the crossing and continued through the crossing,sounding for a total of seconds.
on may,zimmerman filed a civil complaint against norfolk southern.on march,norfolk southern filed a motion for summary judgment,which the court granted on august.zimmerman timely appealed.
in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment,we exercise plenary review.see gallo city of,cir.we apply the same test as a district court applies,see waldorf shuta,cir,and will affirm if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,rule a,federal rules of civil procedure.facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.see monroe beard,cir citation omitted.
zimmerman offers a number of reasons in support of his contention that the district court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment.he asserts that his claims of negligence based on inadequate signals and excessive speed are not preempted.he contends also that the district court erred in finding that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to his claims of negligence based on a duty the railroad owed to maintain a reasonably safe crossing and provide adequate sight distance.finally,he argues that the district court erred in holding that certain documents,relevant to his excessive speed allegation,were privileged.for the reasons that follow,i would affirm the district court judgment.
i would conclude that the district court properly held that zimmerman claims of negligence based on inadequate signals and excessive speed are preempted.with regard to zimmerman claims that norfolk southern failed to maintain a reasonably safe crossing and provide adequate sight distance,i would furthermore conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of norfolk southern,because zimmerman failed to establish a prima facie claim of negligence and therefore no genuine issue of material fact exists.finally,i would conclude that the court correctly held that the documents related to his excessive speed allegation were privileged.summary judgment was therefore appropriate and,as stated heretofore,i would affirm the entire district court judgment.
for part of his negligence claims,zimmerman alleges that norfolk southern failed to maintain a safe crossing at diller avenue.he alleges that the railroad negligently maintained the crossing devices,and that the railroad failed to provide adequate sight distance,thereby preventing him from seeing the train that he struck until it was too late for him to avoid the collision.we have long recognized that railroads have a duty to provide a safe crossing,including adequate sight distances.see strozyk norfolk,cir a railroad must exercise ordinary care at a crossing by adopting a reasonably safe and effective method,commensurate with the dangers of a particular crossing,of warning travelers of the approach of the train.quoting freight se.transp,aff,cir.indeed,where physical conditions visually blanket the speeding train until several short seconds before it sweeps into a crossing,a due responsibility for the safety of mankind dictates that something be done to alert the public above that of asking it to stop,look,and listen.johnson.
at the same time,a motorist planning to drive through a crossing is required to respect the common law of pennsylvania and the relevant statutes of that state.thus,upon the sounding of the train horn,zimmerman had to obey the following provisions of.a 
whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing the driver of the vehicle shall stop within feet but not less than feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until it can be done safely.the foregoing requirement shall apply upon the occurrence of the following circumstance 
a railroad train approaching within approximately feet of the highway crossing emits a signal audible from that distance and the railroad train,by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing,is a hazard.
moreover,ruling case law of pennsylvania teaches 
when a motorist approaches a railroad crossing that is occupied by a train,whether the train is traveling or stationary,the only duties involved are those of the motorist,namely 
to stop,look and listen before entering upon the crossing.
krentz consol.rail,emphasis added citing hogg bessemer lake erie.
krentz was the pennsylvania supreme court latest application of the venerable occupied crossing rule,which is as securely affixed to pennsylvania jurisprudence as train tracks are to the land that they traverse.krentz,at.under that rule,a railroad company can not ordinarily be found negligent because it failed to station guards or light the car,or otherwise give warning of its presence in the highway,id.quoting cella,and this rule applies regardless of whether the train is moving or stationary,id.at,citing cella,at.the train presence in the crossing is sufficient notice of its presence to warn any person using the highway with ordinary care.id.at.
the duty to stop,look and listen before entering a crossing,particularly a crossing that is occupied,is best expressed by the pennsylvania supreme court statement in serfas lehigh and,the plaintiff openly violated the inflexible rule requiring the traveler to stop,look,and listen before entering upon a railroad track it is not a rule of evidence,but a rule of law,peremptory,absolute and unbending and the jury can never be permitted to ignore it,to evade it,or to pare it away by distinctions and exceptions.quoting.aiken.
the occupied crossing rule has a long history in the commonwealth of pennsylvania,dating back to the court opinion in everetts,per curiam.although the rule arose during the era of contributory negligence,it has survived the adoption of the comparative negligence doctrine in pennsylvania.see krentz,at stating that the enactment of the comparative negligence act does not change the well established rule that negligence can not be found where the law does not impose a duty quoting sprenkel consol.rail.
zimmerman allegation that the crossing devices were negligently maintained is a failure to warn claim.he argues that norfolk southern breached a duty to maintain railroad warning devices because the sign that warned of the approaching crossing was covered by tree branches,the pavement markings no longer existed,and the crossbucks had been allowed to fall into disrepair.brief of appellant.because he contends that the railroad failed to warn him of the danger at the crossing,we must determine whether any duty to warn was in fact owed to him by the railroad given the circumstances of the accident.see krentz,at.
zimmerman,upon reaching the grade crossing,abruptly applied his brakes and flew over the handlebars of his motorcycle,striking a moving train.that moving train occupied the crossing at the time he struck it,triggering application of the occupied crossing rule.as stated previously,a motorist approaching an occupied crossing has the duty to stop,look,and listen before entering the crossing the railroad has no duty to warn of an occupied crossing.id.as the krentz court notes in a footnote,railroads do in fact have a duty to warn of approaching trains.id.at.here,however,the lead engine already occupied the crossing at the time zimmerman struck it.he struck the train at a point approximately feet from the front of its lead engine,at a crossing that is only feet wide.this is neither a matter of contributory nor comparative negligence rather,zimmerman can not maintain his negligent maintenance of crossing devices claim because norfolk southern had no duty to warn of an occupied crossing 
zimmerman inadequate sight distance claim is also,at its core,a failure to warn claim.an adequate sight distance is one means of providing motorists with warning that a train is approaching.here,as with the negligent maintenance of crossing devices allegation,zimmerman can not maintain his inadequate sight distance claim because the train that zimmerman struck occupied the crossing,triggering application of the occupied crossing rule.
this issue is not controlled by controverted facts but by fundamental precepts of negligence,under which a plaintiff must first establish that a defendant does in fact have a duty.here,application of the occupied crossing rule would compel us to hold that summary judgment was appropriate because the railroad had no duty to warn of the presence of the train that occupied the crossing at diller avenue.nevertheless,to address the specific points made by the majority,i now turn to the duties to maintain a safe crossing and provide adequate sight distances.
i would hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of norfolk southern because,even assuming that the railroad owed duties to zimmerman under the circumstances of the accident,no genuine issue of material fact exists as to those duties.
the district court noted that the third circuit in strozyk held that b only preempts claims regarding the adequacy of warning devices,and does not preempt the duty to maintain a safe grade crossing.app.the court explained that railroads continue to have the duty to provide a reasonably safe grade crossing,such as the duty to keep visibility at grade crossings free from obstructions.id.quoting strozyk,at.i,along with the majority,agree with the district court conclusion that this claim was not preempted.although the claim was not preempted,the district court nevertheless granted norfolk southern motion for summary judgment because zimmerman had not made a prima facie claim for negligence.the court determined that zimmerman failed to establish that norfolk southern had a duty to remove a privately owned building,located off of the railroad,that potentially obscured sight lines and negligently failed to maintain a reasonably safe crossing.accordingly,the district court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that summary judgment was appropriate.whereas the majority states that t here is sufficient evidence of each element to allow the claim to go forward,majority opinion,i disagree and would hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment.
in determining whether summary judgment was appropriate here,i must therefore determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists as to norfolk southern duties of care.
to establish a prima facie case for negligence under the theory that norfolk southern failed to maintain a reasonably safe crossing by negligently maintaining the crossing devices and failing to provide adequate sight distance,zimmerman had to adduce facts that demonstrate a duty or obligation recognized by law a breach of that duty a causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss suffered by him.see rooney city of,d.
zimmerman asserts that norfolk southern allowed the warnings at the diller avenue crossing to fall into disrepair,breaching its duty to maintain warning devices at the crossing.according to the majority,the record supports his allegations that the warning sign was covered by tree branches,that pavement markings no longer existed,and that the crossbucks had been permitted to fall into disrepair.majority opinion.with regard to the tree branches,zimmerman has failed to put forth competent evidence demonstrating that the foliage blocked his view of the advance warning sign on the day of the accident.curiously,the majority points to photographs taken in to support the proposition that tree branches blocked the view of the warning sign in at the time of the accident.the only competent evidence of the condition of the foliage near the time of the accident is set forth at pages of the appendix.from these photographs,taken the day after the accident,it appears that the foliage did not block the advanced warning sign.see app.picture taken feet north of the crossing.even if we were to use the photographs taken in,the advanced warning sign does not appear to be obscured by foliage from at least as far as feet north of the crossing.
the majority refers to tree branches covering the crossbucks,but zimmerman assertion regarding the crossbucks is that they were in disrepair,not that they too were covered by foliage.as to this assertion,he likewise has offered no competent evidence that the crossbucks were in disrepair at the time of the accident.finally,although the majority has determined that p hotographs suggest there once was a white line north of the crossing,but that the line had faded by the time of the accident,majority opinion,i conclude that there is no competent evidence to support this proposition.i agree that there does not appear to have been a painted line north of the crossing in,judging from the photographs taken one day after the accident.interpreting facts in the light most favorable to zimmerman,however,does not require us to decide that evidence of fresh paint in means that the lines existed at some point prior to the accident,but later faded such that they needed repainting.
the majority rejects norfolk southern causation argument,but here it has misconstrued zimmerman own testimony regarding the impact of his many crossings at the diller avenue crossing.according to the majority,in his deposition,zimmerman said that he had crossed the track many times before the accident and that he believed the crossing was inactive.majority opinion citing app.the majority states also that from zimmerman testimony,combined with evidence of poor maintenance of the crossing,it is reasonable to infer that state of disrepair at least contributed to his belief that the crossing was inactive.id.at.however,a closer reading of the cited portions of zimmerman deposition testimony is instructive.zimmerman stated,i did not know that that track had a regular train on it.i have never seen a train on that track,and so i do know what when i would have actually looked to see if a train was coming.i certainly was expecting to my knowledge,it was an unused track.app.later,he stated i mean,like i said,i never expected to see a train there.app.zimmerman now wishes to recharacterize his reason for believing that the crossing was inactive to be the result of norfolk southern failure to maintain warning devices.his deposition testimony makes it clear,however,that he believed the crossing was inactive because he had never seen a train on that track,over his years in the area and hundreds of trips down diller avenue.
accordingly,i would hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on the negligent failure to maintain crossing devices portion of zimmerman failure to maintain a safe crossing claim.
next,zimmerman contends that norfolk southern negligently failed to maintain a safe crossing when it failed to remove an obstruction,even though the obstruction was not located on the railroad.indeed,norfolk southern neither possessed nor controlled any land beyond its narrow in the area of the diller avenue crossing.although he relies on fallon penn cent.transp,to support his contention that norfolk southern had a duty to remove the building,the teachings of fallon do not support this position.that case states that railroads have a special duty of care towards those who use a crossing with a dangerously limited view,and that duty is to regulate the running of its trains as to make it possible for a driver to cross the tracks in safety if,when just before entering upon them,he stopped,looked and listened,and no train was within sight or sound.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the majority,paraphrasing fallon,states broadly that under pennsylvania law,railroads have a duty to ensure that motorists are able to see approaching trains.majority opinion.as is clear from the emphasized language above,this is an incomplete statement of the law.
the stop,look and listen rule,like the occupied crossing rule,has a long history in pennsylvania.in briach,cir,this court traced the origins of the stop,look and listen rule,noting that d evelopment of the stop,look and listen doctrine originated over a century ago,in the case of reeves,lackawanna,where the court determined that a traveler on a public highway is bound to stop and look out for trains.briach,at.later cases held that failure to stop and look constituted negligence per se,and the requirement to listen was added to the rule in.id.at.by,the pennsylvania supreme court stated that the duty to stop,look and listen was an unbending rule of law and failure to comply with any one of the three absolutes constituted negligence as a matter of law.id.at quoting.beale.by,this court noted that recent case law from the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed and utilized the stop,look and listen rule.id.
all of these cases,as well as briach,the legislature adoption of the comparative negligence act.however,like the occupied crossing rule,the common law stop,look,and listen rule has survived the legislature abolishment of contributory negligence.krentz,at.although under the comparative negligence act a plaintiff failure to stop,look and listen no longer constitutes an absolute bar to recovery in all cases,here the obligation is embedded within the railroad duty to provide an adequate sight distance.the special duty under fallon,which is triggered when a dangerously limited view exists,requires a railroad to make it possible for a driver to safely cross the tracks if that driver stops,looks and listens,and no train is within sight or sound.
at a crossing with a dangerously limited view,a railroad is only required to regulate the running of its trains to make safe crossing possible for drivers who stop,look and listen.this is not to say that zimmerman can not recover because he did not stop,look and listen i would hold that where a plaintiff can not show that a railroad violated its duty under fallon that is,the duty to run its trains in a manner that makes it safe for a driver to cross tracks after stopping,looking and listening for trains summary judgment is appropriate.based on the record,zimmerman presented no evidence to establish that norfolk southern violated its special duty under fallon.
the record before us shows that the lead engine headlight was on full and the horn had been blowing for of a mile,or seconds,such that two people traveling feet behind zimmerman could hear the horn as the train approached the diller avenue crossing.zimmerman does not,and can not,maintain that he stopped,looked and listened prior to crossing the tracks or that,even if he had,he would have nonetheless been harmed.he has represented that he has no present recollection of the events concerning his approach to the crossing and the collision.not a whit of evidence was provided that he complied with the venerable stop,look and listen precepts of pennsylvania law.moreover,no contention is presented by brief or oral argument that he did so.
it must be noted that the requirement to stop,look and listen is not abrogated merely because the motorist view is obstructed at one point but not another.see benner phila.ry,it is further argued that plaintiff was relieved from the obligation to stop because of the obstructions which prevented his view before crossing but,if this be true,another duty was imposed upon him.it was his duty to alight and go to a point where he could make a proper observation.zimmerman admitted that he could have seen the approaching train when he was within less than forty feet of the crossing.app.but,when he came to that point where he could have seen the train,he did not stop,look and listen,as required by pennsylvania law.he now asks us to hold the railroad at fault for his own failure to follow the law.i would not do so.zimmerman offered no evidence that he had obeyed a fundamental maxim of the law formidably designed to prevent him from crashing into the side of a passing train.accordingly,no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether norfolk southern met its duty of care.
i conclude therefore that no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding norfolk southern maintenance of the diller avenue crossing.
notwithstanding my conclusion that zimmerman failed to establish a prima facie claim of negligence under state law,he asserts that a claim was nevertheless made,and thus a genuine issue of material fact exists,based on the railroad violation of its internal policy to contact landowners with obstructions located off of the railroad,which was created pursuant to federal regulation.see b b.this argument is unpersuasive.he contends that the railroad policy regarding sight obstructions was issued pursuant to,and.these regulations,however,do not require railroads to create specific policies but merely require a railroad to keep copies of its operating rules and timetables,see,and to keep records of its program of instruction to help employees learn the railroad operating rules,see.section merely states that the regulations provide minimum requirements and that railroads are free to prescribe more stringent rules.he has failed to identify any regulation requiring norfolk southern to adopt the alleged policy at issue.
furthermore,nothing in creates a private right of action for a railroad failure to comply with any internal policy which it created and which was not otherwise created pursuant to a federal regulation.zimmerman broad interpretation of,such that norfolk southern internal policy was created pursuant to a regulation,is not supported by the statute text.as the district court properly noted,s uch an interpretation would discourage railroads from otherwise implementing internal policies in order to avoid additional duties of care.app.
i conclude,therefore,that although the duty to maintain a safe crossing area including the duties to maintain crossing devices and to provide adequate sight distance is not preempted by federal law,the district court nevertheless properly granted summary judgment as to this claim because zimmerman failed to establish a prima facie claim that the railroad breached its duty.
the majority elects not to confront the critical pennsylvania stop,look and listen rule,stating 
the district court explicitly refrained from deciding whether zimmerman was negligent.zimmerman,wl at i do not need to consider defendant additional arguments that plaintiff was comparatively negligent by failing to comply with pennsylvania law.and neither side has addressed the question of zimmerman negligence on appeal.we therefore refuse to affirm on these grounds.
majority opinion.
the majority position requires special attention.first,stop,look and listen is language that appears in more than one place and for more than one reason it is used not only to impose a duty on motorists,see.a,but also to limit the duty owed by railroads,see fallon penn cent.transp.i do not affirm the district court judgment on the ground that zimmerman was negligent,but on the ground that even if we accept as true all zimmerman has alleged in connection to his claim,he can not establish that the railroad breached its limited common law duty to regulate the running of its trains as to make it possible for a driver to cross the tracks in safety if,when just before entering upon them,he stopped,looked and listened,and no train was within sight or sound.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
second,i wish to make clear that my colleagues did not suggest that i lacked jurisdiction to discuss the implications of the stop,look and listen rule.instead,they choose to refuse to affirm on these grounds.had the majority challenged this court jurisdiction to consider this,they would have gotten nowhere,for an appellate court is authorized to affirm a district court judgment for reasons other than those stated by the trial court,as long as the record supports the judgment.see guthrie lady jane collieries,cir citing helvering gowran.similarly,an appellate court is not shackled to the briefs or oral argument of counsel.an appellate court is not stripped of jurisdiction to discuss an important if not the most important relevant precept of law where,as here,a motorist operates his vehicle into the side of a railroad train proceeding though a street crossing merely because a district court refuses to discuss it even though raised by the defendant,and the appellate lawyers decide not to discuss it by brief or oral argument.the issue was raised in the district court.that vests in me the authority to consider it on appeal.
in electing to refuse to consider the impact of zimmerman failure to stop,look and listen as a grounds that may warrant affirming the district court,the majority reflects a theory of jurisprudence that has been rejected in america for almost years.this jurisprudence of concepts was known by the germans as begriffsjurisprudenz,and was the theory behind the century movement to codify the law in much of europe.later,the prominent german jurisprudent rudolf von ihering insisted that the first question should be how will a rule or a decision operate in practice and advocated a jurisprudence of results.for example,if a rule of commercial law were in question,the search should be for the rule that best accords with and gives effect to sound business practice.rudolf von ihering titled this jurisprudence wirklichkeitsjurisprudenz.roscoe pound,mechanical jurisprudence,colum.see also rudolf von ihering,der geist des römischen rechts.whatever had been possible procedural restrictions on appeal at one time in the civil law countries of european nations utilizing the jurisprudence of concepts,at least until the end of the century,as i will demonstrate below,we should not adhere to this now disfavored approach.
in the beginning of the century the great masters of american jurisprudence oliver holmes,benjamin cardozo and professor roscoe pound rejected the jurisprudence of concepts for what they called a jurisprudence of results.because this discussion has not often appeared in many judicial opinions,if any at all,i will summarize how the great change came about,a change in the nature of jurisprudence doctrine that our courts have now followed for almost years,a change that was advocated by these great american masters.
in his classic the nature of the judicial process,cardozo explained hornbook doctrine that sometimes the source of the law to be embodied in a judgment is obvious,as when the constitution or a statute applies.benjamin cardozo,the nature of the judicial process.in these situations,the judge simply obeys the constitutional or statutory rule.but when no constitutional or statutory mandate controls,the judge must compare that case with the precedents,whether stored in his mind or hidden in the books.id.at.if the comparison yields a perfect fit,if both the law and its application are clear,the task is simple.if the law is unclear,it is necessary to extract from the precedents the underlying principle and then determine the path or direction along which the principle is to move and develop,if it is not to wither and die.id.at.cardozo cautioned that decisions do not unfold their principles for the asking.they yield up their kernel slowly and painfully.id.at.he discussed what he called the organons of the judicial process the instruments by which we fix the bounds and tendencies of that principle development and growth.he also discussed the use of history and customs,and then promulgated what in was considered a revolutionary technique of the method of sociology,a jurisprudence that concentrated on results.
by describing the elements at work in the caldron,cardozo was performing the valued task of a traditional common law judicial analyst.that he ranks with oliver wendell holmes,as one of our greatest common law judges is scarcely now debatable.but to the extent that he developed,persuasively and gracefully,a legitimation for jurisprudence,he became more a legal philosopher than a common law judge.he sought what ought to be the law,in contrast with what is.
although cardozo is not generally listed as a member of the enthusiastic corps of american realists,he must be ranked with holmes,as an elder statesman of that exciting cadre of reformers.in the last quarter of the century critics were quick to recognize the legitimacy of decisions based on social welfare,but in cardozo arguments brought respectability to what theretofore had been condemned as blatant jurisprudence.he was neither timid nor uncertain in espousing his method of sociology.to him it was the power of social justice,and among all principles of the process,it was the force which in our day and generation is becoming the greatest.id.at.to him the preferred in addressing novel questions of law was the social welfare,defined as public policy,the good of the collective body,or the social gain that is wrought by adherence to the standards of right conduct,which find expression in the mores of the community.id.at.
accustomed as we are today to lavish reliance by prestigious courts on judicial concepts of public policy,cardozo statements in the early must be placed in the context of judicial process of that era.judges then were disciples of what rudolph von ihering styled as a jurisprudence of concepts,and as early as american courts were being chided for undue reliance on concepts.
in the path of the law,oliver wendell holmes gently admonished 
i think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.the duty is inevitable,and the result of the often proclaimed judicial aversion to deal with such considerations is simply to leave the very ground and foundation of judgments inarticulate,and often unconscious 
holmes,the path of the law,harv.
within a decade roscoe pound was trumpeting the same theme the most important and most constant cause of dissatisfaction with all law at all times is to be found in the necessarily mechanical operation of legal rules.roscoe pound,the causes of popular dissatisfaction with the administration of justice,am,reprinted in baylor.
critics labeled this blind adherence to precedents,or to the rules and principles derived from them,mechanical jurisprudence and slot machine justice.pound called for a new look at what he described as pragmatism as a philosophy of law,and stated vigorously the nadir of mechanical jurisprudence is reached when conceptions are used,not as premises from which to reason,but as ultimate solutions.so used,they cease to be conceptions and become empty words.roscoe pound,mechanical jurisprudence,colum.
yet founders of the results jurisprudence holmes,pound and cardozo had early historical support for their advocacy.professor calvin woodard of the university of virginia suggests that their theory draws on jeremy bentham utilitarian thesis 
t he advocates of sociological jurisprudence seized upon this aspect of bentham message.like him,they insisted that law has a practical,real world moral purpose,though they defined that purpose more in terms of social justice,and the balancing of social interests,than bentham the greatest happiness of the greatest number.

typical of judicial utterances that had disturbed holmes,pound,and cardozo was one by the maryland court of appeals in obviously a principle,if sound,ought to be applied wherever it logically leads,without reference to ulterior results.gluck baltimore.in contrast,the same year that cardozo delivered the storrs lecture at yale,he seized the opportunity to put his new theory into practice by publicly rejecting blind conceptual jurisprudence in hynes new york central railroad.a boy had been injured while using a crude springboard to dive into the harlem river.the trial court had ruled that if the youth had climbed on the springboard from the river before beginning his dive,the defendant landowner would have been held to the test of ordinary care,but because the boy had mounted from land owned by the defendant railroad company,the court held the defendant to the lower standard of care owed to a trespasser.cardozo rejected this analysis,describing it as an extension of a maxim or a definition with relentless disregard of consequences to a dryly logical extreme.the approximate and relative became the definite and absolute.id.at.
cardozo opinion in hynes is a prototype,and his the nature of the judicial process an apologia,for based on judicial concepts of public policy.the philosophical underpinnings of what cardozo described as the sociological or results method run counter to the widely held notion that the public policy should be formulated and promulgated only by the legislative branch of government.when judges rather than the legislators declare public policy,their declarations produce local and national tensions.when judges utilize this method,laymen and some lawyers label them as activists,liberals,loose constructionists,and a host of other epithets,gentle and otherwise.
but modern american jurisprudence is more than the results method,although its influence is strongly felt.the legal realists of the and worried about what they called the social performance of law.those same concerns are said to lie close to the heart of the critical studies movement as well.to be sure,the law and economics school can be said to be,but it stresses economic efficiency rather than social justice.
modern american jurisprudence constantly seeks the answers to the serious questions presented by the theories of adjudication,theories both old and new.we must keep in mind the central question put to us by the thoughtful professor woodard 
what better measure is there of the value of a legal system,or indeed of the rule of law itself,than the quality of life of those subject to it and if this approach stresses the morality of results,it also puts a huge moral burden on the hand that wields the tool of law.
woodard,supra,at.
from the foregoing,in this railroad crossing case,stop,look and listen may not be cast aside as in the former era of a jurisprudence of concepts we wo meet it on appeal because the trial judge did not meet it.in modern concepts of jurisprudence to ignore this is to run in the face of holmes words,i think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.the duty is inevitable,and also the words of pound the most important and most constant cause of dissatisfaction with all law at all times is to be found in the necessarily mechanical operation of legal rules.and finally the words of cardozo in new york central railroad you should not extend a maxim or a definition with relentless disregard of consequences to a dryly logical extreme.

law is not a form of art for art sake its are social,nothing more and nothing less than the establishment and maintenance of a social environment in which the quality of human life can be spirited,improving and unimpaired.
harry jones,an invitation to jurisprudence,colum,
the pennsylvania stop,look and listen rule was an omnipresent brooding presence in this case.i will not put my head in the sand and ignore it.
the next issue is whether the district court properly granted norfolk southern motion for summary judgment on zimmerman claim.i agree with the majority opinion insofar as it holds that claims are preempted when a train is traveling below a federally mandated speed limit.majority opinion.i also agree with the majority that creates federally mandated speed limits by establishing the degree of care that railroads must exercise on each class of tracks trains should not exceed ten miles per hour on class tracks,miles per hour on class tracks,and so on.majority opinion.
i disagree,however,with the majority holding that zimmerman claim is not preempted by because he has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the track at the diller avenue crossing was a class track the only class of track for which the train speed would have exceeded the federally mandated limit under,and the only class of track for which zimmerman claim would therefore not be preempted by.i would hold that zimmerman failed to provide any competent evidence that the tracks were classified as class because,as the district court held,the limited evidence zimmerman sought to introduce for this purpose was privileged under either or.zimmerman is left without any competent evidence to rebut norfolk southern testimony that the track was either class or class,which both have maximum speed limits greater than the speed the train was traveling,and therefore zimmerman claim is preempted by and summary judgment was proper.
zimmerman sought to introduce two groups of documents to challenge norfolk southern testimony that the track at issue was a class or class track inventory documents from the department of transportation national crossing inventory and accident reports dating back to.i would hold that the inventory documents were privileged under and that the accident reports were privileged under.
the first group of documents zimmerman sought to introduce were nine documents titled dot crossing inventory information.eight of these documents state a maximum permissible speed of miles per hour for trains crossing diller avenue,and one states a maximum permissible speed of miles per hour.if admitted into evidence,these documents would create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the operation of the train was negligent per se,given that it was traveling at a speed of miles per hour at the time of the collision.furthermore,they would establish the possibility that zimmerman claim is not preempted by because they would demonstrate that norfolk southern may have exceeded the federally mandated speed limit set for the diller avenue crossing.
to determine whether the inventory documents are admissible,both the majority and i must analyze carefully,which states 
r eports,surveys,schedules,lists,or data compiled or collected for the purpose of identifying,evaluating,or planning the safety enhancement of crossings,pursuant to sections,and of this title or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing highway funds shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a federal or state court proceeding or considered for other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports,surveys,schedules,lists,or data.
emphasis added.
the supreme court teaches that was enacted to facilitate programs including the crossings program promulgated by.see pierce cnty.guillen,d.the crossings program was enacted to assist states in identifying highways and railways in need of improvements.it makes funds available to states for the cost of construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of crossings.a.to participate,states must conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad crossings which may require separation,relocation,or protective devices,and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.d.because participation in these programs required states to disclose information that could expose them to civil liability,such as information related to accident sites,congress adopted to encourage disclosure.see guillen,at.
additionally,in guillen,the supreme court concluded that protected all data collected by an agency in support of the federal hazard elimination program,regardless of the source of the information.see id.at.at the time,appeared within the text of as a program falling within the statute coverage,just as appeared and still appears to this day within the text of.for this reason,i would hold that the teachings of guillen apply equally to programs and would hold that protects all data collected by an agency in support of,regardless of the source of information.because i conclude that the inventory documents sought to be introduced here fall within,they are inadmissible and i would affirm the district court holding.
because does not protect information that was compiled,collected,obtained and utilized for purposes unrelated to one of the three programs identified in the statute,see guillen,u.at,the relevant inquiry here,in determining whether applies,is whether the information in the inventory docum
