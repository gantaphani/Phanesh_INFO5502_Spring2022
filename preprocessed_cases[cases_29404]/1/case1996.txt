appalachian resources development corporation appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms atf,affirming the revocation of its licenses to sell firearms and ammunition for willfully violating the gun control act of,et.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
on july,eighteen year old aaron rains,a resident of cookeville,tennessee,committed suicide with a caliber handgun.the atf soon thereafter began an investigation of bend of the river shooting supplies appellant,a store located in cookeville,tennessee,that had been duly licensed to sell firearms and ammunition since the early.law enforcement officials began to scrutinize appellant after evidence found at the scene of rains suicide indicated that the caliber ammunition used in his handgun was purchased from bend of the river although appellant claims that it does not recollect ever selling ammunition to rains,a sales receipt and cashed check are evidence that william west,a sales clerk at bend of the river,did in fact sell caliber automatic colt pistol acp ammunition to rains on july.
on march,the atf served appellant with notices of revocation of its four federal firearms licenses for selling handgun ammunition in violation of the gun control act gca of appellant was specifically charged with violating b,which,in pertinent part,prohibits a licensed firearms dealer from selling ammunition,for other than a shotgun or rifle,to any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than years of age.appellant requested an administrative hearing to review the revocation.on november,the hearing officer found that appellant willfully violated the gca,therefore upholding the revocation of appellant firearms licenses.
appellant next filed suit in united states district court for the middle district of tennessee,seeking review of the revocation.after considering the evidence de novo,the district court granted the atf motion for summary judgment.in ruling in favor of the government,the district court determined that appellant willfully violated b because it had knowledge of the obligation not to sell handgun ammunition to underage persons and because of repeated violations of that obligation in reaching this conclusion,the district court ultimately rejected appellant argument that acp ammunition is interchangeable,can be used in both handguns and rifles,thus finding that the sale was not exempt under the gca.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment and all legal conclusions drawn by that court de novo,using the same standard employed by the district court.see moore philip morris,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.in deciding upon a motion for summary judgment,we must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.matsushita,zenith radio,d.
willful violation of the gca 
the gca prohibits a licensed dealer from selling handgun ammunition to any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than years of age.b b.pursuant to e,the government may revoke a firearms license if the dealer willfully violates a statute or regulation governing the firearm industry.
in the instant matter,it is undisputed that at the time of the ammunition sale to rains,appellant knew of its obligation under the gca not to sell handgun ammunition to underage persons.despite this fact,appellant maintains that it did not willfully violate the gca because the sale was not done with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law.bryan united states,d.the district court rejected this argument,finding that appellant willfully violated the gca because it had knowledge of the obligation not to sell handgun ammunition to underage persons at the time of the sale to rains,and because of repeated violations of that obligation.we agree.
the majority of circuits,including the sixth circuit,have consistently held that where a licensee understands his or her legal obligations under the gca,yet fails to abide by those obligations,his or her license can be denied or revoked on the basis that the dealer willfully violated the gca.see al jewelry loan,dep t of treasury,bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,wl,at cir,denial of license affirmed upon finding petitioner willfully violated gca because he knew of record keeping obligations yet failed to abide by them perri dep t of treasury,bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,cir to establish grounds for revocation of a license,the government must demonstrate a willful violation of the act.that is established when a dealer understands the requirements of the law,but knowingly fails to follow them or was indifferent to them.citing lewin blumenthal,cir stein blumenthal,cir the gca does not require bad purpose or evil motive before a license may be revoked or a renewal application denied.the secretary need only prove that the petitioner knew of his legal obligation and purposefully disregarded or was plainly indifferent to the recordkeeping requirements.quotation marks omitted prino simon,cir under the gca,in a civil context,a conscious,intentional,deliberate,voluntary decision properly is described as willful,regardless of venal motive.quotation marks omitted.furthermore,it has been recognized that a single violation of the gca is a sufficient basis for denying an application or revoking a firearms dealer license.cook herbert,wl,at,see also bridges,dep t of treasury,bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,d,dimartino buckles,d,aff by unpublished order,dimartino buckley,wl,at cir.
in the present case,we do not believe the bad purpose standard set forth in bryan for determining willful conduct is controlling with regard to the district court standard defining willful violation.the supreme court decision in bryan affirmed a conviction on the basis of the defendant willful violation of a,which forbids dealing in firearms without a license.in particular,the court upheld jury instructions that read 
a person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and purposely and with the intent to do something the law forbids,that is,with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law.
id.at.emphasis added.the court,however,cautioned that the word willfully has many meanings,and that a s a general matter,when used in a criminal context,a willful act is one undertaken with a bad purpose.id.at.moreover,the bryan opinion acknowledges that a disregard of a known legal obligation is sufficient to establish a willful violation.id.at.
nevertheless,appellant relies solely upon bryan in arguing that a revocation under the gca requires proof of bad intent.this particular argument is unsupported by case law in this circuit or elsewhere.to the contrary,there is a wealth of case law,previously cited,which supports the district court reasoning that appellant willfully violated section b because of its undisputed knowledge of the law at the time of the ammunition sale to aaron rains.
sufficiency of the evidence 
appellant next claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because there was insufficient evidence to prove it violated b by knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that aaron rains was under years of age when it sold him ammunition.we disagree.while it is undisputed that appellant did not have actual knowledge of rains age,a careful review of the record,the parties briefs,and oral arguments by counsel support the district court finding that appellant had reasonable cause to believe that aaron rains was under the age of years.
the crux of the district court determination is grounded in the testimony of rick martin,a sales clerk who spoke with rains on the same day he purchased the caliber ammunition from appellant.on that date,rains approached martin in the sporting good
