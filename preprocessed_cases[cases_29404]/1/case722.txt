petitioner jesus or petitioner seeks review of a may,decision by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the november,judgment of an immigration judge ij,which denied petitioner application for cancellation of removal but granted his request for voluntary departure.petitioner asserts that the ij and the bia erred in concluding that his arrest and conviction for illegal entry into the united states in february interrupted his continuous physical presence in the united states and thereby rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to b.whether a conviction for illegal entry is a formal,documented process pursuant to which an alien is determined to be inadmissible,see in re,b.en banc and,if so,whether such a process interrupts an alien continuous physical presence in the united issues of first impression in this circuit.we conclude that petitioner conviction and subsequent return to mexico did interrupt his continual physical presence and therefore the bia properly concluded that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
background 
petitioner was born in mexico in and first came to the united states in april.at some point in june or july of,he was arrested by an immigration officer and given a document to leave the country.he contends that he returned to the united states in april.petitioner returned to mexico again in to get married and the united states shortly thereafter without incident.
petitioner claims that he next left for mexico in early february to visit his ailing mother and thereafter was arrested three times by the border patrol when trying to the united states.the second of these three arrests occurred on february,near brownsville,texas.petitioner admits that in connection with that attempt to,he paid for fraudulent a border crossing card in the name of raphael he could show to the border patrol.upon questioning by the border patrol,petitioner apparently gave his correct name and was then arrested at the checkpoint.
petitioner was charged that same day with entering the united states illegally in violation of a he appeared before a magistrate judge in the united states district court for the southern district of texas the district court,and the record shows that he waived his right to counsel and pleaded guilty to illegal entry.petitioner also signed a separate notice of rights and request for disposition form on that same day.that document advised petitioner that he had the right to a hearing before the immigration court or,in the alternative,the right to return to mexico without a hearing.petitioner checked the box on that form requesting a hearing before the immigration court but a hearing was never conducted.a notice to appear was also prepared on february,although it does not appear to have been filed with the immigration court and the parties dispute whether it was ever served on.
the record is less than clear with respect to events that followed.petitioner judgment of conviction,entered on february,indicates that he was sentenced to days imprisonment,but the judgment also states that the execution of the sentence was suspended and that ascenciorodriguez was placed on probation without supervision for a period of three years,conditioned on no further violation of federal state laws.a record of alien form produced by the government also indicates that on february,petitioner was granted a voluntary return in lieu of prosecution.according to petitioner testimony before the ij,after appearing in court and signing some documents,he was placed on a bus and returned to mexico on the same day of his arrest.
petitioner attempted to the united states on march,but was arrested again by the border patrol.he asserts that he attempted to the united states for a fourth time on april,and successfully evaded the border patrol.
on may,the department of homeland security in vermont issued petitioner a notice to appear,in which it charged him with removability under a a i as an alien present without being admitted or paroled,and under a b i ii as a nonimmigrant who was not in possession of a valid visa or border crossing card at the time of application for admission.petitioner appeared before an ij three different times in late and early and on april,petitioner stated that he would seek cancellation of removal under b petitioner subsequently submitted an application and supporting documents.
on november,petitioner appeared before the ij for a hearing on the merits of his application for cancellation of removal.the ij issued an oral opinion that same day,in which he denied petitioner application for cancellation of removal on the basis that petitioner was statutorily ineligible for cancellation because he had not met his burden of establishing ten years continuous physical presence in the united states,as required by b a.
in connection with his holding,the ij made two relevant findings.first,after noting that continuous physical presence ends when an alien departs the united states under the threat of initiation of removal proceedings,the ij found that petitioner departed the united states under the threat of such proceedings at least three times in and,accordingly,had ended his physical presence in the united states within the meaning of b a.second,the ij found that petitioner continuous physical presence was interrupted after his arrest at the border in because it resulted in a process by which he was determined to be inadmissible to the united states.
petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal to the bia.on may,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.the bia noted that it had previously 
held that an immigration official refusal to admit an alien at a land border port of entry will constitute a break in the alien continuous physical presence if there is evidence that the alien was formally excluded or made subject to an order of expedited removal,was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw his application for admission,or was subjected to any other formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible to the united states.
citing in re.the bia then noted that petitioner was arrested on february,and concluded that the evidence established that petitioner was subjected to a formal,documented process and determined to be inadmissible.accordingly,the bia determined that the petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he could not show that he had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not fewer than ten years.this petition timely followed.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia adopts the ij reasoning and offers additional commentary,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.wala mukasey,cir.we review the agency factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,under the substantial evidence standard,treating them as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b emphases added.we review de novo questions of law and applications of law to undisputed fact.see chambers office of chief counsel,cir.
aliens who are present in the united states but have not attained permanent resident status and are subject to removal may petition for cancellation of removal pursuant to b.see note,ante.to be eligible for cancellation of removal under this subsection,an alien must,inter alia,have been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years prior to seeking cancellation of removal.b a.despite the statute requirement of continuous physical presence,short breaks in continuity do not render an alien ineligible for cancellation.see d explaining that a single departure in excess of days,or multiple departures exceeding days in the aggregate,break an alien continuous physical presence.the cancellation statute also provides that any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end a when the alien is served a notice to appear under a,or b when the alien has committed an offense referred to in a that renders the alien inadmissible to the united states.d.
in addition to the conditions set forth in these statutory provisions,the bia has held that certain other events break a period of continuous physical presence.in in re,for example,the bia held that a voluntary departure under the threat of deportation also breaks an alien continuous physical presence.en banc.the bia reasoned that it would be contrary to the overall objectives of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira to allow an alien to continue to accrue time for purposes of obtaining relief after the alien departs under a formal order of deportation or removal,or under the threat of such an order.id.at.the holding of in re has been upheld by all of the courts of appeals that have had occasion to consider it.see.attorney,cir holding that the bia construction of the statute was entitled to deference under chevron,natural res.def.council,and that its construction was reasonable ashcroft,cir we have no quarrel with rule that voluntary departure under threat of deportation or removal proceedings constitutes a break in continuous physical presence palomino ashcroft,cir holding in re to be a reasonable interpretation of the immigration code ashcroft,cir same ashcroft,cir we conclude that the bia and the attorney general reading of the statute is a reasonable one,worthy of our deference.
although no court of appeals has rejected the central holding of in re,several have held that it does not apply in cases where an alien is simply turned away at the border.in reyesvasquez ashcroft,for example,the eighth circuit held that,for in re romalez alcaide to apply,the threat of deportation,and its consequences,must be expressed to and understood by the alien,cir.according to the eighth circuit,this understanding is generally absent when an alien is turned away at the border,and therefore frustrated entries ordinarily do not qualify as voluntary departures under a threat of deportation so as to operate to break an alien continuous physical presence in the united states.see id.at b efore it may be found that a voluntary departure occurred,the record must contain some evidence that the alien was informed of and accepted its terms.see also,at.
the bia again considered the circumstances that may constitute a break in continuous physical presence in in re.in that case,the bia explicitly adopted the holdings of the eighth circuit in and the seventh circuit in in concluding that being turned back at the border without formal acceptance of the terms voluntary return or voluntary departure does not break an alien continuous physical presence.id.at.the bia thus held that 
an immigration official refusal to admit an alien at a land border port of entry will not constitute a break in the alien continuous physical presence,unless there is evidence that the alien was formally excluded or made subject to an order of expedited removal,was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw his or her application for admission,or was subjected to any other formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible to the united states.
id.at emphasis added.
the bia did not explain what might qualify as a formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible,id.emphasis added,but it added that the following evidence might suffice to demonstrate such a process 
testimony or documentary evidence of a legally enforced refusal of admission and return such as a record of alien form,a notice of departure form,an ident printout,affidavits or statements of the alien or immigration officials,photographs,fingerprints,or other appropriate forms and official records of the dhs.
id.at emphasis added.the bia cautioned,however,that if the evidence indicates that the alien encounter with immigration authorities involves nothing more than being returned to the border following refusal of admission for failure to have proper documents,the encounter does not break continuous physical presence.id.in tapia gonzales,the ninth circuit,in the only reported decision to have considered the bia formal,documented process requirement,held that the acts of fingerprinting and photographing an alien do not transform a border turnaround into a formal,documented process that breaks an alien period of continuous physical presence,cir.
our court has not yet had the opportunity to apply the bia decisions in in re and in re.we hold today that the bia interpretation of the cancellation of removal statute expressed in both of those decisions is reasonable and is entitled to chevron deference.see chevron,at if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.under the first step of the chevron analysis,we conclude that,although d sets forth circumstances under which continuous physical presence must be deemed to have been broken,congress has not spoken on whether other events can also operate to terminate an alien period of continuous physical presence.see,at.we further hold,under the second step of chevron,that the bia interpretations of in in re and in re are permissible constructions of the statute and thus entitled to deference.see chevron,at we have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.we next consider whether petitioner in this case was subjected to a formal,documented process pursuant to which he was determined inadmissible to the united states.in re,at.
as the ij noted,the circumstances of petitioner arrest on february,and his subsequent departure from the united states are,on this record,somewhat of a mystery.the record reveals with certainty,however,the following facts petitioner was arrested in the early morning hours of february,while attempting to enter the united states.he was subsequently charged in the district court with improper entry in violation of a,see note,ante,and he pleaded guilty to that offense.he was given a suspended sentence of days imprisonment and at some point returned to mexico.immigration records state that petitioner was granted a voluntary return in lieu of prosecution.this sequence of events is a far cry from merely being turned back at the border.accordingly,we have no difficulty concluding that petitioner departed after being subjected to a formal,documented process by which he was determined inadmissible,see in re,at,which terminated his period of continuous physical presence.
petitioner does not dispute that his conviction was the product of a formal,documented process,but he does contend that the conviction has no bearing on his admissibility.although he correctly notes that the statute under which he was convicted.a,see note,ante,makes no reference to admissibility,its language almost mirrors the definition of inadmissibility contained in a a i.compare a applying to a ny alien who enters or attempts to enter the united states at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers,with a a i an alien who arrives in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general,is inadmissible.accordingly,his conviction following his plea of guilty constituted an admission to facts that rendered him inadmissible under a a i.
petitioner responds that there are exceptions by which an otherwise inadmissible alien might be deemed admissible,and therefore a conviction under can not categorically be considered an adjudication of admissibility.section,for example,exempts certain battered women and children from the definition of inadmissible.see a a ii moreover,under i,aliens who enter the united states without inspection may apply to the attorney general for an adjustment of status if they are the beneficiary of a petition for classification filed by a citizen or the beneficiary of an application for a labor certification.see i and finally,an otherwise removable alien may seek cancellation of removal under b,see note,petitioner sought to do in these proceedings.none of these exceptions,however,could have applied to peti
