in this petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia,petitioner contends that his application for adjustment of status was denied pursuant to an invalid regulation.for the reasons that follow,the petition for review is denied.
facts and proceedings 
petitioner,amin memanji momin momin,is a native and citizen of india.he first entered the united states in march as a on a student visa.momin temporarily left the united states and reentered as a parolee in december to pursue a visa application filed by his wife and his application for adjustment of status momin sought lawful permanent resident lpr status.the immigration and naturalization service ins denied momin application for a visa and his application for adjustment of status on october,on october,momin was charged as being removable,pursuant to a a i i,because he did not possess a valid entry document.
before the immigration judge ij,momin conceded the charges,that he was an arriving alien and not in possession of proper immigration documentation.during the hearing,however,momin indicated that he intended to file an application in support of his adjustment of status application and asked for a continuance.the ij granted the continuance.two days after the hearing,the ins filed a motion to pretermit momin application for adjustment of status.in its motion,the ins contended that,under c an arriving alien is ineligible to apply for an adjustment of status.momin did not oppose the motion and,on may,the ij ordered that the ins motion to pretermit momin application for adjustment of status be granted.
a month later,momin filed a motion to reconsider the ij order.momin contended that he was not an arriving alien according to momin,he met the exception to the definition of an arriving alien because he was granted advance parole in the united states prior to his departure from and return to the united states.q defining arriving alien.momin further argued that,under a i and ii,he should be permitted to renew his application for adjustment of status after substituting his visa application for his application.momin argument focused on the facts that,regardless of the type of visa petition,or used to support the application,the application for adjustment of status remained largely the same,and the regulation permitted the renewal of the adjustment application,not a particular visa petition.
the ins responded by asserting that an applicant may substitute visa petitions only when the petition has not been adjudicated.where the application has been considered but denied,the ins argued,the applicant was limited to renewing the application as filed.the ins urged the ij to consider the application as a new application.
the ij agreed with the ins and,on july,issued an order denying the motion to reconsider and directing that momin be removed.the ij addressed momin argument momin seeks to have a second application for adjustment of status,based on an visa petition,reviewed and approved by the court in the instant proceedings.however,nothing in the regulations allows an alien to substitute an application with another visa petitioner.based on its determination that momin was an arriving alien and that the original adjustment of status application had not been renewed,the ij cited,inter alia,c for the proposition that momin was ineligible for adjustment of status in these removal proceedings.
on july,momin appealed the ij order to the bia and asserted basically the same application renewal argument.in response,the ins moved for summary affirmance,arguing that the ij had correctly determined that,under c,momin was not eligible for an adjustment of status.the bia agreed with the ins,adopted the ij july,order,and dismissed momin appeal.in addition,the bia made the following express findings momin was ineligible for adjustment of status under c momin was not within the exception to the definition of arriving alien for one who has been paroled and momin application was different from,not a renewal of,his application for adjustment of status and,therefore,he was ineligible to adjust status under a.momin did not seek judicial review of the bia decision.
on december,momin filed a motion to reconsider the bia decision,which the ins opposed.momin asserted that he was not an arriving alien,based on the definition of that term in q.the ins pointed out that the exception momin relied on applied only to paroled aliens in expedited removal proceedings under b a i,codifying immigration and nationality act ina b a i.momin was not in an expedited removal proceeding rather,momin removal proceeding was pursuant to,codifying ina.accordingly,the ins continued,momin was an arriving alien and,as such,ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to lpr.by order dated january,the bia denied momin motion for reconsideration.the bia held,in accord with c,that momin was an arriving alien and barred from adjustment of status because of the pending removal proceedings.
on january,two days before the bia issued its order denying momin motion to reconsider,momin mailed a pleading titled supplement to the respondent motion to reconsider the board decision to the bia.in this supplemental motion,momin urged the bia to consider the first circuit opinion in succar ashcroft,cir,which concluded that c was inconsistent with a and,therefore,could not be relied on to support a removal order.the ins maintains that it did not receive momin supplemental motion in time to consider it and did not include it in the administrative record momin now petitions this court to review the bia denial of his motion for reconsideration.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews the bia denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.zhao gonzales,cir.the bia findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.zhang gonzales,cir quoting b b and noting that the provision codified the substantial evidence test established in ins,d.
with respect to pure questions of law,legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.alwan ashcroft,cir.but,where appropriate under chevron natural resources defense council,d,the bia interpretation of an ambiguous provision of the ina is entitled to deference singh gonzales,cir.chevron deference is also appropriate where the bia interprets its own regulations.id.citing ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
the sole question presented in momin petition for review,and the only argument under consideration is the argument addressed in his january supplemental motion.momin contends that c,which deems arriving aliens,who are in removal proceedings,ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to lpr,is invalid.according to momin,because the regulation conflicts with the underlying statute,a,it can not be used to bar his application for adjustment of status.if momin status adjustment application is valid,the argument continues,momin is not subject to removal.momin entire argument turns on the regulation validity.before addressing the merits of his claim,we must first consider the ins position that momin waived his argument by failing to present it timely to the bia.
failure to raise the argument with the bia 
the ins argues in its brief that the bia decision was formed without the benefit of momin supplemental argument and that,because he did not timely raise the argument with the bia,it is waived we have addressed the failure of a petitioner to seek relief before the bia when a petitioner seeks to raise a claim not presented to the bia and the claim is one that the bia has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy,the petitioner must raise the issue in a motion to reopen prior to resorting to review by the courts.goonsuwan ashcroft,cir.momin contends that there are no adequate mechanisms to address and remedy his claim before the bia because the bia lacks jurisdiction to consider the validity of regulations promulgated under the ina.
the bia has stated that regulations promulgated under the ina have the force and effect of law as to the bia and the immigration judges.in re shanu,bia citing in re fede,bia.momin argument is supported by several unpublished bia decisions in which the bia declined to follow succar because the regional court of appeals had not adopted the succar reasoning and the bia remained bound by the regulations.see,in re toussaint,no,wl bia unpublished in re,no,wl bia unpublished in re cheng,no,wl bia unpublished.
the question presented is purely a matter of law.under our waiver jurisprudence,the failure to raise such an issue below does not necessarily subject it to waiver this court may exercise its discretion to consider pure issues of law not raised below.freudensprung offshore technical,cir.see also atl.mut.ins.truck ins,cir an issue raised for the first time on appeal generally is not considered unless it involves a purely legal question or failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice.accordingly,we will consider this pure legal validity of c.
validity of c 
statutory and regulatory framework 
momin contends that c conflicts with a.before we focus on the contested regulation,however,a broader perspective of the ina and its statutory and regulatory framework is required.under the version of the ina,aliens fall into one of two classes admitted aliens and applicants for admission.the former class is composed of only those aliens who lawfully entered the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.see a a.the latter class includes those aliens who are present in the united states but have not been admitted.see a.by regulation,the attorney general created a of applicants for admission,the arriving alien see q.for the purposes of our analysis,an arriving alien is the same as an applicant for admission.see id.
parolees constitute another of applicants for admission a parolee is an applicant for admission who has been permitted temporarily into the united states by an exercise of the attorney general discretion.see d a.although a parolee is permitted physically to enter the united states,for the purposes of his immigrant status the parolee remains an applicant for admission and,if parole is revoked,is subject to whatever actions might be appropriate for any other applicant for admission.see a b an alien who is paroled shall not be considered to have been admitted.moreover,an arriving alien remains an arriving alien,even if paroled into the united states.see q.an alien who arrives in the united states on advance parole,as did momin,is nevertheless an arriving alien.see id.see also in re oseiwusu,bia.accordingly,parole allows an alien physically to enter the united states but does not affect the alien status within the immigration framework.
another piece of the statutory framework is the concept of removal.for an applicant for admission,if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,the alien shall be detained for a removal proceeding.b.all aliens and applicants for be subject to removal.see a listing classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission and,therefore,subject to removal,a listing classes of deportable aliens subject to removal.being subject to removal does not necessarily result in removal the removal proceeding is simply the mechanism by which the question of admissibility is adjudicated.
the final noteworthy piece of the statutory framework is the concept of status.as a general rule,though subject to numerous exceptions,aliens have immigrant status.see a listing many classes of aliens.are those aliens who seek admittance for purposes other than immigration.id.an alien who has been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states has lpr status.a.an lpr is not regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien violates the conditions of the status.a c.
armed with an understanding of the statutory framework,we turn to the statute and regulation at issue.the underlying concern is momin eligibility to seek an adjustment of status to lpr.section a provides that the status of an alien who has been paroled into the united states may be adjusted to lpr status at the discretion of,and pursuant to regulations promulgated by,the attorney general 
the status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the united states may be adjusted by the attorney general,in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe,to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.
a.under this statutory provision,the class of admitted aliens and the class of paroled applicants for admission may,at the discretion of the attorney general,have their status adjusted to lpr.
the regulation in question severs a of who are both arriving aliens including those paroled into the united states and in removal the class of parolees eligible for adjustment of status to lpr.under the regulation,this of aliens is ineligible to apply for status adjustment.see c.momin challenges the validity of the regulation as contrary to the statutory framework.
sister circuits jurisprudence 
we do not consider this question in a vacuum.the parties briefed the first circuit holding in succar.since the first circuit first spoke,the third circuit,the ninth circuit,two panels from the eighth circuit,and,most recently,the eleventh circuit have had occasion to address the question we consider.the five circuits to address the issue have reached dissimilar results with even more dissimilar reasoning.and while these opinions lack uniformity,they provide analysis and research which we carefully consider.
invalid under chevron step one 
in succar,the first circuit,performing a chevron step one analysis,considered the statutory text and the context of the statutory scheme to determine that congress had spoken clearly to aliens eligibility for status adjustment and that the regulation additional limitation on the eligible class was inconsistent with that congressional determination.at.the first circuit later referred to the statute legislative history to confirm its reading of the statute.id.at.
in its review of the statute,the succar panel found that congress had defined certain categories of aliens who were eligible to apply for adjustment of status,and refined the definition by specifically excluding certain aliens from eligibility.id.at.because of the express pronouncements in regarding eligibility for status adjustment,the first circuit held that congress unambiguously reserved to itself the determination of who is eligible to apply for adjustment of status relief.id.the regulation limitation on parolees eligibility conflicts with the statute plain language,according to the succar court.
when the first circuit considered the context of the statutory scheme,it drew two conclusions.the succar court first determined that the exclusion of parolees in removal proceedings renders ineligible most of the class that congress rendered eligible by including parolees.id.at.second,the court stated that the congressional choice to delegate to the attorney general some circumscribed discretion over the ultimate decision of who is granted adjustment of status is not authorization for discretion in other areas.id.footnote omitted.these conclusions compelled the court to deem the regulation invalid.
the first conclusion was based,in part,on the court factual understanding that most arriving alien parolees are placed in removal proceedings.id.at.this representation was made to the court and not disputed by the attorney general.id.at.also,the court noted that an applicant for admission who can not demonstrate admissibility clearly and beyond a doubt must be placed in removal proceedings.id.at discussing b a.this view of the operation of the ina as a whole and of the practical effect of the regulation led the succar court to find that the regulation improperly subsumed the congressional grant of eligibility to the parolee class of aliens.
the first circuit second the attorney general a response to the argument that the attorney general may exercise his discretion by rulemaking rather than adjudication pursuant to lopez davis,d.in lopez,the supreme court upheld a regulation of the bureau of prisons the bureau categorically denying early release for certain prisoners as an appropriate exercise of the bureau discretion.at.the authorizing statute in question in lopez eliminated a class of prisoners from eligibility for early release and left the release determination of other prisoners to the discretion of the bureau.id.at.discussing e b.the court determined that,aside from excluding a class of prisoners from eligibility for the reduction in sentence,congress ha d not identified any further circumstance in which the bureau either must grant the reduction,or is forbidden to do so.id.at.because the bureau ultimately was vested with discretion to decide on the prisoners release,the court held that the bureau was within its authority to exclude categorically classes of prisoners by rule the bureau is not required continually to revisit issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.id.at.quoting heckler campbell,d.the first circuit distinguished lopez,asserting that,in the statute at issue in lopez,congress had been silent and that was not the case with respect to the ina.succar,at.accordingly,the succar court deemed the attorney general resort to rulemaking contrary to the plain language of the statute.id.
having concluded that the text and statutory structure conflicted with the regulation,the succar court reviewed the ina legislative history.congress,the first circuit determined,intended to eliminate unnecessary trips out of the united states in order to be eligible to apply for admission.id.at discussing,reprinted in.based on this review of the legislative history,the first circuit concluded that the regulation actually recreated a problem that congress intended to eliminate when enacting the statute because,under the regulation,parolees subject to removal would have to leave the country to become eligible to adjust status.id.at.as the legislative history confirmed its understanding of the statute language and context,the first circuit declared c invalid under chevron step one and vacated the bia removal order.id.at.the ninth circuit,in bona gonzales,cir,expressly adopted and followed succar.
invalid under chevron step two 
the third circuit also invalidated c but did so under chevron step two.zheng gonzales,cir.the third circuit disagreed with the first circuit conclusion that lopez did not govern the chevron step one result.id.at.the zheng court,applying lopez,stated that t he fact that congress declared some categories of aliens ineligible for adjustment by statute does not in itself conclusively prove that the attorney general can not declare other categories ineligible by regulation.id.
moving to the second step of chevron,the zheng court noted that if the regulation was to survive,it would have to be both reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design and based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting nationsbank of,variable annuity life ins,d,and chevron,at.looking to the operation of the ina as a whole the zheng court determined that virtually all parolees will be in removal proceedings.id.at.in addition to considering succar,the zheng court found that the statutory structure was such that parolees will,by default,be in removal proceedings.id.based on this understanding of the ina operation,the third circuit determined that congress intended that the mere fact of removal proceedings would not render an alien ineligible to apply for adjustment of status.id.at.
according to the zheng court,c rendered most aliens paroled into the united states ineligible to apply for adjustment of status.id.although the government contended that some aliens in removal proceedings might be eligible to adjust status,the third circuit deemed the exception too narrow to capture congressional intent that parolees be able to apply for status adjustment.id.at.ultimately,the zheng court stated that f or all practical purposes,c renders paroled aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status.id.based on its practical understanding of the statute function and the effect of the regulation,the zheng court concluded that t he conflict between regulation and statute is clear and unmistakable.id.as such,the regulation,which,according to the third circuit,essentially reverses the eligibility structure set out by congress,was held invalid under chevron step two.id.at.
recently,the eleventh circuit,in scheerer attorney general,wl,at cir,followed the zheng court reasoning and held c invalid.the eleventh circuit adhered to lopez and held that the attorney general may exercise his discretion by rulemaking in lieu of adjudication.scheerer,at,wl,at.the scheerer court,like succar,bona,and zheng,based its conclusion on an understanding that t he vast majority of aliens paroled into the united states will be in removal proceedings by virtue of the statutory scheme.id.at,wl,at.
valid under chevron 
the eighth circuit is the only circuit court to deem c valid,and it has done so in a pair of opinions each opinion drew a dissent arguing in favor of invalidating the regulation.see mouelle gonzales,cir geach chertoff,wl,at cir,following mouelle.the mouelle court,like both zheng and scheerer,followed the supreme court directive in lopez and recognized that the attorney general use of rulemaking was not invalid as contrary to the statute.at.
having satisfied itself with the manner of regulation,the mouelle court followed lopez and inquired whether the regulation was reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design.id.quoting lopez,at.at this point,the eighth circuit referred to the attorney general commentary in promulgating the regulation,which indicated that the regulation responded to congressional intent to expedite removal and avoid lengthening removal proceedings.id.citing inspection and expedited removal of aliens,interim rule with request for comments interim rule.the mouelle court noted the broad discretion granted the attorney general in the statute and determined that the fact that an arriving alien is in a removal proceeding is a characteristic that is a reasonably sound basis for choosing not to grant relief under a.id.to the contention in succar and the same contention later in zheng,bona,and scheerer that the regulation renders an entire class of by congress to be eligible for status for status adjustment,the mouelle court responded 
the court in succar opined that the relevant in removal barred most aliens who had been paroled from adjusting status because most paroled aliens were in removal proceedings.thus,the court concluded,the regulation was contrary to a because paroled aliens were among those eligible to adjust status under the statute.as an evidentiary matter,we can not conclude that the regulation bars most paroled aliens from adjusting status.unlike the court in succar,we have not been informed,of that fact.and in this case the attorney general cites dhs statistics suggesting that only about two to three percent of parolees who entered the united states in have been placed in removal proceedings.in fact,the ins did not initiate removal proceedings against the mouelles until april,over ten months after the mouelles were paroled into the united states.moreover,even if we assumed that most aliens paroled into the united states were placed in removal proceedings,does not show a congressional intent to vest a few,most,or all paroled aliens with the right to adjust their status.relief remains discretionary.
id.at internal citations omitted.because the regulation was,according to the eighth circuit,a valid exercise of discretion,the court upheld c.
we agree with the eighth circuit that c is a valid exercise of the discretion granted by congress to the attorney general.for the reasons that follow,we respectfully disagree with both the succar and zheng lines of reasoning.in determining the validity of the regulation,we must answer
