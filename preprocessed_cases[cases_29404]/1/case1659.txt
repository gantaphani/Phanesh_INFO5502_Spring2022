the united states department of homeland security petitioner petitions this court to issue a writ of mandamus to correct a discovery order by the united states district court for the southern district of texas,houston division.petitioner claims the district court erred by compelling disclosure of documents protected by the law enforcement privilege.we conclude that the district court erred in declaring that no law enforcement privilege exists beyond protecting confidential informant identity.we remand the case to the district court for an in camera review of the documents.confident that the district court will conduct its review in accordance with this opinion,we dismiss the petition without prejudice to the rights of the parties to seek additional relief following the review.
background 
surety national casualty corporation,a surety company,and aaa bonding agency,its bonding agent collectively respondents,underwrite bonds posted by aliens to enable them to secure release from petitioner custody pending removal.see generally.petitioner found that respondents had breached their obligations on more than immigration bonds,totaling more than nine million dollars in cumulative bond debt.the vast majority of respondents administrative appeals were denied.
respondents brought suit seeking a judicial order estopping petitioner from collecting bonds because of petitioner alleged affirmative misconduct.petitioner filed a counterclaim for the outstanding bond debt.to facilitate settlement of the debt dispute,the parties agreed to a framework for alternative dispute resolution adr.as part of adr,the parties agreed to review fifty of the bond breach determinations with selected by each side.petitioner also agreed to produce each respective alien file for those fifty determinations being reviewed.according to the adr agreement,the production requirement was exclusive of any privileged or otherwise protected documents,which will be set forth on a privilege log for further review by the court,if necessary.petitioner produced nearly pages of documents but withheld approximately pages,claiming that they were privileged.
respondents moved to compel production of the withheld documents.the district court did not review the disputed documents,yet granted the motion to compel.significantly,the court found no support for the law enforcement privilege in this circuit.petitioner filed an emergency petition for writ of mandamus and an emergency motion to stay the district court order pending disposition of the petition.this court has granted the stay.
ii.standard of review 
the remedy of mandamus is a drastic one,to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.kerr dist.for dist.of,d.one area where this court has granted mandamus relief is in the context of privileged documents.see in re avantel,cir.mandamus is appropriate if the district court errs in ordering the discovery of privileged documents,as such an order would not be reviewable on appeal.see also in re burlington,cir c ases have recognized the importance of the asserted privilege and the absence of an adequate alternative method of obtaining review.courts have considered the seriousness and novelty of the privilege issue,and r espected commentators have noted that the difficulty of obtaining effective review of discovery orders,the serious injury that sometimes results from such orders,and the often recurring nature of discovery issues support use of mandamus in exceptional cases.in re burlington,at.
iii.discussion 
petitioner contends that the documents at issue fall within the scope of the law enforcement privilege.these documents allegedly are used by petitioner in enforcing immigration and nationality laws,detecting violations of these laws,and referring such violations for prosecution.in support of its contention,petitioner offered the declaration of john clark,the deputy assistant secretary of immigration and customs enforcement,a bureau within the department of homeland security.clark,in that declaration,states that the documents contain information about ongoing criminal investigative leads,law enforcement methods and techniques,internal investigative memoranda,and identifying information relating to witnesses and law enforcement personnel,including undercover operatives.petitioner argues that these concerns go to the heart of the law enforcement privilege.
a.the fifth circuit application of the law enforcement privilege 
the district court found no precedent supporting a law enforcement privilege and therefore refused to apply the privilege to any portion of petitioner documents.petitioner disputes that no such privilege exists in this circuit.petitioner relies on two fifth circuit cases to support its contention brown thompson,cir,and swanner united states,cir.
in brown,this court reviewed the dismissal of a wrongful death action in which the plaintiffs sought discovery of police reports.the district court declined to require the production of files on the ground that the contents were privileged and that the files concerned parts of a homicide investigation which was then still open,the contents of which were highly confidential.brown,at.upon review,this court stated that such g overnment documents are the outstanding example of matter which is privileged and which is not subject to disclosure.it will expire upon the lapse of an unreasonable length of time.whether there should be disclosure is within the discretion of the trial court id.
in swanner,this court addressed whether the district court had erred in failing to require production of certain investigative files,principally for the purpose of supplying plaintiffs with the identity of two people who were under suspicion in connection with the underlying crime.swanner,at.the swanner court stated that pendency of a criminal investigation is a reason for denying discovery of investigative reports,although it would not apply indefinitely id.at.although concluding that the district court had not abused its discretion,this court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial in the interests of justice.id.
this circuit also has recognized the law enforcement privilege more recently.in coughlin lee,we stated that,in addition to protecting the identity of a confidential informant,f ederal common law recognizes a qualified privilege protecting investigative files in an ongoing criminal investigation,cir.in that case,the district court had limited discovery of police files because it considered those files irrelevant to the plaintiffs freedom of speech claim.id.at.on remand,we instructed the district court to review the documents instead for discoverability on the basis of the law enforcement privilege.id.
our case law has acknowledged the existence of a law enforcement privilege beyond that allowed for identities of confidential informants moreover,in today times the compelled production of government documents could impact highly sensitive matters relating to national security.therefore,the reasons for recognizing the law enforcement privilege are even more compelling now than when brown,swanner,and coughlin were decided.such a privilege should have been recognized by the district court the court legally erred in refusing to do so.petitioner also is correct that the error of ordering the discovery of potentially privileged documents,without judicial review of the those documents,would be irremediable on appeal.see in re avantel,at.hence,petitioner has no other means to obtain the relief sought.see mallard dist.for the dist.of iowa,d.
yet,this court does not know whether any of the disputed documents fall within the realm of the privilege.the documents were not presented for our review.in any event,determining privilege is a particularistic and judgmental task of balancing the need of the litigant who is seeking privileged investigative materials against the harm to the government if the privilege is lifted.dellwood farms cargill,cir.in this case,we think this determination of privilege following an initial review of the best left to the district court.
