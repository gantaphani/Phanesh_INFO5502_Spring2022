petitioner marty danso seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia adopting and affirming the decision of an immigration judge ij that denied danso requests for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status,and ordered him removed from the united states.we affirm.
facts proceedings 
danso is a citizen of ghana.in,he was convicted in england of a crime involving a controlled substance and sentenced to twelve months of imprisonment two years later,danso entered the united states without inspection.after leaving briefly in,he returned,applied for admission,and was paroled into the united states for a period of one year.
in,danso received a notice to appear,charging him with removability as an alien who has been convicted of an offense involving a controlled substance and a trafficker of controlled substances danso then filed an immigrant visa petition with the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis and an application with the ij for cancellation of removal with adjustment of status.danso was later charged with removability as an alien not in possession of a valid immigrant visa 
at a preliminary hearing before an ij,danso admitted his conviction in england,and the ij sustained the charge of removability based on that conviction.the ij did not sustain the charge based on danso alleged trafficker status.at a subsequent hearing,danso conceded removability for failure to maintain a valid immigrant visa,and the ij sustained that charge of removability as well.
at his merits hearing,danso requested that the ij suspend removal proceedings to allow the uscis to adjudicate danso pending immigrant visa petition the ij issued an oral decision denying danso requests for relief and ordering him removed from the united states.specifically,the ij denied danso request for adjustment of status or a continuance to pursue same,because,as an arriving alien in removal proceedings,he was ineligible to apply for adjustment of and denied danso requests for cancellation of removal because his inadmissibility under a a i ii barred that relief.
danso filed an appeal with the bia,asserting that the ij wrongly determined that danso was ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his prior conviction,because that conviction was expunged by effect of british law.this expungement,danso argued,is analogous to an expungement obtained under the federal first offenders act ffoa,which provides that,if specified conditions are met,the disposition of a federal simple possession offense will have no legal effect he also argued that the ij erred in determining that danso was ineligible for adjustment of status as an arriving alien in removal proceedings.after the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision,danso filed this petition for review.
ii.analysis 
danso contends that the bia violated his right to equal protection by not treating his expunged foreign conviction the same as it would a conviction expunged under the ffoa,and the bia erred as a matter of law in holding that danso was ineligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of his status.
jurisdiction 
under a c,we do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a.under a d,however,we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law.as danso petition for review presents both a constitutional claim and a separate question of law,we have jurisdiction to review it on the merits.
standard of review 
we review an alien constitutional claim de novo we also review questions of law de novo,deferring,however,to the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers 
danso claima.dillingham ins 
danso bases his claim on dillingham ins,a case in which the ninth circuit held that the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection prohibit the government from denying rehabilitation to an alien previously convicted of a simple possession offense and rehabilitated under foreign law,if his conduct would qualify him for expungement under the ffoa we turn therefore,to the applicability of the dillingham decision to the instant case.
england rehabilitation of offenders act 
as danso does here,dillingham contended that his conviction had been expunged by operation of england rehabilitation of offenders act roa.the roa provides that a conviction is treated as spent,viz.expunged,if an offender complies with his sentence and is not thereafter convicted of an offense within a statutorily specified time the duration of the rehabilitative period depends on the length of the original sentence and the age of the offender,but not on the nature of the original offense after meeting the statutory requirements,a person who has become a rehabilitated person shall be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for the offence or offences which were the subject of that conviction.
ii.federal first offenders act 
the ffoa provides that a court may place a convicted of simple possession under on probation for up to one year without entering a judgment of conviction if the offender complies with the terms of probation,the court must dismiss the proceedings against him and discharge him from probation if an offender subject to such a disposition was under the age of at the time he committed the offense,the court must,on application of the offender,direct that all references to criminal proceedings against him be expunged from official records after such an expungement,the disposition shall not be considered a conviction for the purpose of a disqualification or a disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,or for any other purpose.
iii.the ninth circuit reasoning 
in resolving dillingham claim,the ninth circuit first recognized that a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines is accorded a strong presumption of validity,and thus is subject to rational basis review the court cited its own precedent which established that expungement under the ffoa applies to removal proceedings persons who received the benefit of a state expungement law were not subject to deportation as long as they could have received the benefit of the ffoa if prosecuted under federal law,and persons found guilty of a drug offense who could not have benefited from the ffoa were not entitled to receive favorable immigration treatment,even if they qualified for rehabilitation under state law.
the court stated that the bia categorical decision not to recognize foreign expungements for simple drug possession offenses did result in differential treatment between dillingham and persons whose federal and state expungements of identical crimes were honored by the ins.after finding differential treatment,the court examined whether the difference was supported by a rational basis.it concluded that the government decision establishing an irrebuttable presumption against the validity of foreign expungements is unacceptably overbroad,and its purported interest in greater administrative efficiency does not provide a rational basis for precluding dillingham from eligibility for adjustment of status,while permitting aliens convicted domestically of identical offenses and rehabilitated under similar state and federal rehabilitative statutes to seek such relief.
finally,the dillingham court addressed whether the bia interpretation of the term conviction in a a,which was enacted after the ffoa,was entitled to chevron deference and effectively superseded the ffoa applicability to removal cases the court concluded that,because the later immigration law did not repeal the ffoa in whole or in part,the ffoa unambiguously precluded the government interpretation,making chevron deference unwarranted 
b.the bia decision 
the bia regarded danso contention that his conviction was expunged under british law as irrelevant,because the roa was clearly rehabilitative in nature and did not remove the disposition of danso criminal offense from the ambit of a a definition
