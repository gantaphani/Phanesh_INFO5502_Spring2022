opinion of the court 
mark levy filed a shareholder derivative suit on behalf of fairchild semiconductor international,fairchild against sterling holding company,llc sterling and national semiconductor corporation national for disgorgement of profits,pursuant to section b of the exchange act of.national and sterling contend that two separate sec rules,and,exempt them from section b liability.when this case was before us previously,at the stage,we ruled that neither exemption applied here.levy sterling holding levy i,cir.thereafter,however,the sec amended rules and to,as it put it,clarify the exemptive scope of these two rules,making clear that both apply to the instant fact pattern.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release amendments release.the district court then ruled in favor of national and sterling and against levy on cross motions for summary judgment.we must decide whether our rulings in levy i,or the sec rule amendments,govern the case at this stage.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that at least one of the amendments is controlling and,therefore,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to national and sterling,and its denial of summary judgment to levy.
in,fairchild was spun off from national as a new company.three classes of fairchild stock were created class a common stock class b common stock,which differed from class a common because it did not entail voting rights and preferred stock,which offered a cumulative dividend.class a common and class b common were freely convertible into each another,but preferred stock was not convertible into either class of common.national received a mix of all three classes of stock and,in exchange for its million investment in the new company,so did sterling.the only other initial investors were a number of national employees slated to become key fairchild employees.the governing shareholder agreement gave national the power to designate one of fairchild seven directors and gave sterling the power to designate two.
in,fairchild decided to undertake an initial public offering ipo to raise additional capital and was told by a number of underwriters that it should eliminate its preferred stock in order for the ipo to be successful.consistent with this advice,a majority of fairchild board voted that,as part of the ipo,all of the company outstanding shares of preferred stock would automatically be reclassified as shares of class a common stock.a majority of each of the three classes of shareholders subsequently approved the reclassification by written consent.preferred shares were to be valued at their contractual liquidation original price plus accumulated unpaid class a common shares were to be valued at the price at which the class a shares would be offered to the public in the ipo,less underwriting fees and commissions.dividing the former by the latter yielded a conversion ratio,meaning that each share of preferred stock would become shares of class a common prior to the execution of the ipo,according to the ipo prospectus,sterling owned of the outstanding class a common,of the outstanding class b common,and of the outstanding preferred,while national owned,and,respectively.
on august,the ipo was completed and the shares of preferred stock owned by sterling and national were reclassified as million and shares of class a common,respectively.on january,than six months fairchild undertaking a secondary offering of class a common stock,sterling sold million shares of class a common and national sold million shares of class a common.the share price of class a common had increased since the reclassification.
in november,levy,a fairchild shareholder,filed a derivative suit against national and sterling,pursuant to section b of the securities and exchange act of,which generally provides for the disgorgement of any profits earned by statutory insiders from trading.see b the four elements required for section b liability are a purchase of a security and a sale of that security by a director or officer of the issuer or by a beneficial owner of of any class of the issuer securities within a period.see levy i,at.as a general rule,any profits earned through transactions that meet these elements rightfully belong to the issuer.there is no mens rea b creates a strict liability regime.
according to the statute itself,the purpose of section b is preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer.b.the statute authorizes the sec to promulgate rules and regulations exempting from liability transactions that are not comprehended within this purpose.see levy i,at.exercising this authority,the sec has established a number of section b exemptions.see,to codifying sec rules,and to.
levy claimed that the reclassification of national and sterling preferred stock holdings constituted a purchase of class a common stock so that the profits that national and sterling earned from their sale of class a common less than six months later belong to fairchild.national and sterling filed motions to dismiss,contending that two separate and rule them from section b liability 
adopted in,the version of rule that was in effect until provided,in pertinent part 
transactions between an issuer and its officers or directors.
a general.a transaction between the issuer including an employee benefit plan sponsored by the issuer and an officer or director of the issuer that involves issuer equity securities shall be exempt from section b of the act if the transaction satisfies the applicable conditions set forth in this section.
d grants,awards and other acquisitions from the issuer.any transaction involving a grant,award or other acquisition from the issuer other than a discretionary transaction shall be exempt if 
the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the issuer 
the transaction is approved or ratified by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the securities of the issuer entitled to vote or 
the issuer equity securities so acquired are held by the officer or director for a period of six months following the date of such acquisition 
the version of rule,which remained in effect until,provided,in pertinent part 
mergers,reclassifications,and consolidations.
a the following transactions shall be exempt from the provisions of section b of the act 
the acquisition of a security of a company,pursuant to a merger or consolidation,in exchange for a security of a company which,prior to the merger or consolidation,owned percent or more of either 
i the equity securities of all other companies involved in the merger or consolidation,or in the case of a consolidation,the resulting company or 
ii the combined assets of all the companies involved in the merger or consolidation 
amended.even though the sec added the word reclassifications to the rule title in,the rule text did not specifically refer to them.
national and sterling argued that rule d exempted them from any liability related to the reclassification because the reclassification fit within the category of a grant,award,or other acquisition from the issuer as an other acquisition and was approved by a majority of fairchild board and a majority of the voting shareholders even though approval by either of the two would have sufficed.they maintained that rule exemption applied as well because they acquired the disputed class a common stock as part of a reclassification that met the rule requirement.
the district court granted national and sterling motions to dismiss,finding that the reclassification fell within the scope of rule and that levy section b suit thus necessarily failed.the court did not rule on the applicability of rule d.levy then appealed to our court.
in an opinion filed december,we reversed,concluding that neither rule d nor rule exempted national or sterling from section b liability.as to rule d,we reasoned that,despite the apparent of the language other acquisition from the issuer,and despite the fact that the rule made no mention of compensation,the sec intended it to apply only to transactions with a compensatory nexus.levy i,at.we reviewed in depth the release issued by the sec in in connection with the adoption of the rule,and relied on a number of excerpts that,we thought,indicated that the sec adopted the version of the rule in order to spur participation in employee benefit plans and to make it clear that the exemption applied to transactions,such as the exercise of a stock option.id.at.we did acknowledge,however,that one portion of the release appear ed to cut against our position that rule d required a compensatory nexus.id.at.in that portion,the sec explained 
new rule exempts from profit recovery any acquisitions and dispositions of issuer equity securities between an officer or director and the issuer,subject to simplified conditions.a transaction with an employee benefit plan sponsored by the issuer will be treated the same as a transaction with the issuer.however,unlike the current rule,a transaction need not be pursuant to an employee benefit plan or any compensatory program to be exempt,nor need it specifically have a compensatory element.
ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release rule release,june,emphasis added footnotes omitted.nonetheless,we concluded that the weight of the sec pronouncements on rule,and particularly rule d,suggest that the transaction should have some connection to a function.levy i,at.
examining the applicability of the exemption set forth in rule,we began our analysis by noting that the sec has not set forth its interpretation clearly so our threshold challenge is to ascertain what in fact was its interpretation.id.at.we reasoned that the sec must have added reclassifications to the rule title for a reason,but found that,u nfortunately,the title and text of the rule,standing alone,do not provide us assistance in our effort to ascertain the sec purpose.id.at.
based on a pair of sec releases,we concluded that the sec intended for rule to exempt some,but not all,reclassifications from section b liability.id.at.the first release was from,ten years before reclassifications was added to the rule title and included a question and answer regarding the rule applicability to reclassifications 
question although not specifically mentioned,does rule apply to transactions structured as statutory exchanges liquidations or reclassifications 
answer the staff is of the view that,for purposes of rule,a statutory exchange may be the substantive equivalent of a merger,consolidation or sale of assets.therefore,the acquisition and disposition of stock in a statutory exchange would be exempt under rule,assuming all of the conditions of the rule are satisfied.a liquidation,on the other hand,is not covered by rule,since the liquidation in substance and purpose bears little resemblance to the types of transactions specified in the rule.rule does not require that the security received in exchange be similar to that surrendered,and the rule can apply to transactions involving reclassifications.
interpretive release on rules applicable to insider reporting and trading,exchange act release,emphasis added footnotes omitted.essentially,we read the language can apply to mean sometimes applies.levy i,at.
the second release,from,pertained to proposed amendments to form and exempted from reporting requirements a cquisitions or dispositions pursuant to holding company formations and similar corporate reclassifications and consolidations.form disclosure of certain management transactions,exchange act release,emphasis added.it noted that t hese are the transactions exempted from section b profit recovery by exchange act rule.id.at.we reasoned that this release does not suggest that all reclassifications are per se exempt and that,because it clearly hedges on the point,it thus supports a conclusion that some but not all reclassifications are exempt from section b restrictions.levy i,at.
next,lacking specific sec guidance about which reclassifications are exempt from section b under rule,we devised a test,under which a particular reclassification would be exempt if it met the requirements that the rule clearly made applicable to mergers and consolidations and was a transaction not comprehended within the purpose of section b.id.at quoting b.
applying our test,we found that the reclassification here failed part least at the stage.id.at.we rejected national and sterling argument that the reclassification changed only the form,not the substance,of their investments in fairchild such that it did not present an opportunity for insiders to benefit over the public and thus did not implicate congress purpose in enacting section b.indeed,we concluded that it did present such an opportunity.we based our conclusion on two independent grounds.first,we found that,reading the pleadings in the light most favorable to levy,the reclassification proportionately increased national and sterling interests in fairchild by leaving them with a greater percentage of fairchild common stock.id.at.second,after contrasting the pros and cons of and ownership,we decided that the reclassification so chang ed the risks and opportunities of the preferred shareholders in fairchild that the sec would not have intended to exempt the reclassification from section b by rule.id.at.
national and sterling petitioned for rehearing,and the sec submitted an amicus brief in support.we denied the rehearing request,despite the fact that the sec maintained in its brief that our ruling in levy i was inconsistent with its view that both exemptions applied here 
in,in response to our opinion in levy i,the sec adopted amendments to rules and in order to clarify the exemptive scope of these rules,consistent with statements in previous commission releases.amendments release.at.the sec explained its disagreement with levy i and its impetus for the amendments in the adopting release 
in particular,the levy sterling opinion read rules and to require satisfaction of conditions that were neither contained in the text of the rules nor intended by the commission.the resulting uncertainty regarding the exemptive scope of these rules has made it difficult for issuers and insiders to plan legitimate transactions,and may discourage participation by officers and directors in issuer stock ownership programs or employee incentive plans.with the clarifying amendments to rules and that we adopt today,we resolve any doubt as to the meaning and interpretation of these rules by reaffirming the views we have consistently expressed previously regarding their appropriate construction.
rule d was amended to read,in pertinent part 
d acquisitions from the issuer.any transaction,other than a discretionary transaction,involving an acquisition by an officer or director from the issuer including without limitation a grant or award,whether or not intended for a compensatory or other particular purpose,shall be exempt if one of the same three conditions from the version of the rule are met.
d new material underlined.thus,there is now no doubt that rule d does not require a compensatory nexus.
rule was amended to read,in pertinent part 
a the following transactions shall be exempt from the provisions of section b of the act 
the acquisition of a security of a company,pursuant to a merger,reclassification or consolidation,in exchange for a security of a company that before the merger,reclassification or consolidation,owned percent or more of either 
i the equity securities of all other companies involved in the merger,reclassification,or consolidation,or in the case of a consolidation,the resulting company or 
ii the combined assets of all the companies involved in the merger,reclassification,or consolidation 
c the exemption provided by this section applies to any securities transaction that satisfies the conditions specified in this section and is not conditioned on the transaction satisfying any other conditions.
new material underlined.thus,there is no now no doubt that rule applies to any reclassification that meets the rule requirement.
further,the sec explicitly indicated that because the rule amendments clarify regulatory conditions that applied to that exemption since it became effective on august,they are available to any transaction on or after august,that satisfies the regulatory conditions so clarified.amendments release.at.the sec similarly made clear its view that because the rule amendments clarif y regulatory conditions that applied to that exemption since it was amended effective may,they are available to any transaction on or after may,that satisfies the regulatory conditions so clarified.id.the transaction at issue here occurred in august after both of these dates,but six years before the adoption of the clarifying regulations.
before the adoption of the amendments,levy,national,and sterling had filed cross motions for summary judgment.after the amendments were adopted,the district court denied levy motion and granted those of national and sterling,finding that the new versions of both rules applied to the reclassification and shielded national and sterling from section b liability.levy sterling holding,d.specifically,the court concluded that the new rules were permissible constructions of section b,id.at,and that applying them here would have no impermissible retroactive effect because the changes made to the old rules were clarifying rather than substantive,id.at.levy then filed this timely appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and,and we now have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to we review de novo the grant or denial of summary judgment by a district court.abramson william paterson coll.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
levy raises three issues on appeal.first,he maintains that,under the doctrine of stare decisis,the mandate that we issued in levy i requires the grant of summary judgment in his favor.second,levy contends that new rule and new rule both exceed the authority that congress delegated to the sec in section b.third,he asserts that applying either of the new rules to exempt national or sterling acquisition of class a common stock through fairchild reclassification would have an impermissible retroactive effect.levy does not argue,however,that the transactions at issue failed in any way to meet the requirements of the new rules.thus,he has effectively conceded that if we were to conclude that either of the new rules is a permissible exercise of the sec authority that may properly be applied to a reclassification,we would affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to national and sterling and its denial of his motion for summary judgment.
levy argues that the following three premises,together,require the grant of summary judgment in his favor all four elements of a section b violation were met by both national and sterling we already ruled in levy i that neither rule nor rule exempted national or sterling from liability and prior panel decisions may only be overruled by our court sitting en banc,which has not happened here.even assuming that these premises are correct,however,levy proposed conclusion does not follow from them.
in national cable telecommunications association brand x internet services,d,the supreme court left no doubt that if a court of appeals interprets an ambiguous statute one way,and the agency charged with administering that statute subsequently interprets it another way,even that same court of appeals may not then ignore the agency interpretation.in,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that broadband cable internet service constituted a telecommunications service under title ii of the communications act,a classification with significant regulatory implications.id.at.in,however,the federal communications commission fcc issued a declaratory ruling that the term telecommunications service did not encompass broadband cable internet service.id.at.when numerous parties challenged the fcc ruling,the ninth circuit held,under principles of stare decisis,that it was bound by its interpretation of telecommunications service,notwithstanding the fcc conflicting interpretation from two years later.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,explaining that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.id.at.the court reasoned that allowing a judicial precedent to foreclose an agency from interpreting an ambiguous statute would allow a court interpretation to override an agency,which would fly in the face of chevron premise that it is for agencies,not courts,to fill statutory gaps.id.further,the court emphasized,the ninth circuit approach would produce anomalous results,as the relative weight of conflicting judicial and agency interpretations of an ambiguous statute would turn on the order in which the interpretations issue.id.at.see also smiley citibank,d where a court is addressing transactions that occurred at a time when there was no clear agency guidance,it would be absurd to ignore the agency current authoritative pronouncement of what the statute means.reich sabia,cir although a panel of this court is bound by,and lacks authority to overrule,a published decision of a prior panel,a panel may reevaluate a precedent in light of intervening authority and amendments to statutes or regulations.emphasis added citation omitted.
we see no reason why these principles should not apply equally to the interpretation of a regulation.after all,w hen the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is in issue,deference is even more clearly in order.udall tallman,d see also facchiano constr.dep t of labor,cir a n administrative agency interpretation of its own regulation receives even greater deference than that accorded to its interpretation of a statute.accordingly,we conclude that a judicial opinion construing an agency regulation does not necessarily bar a court from giving effect to a subsequent,different interpretation by the agency,unless,according to the earlier opinion,the judicial construction flowed unambiguously from the terms of the regulation.to find otherwise would produce the same anomalous results that the brand x court sought to avoid,creating a rule for determining whether a judicial or administrative interpretation of a regulation is authoritative.
we reached a similar conclusion in a similar context in united states marmolejos,cir,a case that involved an amendment by the sentencing commission of an application note that accompanied an ambiguous section of the sentencing guidelines.there,we made clear that an earlier,conflicting judicial construction of the ambiguous guidelines section did not preclude us from considering the interpretation of that section provided by the commission in the application note amendment.id.at.in such a situation,we explained,this court is not bound to close its eyes to the new source of enlightenment.id.at quoting united states joshua,cir.importantly,as we noted in marmolejos,the supreme court has analogized sentencing commission commentary on the guidelines to an agency interpretation of its own rules.id.at citing stinson united states,d.
here,the new rules constitute both interpretations of a statute,as they construe the provision of section b granting the sec authority to exempt transactions not comprehended within the statute purpose,and interpretations of regulations,as they set forth the sec understanding of what the old rules meant all along.looking at the new rules from either perspective,it is clear that,notwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis,levy i does not necessarily foreclose us from considering them.in levy i,we did not conclude that section b unambiguously precluded the sec from exempting transactions like the reclassification.similarly,we did not indicate that our reading of old rule or of old rule flowed unambiguously from their terms.indeed,we struggled to divine their applicability to the instant fact pattern.with respect to rule,we concluded only that the weight of the sec pronouncements suggest ed that we should read in a compensatory nexus requirement.levy i,at emphasis added.further,we recognized that a portion of the sec adopting release appear ed to cut against this interpretation.id.as to rule,we repeatedly noted the lack of clear guidance in the text or elsewhere regarding whether and to what extent reclassifications fell within the rule scope.id.at.our conclusion as to both represented our view of what the sec probably intended.
accordingly,levy i does not control the result here simply by virtue of the fact that it came first and has not been overturned.
levy also contends that new rule and new rule are improper exercises of the authority that congress granted the sec in section b.this argument equates to a claim that both new rules are impermissible interpretations of the portion of the statute that provides that section b does not apply to any transaction or transactions which the commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.b.because chevron deference applies here,and the statutory interpretations embodied in the new rules easily pass muster under this lenient standard,we disagree with levy on this issue as well.
chevron deference applies to an agency statutory interpretation when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states.mead,d.if we determine that the situation does indeed call for chevron deference,we proceed to a inquiry.first,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if the answer is yes,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress and our inquiry ends there.id.at.if,however,the answer is no,we move on to step two,under which we must give the agency interpretation controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.in other words,where congress has left a statutory gap for the agency to fill,we must accept any interpretation by the agency that fills the gap in reasonable fashion.brand x,at.
here,congress has generally authorized the sec to make rules that have the force of law in implementing the exchange act,securities exchange act of a,a,and has specifically authorized it to create binding exemptions from profit recovery,b.because the sec was acting pursuant to this authority when it promulgated new rule and new rule,chevron deference clearly applies.see amendments release.at nn.further,by broadly pronouncing that section b does not apply to any transaction or transactions which the commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection,b,congress certainly left a gap for the agency to fill.thus,the key question for us to answer is whether it was reasonable for the sec to think that the transactions exempted by the new rules are not comprehended within the purpose of section b.
as noted above,section b purpose is preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer.b.the supreme court has expanded upon this purpose 
the general purpose of congress in enacting s ection b is well known.congress recognized that insiders may have access to information about their corporations not available to the rest of the investing public.by trading on this information,these persons could reap profits at the expense of less well informed investors.in s ection b congress sought to curb the evils of insider trading by taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.it accomplished this by defining directors,officers,and beneficial owners as those presumed to have access to inside information and enacting a flat rule that a corporation could recover the profits these insiders made on a pair of security transactions within six months.

in the adopting release,the sec explained why it believed the transactions exempted by new rule between directors or officers and the not comprehended within this purpose 
typically,where the issuer,rather than the trading markets,is on the other side of an officer or director transaction in the issuer equity securities,any profit obtained is not at the expense of uninformed shareholders and other market participants of the type contemplated by the statute.

in other words,the purchase of securities from,or sale of securities to,the issuer by a director or officer does not present the same informational asymmetry,and associated opportunity for speculative abuse,that,according to the supreme court,congress was targeting in enacting section b.because this rationale is perfectly applies equally whether or not the transaction has a compensatory conclude that new rule is a permissible construction of section b and a valid exercise of the sec congressionally delegated authority the two courts of appeals that have considered this question reached the same conclusion.roth perseus,cir dreiling am.express,cir.
as for new rule,the sec explained in the adopting release that it is based on the premise that the exempted transactions including reclassifications are of relatively minor importance to the shareholders of a particular company and do not present significant opportunities to insiders to profit by advance information concerning the transaction.amendments release.at.indeed,the sec continued,by satisfying either of the rule ownership tests,an exempted transaction does not significantly alter the economic investment held by the insider before the transaction.id.in essence,the sec position is that reclassifications,in addition to mergers and consolidations,that meet the requirement do not pose much risk of abuse of inside information because they usually change merely the form of the insider investment in the issuer.id.we think this is a reasonable explanation as to why the exempted transactions are not comprehended within the purpose of section b and,therefore,conclude that new rule,like new rule,is a permissible construction of section b and a valid exercise of the authority delegated to the sec by congress.we note that the only other court of appeals to have faced this issue as to rule agreed,finding that new rule falls safely within the commission delegated authority.bruh bessemer venture partners iii,cir.
finally,levy contends that,even if levy i does not bind us for any of the reasons discussed above,and even if the new rules are permissible constructions of section b,actually applying the new rules here to the reclassification would have an impermissible retroactive effect 
drawing on the principle that r etroactivity is not favored in the law,the supreme court held in bowen georgetown university hospital,d,that an agency may not promulgate rules that operate retroactively unless congress has expressly delegated to it the authority to do so.however,we have held that a new rule should not be deemed to be retroactive in its thus does not implicate the supreme court concerns in it d oes not alter existing rights or obligations but merely clarifie s what those existing rights and obligations ha ve always been.appalachian states radioactive waste comm,cir.thus,where a new rule constitutes a than a substantive the law as it existed beforehand,the application of that new rule to conduct necessarily does not have an impermissible retroactive effect,regardless of whether congress has delegated retroactive rulemaking power to the agency.
many of our sister courts of appeals have endorsed similar approaches,finding retroactivity to be a with respect to new laws that clari
