opinion of the court 
michael nelson petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals,which concluded that he had not accumulated the seven years of continuous residence in the united states necessary to be eligible for cancellation of removal under.we will deny the petition.
nelson is a native and citizen of jamaica who was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident on november.in early,less than five years after his admission to the united states,nelson pleaded guilty in new york state court to possession of approximately ounces of marijuana the conviction.
in august,nelson visited canada for two days.although his conviction rendered him inadmissible to the united states,nelson was nonetheless allowed to reenter the country through a border checkpoint.following his reentry,he did not leave the united states again and lived here without interruption.
on november,nelson was arrested in new jersey after attempting to retrieve a package containing a substantial amount of marijuana that had been mailed to a sears auto center.in may,he was tried by a jury in new jersey state court and found guilty of attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of,the convictions.he proceeded to challenge these convictions on direct appeal.
on november,the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear asserting that nelson was removable because his convictions constituted aggravated felonies and controlled substances offenses pursuant to a a iii and b i.the immigration judge ij originally found nelson removable based on these convictions,but later withdrew those findings after nelson established that the convictions were on direct appeal and thus were not final.
on september,dhs issued additional removal charges based instead on nelson conviction.nelson,for his part,subsequently applied for cancellation of removal.after finding nelson removable based on the conviction,the ij denied his application for cancellation of removal,concluding that nelson had not accrued the required seven years of continuous residence in the united states necessary to be eligible for that relief.in particular,the ij found that nelson drug offense triggered the provision of d l,and ended his period of continuous residence short of the statutory threshold.furthermore,the ij determined that nelson was not permitted to start a new period of continuous residence based on his reentry to the united states following his trip to canada in.
nelson appealed to the bia.on appeal,nelson conceded his removability based on the conviction,but argued that the ij erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal for failure to meet the residence requirement.he did not dispute that his conviction was an event that interrupted his continuous residence.rather,he argued that,based on this court decision in okeke gonzales,cir,he was entitled to establish a new period of continuous residence after his reentry to the united states in.
on february,the bia issued a precedential decision affirming the ij and dismissing nelson appeal.in re nelson,bia.the bia distinguished okeke and concluded that the clock does not start anew simply because an alien departs and reenters the united states following the commission of a triggering offense.because the bia found nelson removable based exclusively on the conviction,it refused to address the convictions or dhs claim that nelson direct appeal from those convictions had been dismissed.nelson petitioned for review of the bia decision.
we have jurisdiction to review the decision of the bia under a.because the bia issued its own opinion,and did not simply adopt the opinion of the ij,we review only the bia decision as the final agency decision.sarango attorney general,cir.however,to the extent the bia deferred to or adopted the ij reasoning,we also look to and consider the decision of the ij on those points.see chavarria gonzalez,cir.we review the bia conclusions of law de novo,but give chevron deference to its interpretation of the immigration and nationality act.id.citing ins aguirre aguirre,d.under the familiar chevron inquiry,first,if the statute is clear we must give effect to congress unambiguous intent,and,second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue,we defer to an implementing agency reasonable interpretation of that statute.de leon ochoa attorney general,cir.
the relevant statute in this case is,which provides that aliens may be eligible for cancellation of removal if they meet certain requirements.the precise eligibility requirements depend on the alien status as a permanent resident or a nonpermanent resident.with respect to permanent residents,the statute provides that 
the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
a the crucial provision for purposes of this petition is the requirement of a continuous residence in the united states.
with respect to the residency requirement,the statute contains a section on the t reatment of certain breaks in presence.in particular,it states that a n alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence if the alien has departed from the united states for any period in excess of days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding days.id.d.more importantly for nelson,however,the statute also contains a provision calling for the termination of an alien continuous period of residence,stating 
any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end a when the alien is served a notice to appear under section a of this title,or b when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section a of this title that renders the alien inadmissible to the united states or removable from the united states,whichever is earliest.
id.d l.this section is known as the provision of the statute.
both this court and the bia have analyzed and elaborated on the provision of.in in re mendoza sandino,bia mendoza sandino,the bia held that,once an alien period of continuous presence or residence is terminated by the provision through service of a notice to appear or commission of a specified offense it does not restart,and the alien does not automatically begin accruing a new period following the cessation of the first one.in reaching that conclusion,the bia focused on the language and structure of the statute,particularly the fact that the service of a notice to appear or commission of a crime are said to end the alien period of continuous presence.the board contrasted that with the provision of the statute identifying events that merely break the alien period of continuous presence 
congress has distinguished between certain actions that end continuous physical presence,service of a charging document or commission of a specified crime,and certain departures from the country that only temporarily break that presence.service of a notice to appear is not included as an interruptive event under the statute,which merely breaks continuous physical presence.rather such service is deemed to end an alien presence completely.therefore,a reading of the statute that would allow an alien to accrue a new period of continuous physical presence after the service of a charging document is not supported by the language of the statute.
id.at.accordingly,the bia concluded that the language of the statute reflects that service of a notice to appear is not simply an interruptive event that resets the continuous physical presence clock,but is a terminating event,after which continuous physical presence can no longer accrue.id.at emphasis supplied.
we have held that the mendoza sandino decision is reasonable and entitled to chevron deference.briseno flores attorney general,cir.
