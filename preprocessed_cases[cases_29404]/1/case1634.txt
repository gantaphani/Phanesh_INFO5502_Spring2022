the national labor relations board the board seeks enforcement of a broad cease and desist order issued against the united states postal service facility in waco,texas the postal for repeated failures to respond to union information requests.there is no dispute over the facts the postal service concedes that numerous information request violations occurred.the only issue on review is whether the cease and desist order is overly broad.we find that it is and modify the order accordingly.
in october,the board found that the postal had committed twelve violations of the national labor relations act nlra a and a,a and a,by failing or refusing to furnish timely furnish the postal workers union with presumptively relevant requested information.in march,the postal instituted new information request procedures in an attempt to prevent future information request violations.evidence reveals that these procedures were not always followed.in july,the union charged further violations for failing or refusing to furnish requested information.an administrative law judge alj confirmed that violations occurred,finding that over the period at issue,may and june,the postal did not respond to four of information requests.
after the first series of violations in,the alj imposed a narrow cease and desist order,which prohibited the postal from violating the act in any like or related manner to the information request violations.this order would allow contempt proceedings against the postal if evidence suggested it had committed further information request violations.the second series of violations,in,took place prior to our enforcement of the narrow order that is,the narrow order was not in effect at the time the second violations occurred and contempt proceedings were not yet available.thus,as a result of the second series of violations,the alj imposed a broader cease and desist order this time the order prohibited the postal from i n any other manner interfering with,restraining,or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed them by section of the act.section of the nlra,sets out all of the rights of employees and provides 
employees shall have the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section a.
id.subsequently,the board affirmed the broad cease and desist order,over the objection of one board member.
we review the board findings of fact for substantial evidence.e the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion.valmont indus.nlrb,cir quoting universal camera nlrb.
although t he nlrb legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,nlrb thermon heat tracing,cir,we review the propriety of the board remedial orders under a more deferential standard.nlrb laredo packing,cir the board remedial power in this regard is wide and discretionary subject to scanty judicial review.the board order must not be disturbed unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the act.nlrb dmr,cir quoting virginia electric power nlrb.but the act regulatory framework under which we have the authority to review orders,nlra e,e,foresees the role of the court as more than mere perfunctory executors of the board unrestrained will.nlrb ford motor,cir.therefore,we will generally defer to the board remedial decisions where it acts within its statutory authority,though we will review the board orders to ensure that it does not exceed that statutory authority.see may dep t stores nlrb.while the board has been delegated initially the exclusive authority to prevent unfair labor practices,courts,which are called upon to enforce such orders by their own decrees,may examine its scope to see whether,on the evidence,they go so beyond the authority of the board as to require modification as a matter of law before enforcement.
the board statutory authority to issue cease and desist orders stems from nlra c,c,which states that where the board determines a violation of the act has occurred,the board shall cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice as will effectuate the policies of this act.id.of this statutory provision,the supreme court has stated,
under c,the board authority to remedy unfair labor practices is expressly limited by the requirement that its orders effectuate the policies of the act.although this rather vague statutory command obviously permits the board broad discretion,at a minimum it encompasses the requirement that a proposed remedy be tailored to the unfair labor practice it is intended to redress.
nlrb.see also nlrb district,united mine workers.the board discretionary authority to fashion remedies to purge unfair labor practices necessarily has a broad reach.but the power is not limitless it is contained by the requirement that the remedy shall be appropriate,and shall be adapted to the situation which calls for redress.internal citations omitted.this is consistent with the remedial nature of the board authority.see florida steel nlrb,cir we have held many times that the orders of the board are required to be remedial and not punitive.
thus,the question before us is whether the cease and desist order in this case,covering the entirety of section,is tailored to the unfair labor practice it is intended to redress.we are aided in this task by the extensive caselaw,both from the supreme court and within this circuit,speaking to the propriety broad cease and desist specifically addressing orders prohibiting any violation of section,as the board imposed here.the caselaw establishes that such broad orders will rarely be justified.
in nlrb express publishing,the supreme court discussed at length the board ability to issue broad cease and desist orders.id.at.there the court made clear that cease and desist orders reaching other violations beyond those proven are disfavored.the court established a high standard to warrant the use of such an order,stating,to justify an order restraining other violations it must appear that they bear some resemblance to that which the employer has committed or that danger of their commission in the future is to be anticipated from the course of his conduct in the past.id.at.in that case,the board found that the respondent had refused to bargain,as required by the act,and imposed an order direct ing respondent not to violate in any manner the duties imposed on the employer by the statute.id.at.to the extent that the order prohibited the respondent from interfering with the employees right to bargain,the court found it unproblematic.but the court restricted the scope of the order where it prohibited conduct unrelated to the bargaining violations proven.id.at.an appropriate order in the circumstances of the present case would go no further than to restrain respondent from any refusal to bargain and from any other acts in any manner interfering with the guild efforts to negotiate.
the judicial authority to enjoin actions is broad but with clear boundaries,requiring some relation between the acts proven and the acts restrained.id.at.a federal court has broad power to restrain acts which are of the same type or class as unlawful acts which the court has found to have been committed or whose commission in the future,unless enjoined,may fairly be anticipated from the defendant conduct in the past.the court determined that,as a matter of congressional intent,the board authority to issue orders should be similarly limited.id.w e can hardly suppose that cong
