opinion of the court 
this appeal,in an action seeking federal injunctive relief from state disciplinary proceedings against a medical practitioner,raises important questions concerning the application of the doctrines of preemption and abstention.the new jersey state attorney general attorney general instituted disciplinary proceedings against kenneth zahl,zahl,alleging,inter alia,violations of the federal medicare statute and regulations.zahl sought an injunction in the united states district court for the district of new jersey to restrain the attorney general from pursuing adjudication of two counts of the administrative complaint complaint in the pending action before the new jersey state board of medical examiners board.zahl asserts that the two counts he challenges,involving allegations of medicare fraud,are preempted by g and h.therefore,he contends that the board lacks jurisdiction over the proceedings pending against him.the district court dismissed the complaint on grounds of abstention.we affirm.
zahl,a anesthesiologist licensed by the state of new jersey to practice medicine and surgery,founded the ridgedale surgery center in cedar knolls,new jersey,and became its medical director.the surgery carries medicare certification.there,zahl frequently performed a procedure known as nerve block,a form of local anesthesia administered by injection.unlike general anesthesia,where the patient is unconscious during surgery,the anesthesiologist need not be in the patient presence throughout the operation or other medical procedure.typically,zahl would have one patient in the operating room,undergoing a procedure performed by a surgeon,while zahl simultaneously administered nerve block to another patient.thus,while administering nerve blocks,zahl would usually treat two patients simultaneously,administering and monitoring one patient being prepared for surgery,and monitoring another patient undergoing surgery.counts one and two of the attorney general complaint allege improprieties in zahl method for billing nerve blocks under medicare.
the billing issue involves payments for medical services under medicare part medicare part b is administered by the united states department of health and human services hhs.hhs employs contractors called carriers,who review and pay medicare claims on its behalf.for the period relevant to this case through march,xact medicare services xact served as new jersey part b carrier.from march onward,empire medicare services has been new jersey part b carrier.
medicare uses a system of codes known as cpt codes cpt.each cpt describes a different medical procedure.zahl believes that nerve blocks should not be billed on the basis of time spent,but that the proper billing method is to charge for each procedure performed.thus,zahl billed separately for each nerve block.in late,xact subjected zahl billing method to a focused review.as a result,zahl was ordered to refund money paid for approximately nerve blocks and to the procedures under a cpt relating to time spent.zahl complied,but wrote a letter to xact stating that he would bill for overlapping time for each nerve block he performed.xact never responded,and zahl continued to bill for overlapping time.eventually,xact investigated zahl billing method and,inter alia,made a preliminary finding that he had improperly billed for overlapping,concurrent time periods.
in august,the attorney general filed a complaint with the board seeking to suspend zahl license to practice medicine and surgery in new jersey.the first two counts of the complaint allege that the method zahl used to bill nerve blocks amounted to medicare fraud,and thus violated stat.ann.b and e the attorney general,believing that there were no genuine issues of material fact arising from the allegations,moved for a board order granting summary decision.the board required zahl to appear before it to explain why the board should not enter an order granting the attorney general motion for summary decision.zahl denied the substantive charges and the board denied the motion for summary judgment.it referred the case to the new jersey office of administrative law oal for plenary hearing.
the attorney general filed a motion with the administrative law judge alj for partial summary decision on,inter alia,counts one and two.zahl filed a to dismiss the counts.although oral argument on the motion and was held in april,the alj has not yet rendered his decision.
in march,zahl filed a complaint with the united states district court seeking an injunction to restrain the board from pursuing the administrative prosecution of him based upon any allegations of violation of the federal medicare statute or its regulations.the plaintiff contended that the federal government enactment of the medicare statutes preempted the state action and that pursuant to h,as made applicable to medicare claims by,g provides the exclusive jurisdictional grant for judicial review of medicare claims.he,therefore,asserts that as a matter of federal law,the defendants lack jurisdiction to take action against him or his license to practice medicine until the secretary of health and human services has made a determination that has been reviewed by the federal courts.
the district court concluded that the new jersey attorney general is not pursuing a claim under medicare or challenging a medicare regulation or practice.the court rejected zahl contentions that congress had preempted the field so as to preclude the state agencies from proceeding with their disciplinary proceedings raising issues under medicare law.accordingly,it dismissed the complaint on the ground of abstention.
on appeal,zahl argues that the district court erred by abstaining.we review the district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion.schall joyce,cir.we exercise plenary review,however,over the underlying legal determinations of whether the abstention requirements have been met.focus allegheny county court of common pleas,cir.
the district court abstained under principles promulgated by the united states supreme court in younger harris,d.in younger,the federal district court had enjoined younger,the district attorney of los angeles county,from prosecuting harris under a state statute.id.the supreme court reversed,finding the injunction a violation of the national policy forbidding federal courts from stay ing or enjoin ing pending state court proceedings except under special circumstances.id.at.
although younger involved a state court criminal proceeding,the national policy against enjoining pending state court proceedings has since been extended to noncriminal judicial proceedings,middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d the policies underlying younger are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.administrative proceedings are also subject to younger abstention,id.abstention when pending state bar disciplinary proceeding williams red bank bd.of,cir abstention when pending state administrative tenure proceeding against school teacher.
the united states supreme court has laid out a test for determining whether abstention is appropriate.abstention is appropriate when there is a pending state judicial proceeding the proceeding implicates important state interests and the state proceeding affords an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.garden state,at.even if this test is met,however,abstention is not appropriate if the plaintiff establishes that extraordinary circumstances exist such that deference to the state proceeding will present a significant and immediate potential for irreparable harm to the federal interests asserted.schall joyce,cir.
aside from incorrectly asserting that his is not a constitutional challenge,zahl does not challenge the district court holding that the test has been met.we briefly apply the garden state test to this case.the state proceedings are clearly judicial in nature,and therefore meet the first part of the test.the proceedings are being conducted before an alj pursuant to new jersey uniform enforcement act uea,stat.ann.to,and new jersey administrative procedu
