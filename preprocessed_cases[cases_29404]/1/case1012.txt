opinion of the court 
the port authority of new york and new jersey authority appeals the district court summary judgment,which orders the authority to make modifications to its grove street station to bring it into compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada of,stat.codified as amended at.we will vacate this judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.in a,plaintiffs heightened independence and progress,hip,the united spinal association,and peter gimbel appeal the district court order dismissing their claims on the basis that allowing such claims to proceed would violate the interstate compact between new york and new jersey that created the authority.that order of the district court will be affirmed.
the authority wholly owned subsidiary,the port authority trans hudson corporation path,operates the grove street station in jersey city,new jersey,which is the subject of this lawsuit.the station has three levels street,mezzanine,and platform and two entrance sides east and west.the station can serve an train.the mezzanine is not connected between the east and west sides.one staircase connects the east mezzanine to a corridor,which leads out to the platform itself.
the station was built in,and in the path closed the east entrance and constructed two entrances on the west side.as reflected in a report,in path planned to expand the station to accommodate trains and persons with disabilities,a project that would have involved the construction of a new entrance and two elevators on the west side.after september,and the resulting closure of two of the authority stations exchange place in new jersey and world trade center in manhattan ridership increased at the grove street station.citing concerns about congestion and safety,path scrapped its renovation plans and undertook a different fast track project to reopen the east entrance.
construction began in and concluded in.the project involved building a new pavilion and focused on renovating the connections between the street and mezzanine levels on the east side only.the pavilion was built four inches above the sidewalk to comply with construction requirements,and stairs were installed to connect the sidewalk and the building,which is also referred to as a headhouse.the mezzanine was expanded to include a new area.in addition,the platform corridor was reopened and the interior spaces connecting the three levels were rehabilitated.to complete the project,path purchased land adjacent to the station from a private company.
in,after path had finished construction,its engineering department concluded that elevator installation was feasible only on the west side of the station.path believed that the platform would be too crowded with an elevator,leading to safety concerns,and that construction on the east side would result in service disruption and possible flooding.
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in state court in,and the authority removed the case to the district court.the complaint alleges that the grove street station renovations triggered an obligation under the ada to make the station accessible to handicapped persons.it also alleges violations under new jersey law against discrimination and certain new jersey construction code provisions.the district court dismissed the claims,reasoning that,under the terms of the interstate compact that created the authority,one state can not unilaterally regulate the joint entity.see hip,port auth.of hip i,wl,at.following further proceedings and failed settlement attempts,the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court entered summary judgment for plaintiffs.during discovery,five schemes for making the east entrance were produced,and the authority engineering department evaluated each of those schemes.the court held that of the five,two schemes and,which propose installation of a limited use limited access lula elevator are feasible.consequently,the court ordered the authority to make the east entrance accessible.hip,port auth.of hip ii,wl,at.the parties timely filed notices of appeal.
the ada is a complex law codified in numerous statutes in the united states code.regulations have been promulgated by the department of transportation to implement those statutes.and pursuant to,the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board has issued a set of ada accessibility guidelines adaag.the department of justice produces an ada technical assistance manual,which provides still further guidance.the litigants here dispute the interpretation of several of these provisions as applied to the grove street station construction project.
for example,and as a preliminary matter,the regulations and the adaag impose different obligations on different kinds of construction projects.new facility construction is distinguished from the alteration of existing facilities.see,adaag,regents of mercersburg coll.republic franklin ins,cir.the adaag also recognizes another category of construction,addition,though it treats additions largely as alterations.adaag.generally,the ada is more onerous on new construction projects than it is on alterations.
the district court treated the station renovations as an alteration but recognized that they may also qualify as new construction addition.hip ii,wl,at.on appeal,plaintiffs urge application of the rules,arguing that the headhouse is an entirely new structure.we reject this argument for two reasons.first,plaintiffs notice of appeal unambiguously specifies only the district court dismissal order,and not its summary judgment.see fed.c b the notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.in fact,the notice of appeal indicates it appeals the dismissal order only insofar as the order dismisses with prejudice the new jersey state law claims raised in the complaint.ja.although there are circumstances under which we may review an order not specified in the notice of appeal,none is present in this appeal.see sulima tobyhanna army depot,cir.while we have jurisdiction to review the summary judgment because the authority has appealed that order,we will not entertain plaintiffs challenge to an order from which they failed to appeal.
second,we think the district court characterization of the construction project as an alteration was sound.the regulations clearly distinguish between new construction and alterations,and because the obligations of the builder under each scheme are different,a given construction project must be classified as one or the other.an alteration is a change to an existing facility,including,but not limited to,remodeling,renovation,rehabilitation,reconstruction,historic restoration,changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements,and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and partitions.the grove street station project plainly falls under this definition,and it would be a stretch to claim that the station,which existed in substantially the same form and for the same purpose prior to the renovation,is a new facility.moreover,the modifications clearly exceeded the scope of the definitional exclusions from alteration,such as n ormal maintenance,reroofing,painting or wallpapering,because they affect ed the usability of the building or facility.id.accordingly,in this case we will apply only the ada provisions applicable to alterations.
as noted,this case comes to us on the appeal of an order resolving for summary judgment.when reviewing a district court summary judgment decision in an ada case,we exercise plenary review,applying the same standard as the district court.sulima,at citing turner hershey chocolate usa,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.accord.a.in considering plaintiffs and the authority motions,we must construe facts and draw inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.ex rel.snyder blue mountain sch,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.
the touchstone of our analysis in this appeal is the authority obligation triggered because it altered the station to make the station accessible to the maximum extent feasible.this requirement appears in a and a,as well as in the technical infeasibility guideline,adaag j,which is discussed in greater detail below.
as used in this section,the phrase to the maximum extent feasible applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration.in these circumstances,the entity shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible.any altered features of the facility or portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible.if providing accessibility to certain individuals with disabilities,those who use wheelchairs would not be feasible,the facility shall be made accessible to individuals with other types of disabilities,those who use crutches,those who have impaired vision or hearing,or those who have other impairments.
b.where we discuss feasibility in this opinion,we do so only for the sake of expedience,recognizing that the actual standard to the maximum extent feasible is much more demanding.
having discerned the appropriate regulatory framework that governs this appeal,we turn to the substantive disputes.the authority proffers five reasons why it is entitled to summary judgment or,alternatively,summary judgment was wrongly entered for plaintiffs.two of these arguments that the ada did not require the authority to make the platform accessible because it was not an altered portion of the facility,a,and that the authority was excused from making modifications because the cost of those changes would have been disproportionate,e f were not preserved in the district court,so we will not consider them here tri m,llc sharp,cir.that leaves three of the authority arguments for us to resolve first,the accessibility modifications ordered by the district court could not have been accomplished because they would require the acquisition of subterranean property rights currently owned by jersey city second,the ordered modifications would have been technically infeasible under adaag j,or,in the alternative,there are triable factual disputes regarding technical infeasibility and third,the ordered modifications would not have been feasible because,if implemented,the station might not have complied with national fire protection association standard nfpa,a code the authority has adopted.we hold that neither side is entitled to summary judgment on these issues.
in considering the parties arguments under the ada,it is important to bear in mind that the ada obligations are triggered at the time the construction is undertaken,not after it has been completed and litigation has commenced.see roberts royal atl,cir describing the inquiry as.consequently,in assessing whether the authority has violated the ada,we evaluate the circumstances as of the time of construction.questions of the feasibility of a proposed modification,then,are directed not toward whether it would be feasible to execute the modification today,but rather whether it would have been feasible between and.the district court did not address this question,but,rather,chose from the options for reconstructing the station that were presented as feasible after the fact.we can not endorse this approach,and,accordingly,will remand for consideration of feasibility anew,as of the time of construction.the parties present us with numerous arguments as to why it would or would not have been feasible to make grove street station as part of the project at that time by installing an elevator to the platform level.these arguments were addressed to and in some instances,ruled upon by the district court as part of the summary judgment motion proceedings.we will proceed to consider them.
the authority first preserved argument is that the ada does not and can not mandate a public transit authority to purchase subterranean property rights held by another party,which it would be required to do under schemes and.it frames this argument under adaag j,which states that if compliance with the alteration guideline is technically infeasible,the alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible,and defines technically infeasible to mean,in relevant part,that other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements,spaces,or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility.adaag j.we agree with the parties that the authority bears the burden of proving technical infeasibility,as j acts as a kind of affirmative defense to otherwise applicable ada compliance requirements.roberts,at discussing borkowski valley cent.sch,cir holding in a title iii ada case that the plaintiff need only mak e a facially plausible demonstration that the modification is an alteration before the burden shifts to the defendant to show it is not an alteration turner,at observing that a disabled employee must make a prima facie showing that a proposed accommodation is possible before the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the accommodation is unreasonable or unduly burdensome.
in disabled in action of pennsylvania southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority dia septa,cir,we considered a similar issue regarding whether a district court can order ada compliance notwithstanding the fact that the defendant does not presently possess property rights necessary to make the ordered modifications.in that case,dia sued septa and the city of philadelphia over accessibility barriers at two subway access points,the street courtyard and city hall courtyard.id.at.early in the litigation,the city and dia reached a settlement in which the city agreed to allow septa to build an elevator on its property at the street courtyard and was dismissed from the suit as a result.id.we affirmed the district court order that septa make both courtyards accessible.id.at.because compliance at the city hall courtyard also required use of the city property,septa argued that the court could not order modification of that site without rejoining the city in the suit.id.ultimately rejecting septa argument for the necessity of joinder pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,we reasoned that because the city had already settled with dia with respect to the other location,the city must have be en aware of dia current position,and that the fact that the issue had not yet arisen in the lower court meant it did not pose a significant hurdle to relief.id.at.the majority of the panel concluded that septa would have to work with the city in complying with its decision,something the city ha d already agreed to do with respect to the street courtyard.id.
of course here,unlike dia,we have less of a clear indication that jersey city is willing to cooperate with the authority in making the station accessible.though plaintiffs have presented evidence that the mayor has indicated that the city could allow access to the property,it is the city council that must vote on any such matter.because we lack any similar indication from the city council,we can not assume that the authority will be able to acquire the land rights it needs to implement scheme or.accordingly,summary judgment need not be entered for the authority,either.
as we see it,the mere fact that the authority would now have to acquire land from a is not sufficient to render the proposed accommodations per se infeasible.indeed,in considering feasibility,as we must,as of the time of the original construction,the authority may have been able to negotiate for the use or ownership of the relevant land in the manner it had to facilitate construction of the headhouse for the east entrance.in light of the mayor letter to the plaintiffs,this may still be the case.there is,however,an open factual question as to whether the relief ordered by the district court would now be ineffective because the city council might refuse to negotiate a subterranean easement or sale to the authority.on this point,we remand for further dev
