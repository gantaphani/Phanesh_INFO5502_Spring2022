this appeal arises from a dispute over the right of fishermen to access the atlantic sea scallop fishery.at issue is an order of the united states district court for the district of new jersey denying summary judgment on all claims by appellants,who are former general category scallop permit holders,while granting summary judgment on all claims to appellees gary locke,in his capacity as secretary of the united states department of commerce,national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa,and national marine fisheries service nmfs.we are asked to resolve whether nmfs complied with the administrative procedures act apa,and the fishery conservation and management act of act,when it promulgated regulations implementing amendment to the atlantic sea scallop fishery management plan,including a control date that effectively terminated the access rights of general scallop fishermen who were not established in the fishery prior to november,whether the process by which amendment was adopted complied with the act requirement that public hearings be held in appropriate locations in the geographical area that will be affected by changes to a fishery management plan fmp whether nmfs reasonably concluded that amendment reliance on nmfs internal dataset to determine permit eligibility complied with the act national standard,which requires the use of the best scientific information available and whether nmfs reasonably concluded that amendment limitations on the general category scallop fishery were consistent with the act national standard,which prohibits the implementation of any fishery management measure that has economic allocation as its sole purpose.we will affirm the judgment of the district court 
the act,as amended by congress in and,delegates to nmfs,by and through the secretary of commerce,the authority to implement a comprehensive national fisheries management program in order to prevent overfishing,to rebuild overfished stocks,to insure conservation,to facilitate protection of essential fish habitats,and to realize the full potential of the nation fishery resources.see a the secretary authority is exercised through eight regional fishery management councils composed of state fishery managers,the regional nmfs fisheries administrator,and representatives of the fishing,environmental,and academic communities.the councils are responsible for preparing fmps and recommending implementing regulations for the exclusive economic zone that stretches nautical miles seaward from the coastal boundaries of the states within each region the task of approving an fmp falls to the secretary of commerce,who is mandated to review the fmp to ensure that it complies with the ten national standards established by the act see a.the secretary must also publish the proposed fmp and accept public comment for a period before giving his or her final approval.a b.an implementing regulation goes through the same process of review,although the secretary may limit the period for public comment to a minimum of days.b a.nmfs is the executive agency responsible for overseeing the enforcement of an approved fmp and any of its attendant regulations.
the new england fishery management council and the scallop fishery 
the development of the atlantic sea scallop fmp is the responsibility of the new england fishery management council nefmc.all parties agree that the nefmc is not an agency within the meaning of the apa.in,the limited access scallop fmp then in place was amended amendment to provide for an open access fishery to allow a flexible program for seasonal or opportunistic fisheries targeting inshore scallops.both limited access and open access general category scalloping permits authorized the harvest of up to pounds of atlantic sea scallops daily.only scallop boats,however,were eligible for the limited access permits.scallop fishing vessels and vessels that harvested scallops as an incidental bycatch were issued general category permits.the appellants are general category scallop fishermen.
after the passage of amendment,the number of general category permit holders exploded,fueling concerns about overfishing these concerns prompted the nefmc to consider regulatory responses to limit the number of participants in the general category scallop fishery.on august,the nefmc published a notice of a public meeting in the federal register announcing a meeting to be held from september,in fairhaven,massachusetts,to consider actions affecting new england fisheries in the exclusive economic zone.according to the meeting agenda,among the issues that might be discussed were actions to address overfishing and actions to cap or reduce general category scallop landings improve reporting measures.
during the meeting,nefmc thomas hill announced his intention to propose a motion to establish a control date effective upon publication of the federal register that would freeze the number of permits in the fishery.one of the participants maggie raymond of the associated fisheries of maine objected that the subject of a control date was not posted on the agenda and so this would be the only opportunity for the public to speak to that.hill replied that the nefmc never notifie s the public in advance,because it defeats the purpose of the control date if you notify in advance.hill motion to publish notice of a control date for the general category permit scallop fishery was adopted by a vote,with two abstentions.
nmfs published the notice in the federal register on november.in relevant part,the advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr sought public comment on 
proposed rulemaking to control future access to the open access vessel permit category general category atlantic sea scallop fishery if a management regime is developed and implemented under the act to limit the number of participants in this sector of the scallop fishery this announcement is intended,in part,to promote awareness of potential eligibility criteria for future access so as to discourage speculative entry into the fishery while the nefmc considers whether and how access to the general category sea scallop fishery could be controlled.the date of publication of this notice,november,shall be known as the control date and may be used for establishing eligibility criteria for determining levels of future access to the sea scallop fishery subject to federal authority.
in january of,the nefmc initiated a scoping process inviting the fishing public to participate in the crafting of amendment to the atlantic sea scallop fmp as announced,the purpose of amendment was to establish criteria and authority for determining the percentage of scallop catch allocated to the general category fleet and to implement an individual fishing quota ifq permit system.between february of and june of,the nefmc held public meetings in seven states to discuss the adoption of amendment.on april,the nefmc submitted a draft supplemental environmental impact statement to nmfs,the final version of which was submitted to nmfs on september.the nefmc formally adopted amendment on june.on december,nmfs published amendment in the federal register with its proposed implementing regulations and invited public comment through january.on february,nmfs adopted amendment on behalf of the secretary of commerce.the final rule was published on april,and took effect on july.
amendment significantly reduced the number of vessels eligible to participate in the scallop harvest by replacing the open access general category fishery with a limited access general category lagc.amendment provides for three classes of lagc scalloping permits an ifq permit a northern gulf of maine permit and an incidental catch permit.at issue in this appeal is the ifq permit,which allows a permittee to land up to pounds of shucked scallop meat per trip 
to be eligible for an ifq permit,nmfs records must confirm that the applicant vessel landed at least pounds of scallop meat in any fishing year between march,and november.the vessel must also have been issued a general category scallop permit during the fishing year in which the qualifying landing was made.the individual quota is determined by a formula that weights the vessel best year of scalloping and the number of years it has been actively engaged in scallop fishing.these numbers are derived from nmfs landings data compiled from dealer reports.a vessel owner may appeal the denial of a permit to nmfs,but only on the ground that the data nmfs relied on to determine eligibility was incorrect 
amendment also allocates the scallop harvest between the limited access fleet and the lagc permit holders the estimated landings of scallops by boats with incidental catch permits are first subtracted from the projected annual scallop harvest.ifq permit holders are then allocated five percent of the remaining catch,while almost all of the rest is apportioned to the limited access scallop fishery most of the appellant fishermen received their first general scallop permit after the control date of november,thus,they are not eligible to receive lagc scallop permits.for all practical purposes,their scallop fishing days are over.
standard of review

issue the november,control date 
the principal argument made by the appellant fishermen is that the district court erred in determining that the nefmc control date recommendation was not subject to the rulemaking provisions of the apa they reason that because noaa and nmfs are agencies that must answer to the notice and comment requirements of the apa and the act,the nefmc by extension is governed by the same constraints operating from this premise,the fishermen find fault with almost every step taken by the nefmc in developing the control date proposal.first,they object to the fact that notice of the september,meeting was published in the federal register only days in advance.second,they claim that the published agenda failed to make specific mention of the possible adoption of a control date.third,the fishermen argue that hill ambushed them by bringing the motion to establish a control date to a snap vote,depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to mobilize in opposition 
the fishermen also object to the selection of november,as the control date.they contend that the nefmc arbitrarily and capriciously let the specific control date be determined by publication in the federal register by some unknown individual rather than by the nefmc members themselves.they further argue that the publication of the control date in the federal register did not amount to wide publicity in the major fishing ports of the region as i c requires.finally,the fishermen contend that the nefmc foreclosed all meaningful opportunity for public comment by requiring that all written comments on the proposed rule be submitted by december,only one month after its publication in the federal register.
the flaw in the fishermen argument is found in its fundamental the publication by nmfs of the nefmc proposed november,control date promulgated a rule.in fact,the control date did not become a rule until nmfs adopted amendment on february.the november,anpr title and content made clear that the control date was a proposed rule and nothing more.
this notification established november,as the control date for potential use in determining historical or traditional participation in the general category scallop fishery.consideration of a control date does not commit the council or nmfs to develop any particular management system or criteria for participation in this fishery.the council may choose a different control date,or may choose a management program that does not make use of such a date.
at.indeed,if the november,publication of the control date by nmfs were a rule,the fishermen action would be by the act statute of limitations,which requires that a petition for review of a final rule be filed within days of its publication see u.f.
we also agree with the district court that nmfs reasonably concluded that the steps taken by the nefmc in developing amendment complied with the procedural requirements of the act.see a.the nefmc gave timely public notice of the september meeting by publishing the date days in advance as the act required.id.i c.the meeting was announced in the federal register and in various fishing publications distributed in the new england and regions,including two with combined circulations in the tens of fisheries news and national fisherman.the notice of the meeting was also posted on the nmfs website.the success of the notice effort is demonstrated by the fact that over stakeholders attended the meeting.
we are also of the view that the november,publication of the proposed control date by nmfs came reasonably close on the heels of the nefmc vote.as appellees note,this publication was followed by a series of notices and public hearings tracking the shaping of amendment over the next three years.these hearings culminated in the november and december of publication by nmfs of the final rule and the implementing regulations and yet another round of public comment 
the fishermen object more substantively to the fact that the nefmc meeting discussed a control date at all,contending that the discussion and vote deviated from i c of the act,which provides that t he published agenda of the regular meeting may not be modified to include additional matters for council action without public notice or within days prior to the meeting date.although the use of the specific term control date in the proposed agenda might have been preferable,the agenda referred to actions to address overfishing as well as actions to cap or reduce general category scallop landings.we think this sufficient to have put the fishermen on notice that a control date might well be one of the mechanisms put forward at the meeting for reducing access to the scallop fishery.
issue mandate to hold public meetings in all geographic areas 
the fishermen next argue that the district court erred in concluding that the nefmc complied at least minimally with the mandate that public meetings to discuss new management measures like amendment be held in appropriate locations in the geographical area concerned.the locations also include areas under the authority of another council if the measures could affect fishermen of that area.h.following the publication of the november,anpr,public meetings were held over a span of months in maine,new hampshire,massachusetts,rhode island,connecticut,new jersey,and virginia.while it is true,as the fishermen complain,that most of the meetings were held in the new england region,that fact by itself is unsurprising,given that georges bank is the most sensitive of the environs of fishable atlantic sea scallops three public meetings were held outside of the jurisdiction of the nefmc.two of these were held in new jersey.the first meeting in february of in cape may attracted participants.a second new jersey meeting held in may of in manahawkin drew another fishermen.later that month,a third meeting in newport news,virginia,attracted some participants.
we can find no authority that supports the fishermen assertion that nmfs was
