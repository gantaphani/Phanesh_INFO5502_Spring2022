the commissioner of the internal revenue service irs appeals the united states tax court ruling that the latter had subject matter jurisdiction over a claim by sunoco,and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as sunoco.the underlying dispute arises from sunoco overpayment of income tax for certain years.the irs either refunded the overpayments to sunoco or applied the overpayments as credits to other tax years to other of sunoco liabilities for other types of taxes before sunoco contested a notice of deficiency the irs issued for those years.sunoco claimed that the irs did not pay it enough overpayment interest on those overpayments.the tax court ruled that it had subject matter jurisdiction over sunoco claim.in its appeal,the irs argues that the tax court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over sunoco claim.we agree and will therefore vacate the tax court ruling.
facts and procedural history 
sunoco,formerly sun company,headquartered in philadelphia,pennsylvania,is the parent of a group of companies engaged primarily in the manufacturing and marketing of petroleum products,logistics businesses,and cokemaking operations,in the united states and elsewhere.for many years,sunoco has filed a consolidated federal tax return that includes several hundred of its subsidiaries.
as is typical of most large public companies,sunoco is continually audited by the irs.the audits generally result in various adjustments to sunoco tax liabilities for a particular year,as items are identified by the irs and by sunoco tax personnel.those adjustments are both up meaning additional taxes are owed and down meaning that sunoco overpaid a given tax for a given period.many of these adjustments are resolved administratively within the irs,either at the audit level or the irs appeals office level.
the audits and appeals typically take years to complete.any applicable period of limitation is usually extended by the parties execution of irs form a,entitled special consent to extend the time to assess tax.in return,form a extends the time in which the taxpayer may file a claim for credit or refund for a given tax year.
on july,after the completion of one such audit cycle and an irs administrative appeals process,the irs issued a notice of deficiency to sunoco for the tax years,and.the irs claimed deficiencies of income tax in the amounts of,and respectively,for a total amount of.
sunoco responded to the notice of deficiency by filing a timely petition in the tax court in which it contested the irs determination of deficiencies for,and.it also asserted that it had made income tax overpayments for those years totaling.sunoco sought a refund of the overpayment together with interest.
thereafter,in november of,sunoco amended its petition to add,inter alia,allegations relating to certain errors that sunoco claimed the irs had made in computing underpayment and overpayment interest.sunoco alleged that for each of the disputed years,the interest the irs had charged on underpayments pursuant to was too high,and the interest the irs had paid to sunoco on overpayments pursuant to was too low 
the tax court held a trial on the merits with respect to certain substantive issues not related to the amount of interest owed the tax court subsequently issued two opinions on the disputed substantive issues 
in may of,sunoco and the irs entered into various stipulations that disposed of most of the competing claims.the remaining disputes included the claim that the amount of interest paid to sunoco on its overpayment of various taxes was insufficient.that was the claim that sunoco had added by amending the petition it had filed in the tax court in response to the notice of tax deficiency 
in march of,the irs moved to dismiss sunoco amended petition to the extent that it asked the tax court to order the irs to pay additional overpayment interest under.the irs contended that sunoco claims for overpayment interest for the taxable years,and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the tax court does not have jurisdiction to determine the amount of interest due on overpayments allowed prior to the commencement of the case.most of the overpayments underlying sunoco claims for interest were interim overpayments that the irs credited against a tax liability of sunoco for a different tax year a different tax,pursuant to a,a,before the notice of deficiency issued the irs had refunded the remaining overpayments to sunoco before the notice of deficiency issued.in its motion to dismiss,the irs challenged the tax court jurisdiction to adjudicate sunoco claim for interest on sunoco overpayment of taxes.the irs contended that sunoco appropriate remedy for seeking overpayment interest with respect to the amounts that had previously been refunded or credited is a suit in a federal district court or the court of federal claims 
the tax court denied the irs motion to dismiss in an opinion dated february.it held that it had jurisdiction to determine interest with respect to overpayments where the overpayments and interest on overpayments had been refunded to the taxpayer or otherwise credited to the taxpayer account before the case arrived in the tax court.sunoco,and subsidiaries comm r of the irs,wl.the court decision was based on its interpretation of b and as well its earlier decision in estate of baumgardner comm r of internal revenue,wl.
after the tax court denied a motion to reconsider,the irs and sunoco filed a second stipulation of settled issues limited to the interest calculation issue.sunoco and the irs expressed their intention to agree to the underlying facts and the computation of interest,if the tax court determination as to jurisdiction is either not appealed or is sustained on appeal,while preserving for potential appeal the legal issue of the court jurisdiction over sunoco claim to additional overpayment interest.
concurrently with the second stipulation of settled issues,the parties filed a stipulation as to the underlying tax liabilities for each of the disputed years,showing an overpayment of for,a deficiency of to be assessed and paid for,and a deficiency of to be assessed for,of which remains to be paid.the tax court entered a decision accordingly on february.
the irs then filed this appeal challenging the tax court jurisdiction over sunoco claim to additional interest on sunoco tax overpayments.

iii.discussion.
as noted earlier,when sunoco filed its amended petition for redetermination of deficiencies for,and,sunoco claimed,inter alia,additional interest on overpayments that the irs had previously refunded to sunoco credited to other of sunoco tax liabilities,before the notice of deficiency issued.as we have also noted,the tax court determined that it could exercise jurisdiction over sunoco claim based on its reading of b and,and its earlier holding in estate of baumgardner comm r of the irs.see at 
on appeal here,the irs contends that the tax court erred as a matter of law in its reading of the controlling statutes and in relying on the analysis in baumgardner.we agree,and we will address each of the irs main arguments separately 
the tax court erred in holding that it had jurisdiction over sunoco claims for additional overpayment interest,because such interest is not an overpayment of tax.
at the outset,it is important to understand the difference between the two types of interest claims that sunoco asserted in its amended petition.sunoco first claim was that it had paid too much deficiency interest.deficiency interest is interest charged to a taxpayer pursuant to,on tax underpayments the taxpayer has made or should have made for a given period the irs,like banks or any other creditor,charges interest on money it is owed over time.thus,when a taxpayer underpays taxes for a certain tax period,the irs charges interest on the amount of the deficiency.concomitantly,the irs pays a taxpayer interest on any amount of taxes that a taxpayer pays that exceeds the actual tax liability for a given year.this second type of interest is known as overpayment interest,and it underlies the jurisdictional dispute here.
the issue before us arises from sunoco claim that its tax payments exceeded the amount of taxes it owed for the years in question.sunoco therefore asked the tax court to award it the amount of interest it was purportedly owed on the amount of its overpayment of taxes overpayment interest pursuant to 
the irs acknowledges that the tax court had jurisdiction over the first type of claim under the tax court limited overpayment jurisdiction set forth in b.however,the irs contends that the tax court does not have jurisdiction over the second type of claim,sunoco claim that the government did not pay it enough interest on sunoco overpayments of tax.the irs notes that sunoco made interim tax payments for,and,before the irs determined that there were deficiencies for those years.at various times before sunoco commenced the tax court proceedings,the irs refunded overpayments to sunoco or applied the overpayments as credits to other tax years sunoco tax liabilities for other types of taxes.
section a of the internal revenue code provides that i nterest shall be allowed and paid upon any overpayment in respect of any internal revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section.a.the irs contends that overpayment interest is not itself an overpayment of tax because the taxpayer has paid nothing to the irs.rather,the taxpayer is owed money by the government.
therefore,according to the irs,a claim for overpayment interest is a general monetary claim against the united states,which like all such claims must be brought in the federal district courts or the court of federal claims within the limitations period set forth in district court and court of federal claims 
thus,the irs contends that the tax court wrongly held that insufficient overpayment interest should be characterized as an overpayment subject to its jurisdiction,in the same way that overpaid deficiency interest is treated as an overpayment within its jurisdiction.the irs submits that the tax court improperly expanded its jurisdiction over disputes involving deficiency interest by equating interest a taxpayer owes the government that has accrued on a tax deficiency with interest the government owes a taxpayer on the amount of tax payments that exceed the taxpayer actual tax obligation.we agree.
the tax court jurisdiction to determine overpayments and overpayment interest is narrowly circumscribed by the internal revenue code.
the tax court is a court of limited jurisdiction possessing only such jurisdiction as is expressly conferred by congress.see the tax court and its divisions shall have such jurisdiction as is conferred on them by this title,by chapters,and of the internal revenue code of,by title ii and title iii of the revenue act of stat,or by laws enacted subsequent to february.see also estate of smith comm r of the irs,cir the tax court is purely a creature of statute and has only the power given it by congress.
congress changed the status of the tax court from an administrative forum to an article i court in the tax reform act of.however,nothing in the text of that act suggests that congress intended to broaden the tax court jurisdiction or otherwise decrease the dissimilarities between the tax court and the district courts.cont l equities,comm r of the irs,cir explaining that nothing in the tax reform act of indicate s that congress intended to obliterate other dissimilarities that it did not explicitly address.accordingly,the conclusion that the tax reform act did not grant the tax court equitable jurisdiction is inescapable.id.indeed,the tax court itself has noted that its basic jurisdiction was not changed by the tax reform act.burns,stix friedman comm r of the irs,wl.
the tax court principal basis for jurisdiction is a,a.that section of the tax code gives the tax court jurisdiction to redetermine a deficiency in income,estate,gift,and certain excise taxes as to which the irs has issued a notice of deficiency pursuant to a,u.a,and the taxpayer has filed a timely petition for redetermination.pursuant to a,the tax court has such jurisdiction even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency as set forth in the notice of deficiency,and its jurisdiction extends to any additional amount,or any addition to the tax,asserted by the irs at or before trial.
however,jurisdiction concerning overpayments,tax refunds generally lies with the federal district courts and the court of federal claims.see a a baumgardner,at.nevertheless,congress did confer overpayment jurisdiction on the tax court,u nder limited circumstances.baumgardner,at.the first such circumstance arises under b,which provides,in relevant part,as follows 
i f the tax court finds that there is no deficiency and further finds that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year in respect of which the secretary determined the deficiency,or finds that there is a deficiency but the taxpayer has made an overpayment of such tax,the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of such overpayment,and such amount shall,when the decision of the tax court has become final,be credited or refunded to the taxpayer 
b.see baumgardner,at the tax court overpayment jurisdiction is limited to situations where a deficiency has been determined and the taxpayer petitions the court for a taxable period.when the tax court is given overpayment jurisdiction,its jurisdiction is exclusive.a,a where taxpayer has filed a petition in the tax court for a redetermination of a deficiency,no credit or refund of income tax for the same taxable year shall be allowed or made and no suit by the taxpayer for the recovery of any part of the tax shall be instituted in any court except,as is relevant here,a s to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax court which has become final.
the second circumstance where the tax court acquires overpayment jurisdiction is set forth in b,b.however,that provision merely gives the tax court jurisdiction to enforce its decisions.thus,b provides i f,after days after a decision of the tax court has become final,the secretary has failed to refund the overpayment determined by the tax court,together with the interest thereon,then the tax court,upon motion by the taxpayer,shall have jurisdiction to order the refund of such overpayment and interest.b.
although the internal revenue code does not define the term overpayment,the supreme court has read the word overpayment in its usual sense,as meaning any payment in excess of that which is properly due.jones liberty glass.see also united states dalm,d n the commonsense interpretation is that a tax is overpaid when a taxpayer pays more than is owed,for whatever reason or no reason at all.
the tax court jurisdiction over overpayments is very constrained with respect to credits under,section a provides that i n the case of any overpayment,the secretary,within the applicable period of limitations,may credit the amount of such overpayment,including any interest allowed thereon,against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall,subject to subsections c,d,and e,refund any balance to such person.a.the irs has broad discretion in determining whether to credit an overpayment for one tax liability toward a different liability of the taxpayer,see,estate of bender comm r of the irs,cir,and the irs discretion can not be challenged in the tax court.b provides that t he tax court shall have no jurisdiction under this subsection to restrain or review any credit or refund made by the secretary under section.b.
except in limited circumstances,the tax court also lacks jurisdiction over issues relating to interest,whether on underpayments or overpayments.see comm r of the irs mccoy,d zfass comm r of the irs,cir citing several appellate court cases which recognize that the tax court does not have jurisdiction regarding interest determinations.melin comm r of the irs,cir the tax court does not have jurisdiction over challenges to interest determinations in most circumstances.bax comm r of the irs,cir med james,comm r of the irs,wl white comm r of the irs,wl.
the interest imposed on underpayments by a is generally excluded from the definition of a deficiency which the tax court has jurisdiction over,see white,at,but it is otherwise treated as a tax pursuant to e any reference in this title except subchapter b of chapter,relating to deficiency procedures to any tax imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section.
however,if the tax court properly obtains jurisdiction over a deficiency for a given year and then finds that the taxpayer has overpaid its taxes for that year,the tax court may determine an overpayment of interest paid on the deficiency,if the interest accrued and was paid before the overpayment arose.estate of baumgardner,supra.see smith comm r,cir in baumgardner,the tax court held that,at least when interest has been assessed against and paid by the taxpayer,it has jurisdiction to determine an overpayment of interest as part of its jurisdiction to determine an overpayment of tax on which the interest was paid.heffley comm r of the irs,cir in baumgardner,t he tax court held that when it had jurisdiction to determine the overpayment of the tax,it also had jurisdiction to determine the overpayment of interest that the taxpayer paid with the tax.the tax court jurisdiction in such cases is based on the delinquency owed by the taxpayer,but may then extend to any claim that the taxpayer was charged too much interest on the delinquency.the tax court ability to determine if the government charged too much interest is tangential to that grant of jurisdiction arising from the tax deficiency.however,nothing in the relevant statutes or cases allows us to infer that congress also intended to give the tax court jurisdiction over a taxpayer claim against the government for interest owed to the taxpayer arising solely from the taxpayer overpayment of taxes.indeed,that result would be contrary to the concurrent grant of jurisdiction that congress limited to the court of federal claims and the district courts without mention of the tax court.see a a 
the irs properly concedes that the tax court has jurisdiction to determine overpayments of deficiency interest paid by sunoco pursuant to.however,the dispute between sunoco and the irs concerns interest which sunoco claims the government owes it pursuant to on overpayments of tax that had already been refunded or credited before the notice of deficiency was issued.sunoco claims that since it was charged too much interest on various tax obligations,the tax court could award it the amount of interest that the government charged that was in excess of the amount which sunoco actually owed on those tax obligations.however,claims for such overpayment interest are not subject to the internal revenue code requirements in limitations on credit or refund and civil actions for refund for claiming a tax refund or a refund of deficiency interest.moreover,we can find no provisions in the internal revenue code which specifically address actions to recover such overpayment interest.see alexander proudfoot united states,barnes united states.
however,it is clear that such actions constitute claims against the united states,and such claims must be brought by filing a complaint in the appropriate district court or the court of federal claims within six years of the accrual of the cause of action.see a district courts and a court of federal claims.
the tax court has been given jurisdiction over overpayment interest in two very narrow circumstances,both involving a final decision of the that court.the first,already noted,concerns the enforcement of a decision.it is set forth in b which provides that i f,after days after a decision of the tax court has become final,the secretary has failed to refund the overpayment determined by the tax court,together with the interest thereon,then the tax court,upon motion by the taxpayer,shall have jurisdiction to order the refund of such overpayment and interest.b emphasis added.
the second circumstance in which the tax court has jurisdiction over overpayment interest is found in c.that section provides in relevant part as follows 
i f,within year after the date of the decision of the tax court becomes final in a case to which c applies,the taxpayer files a motion in the tax court for a redetermination of the amount of interest involved,then the tax court may reopen the case solely to determine whether the taxpayer had made an overpayment of such interest or the secretary has made an underpayment of such interest and the amount thereof.
c.see asa investerings comm r of the irs,wl c specifically carves out an exception to the rule on the finality of our decisions a prerequisite for invoking that exception is a final decision of this court.thus,i f the tax court determines that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of interest or that the secretary has made an underpayment of interest,then that determination shall be treated under section b as a determination of an overpayment of tax.c.this provision merely requires that an amount determined by the tax court as owing to the taxpayer be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with b,and it brings that amount within the tax court jurisdiction to enforce under b.
c is therefore quite limited in scope and only reaches situations where the secretary has made an assessment that includes interest,the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of the deficiency plus interest claimed by the secretary,and the tax court finds under section b that the taxpayer has made an overpayment.c,c.see bax,at the language of c is plain and clear the tax court may make a redetermination of interest in cases where the taxpayer prepays both the entire amount of the deficiency and the interest claimed by the government on the deficiency.emphasis in original.congress did not expressly grant blanket federal jurisdiction over interest issues to the tax court through section c.melin,at.
accordingly,neither b nor c supplies a basis for the tax court exercise of jurisdiction over sunoco claims for additional overpayment interest.those sections only address proceedings and the tax court jurisdiction to redetermine interest arising from its decision.
the overpayment interest at issue here is not attributable to any decision of the tax court.indeed,no decision had been entered when sunoco raised its interest claims.rather,the interest at issue here arises from overpayments that were refunded or credited before this case began.we can find no statutory authorization for the tax court to determine this kind of claim,and we are not convinced by sunoco attempts to identify one.
sunoco contends that the language in b,that the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of such overpayment,should be stretched to include the amount of interest on an overpayment for the taxable year that is before the tax court.sunoco argues that the omission of interest does not mean that overpayment interest can not be determined by the tax court.however,sunoco offers no authority for its contention and we have found none.this argument is merely an ipse dixit.
in any event,b does not provide jurisdiction for claims of overpayment interest of the type asserted by sunoco here.that section provides,in relevant part,as follows 
b overpayment determined by 
jurisdiction to determine.i f the tax court finds that there is no deficiency and further finds that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year in respect of which the secretary determined the deficiency,or finds that there is a deficiency but the taxpayer has made an overpayment of such tax,the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of such overpayment,and such amount shall,when the decision of the tax court has become final,be credited or refunded to the taxpayer.
b.in estate of baumgardner comm r of the irs,wl,the tax court held that an overpayment
