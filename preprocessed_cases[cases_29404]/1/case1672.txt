raja akhtar and mohammad salman,citizens of pakistan,are paroled arriving aliens in removal proceedings.under a regulation promulgated in,such aliens can not apply for adjustment of status to become immigrants.because they mount the same legal challenge to the regulation,a challenge upheld by four of our sister circuits and rejected by one,we consolidated their appeals.we reject the challenge and affirm.
factual background 
raja akhtar 
raja akhtar,a native and citizen of pakistan,entered the united states in through texas using a fraudulent passport.he has been living in this country ever since,going abroad once,in,pursuant to a fraudulently obtained advance parole.in,akhtar married his current wife,aracely cuellar chapa,a united states citizen,with whom he has two citizen children.
the ins,now part of the department of homeland security and the customs and immigration service uscis,commenced removal proceedings against akhtar on december.in response,akhtar filed an application for cancellation of removal and an application for adjustment of status based on his marriage.he also sent a letter to the ins district director,asking him to temporarily terminate the removal proceedings because the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to hear the application for adjustment of status while the proceedings continued.the ins asked the ij to confirm that she lacked such jurisdiction under a regulation forbidding applications from arriving aliens in removal proceedings,like akhtar.the ij did so.after the district director refused to terminate removal proceedings,the ij denied akhtar application for cancellation of removal,finding that he failed to establish that removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying family member,and issued a final order of removal.the board of immigration appeals dismissed his appeal without comment 
on appeal to this court,akhtar argues that the regulation precluding applications for adjustment of status from arriving aliens in removal proceedings is invalid alternatively,since the uscis district director has jurisdiction to adjudicate such applications if removal proceedings are conditionally terminated,that we should initiate conditional termination and that the ij erred in denying akhtar application for cancellation of removal.
mohammad salman 
mohammed salman,a native and citizen of pakistan,entered the united states at san francisco international airport on april,using another person passport and visa.he then attempted to assume that person identity.
the ins detained salman and commenced removal proceedings against him on may,releasing him from custody and paroling him into the united states on june after he posted bond.the ins transferred his case to houston after salman moved to texas.on august,salman applied for asylum and admitted that he was removable as charged.on november,salman married his current wife,senovia ramiers,a united states citizen,with whom he has one child,an american citizen by birth.
during removal proceedings,the ij denied salman motion for continuance to allow adjudication of an immigrant visa petition based on his marriage.the bia affirmed,concluding that the ij did not abuse her discretion in refusing to continue the proceedings because salman,as an arriving alien in removal proceedings,was ineligible to adjust status under current regulations rending a continuance pointless.salman appeals,challenging the validity of that regulation and,hence,the ij denial of his motion for continuance.
ii.statutory regulatory background 
before,aliens in the united states without a valid visa had to go abroad to apply for permanent resident immigrant status.in,congress eliminated that burden by expanding eligibility for adjustment of status under a to all aliens inspected and admitted or paroled,allowing people in the country to apply for immigrant status without leaving,even those in the country without a valid visa.paroled aliens are those aliens allowed to enter the country temporarily,without a valid visa,while authorities investigate their eligibility for admission.under a,respondent may,in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe,grant such an application.a b i makes unreviewable his use of that discretion.
before,aliens were divided into two categories applicants for admission,also called arriving aliens,those aliens who had not yet entered the country,and aliens present in the who had already entered,with or without inspection.paroled aliens were considered arriving aliens.after inspection,arriving aliens were either admitted or excluded during exclusion proceedings aliens who had already entered were either admitted or deported during deportation proceedings.
pursuant to a,parolees could adjust status with the district if they were in exclusion proceedings.the bia held that in exclusion proceedings,the district director,not the ij,maintained jurisdiction over applications 
the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira eliminated the concept of entry to differentiate aliens,replacing it with the concept of admitted versus aliens.the main effect is that aliens present in the who have not been not been inspected or admitted are added to those considered applicants for admission,or arriving aliens.it also replaced exclusion and deportation with removal,applicable to all aliens in the country without inspection,inspected but not admitted,or previously admitted but now subject to removal the iirira did not change a or otherwise change the adjustment of status process.
in,attorney general janet reno issued new regulations said to implement the iirira.the regulations created a new definition for arriving alien,a term that had existed without definition in the old statute the term arriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the united states at a port of entry an arriving aliens remains such even if paroled except aliens paroled before april,or aliens receiving advance parole this definition is not in controversy,merely codifying the previously understood definition,which under the iirira now encompasses all aliens.
the attorney general made a more substantive change to the adjustment of status regulations,c,rendering seven categories of aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under a,including a ny arriving alien who is in removal proceedings this regulation dovetails with the new regulation governing adjustment procedure,promulgated at the same time 
an alien who believes he is eligible for adjustment of status shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence after an alien,other than an arriving alien,is in deportation or removal proceedings,his or her application shall be made and considered only in those proceedings an arriving alien,other than an alien in removal proceedings,who believes he or she meets the eligibility requirements shall apply to the director having jurisdiction over his or her place of arrival an alien on advance parole hence not an arriving alien whose application was denied by the district director may renew that application in removal proceedings.
thus,c prevents arriving aliens,including parolees,in removal proceedings from filing for adjustment of status,either with the district director,as they had been able to do in exclusion proceedings before,or the ij.
the parties agree that akhtar and salman are parolees in removal proceedings instead,akhtar and salman challenge the validity of c,arguing that in rendering parolees in removal proceedings ineligible to apply,it conflicts with a,which makes parolees eligible to apply without mention of removal proceedings.
in promulgating c,the attorney general explained that she was furthering congress intent to expedite removal of arriving aliens by not favorably exercis ing her unreviewable discretion to adjust status under a and a b i she explained further that arriving aliens in removal proceedings eligible for immigrant visas would have to return to their home countries to apply,although she might exercise her prosecutorial discretion not to initiate removal proceedings or to terminate removal proceedings to allow applicants to apply to the district director.respondent alberto gonzalez,reno successor,maintains this position.
akhtar and salman reply that respondent can not by regulation redefine eligibility defined by congress,despite his unreviewable discretion once the applications are filed.hence the heart of this case how to resolve the inherent tension in a statutory scheme that explicitly defines who is eligible to apply but gives respondent unreviewable discretion to review the applications.
iii.jurisdiction 
respondent argues first that a b,the provision precluding judicial review of discretionary orders,including orders granting or denying adjustment of status,bars our consideration of petitioners claim.like our five sister circuits that have addressed the validity of c we reject this argument because the issue here is one of statutory interpretation,a pure legal task distinct from review of an individual decision on the merits of an application for adjustment.that our analysis centers on the effect of respondent discretion does not change this result.
iv.previous challenges to c 
until recently,we had not examined this issue in an opinion issued after oral argument in our case,momin gonzales,another panel of this court addressed it and upheld the regulation,as we do our opinion builds upon momin,as we will explain.
five of our sister circuits have passed on c.the first circuit lead,invalidating the regulation in succar after concluding that it violated chevron step because discretion to adjudicate individual applications is not discretion to redefine eligibility,citing ins it held that while an agency may use its discretion to define eligibility where congress was silent on eligibility,citing lopez davis congress was not silent here explicitly states who is eligible and creates many and,highlighting the lack of a for parolees in removal proceedings moreover,the court observed,since most parolees are now put in removal proceedings,c effectively makes all parolees ineligible the court also noted the larger statutory context,concluding that its explicit grants of discretion highlight the lack of discretion over eligibility.checking this interpretation against the legislative history of from the court concluded that c the burdensome procedure that was designed to eliminate.finally,the court rejected respondent contention that the iirira justifies the regulation,noting that the iirira left untouched and that the general policies said to be embodied by the iirira are doubtful,and in any event insufficient to justify such a sharp break from previous practice.
the eighth circuit followed with mouelle gonzales rejecting succar and upholding the regulation.it held first that chevron step one did not control because a gave respondent discretion to adjust status,and such discretion can be exercised or by rule.for this proposition it cited its own case bellis davis affirmed in lopez,and judge friendly statement about that we are unable to understand why there should be any general principle forbidding an administrator,vested with discretionary power,to determine by appropriate rulemaking that he will not use it in favor of a particular class on a basis it rejected succar interpretation of,acknowledging that distinguished statutory eligibility but noting that its context was materially different turning to chevron step two,the court held c reasonable as a means to expedite removal proceedings.finally,the court noted that,unlike succar,it had no evidence that most parolees were put in removal proceedings to the contrary,respondent had stated that few were put in removal proceedings.in any event,the court stated,the number is irrelevant.
next came zheng gonzales,where the third circuit invalidated the rule,albeit under chevron step two the court first rejected succar rationale,holding that its distinction between eligibility and discretion was rejected by the court in and that succar basis for distinguishing the statute in lopez was silent as to eligibility perilously close to rejecting that case it then held that lopez,though swaying in respondent favor by allowing him to exercise discretionary authority by rule,was a sword in putting that discretionary authority squarely within the second step of chevron turning to step two,the court focused on the percentage of parolees put in removal proceedings.although it had no statistics,it noted those cited in succar and held that,more importantly,the statutory structure seems to mandate that parolees be put in removal proceedings,regardless of respondent claim to discretion noting that the exception allowing parolees in removal proceedings to renew applications was narrow,and that renewing was not applying,the court held that c for all practical purposes renders parolees ineligible to apply.citing the language,structure,and legislative history of the immigration statutes,the court explained that congress clearly intended in that most parolees could apply.given this conflict,it struck down the regulation.in doing so,it noted that the closeness of the step one question ha d some bearing on its step two decision.
the ninth circuit held the regulation invalid in bona gonzales after succinctly and expressly adopting succar and rejecting mouelle the eleventh circuit ruled last in scheerer attorney general,expressly adopting the rationale of zheng 
validity of c 
we agree with mouelle that c passes both chevron hurdles.congress did not speak precisely to the issue because it gave respondent unreviewable discretion to adjudicate individual applications.and there is simply no reason why an agency given such discretion can not exercise it by rule.lopez concurs,and we find succar attempt to distinguish that case unconvincing for the reasons explained by zheng.furthermore,as explained in mouelle,ins does not create some artificial distinction between eligibility and discretion such that the latter can not de facto affect,or even redefine,the former.it merely held that the bia interpretation of the statute in that case failed because congress did not intend the heightened showing to apply to discretionary asylum.
turning to step two,c is a reasonable method of exercising that discretion to facilitate removal.the statutory structure and history are insufficient to render it unreasonable because they also highlight congress intent to give respondent unreviewable discretion.that is,while congress certainly intended to define who is eligible to apply,it just as clearly intended to let respondent deny many,some,or all applications given the tension between those intents,we can not say that respondent interpretation is unreasonable under chevron.
we are cautioned to mind the practical effect of striking down c.the question is put,could the government achieve the same result by instructing all ijs or district directors to deny all applications from paroled aliens in removal proceedings after allowing such aliens the formality of applying succar responds that while its holding does not preclude respondent from adopting a uniform set of criteria for consideration in evaluating applications,respondent can not categorically refuse to exercise discretion favorably for classes deemed eligible by the statute,although whether an eligible alien is in removal proceedings can be a consideration in the weighing.but that restraint on respondent discretion is unclear,requiring the federal courts to police adjudications on a low level,if not in contravention of a b i.respondent reasonable construction of allows us to avoid that morass.
we conclude that c is valid under chevron.respondent has discretion to adjudicate applications for adjustment of status,and he has done so by a reasonable rule 
vi.akhtar remaining claims 
we have disposed of petitioners primary claim.akhtar makes two others.first,he argues that we should initiate conditional termination of removal proceedings to allow adjudication of his application for adjustment of status.he cites no authority for this request,and,finding no basis for terminating removal proceedings,we dismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction.second,he urges us to r
