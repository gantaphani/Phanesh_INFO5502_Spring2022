opinion of the court 
this class action appeal is unique in that both parties have the same objective the timely discharge of mental health patients from the norristown state hospital nsh,a mental heath facility located in southeast pennsylvania.the parties diverge,however,over the time frame for discharge,the number of patients to be discharged,and the perceived fiscal restraints hindering discharge.
appellants patients are a class of mental health patients institutionalized at nsh who are statutorily eligible for deinstitutionalization and who therefore seek integration into healthcare programs.patients claim that because they are qualified and prepared for services,their continued institutionalization violates the and integration mandates of the americans with disabilities act ada,et and d and section of the rehabilitation act,and d appellee is the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw the entity charged with the responsibility and duty to provide statewide mental health care.see.stat.ann.
in its first consideration of this case,the district court ruled in favor of dpw,holding that under olmstead,d,the integration accommodation patients requested was unavailable at the time because it would require a fundamental alteration of pennsylvania mental health program in light of its limited economic resources and its obligations to other segments of the mentally disabled population.frederick dep t of pub.welfare,d,frederick i 
this court vacated and remanded for further evaluation of whether there was sufficient evidence to justify acceptance of pennsylvania fundamental alteration defense.frederick dep t of pub.welfare,cir frederick ii.we based this determination largely upon dpw failure to heed the supreme court admonition in olmstead that a state may avoid liability by providing a comprehensive,effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in programs with a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.id.at quoting olmstead,at.accordingly,we directed the district court on remand to instruct dpw to devise a plan which would demonstrate a commitment to community placement in a manner for which it can be held accountable by the courts.id.at.
dpw offered submissions which the district court credited as proof of the required commitment to deinstitutionalization.the court,therefore,ruled in favor of dpw on remand.patients have now appealed again.we vacate the court judgment in favor of dpw and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
the background of this case has been adequately set forth in the cases leading up to this appeal.see frederick i,d frederick ii.thus,we dispense with a factual recitation and proceed directly to the legal issues for discussion.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual conclusions for clear error.goldstein johnson johnson,cir.in this appeal,patients challenge dpw compliance with this court mandate in frederick ii that it develop a plan for future deinstitutionalization of qualified disabled persons that commits it to action in a manner for which it can be held accountable by the courts.frederick ii,at.
in their current brief to this court,patients argue that in our previous decision remanding to the district court,we held that dpw could not meet its burden to prove its fundamental alteration defense with proof of its fiscal constraints because if every alteration requiring an outlay of funds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration,the ada integration mandate would indeed ring hollow.patients also argue that in our previous decision we did not accept as sufficient proof dpw past efforts toward deinstitutionalization and its good faith intention to further deinstitutionalize as quickly as possible given its fiscal constraints.frederick ii,at.they similarly argue that we saw as insufficient to establish a fundamental alteration defense dpw review of county and regional budget requests related to deinstitutionalization efforts and its individualized discharge planning for nsh residents.
patients recognize that in delineating the balance between their interests in discharge to appropriate community placements and dpw fiscal and programmatic constraints,this court was informed by the olmstead plurality suggestion that the state could establish a fundamental alteration defense by demonstrating that it had a comprehensive,effectively working plan to discharge persons who are unnecessarily institutionalized in more integrated settings and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.frederick ii,at.patients complain that against this backdrop,the plan submitted to the district court by dpw fails to provide concrete,measurable benchmarks and a reasonable timeline for them to ascertain when,if ever,they will be discharged to appropriate community services.patients contend that such benchmarks and timelines are essential to comply with this court mandate.
on the other hand,dpw argues that our previous mandate expressed the issue as whether dpw had given assurance that it will make ongoing progress toward community placement,thereby satisfying the fundamental alteration defense.frederick ii,at.in its current brief,dpw emphasizes its past success in moving institutionalized patients into community settings and describes the various mechanisms for doing so,including the integration projects program chipp.dpw also discusses its policy of deinstitutionalizing eligible patients and its various planning efforts aimed at devising strategies to accomplish that goal,including designation of a service area planning sap group for each of the nine psychiatric hospitals,each charged with developing plans to achieve three specific goals within five years.dpw admits that it does not intend to implement these plans as written,but it argues that t here is no legal basis for plaintiffs contention that,without concrete benchmarks and timelines,dpw planning efforts are inadequate.
dpw argues that all it was required to do on remand was to demonstrate a commitment to take all reasonable steps to continue its past progress.frederick ii,at.dpw argues that the district court correctly found that it had satisfied our instruction that it submit a plan on remand for which it could be held accountable,frederick ii,at,because a court can not become enmeshed in minutiae.nor,if the state is heading in the right direction,can a court dictate a certain approach to the development and delivery of mental health services.dpw further argues that,contrary to patients contentions,the lack of benchmarks,timelines,commitments to implement any of the sap plans,and specific relief for class members in its submission,are not fatal to its fundamental alteration defense because there is no one right approach to olmstead planning.dpw argues that hard numbers can not be the sine qua non of an acceptable plan and that concrete and measurable guidelines are not sufficient to make a plan to provide community residential services legally acceptable.
dpw also argues that patients criticism of its lack of commitment to implement the sap plans as written is misplaced because the sap plans are merely tools in a larger planning process that requires it to assess needs and allocate scarce resources.dpw points out that the january,announcement of the closing of harrisburg state hospital actually exceeds the goals set forth in the sap plan for that region.it also argues that is has no special duty to class members as opposed to the rest of the patients in its care that it was not required on remand to demonstrate any specific plans with respect to the class and that to favor class members over other persons in its care would violate olmstead.
because dpw apparently refuses to accept verifiable benchmarks or timelines as necessary elements of an acceptable plan,much of its brief misses the mark.although we are aware of dpw strong commitment in the past to deinstitutionalization,pennsylvania mental health hospital population has declined from in the to fewer than at the time of trial,dpw submission amounts to a vague assurance of the individual patient future deinstitutionalization rath
