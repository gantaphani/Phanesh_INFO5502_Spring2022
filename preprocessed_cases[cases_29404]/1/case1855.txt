the secretary of labor petitions this court for review of a final order of the occupational safety and health review commission.the commission affirmed in part and reversed in part a decision by an administrative law judge,who affirmed the majority of citations issued to respondent manganas painting,by the occupational safety and health administration following a inspection of a worksite on the southbound structure of the jeremiah morrow bridge.although the commission order adjudicated numerous citations issued to manganas painting,the secretary petition appeals only three citations for unguarded scaffolds that were vacated by the commission.
in a decision,the commission held that these citations were barred by b of the occupational safety and health act of the act,b,because a citation for the same unguarded scaffold condition,arising out of an inspection of the northbound structure of the morrow bridge,was pending before the commission at the time these citations were issued for the southbound bridge.commissioner rogers dissented on the basis that because the citations issued in and arose at separate worksites and at different times,b did not bar the unguarded scaffold citations.we agree with the rationale advocated by the dissent and therefore grant the petition for review,reverse the commission,and remand for further proceedings regarding the merits of the citations at issue.
manganas painting began work removing paint on the jeremiah morrow bridge in lebanon,ohio in,after it entered into a contract with the ohio department of transportation.the morrow bridge consists of two parallel bridges one structure running northbound the other,southbound.in april,osha performed an inspection of the project while manganas painting was working on the northbound bridge.following the inspection,osha issued several citations to manganas painting,including,inter alia,a citation alleging that manganas painting had failed to install guardrails on platforms that were located more than feet above the ground level,in violation of a repealed.manganas painting timely appealed the citation,and it was ultimately affirmed by the commission in.sec y of labor manganas painting,cas.bna,aff by manganas painting sec y of labor.
in december,while manganas painting was working on the southbound bridge,osha performed another inspection.at the conclusion of this inspection,osha issued several new citations,including,inter alia,three alleged instances of unguarded scaffolds,in violation of a these citations alleged the following violations 
item.located under and along the east side of the south bound bridge deck,approximate panel point between,an employee was observed working from a pic scaffold spray painting a column and the upper cord or steel area without standard guardrails or equivalent,exposing the employee to perimeter exterior falls in excess of and interior falls of approximately.
item.employees were exposed to a fall in excess of while using the scaffold pic adjacent to the ladder suspended over the side of the bridge outside the containment area south of pier in that there were no guard rails on the pic.
item.located under and along the east side of the south bound bridge deck approximate panel point,employees were working from a pick scaffold without standard guardrails or equivalent exposing employees to perimeter exterior falls in excess of and interior falls in excess of.
manganas painting timely appealed,resulting in a decision by an administrative law judge vacating the citations on the basis that these violations were duplicative of other citations issued during the inspection of the southbound bridge 
on review,the commission affirmed the alj decision,but on different grounds.the commission majority held that section b of the act barred the secretary from citing manganas painting for failing to guard pick scaffolds at the bridge worksite because a citation for the same condition relating to the northbound bridge was pending before the commission at the time these alleged violations were cited in december.the commission reasoned 
as a result of the april inspection of the bridge worksite,osha cited manganas for a violation of a,the same scaffolding standard cited here.the citation was based on manganas failure to install guardrails on a painter pick.manganas painting,bna oshc at,cch oshd at.it is undisputed that at the time osha initiated the inspection and issued the resulting citations,the citation had been timely contested by manganas and a hearing in the matter had yet to commence.in fact,the judge who presided over the matter did not issue his decision until after a decision was issued in the current cases,and his decision did not become a final order of the commission until.
while the alleged scaffolding violations cited in and were observed at what we find to be essentially two different worksites,the citations covered the same condition in that each item was based on manganas failure to guard the same type of pick scaffold used throughout the bridge worksite during both painting seasons.
emphasis added 
the secretary timely filed a petition for review with this court,limited to the commission decision regarding these citations.neither manganas painting nor the commission has filed a responsive brief in opposition.
in reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering,we apply the familiar process announced by the supreme court in chevron,nrdc,d.the initial question under step one of the chevron framework is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue by employing precise,unambiguous statutory language.alliance for community media,cir citing chevron,at.if the text of the statute is unambiguous and,therefore,the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.jewish,sec y of health human,cir citing chevron,at.if,however,we determine that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,that is,that the statute is silent or ambiguous on the specific issue,we must determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.battle creek health leavitt,cir quoting jewish,at.where the agency interpretation of the statute does not take the form of a regulation issued following notice and comment rulemaking,but rather is offered through an informal as an opinion letter,policy statement,or agency deference is not warranted,and we apply the less deferential review to the agency interpretation.id.at.see also infra at.
the threshold issue,then,is whether b is ambiguous.section b of the act provides in pertinent part 
if the secretary has reason to believe that an employer has failed to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued within the period permitted for its correction which period shall not begin to run until the entry of a final order by the commission in the case of any review proceedings under this section initiated by the employer in good faith and not solely for delay or avoidance of penalties,the secretary shall notify the employer by certified mail of such failure and of the penalty proposed to be assessed under section of this title by reason of such failure,and that the employer has fifteen working days within which to notify the secretary that he wishes to contest the secretary notification or the proposed assessment of penalty.
b emphasis added.
we conclude that the statute is ambiguous regarding the meaning of a violation for which a citation has been issued.b.we have explained previously that l anguage is ambiguous when to give th e phrase meaning requires a specific factual scenario that can give rise to two or more different meanings of the phrase.alliance,at quoting beck city of cleveland,cir.here,there are at least two possible constructions of the pertinent phrase.it could refer,as the secretary insists,to each instance in which an ohsa regulation is breached.the statute use of the term violation could also be read plausibly,however,to apply only to the regulation that was allegedly transgressed,rath
