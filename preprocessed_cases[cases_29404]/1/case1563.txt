a minor,appeals the denial of tuition reimbursement for private preschooling under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.we affirm.
i.the idea.
congress enacted the idea to ensure that children with disabilities will have access to public education,including special education and related services.see d a daniel state bd.of,cir.the idea requires school districts in states receiving designated federal funds to implement procedures and policies that assure that each disabled student receives a free appropriate public education,or fape.a,a.to ensure that a child receives a fape,parents and school districts collaborate to develop an individualized education plan iep that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.
in texas,a committee that develops an iep is known as an admissions,review,and dismissal ard committee.indep.sch.dist.michael,cir.the ard committee consists of the parents of the child at least one of his regular education teachers at least one teacher a qualified representative of the school district an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child included at the discretion of the parent or agency and,where appropriate,the child,at citations omitted.
the idea does not entitle a disabled child to an iep that maximizes his potential,but instead only guarantees a basic floor of opportunity specifically designed to meet the child unique needs,supported by services that will permit him to benefit from the instruction.richardson indep.sch.dist.michael,cir citations omitted.the educational benefit,however,can not be a mere modicum or de minimis rather,an iep must be likely to produce progress,not regression or trivial educational advancement.id.citation omitted.
one of the primary mandates of the idea,and the central focus in this case,is mainstreaming,which is the requirement that an iep place a disabled child in the least restrictive environment lre for his education 
in general,t o the maximum extent appropriate,children with disabilities,including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities,are educated with children who are not disabled,and special classes,separate schooling,or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.
a a.see daniel,at.
by creating a statutory preference for mainstreaming,congress also created a tension between two provisions of the idea,the requirement that a school district provide a fape on the one hand,and the requirement that,on the other hand,it does so within the least restrictive environment.id.at.even when school officials can mainstream a child,however,they need not provide for an exclusively mainstreamed environment.id.at.rather,the idea requires school officials to mainstream each child only to the maximum extent appropriate.in short,the idea mandate for fape qualifies and limits its mandate for education in the regular classroom.id.citation omitted.
ii.factual background.
was born in december.at age two,he received an evaluation through texas early childhood intervention eci program and was deemed eligible for eci services,namely,speech and occupational therapy.
in june,began attending tlc,a private preschool,and continued there until december of that year,when his parents convened with officials from plano independent school district pisd or the district for an ard committee meeting.at the meeting,was determined to qualify for idea services because of suspected autism and speech impairment.the ard committee also developed iep,which proposed placing him in a class at beaty early childhood school beaty that included both special education and typically developing students.would also receive supplemental services,including weekly speech therapy sessions.his parents agreed to the iep.
enrolled at beaty in january and spent most of the spring semester there.the record reflects that,while at beaty,he made some progress toward the goals listed in his iep.nevertheless,his parents became concerned that he was showing behavioral regression.during a conference in march,they expressed concern about the perceived regression and stated their belief that needed summer school.
in may,after receiving no response from pisd about their concerns,parents removed him from beaty and him at tlc.by that time,the spring curriculum had ended at tlc,and participated in a less structured summer program,which a tlc employee referred to as play time.teacher at tlc was not certified to teach in texas public schools,was not certified in special education,and did not have a college degree.tlc did not have a speech or occupational therapist on staff.parents believed,however,that was better suited to be at tlc,in large part because the ratio of typically developing students to special education students was higher than at beaty.during the summer,parents obtained private speech and occupational therapy for him.
at the end of the summer,pisd and parents held another ard meeting to discuss modifications to the iep.more ard meetings followed throughout the fall,until january.parents wanted pisd to provide with a full day schedule and minutes of individual speech therapy and minutes of group speech therapy each week.the district instead offered to lengthen school day from hours,minutes to hours,minutes,including supervised lunch time with other students to address some of difficulties with eating.the district also offered minutes of individual speech therapy and minutes of group therapy each week.as an alternative,the district offered a dual enrollment option,whereby parents could enroll him at tlc at their own expense but receive supplemental services at beaty at no cost.
the parties could not reach an agreement.parents requested a due process hearing pursuant to the idea,which was held before a special hearing officer in april.at the hearing,alleged that pisd had denied him a fape.specifically,he alleged that,in developing his iep,the district had failed to consider the full continuum of placement options,including education environments offer an appropriate educational program at beaty during the spring of place him in the lre available for his education and provide him with education for the summer of.requested reimbursement for his tuition at tlc and privately obtained speech,occupational,and physical therapy from may onward,as well as an order that pisd continue to pay for tuition and therapy until he began kindergarten in the fall of.
the hearing officer found in favor of pisd on all but the claim.although the hearing officer found that the district had improperly denied services for the summer of,she did not award reimbursement,because had failed to notify pisd of his intent to enroll at tlc during that period as required by a c iii.
sued.both parties moved for summary judgment after agreeing that the evidence in the administrative record was sufficient.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation in favor of affirming the ruling of the hearing officer.the magistrate judge found that iep provided him with a fape,including an education in the lre,and that failure to give notice under a c iii barred reimbursement for tuition at tlc during the summer of.over objections,the district court adopted the report and recommendation.
on appeal,argues that his placement at beaty violated the idea because it was not the lre for his education and because pisd failed to follow certain procedural requirements of the idea.also contends that the notice requirement,which the district court held barred recovery for summer tuition,does not apply.
iii.standard of review.
the district court,reviewing the decision of a hearing officer under the idea,accords due weight to the hearing officer findings but ultimately reaches an independent decision based upon the preponderance of the evidence that is virtually de novo.michael,at.we review the district court decision that the iep placement of at beaty was appropriate under the idea de novo as a mixed question of law and fact the findings of underlying facts,such as findings that a disabled student obtained educational benefits under an iep,are subject to clear error review.id.citations omitted.
the role of the judiciary is not to the decisions of school officials or to substitute their plans for the education of disabled students with the court.flour bluff indep.sch.dist.katherine,cir citation omitted.instead,the court role is limited to determining whether those officials have complied with the idea.id.citation omitted.the idea creates a presumption in favor of a school district educational plan,placing the burden of proof,by preponderance of the evidence,on the party challenging it.salley tammany parish sch,cir citation omitted.
if there is a violation of the idea,we review the district court decision not to grant tuition reimbursement for abuse of discretion.tammany parish sch.bd.louisiana,cir.because we affirm the finding that pisd did provide with a fape,however,we need not review the denial of reimbursement.
iv.tuition reimbursement for the regular school year.
tuition reimbursement for private education is a remedy available to courts and hearing officers where a school district fails to provide a child with a fape to receive reimbursement,must show that his iep public placement at beaty was inappropriate under the idea and his private school this case,at proper under the idea 
we determine whether iep appropriately placed him at beaty by considering two additional questions.first,did pisd comply with the procedural requirements of the idea and second,was the iep reasonably calculated to enable to receive educational benefits michael,at citing bd.of educ.rowley.
a.did pisd comply with idea procedural requirements 
alleges three violations of the idea that could be construed as procedural.he does not explicitly identify them as procedural,perhaps because the district court held that he had not alleged procedural violations in his complaint and had thus waived his right to pursue such claims.though we are inclined to agree,we review procedural claims,assuming arguendo that they were properly raised.
the first such claim is that pisd failed to consider the harmful effects of placing at beaty when developing his iep,as required by d.that regulation no longer exists.gives us no information about whether it was effective at relevant times in the past.because the claim is inadequately briefed,it is waived.united states martinez,cir.
even if we were to consider the argument,it is directly controverted by the record.iep from december contains a standard subsection entitled,consideration of potential harmful effects,which indicates that the ard committee the potential harmful effects of placement at beaty 
also alleges that his iep offered no explanation of the extent,if any,to which w ould not participate with nondisabled children in the regular class,in violation of d a i v.again,the iep controverts claim.it contains a standard section entitled committee justification for removal from the general education,which explains that are such that he requires a special education setting but that he would still be part of a general education campus with opportunity to participate with students without disabilities in all nonacademic and extracurricular activities to the maximum extent appropriate.therefore,has not met his burden of proving a procedural violation in that respect.
finally,claims his ard committee violated the idea procedural requirements because it did not consider placing him in a regular,as opposed to special,educational setting with supplementary aids as needed.that argument dovetails with principal substantive claim,that his iep was not reasonably calculated to deliver educational benefits,because it violated the lre requirement of the idea.because of that overlap,and because has not explicitly identified a distinct procedural claim in his briefing,we will consider this claim as part of his allegation that pisd violated the substantive lre requirement of the idea 
was the substance of the iep reasonably calculated 
we move from procedure to substance.the second question we address,in reviewing the appropriateness of placement at beaty,is whether the substance of his iep was reasonably calculated to enable him to receive educational benefits.michael,at.
the lre requirement in michael and daniel 
at the outset,we must reconcile some of our precedent.we determine whether an iep was reasonably calculated using the four factors identified in michael,at is the program individualized on the basis of the student assessment and performance is the program administered in the least restrictive environment are the services provided in a coordinated and collaborative manner by the key stakeholders and are positive academic and benefits demonstrated 
argues,however,that analysis under michael is premature until we examine whether his iep satisfies the statute lre requirement.he points to daniel,at,in which we said the two part inquiry looking first to procedural violations and second to whether an iep was reasonably not the appropriate tool for determining whether a school district has met its mainstreaming,lre obligations.we then developed an independent test for satisfying the lre requirement.
michael and daniel are not in conflict.michael interpreted the lre requirement as part of the fape requirement but did not alter daniel framework for determining whether a school district satisfies the lre requirement.our analysis of the second michael factor,then,is guided by daniel 
did not address the michael factors in his briefing,insisting that only daniel is relevant.as we have just explained,we consider his arguments as relating to the second michael factor,whether the iep satisfied the statute lre provision.as for the other michael factors,nothing in briefing could be construed as challenging the district court finding that pisd satisfied the first individualized program and third stakeholder involvement factors.does argue that he regressed during his time at beaty,and this could be construed as a challenge to the district court finding,under the fourth factor,that demonstrated positive academic and nonacademic benefits under his iep.we therefore review the district court findings under the second and fourth michael factors.
standard of review under michael 
we review the district court underlying factual findings under each of the four michael factors for clear error we consider de novo any legal issues that arise under the four factors,at.
michael factor two the lre requirement.
in daniel,at,we stated a flexible,test for determining whether an iep placement was in the lre.first,we ask whether education in the regular classroom,with the use of supplemental aids and services can be achieved satisfactorily for a given child.daniel,at.if it can not and the school intends to provide special education or to remove the child from regular education,we ask,second,whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate.id.at the outset of step one,we must examine whether the state has taken steps to accommodate the handicapped child in regular education if the state has made no effort to take such accommodating steps,our inquiry ends,for the state is in violation of the act express mandate to supplement and modify regular education.id.
central argument is that pisd fails daniel step one and thus,michael factor two,because the district did not consider placing him anywhere except at beaty.his class at beaty,argues,is a special education setting,not a regular setting.it follows that pisd took no steps to accommodate him in regular education,as required by the idea.
we disagree.the hearing officer found that pisd had considered placing in a fully mainstreamed environment but rejected that option.that finding was amply supported by evidence offered at the hearing.susie vaughn,the principal at beaty and a member of ard committee,testified that the committee was aware of previous enrollment at tlc,but because
