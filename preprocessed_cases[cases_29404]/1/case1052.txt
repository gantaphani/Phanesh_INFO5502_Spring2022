opinion of the court 
in,congress amended the social security act to create a program for states to assist the poor with their medical expenses.through this program,known as medicaid,the fifty states pay medical expenses on behalf of qualified beneficiaries.for more than thirty years,in circumstances where third parties are liable for such medical expenses,the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw has recouped its expenditures by asserting liens against future settlements or judgments.in arkansas department of health and human services ahlborn,d,the supreme court assumed without deciding that such liens,when limited to the portion of a settlement or judgment constituting reimbursement for medical costs,are an implied exception to the federal law prohibiting states from imposing liens on the property of medicaid beneficiaries.we now must decide whether these liens in fact constitute such an exception.
this appeal involves a putative class action filed by three pennsylvania medicaid beneficiaries subject to dpw liens.the district court certified a question for interlocutory review pursuant to b,asking us to determine whether state agencies responsible for administering the medicaid program have the authority to assert such liens and,if so,whether pennsylvania statutory framework is consistent with the supreme court decision in ahlborn.
we begin by reviewing the facts of the state court cases filed by each of the three plaintiffs collectively,the beneficiaries.
rita tristani underwent a bunionectomy in that resulted in pain and discoloration in her leg.her surgeon suspected that she was suffering from deep venous thrombosis,and immediately referred her to the hospital.upon her arrival,tristani was examined by a medical resident who misdiagnosed her condition as superficial thrombophlebitis.roughly one week after the misdiagnosis,tristani suffered a massive pulmonary embolism and stroke,which left her partially paralyzed,disfigured,and.consequently,tristani resides in a facility where she receives medical care.
tristani was eligible for assistance under pennsylvania medicaid program,and the dpw the state agency responsible for administering medicaid paid for her medical care.in september,tristani filed a medical malpractice action in which she sought,inter alia,the costs of medical expenses that had been paid on her behalf by the dpw.approximately two months after the complaint was filed,the dpw wrote tristani counsel that,as a recipient of medical assistance,tristani had assigned her right to recover medical expenses to the dpw.in may,tristani preliminarily settled her malpractice claim for million.thereafter,seeking to recoup funds it had expended for tristani medical care,the dpw sent tristani counsel another letter asserting a lien of against her settlement.the agency later reduced this lien by to to bear its proportionate share of tristani contingency fee obligation to her counsel.on june,the state trial court issued an order directing payment of the dpw lien in full.
in january,joshua valenta was injured in a traffic accident and suffered relatively minor,but permanent injuries.valenta was eligible for government assistance,and the dpw paid for his medical expenses following his accident,valenta sued the tortfeasor,whose insurance carrier settled the case for.in april,the dpw sent valenta attorney a letter informing him that,as counsel for a medicaid recipient in a liability tort action,pennsylvania law required him to satisfy the dpw claim prior to making a distribution to his client.in august,the dpw sent another letter asserting a lien for against valenta settlement,which it reduced to to account for attorneys fees.valenta attorney promptly mailed the dpw a check for to satisfy the lien.
is a young girl who suffered brain injuries following surgery to correct a congenital heart defect.the dpw enrolled in an mco and paid capitation fees totaling on her behalf.the mco payments to health care providers totaled.the dpw also paid on a basis for benefit.in june,filed a medical malpractice claim against her doctors,which was settled in april for an undisclosed amount.after the settlement,the dpw asserted a lien for to reflect the cost of her medical care,less attorneys fees and costs.challenged the validity of the dpw lien,and,instead of paying the lien directly,mother obtained court approval to place the disputed funds in an escrow account pending the outcome of this litigation 
in may,tristani and valenta commenced a putative class action in the district court against estelle richman,pennsylvania secretary of public welfare feather houston,richman predecessor and the dpw.tristani and valenta sought a refund of their payments to the dpw,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating medicaid liens generally.they argued that the dpw claims were prohibited by the and provisions of the social security act.see a b.alternatively,they asserted that pennsylvania scheme for recouping medical expenses from medicaid recipients was impermissible under the supreme court holding in ahlborn 
several months after tristani and valenta commenced their action,richman and houston collectively,the secretaries filed a motion to dismiss.following two amendments to the complaint,the secretaries again filed a motion to dismiss and,after oral argument,the district court denied their motion without prejudice.
in april,richman and houston filed a motion for summary judgment.the next day,tristani and valenta filed a motion for partial summary judgment in which they sought a declaration that pennsylvania practice of asserting medicaid liens is invalid the dpw ability to recover medical payments made by mcos is limited to the capitation payments made by the state and pennsylvania current method of determining the portion of a settlement that constitutes medical costs violates the supreme court holding in ahlborn.
the district court issued a comprehensive opinion denying tristani and valenta motion for partial summary judgment and granting in part and denying in part the secretaries motion.the district court determined that federal law prohibits the dpw from asserting liens against recoveries obtained by medicaid beneficiaries.nevertheless,the district court denied tristani and valenta claims for monetary damages,holding that the secretaries were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court also held that pennsylvania practice of apportioning settlements between medical costs and other portions of the recovery was permissible under ahlborn.the court denied the secretaries motion for summary judgment as to tristani and valenta claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,but noted an unresolved issue regarding their standing to seek equitable relief.
after the district court issued its order,the parties filed a joint motion to add a party to cure the potential standing problem.the court permitted the parties to add who,both parties agreed,had standing with respect to the remaining issues.the district court thus amended its prior order to deny the secretaries motion for summary judgment with regard to the validity of.stat.ann.b pennsylvania statutory mechanism for attaching liens to recoveries made by medicaid beneficiaries and granted the parties motion to certify an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
although the parties agree that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal,we have an independent obligation to determine whether jurisdiction exists,even in the absence of a challenge from any party.arbaugh y h,d internal citation omitted.the district court had jurisdiction over the beneficiaries federal claims pursuant to,and exercised supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims pursuant to a.

consistent with the requirements of b,the secretaries timely petitioned this court for leave to appeal.after we granted the secretaries petition for interlocutory appeal,the beneficiaries filed a notice of in the district court.
the first issue we must confront with respect to our jurisdiction is whether the secretaries have standing to appeal the order of the district court.the general rule is that a party may not appeal a favorable decision.ryan,cir citing fittings thomas betts.here,although the district court held that the medicaid liens asserted by the dpw were impermissible,it ultimately concluded that richman and houston were entitled to qualified immunity.thus,the secretaries prevailed on this issue in the district court.horne coughlin,cir noting that when a district court makes an adverse constitutional holding followed by a determination that qualified immunity exists,appellate review of the constitutional decision may be precluded for lack of standing.
after issuing its opinion,however,the district court permitted the parties to add to the litigation to ensure that the beneficiaries would have standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief.following the addition of,and prior to certifying this interlocutory appeal,the district court amended its order to deny the secretaries motion for summary judgment with respect to the validity of the pennsylvania law permitting medicaid liens.this issue was included in the district court certification for interlocutory appeal,and constitutes an adverse judgment from which the secretaries may properly seek appellate review 
having decided that we possess jurisdiction over the secretaries appeal,we must now determine whether we have jurisdiction over the beneficiaries.although they filed a notice of in the district court,the beneficiaries failed to petition for leave to appeal in this court.we must decide whether this omission deprives us of jurisdiction over the issues raised in their.stated differently,when an appellant has timely sought and received leave to appeal,is a obligated to separately seek permission to appeal 
in yamaha motor,calhoun,d,the supreme court explained a s the text of b indicates,appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals therefore,the appellate court may address any issue fairly included within the certified order.accordingly,when we granted the secretaries petition for leave to appeal pursuant to b,we obtained jurisdiction over the entire certified order of the district court,including any portions that were decided in the appellant favor.see united transp.union local city of albuquerque,cir briscoe,concurring and dissenting.thus,to the extent that the issues raised in the beneficiaries were included in the certified order of the district court,they are properly before us on appeal

having established that jurisdiction lies,we proceed to the principal substantive issue,namely,the lawfulness of the dpw practice of imposing liens on judgments or settlements that medicaid beneficiaries obtain from third parties.we begin with an overview of the applicable statutory provisions.
the social security act provides that,as a condition to receiving medicaid assistance,states must require individuals to assign to the state any rights to support and to payment for medical care the individual has from any third party.a a.the act also requires states to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services under the plan and,in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made,to seek reimbursement to the extent of such legal liability.id.a a b.
however,and of significance to this appeal,the act also provides 
no lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the state plan,except 
a pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual,or 
b in the case of the real property of an individual who is in a nursing home and required by law to spend his own income on those expenses,and who can not reasonably be expected to return home.
id.at a.this is known as the provision.
of equal importance,the act provides that n o adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the state plan may be made,except in limited circumstances not at issue in this case.id.at b.this is known as the provision.
pennsylvania has enacted a detailed statutory framework in an attempt to comply with the requirements of the social security act.consistent with the federal mandate.stat.ann.b provides that t he acceptance of medical assistance benefits shall operate as an assignment to the dpw,by operation of law,of the assistance recipient rights to payment for medical care from any third party.
although a medicaid beneficiary must assign the portion of her recovery relating to medical costs to the s tate,pennsylvania statutory framework provides the beneficiary with a number of options for prosecuting the remainder of her claim against a third party.for example,after providing notice to the dpw,a medicaid beneficiary may elect not to include medical costs as damages in her lawsuit against a third party.see.stat.ann.b if the beneficiary chooses not to include medical costs as part of her damages,the state will not be involved in the prosecution of her claim.
when a medicaid beneficiary chooses to pursue damages for medical costs,however,the method of transferring this portion of the recovery to the state will vary depending on whether the state is involved in the lawsuit.if the action is prosecuted by the medicaid beneficiary alone,after the payment of litigation expenses and attorneys fees,the court or agency shall allocate the judgment or award between the medical portion and other damages and shall allow the dpw a first lien against the medical portion of the judgment or award,in the amount of the dpw expenditures for the benefit of the beneficiary under the medical assistance program.id.b by contrast,if the claim is prosecuted jointly by the beneficiary and the dpw,after payment of litigation expenses and attorneys fees,the court or agency shall allocate the judgment or award between the medical portion and other damages and shall make an award to the dpw out of the medical portion of the judgment or award in the amount of the benefits paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the medical assistance program.id.b.
the beneficiaries claim the dpw practice of asserting liens on recoveries made by medicaid recipients violates the antilien and provisions of the social security act.despite having assigned to pennsylvania the portion of their recovery relating to medical costs,the beneficiaries claim they retain a property interest in their choses in action,including their claims for medical expenses.thus,they claim that b which permits pennsylvania to take a lien on the portion of a settlement that constitutes medical costs effectively authorizes the imposition of a lien on a medicaid beneficiary property in violation of federal law.the dpw counters that its liens fall within an exception to the federal prohibitions on imposing liens on the property of medicaid beneficiaries and on recovering medical assistance payments made on their behalf.the dpw further asserts that the supreme court decision in ahlborn,in which the court assumed without deciding that such an exception exists,demonstrates that its liens are valid.
the district court held that the pennsylvania statute authorizing medicaid liens was preempted by federal law.the district court recognized the tension between the plain language of the and provisions of the social security act,which prohibit states from recouping medical assistance payments made on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries,and the forced assignment and reimbursement provisions of the act,which require states to recover medical assistance payments made on behalf of beneficiaries.relying on dicta in the ahlborn decision,the district court determined that medicaid beneficiaries,despite having assigned their recovery of medical costs to the state,retain an enduring property interest in this portion of their recovery.see tristani richman,d,since pennsylvania law permitted tristani and valenta to recover the entire amounts of their damages including the amounts of payments made by the dpw to provide them with medical assistance,the entire settlement awards were their property.citing ahlborn,at.the district court then attempted to harmonize the conflicting provisions of the social security act by interpreting them to require pennsylvania to take an active role in the recovery of medical costs,either by intervening in lawsuits initiated by medicaid beneficiaries or by directly pursuing liable third parties based on this approach,the district court held that b is preempted by the provision.as we shall explain,we are unpersuaded by the district court analysis 
our task is to give effect to the will of congress,and where its will has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.griffin oceanic contractors,d quoting consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.as outlined above,the social security act requires states to seek reimbursement for medical assistance payments made on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries whenever legal liability of a third party is found to exist.a b.notably,this provision is silent regarding the method by which reimbursement must be sought.the act also states that,as a condition to eligibility,medicaid beneficiaries must assign to the state any right they may have to recover medical costs from a third party.the difficulty we perceive in this case is that the plain language of these provisions conflicts with the equally plain prohibition against states imposing liens against the property of medicaid beneficiaries,a a,or recover ing any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual,id.b.the initial question,therefore,is whether the plain language of these provisions can be reconciled.
the district court attempted to resolve the apparent conflict by interpreting the act to require intervention by the states.however,the court did not adequately explain,nor is it apparent to us,how its holding is consistent with the provision,which prohibits states from seeking adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the state medical assistance plan.id.by its terms,the provision limits the ability of states to recover medical assistance payments made on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries,regardless of the specific collection method utilized.thus,the district court conclusion that pennsylvania must intervene in tort actions filed by medicaid beneficiaries can not be reconciled with the provision.
the supreme court has stated that w hen interpreting a statute,the court will not look merely to a particular clause in which general words may be used,but will take in connection with it the whole statute and the objects and policy of the law,as indicated by its various provisions,and give to it such a construction as will carry into execution the will of the legislature.kokoszka belford,d quoting brown duchesne,how.when we consider the social security act as a whole,including its text,structure,purpose,and legislative history,we conclude that the dpw practice of asserting liens against that portion of a medicaid beneficiary recovery relating to medical costs must be viewed as an exception to the and provisions.
the and provisions significantly predate the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions.as we shall explain,congress was pursuing different goals in enacting these two sets of provisions.while the and provisions were intended to ensure that medicaid beneficiaries were not forced to directly bear the costs of their medical care,the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions were intended to allow states to recoup their expenditures for medical assistance payments when third parties are held liable.by allowing states to recover these expenditures,congress both protected the public fisc and ensured that beneficiaries did not receive a windfall by recovering medical expenses they did not pay.in order to effectuate the goals animating these conflicting provisions,we must view the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions as exceptions to the and provisions 
an examination of the social security act reveals that congress has consistently pursued the dual goals of protecting the personal property of medicaid beneficiaries while ensuring that liable third parties reimburse states for medicaid expenditures.as we shall describe below,the act evolution over time reveals that congress has not viewed these objectives to be in conflict.rather,the available evidence indicates that congress did not intend that liens for medical costs would fall within the scope of the and provisions.
the and provisions were first incorporated into the social security act in,some five years before medicaid came into being.they required state medical assistance plans for the aged to 
provide that no lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance for the aged paid or to be paid on his behalf under the plan except pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual,and that there shall be no adjustment or recovery except,after the death of such individual and his surviving spouse,if any,from such individual estate of any medical assistance for the aged correctly paid on behalf of such individual under the plan.
a e supp.ii by its terms,this provision creates a system in which elderly recipients of medical assistance are insulated from paying the costs of their care during their lifetimes and the lifetimes of their surviving spouses.nevertheless,this system,which ultimately allows a state to recoup its medical assistance expenditures directly from the estate of a deceased beneficiary,in no way entitles beneficiaries to retain monies paid to them by liable third parties in compensation for their medical costs.
the legislative history of the and provisions confirms this understanding as a senate report discussing the provision stated,pursuant to the congressional framework a state would not be permitted as a condition of medical assistance to impose a lien on the property of a recipient during her lifetime however,the bill would permit the recovery from an individual estate after the death of her spouse if one survives her,at,reprinted in.the report then explains that t his provision was inserted in order to protect the individual and her spouse from the loss of their property,usually the home,during their lifetime.id.congress concern for protecting a medicaid beneficiary personal assets not her interest in recovering medical costs paid on her behalf clearly animated the enactment of the and provisions.moreover,a beneficiary property interest in her home is readily distinguishable from the inchoate interest that she retains in her chose in action,particularly since congress has mandated assignment of that chose to the state we can not agree that congress intended these provisions to prohibit states from placing liens on recoveries from liable third parties,especially in light of the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions it later added to the social security act.
the reimbursement provision of the act was first enacted in,and required state medical assistance plans to provide 
a that the state or local agency administering such plan will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the plan arising out of injury,disease,or disability,b that where the state or local agency knows that a third party has such a legal liability such agency will treat such legal liability as a resource of the individual on whose behalf the care and services are made available for purposes of determining a potential recipient eligibility for medical assistance and that in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual,the state or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.
a supp.iii.the plain language of this provision requires states to consider liability when making medicaid eligibility determinations,and to seek reimbursement of sums expended when liability is unknown at the time payments are made.in this way,the reimbursement provision protects the public fisc while preventing medicaid beneficiaries from receiving a windfall.although the and provisions were in force when the reimbursement provision was enacted,congress made no attempt to reconcile this new requirement with the prohibition against states recovering medical assistance payments made on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries.instead,the statute simply requires states to consider any known liability as an asset of the individual in determining eligibility,and to seek reimbursement when liability is discovered after medical assistance payments have been made 
the legislative history of the reimbursement provision confirms that congress intended to ensure that states recover medical assistance payments made on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries whenever third parties are found liable for medical expenses.as stated during a senate hearing 
unquestionably,many beneficiaries will be paid twice through receipt of benefits under the m edicaid program,and from obligations imposed upon the insurance industry by the liability system.to the extent that the medicaid program is intended to assist the medically indigent,it is not consistent to apply m edicaid benefits to those whose needs are being met by a third party under a legal or contractual obligation.to the extent that health care protection is being provided from sources other than under the social security program,the resulting duplication is discriminatory and a wasteful,inefficient use of public funds.
social security amendments of hearing before the comm.on finance,cong.statement of wallace smith.
the forced assignment provision of the social security act was first enacted in.as a condition of receiving medicaid benefits,the forced assignment provision obligates states to require individuals 
to assign the state any rights,of the individual or of any other person who is eligible for medical assistance under this title and on whose behalf the individual has the legal authority to execute an assignment of such rights,to support specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order and to payment for medical care from any third party.
a a.by its terms,this provision requires individuals,as a condition of receiving medicaid benefits,to confer upon the state their right to recover the costs of their medical care.this is further evidence of congressional intent to ensure that medicaid beneficiaries do not receive a windfall by recovering medical costs they did not pay.
our review of the evolution of the various provisions of the social security act reveals that the only way to harmonize the conflicting language of the and provisions with the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions is to conclude that the and provisions do not apply to medical costs recoverable from liable third parties.the and provisions evince congressional intent to protect the assets of medicaid recipients,and to ensure that beneficiaries are not forced to personally bear the costs of their medical care.meanwhile,the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions require states to recover the costs of medical assistance payments despite the apparent prohibition against seeking recovery of medical assistance payments.it defies common sense to conclude that congress intended to protect the rights of medicaid beneficiaries to recover medical costs that they never paid in the first place.indeed,federal law requires beneficiaries to assign their right to recover such medical costs to the state,because it is the state not the beneficiaries that pays these costs.
our conclusion that liens on medical costs are excepted from the and provisions is bolstered by the forced assignment provision.the district court viewed the forced assignment provision as evidence of congressional intent to require states to intervene in lawsuits initiated by medicaid beneficiaries against third parties.we see it differently.
as the secretaries correctly point out,a partial assignment typically creates a lien on a portion of the recovery in favor of the assignee.see,matchett wold,cir an ordinary lien attaches to property in being the statutory attorney lien attaches to an expectation of recovery,the court thought the statute better described therefore as making the attorney in effect a partial assignee of his client interest in the lawsuit angeles real estate kerxton,cir u nder general common law principles,a partial assignment creates an equitable lien in favor of the assignee.law research,martin lutz appellate printers,cir t he assignment of part of an existing right under a judgment creates an immediate lien in favor of the assignee that is valid against later lien creditors of the assignor.we do not believe that congress would prohibit states from imposing liens to recoup medical costs while at the same time imposing a requirement that has the legal effect of creating such liens.the more logical conclusion is that congress understood that the legal effect of the forced assignment provision would be to provide the states with a lien on recoveries of medical costs.thus,in our view,the forced assignment provision is evidence of congress intent to except recoveries of medical assistance payments whenever third parties are found liable for them.
unlike the district court,we do not believe that congress intended to require states to intervene in medicaid beneficiaries lawsuits in order to recoup medical costs from third parties.congress enacted the forced assignment provision more than a decade after it began requiring states to seek reimbursement for medical costs from liable third parties.the purpose of the provision was to ensure that states were able to recoup their outlays.thus,far from restricting the state ability to recoup medical expenses,the forced assignment provision was intended to facilitate the state recovery of those funds.
finally,practical considerations weigh in favor of our holding today.at present,over thirty states use liens to recoup medical expenses paid on behalf of medicaid beneficiaries from liable third parties.see state peters.and disparate federal and state courts have overwhelmingly endorsed this practice.see supra note.in pennsylvania,the authority for imposing such liens dates back to.see.laws after payment of expenses and attorneys fees the court or agency shall,on the application of the department,allow as a first lien against the amount of such judgment or award,the amount of the department expenditures for the benefit of the beneficiary under the medical assistance program.since then,congress has had occasion to amend the and provisions,and has chosen not to prohibit this widespread and pervasive practice.its failure to do so further supports our holding that medicaid medical expense liens are excepted from the and provisions.see lorillard pons,d congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.
the text of the social security act,when combined with its structure,purpose,and legislative history,reveals that congress sought to accomplish different goals in enacting the and provisions on the one hand,and the reimbursement and forced assignment provisions on the other hand.while the and provisions were intended to protect the assets of medicaid recipients,the forced assignment and reimbursement provisions were intended to limit the financial burden of medicaid on the states and ensure that medicaid beneficiaries did not receive a windfall by recovering medical costs they did not pay in this context,the forced assignment and reimbursement provisions are best viewed as creating an implied exception to the and provisions of the act.our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the statutory mechanism created by congress for beneficiaries to relinquish their right to recover medical assistance payments to the state a partial assignment itself creates a lien.consequently,we hold that liens on settlements or judgments limited to medical costs are not prohibited by the and provisions of the social security act.
having determined that liens limited to recoveries for medical costs are not prohibited by the and provisions,we now turn to pennsylvania method of apportioning settlements between medical costs and the remainder of a beneficiary recovery.typically,a medicaid beneficiary recovery from a third party will compensate her for a variety of damages,including medical costs,lost wages and pain and suffering.pursuant to the supreme court holding in ahlborn,states may be reimbursed only for the portion of the recovery constituting compensation for medical expenses.many settlements,however including those at issue in this appeal are not specifically apportioned between medical costs and other types of damages.the question before us is how,in the absence of explicit allocation,one may ascertain what portion of a settlement is allocable to medical expenses recoverable by the state.
pennsylvania has addressed this allocation problem by providing 
except as otherwise provided in this act,notwithstanding any other provision of law,the entire amount of any settlement of the injured beneficiary action or claim,with or without suit,is subject to the department claim for reimbursement of the benefits provided any lien filed pursuant thereto,but in no event shall the department claim exceed of the beneficiary recovery after deducting for attorney fees,litigation costs,and medical expenses relating to the injury paid for by the beneficiary.
stat.ann.b.as the district court noted,the dpw has construed this provision as establish ing a statutory default rule of allocation for tort recoveries consistent with ahlborn.tristani richman,d,quoting.bull.pursuant to the dpw construction of section b,in the absence of a judicial allocation of damages,the dpw is entitled to recover the lesser of its actual expenditures on medical costs or one half of the beneficiary recovery after expenses.
in this appeal,the beneficiaries medical costs constitute less than of their recoveries therefore,the dpw has recovered or,in case,seeks to recover the full amount of its medicaid expenditures,less a pro rata reduction for attorneys fees and costs.the beneficiaries argue,however,that they settled their claims for less than full value,and that the dpw recovery for medical costs should be reduced correspondingly.because no such reduction occurred,the beneficiaries claim that the dpw liens exceed the scope of the interests they assigned to the agency in violation of ahlborn.
the district court rejected the beneficiaries argument,concluding that pennsylvania law validly adopted a default apportionment mechanism to divide settlements between medical costs and other expenses.the district court noted that although section b predates ahlborn,thereafter the dpw has interpreted it as establishing a default apportionment between and medical expenses.this interpretation has since been codified in,which states 
b in determining the portion of a tort recovery that represents payment for medical care by a third party,the department will apply the following interpretations 
in the absence of a court order allocating tort proceeds among categories of damages of the net proceeds are allocated by law to be available to repay medicaid expenses.the amount of net proceeds is computed by deducting from the gross proceeds the attorney fees,litigation costs and medical expenses relating to the injury that were paid for by the beneficiary prior to the settlement of the injured beneficiary action or claim.
the department is not bound by a private agreement between the parties to a tort claim regarding allocation of the proceeds.
d if a court does not adjudicate the amount of the department claim against a settlement,the bureau of hearings and appeals has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal by a beneficiary contesting the amount of the department claim.
this regulation explains section b relationship to the rule of ahlborn,and formally establishes a default method for establishing the portion of a recovery relating to medical costs 
the district court found this scheme to be consistent with federal law.the court noted that ahlborn recognized the possibility that plaintiffs would manipulate settlement agreements to artificially depress the portion attributable to medical expenses.in ahlborn,the supreme court suggested that this risk could be avoided either by obtaining the state advance agreement to an allocation or,if necessary,by submitting the matter to a court for decision.ahlborn,at.in a footnote,the court stated 
s ome states have adopted special rules and procedures for allocating tort settlements in circumstances where,for example,private insurers rights to recovery are at issue.although we express no view on the matter,we leave open the possibility that such rules and procedures might be employed to meet concerns about settlement manipulation.
id.at.the district court held that pennsylvania allocation and agency appeal provisions are special rules and procedures of this kind that are consistent with the federal requirement that the state recovery not exceed the portion of the recovery attributable to expenses.the supreme courts of north carolina and idaho have reached similar conclusions with respect to analogous state laws.see state dep t of health welfare hudelson,idaho,idaho andrews ex rel.andrews haygood.
alternatively,the district court held that pennsylvania apportionment scheme is valid because,under pennsylvania law,a settlement represents full compensation for an individual damages,which implies that the beneficiaries can not,after settling,claim that they were not made whole.under pennsylvania law,when a subrogor settles a claim,he essentially waives his right to a judicial determination of his losses,and therefore conclusively establishes the settlement amount as full compensation for his damages.goldman workers comp.appeal bd.girard provision.hence,in effect,pennsylvania law indicates that when an individual settles his suit he is later estopped from claiming that his damages exceed the amount settled for.allstate ins.clarke.the pennsylvania supreme court has never explicitly adopted this rule,but as the cases quoted above demonstrate,it has gained some traction in the lower courts.accordingly,the district court held that,even in the absence of the statutory default allocation,the made whole doctrine would fix the portion of the beneficiaries settlement attributable to medicaid expenses at an amount equal to the dpw actual expenditures.
we agree with the district court conclusion that pennsylvania apportionment scheme is valid.pursuant to the current statutory framework,beneficiaries unhappy with its results may appeal the default allocation.this mechanism is consistent with the supreme court holding in ahlborn,and comports with the practice of other states.therefore,we will affirm this portion of the district court order 
despite the validity of pennsylvania current apportionment scheme,the question remains whether the prior scheme,which did not provide a right of appeal from the default allocation,is valid under ahlborn the district court upheld the scheme,but we find it problematic.
although the ahlborn court acknowledged the existence in state law of special rules and procedures for allocating settlements,and left open the possibility that such rules may be employed to address concerns about settlement manipulation,at,it did not give states unfettered discretion to allocate settlements without regard to the actual portion attributable to medical expenses.indeed,ahlborn expressed a preference for resolving allocation disputes either by obtaining the state advance agreement to an allocation or,if necessary,by submitting the matter to a court for decision.id.at.
we express no view as to whether allocation disputes of this type must be adjudicated by a court,or may instead be resolved through other special rules and procedures.id.at.we hold merely that in determining what portion of a medicaid beneficiary recovery it may claim in reimbursement for medicaid expenses,the state must have in place procedures that allow a dissatisfied beneficiary to challenge the default allocation.as the beneficiaries point out,without such a rule nothing would prevent states from allocating,or even of a settlement to medical expenses,thereby eviscerating the rule promulgated by ahlborn.because the district court concluded otherwise,we will reverse its order in this respect and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in ahlborn,the supreme court assumed without deciding that liens on recoveries made by medicaid beneficiaries for medical costs constitute an exception to the and antirecovery provisions of the social security act.medicaid beneficiaries in pennsylvania have questioned this assumption by challenging the state practice of utilizing such liens.our examination of the text,structure,history and purpose of the social security act leads us to conclude that liens limited to medical costs are not prohibited by the and provisions of the act.accordingly,we uphold pennsylvania longstanding practice of imposing such liens.
the beneficiaries have also challenged pennsylvania practice of disaggregating medical costs to comport with the requirements of ahlborn.we hold that pennsylvania current statutory framework,which affords medicaid recipients a right of appeal from the default allocation,is a permissible default apportionment scheme.the prior framework,which did not afford beneficiaries a right of appeal,is invalid under ahlborn.
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree with the majority that we possess jurisdiction over the defendants appeal,and that we possess jurisdiction over the issues raised in the plaintiffs to the extent those issues were included in the certified order of the district court.however,like the district court,i do not believe congress intended to permit state medicaid agencies,such as the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw,to impose liens on judgments and settlements obtained by medicaid beneficiaries from third parties i therefore respectfully dissent.
as a condition of participating in medicaid,states must prepare a state medicaid plan to comply with various requirements set out in the social security act.see generally.as relevant here,a state medicaid plan must permit the state to seek reimbursement when third parties are liable for medical services provided by medicaid.specifically,the plan must provide 
a that the state or local agency administering such plan will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the plan,including 
i the collection of sufficient information to enable the state to pursue claims against such third parties,
ii the submission to the secretary of a plan subject to approval by the secretary for pursuing claims against such third parties 
b that in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the state can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery,the state or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability 
id.a a b emphasis added reimbursement provision.
a state medicaid plan must also require individuals enrolled in medicaid to assign to the state their right to payment for medical care from third parties,and to cooperate with the state efforts to recover those payments.in relevant part,this provision states that 
a for the purpose of assisting in the collection of medical support payments and other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assistance under the state plan approved under this subchapter,a state plan for medical assistance shall 
provide that,as a condition of eligibility for medical assistance under the state plan to an individual who has the legal capacity to execute an assignment for himself,the individual is required 
a to assign the state any rights to support specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order and to payment for medical care from any third party 
b to cooperate with the state in obtaining support and payments described in subparagraph a for himself and 
c to cooperate with the state in identifying,and providing information to assist the state in pursuing,any third party who may be liable to pay for care and services available under the plan.
b such part of any amount collected by the state under an assignment made under the provisions of this section shall be retained by the state as is necessary to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such assignment was executed and the remainder of such amount collected shall be paid to such individual.
id.a b emphasis added 
in addition to the reimbursement and provisions,the social security act contains an provision,which states that 
no lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the state plan,except 
a pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual,or 
b in the case of the real property of an individual when the individual is an inpatient in a medical institution,is required to spend her own income as a condition of receiving services in the institution,and is unlikely to ever be discharged from the institution and to return home.
id.at a.the act also contains an provision,which states that n o adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the state plan may be made,except in limited circumstances not at issue in this case.id.at b.
to comply with the foregoing provisions of the social security act,pennsylvania has enacted.stat.ann.b,which provides that the acceptance of medical assistance benefits shall operate as an assignment to the dpw,by operation of law,of the assistance recipient rights to recover payment for medical care from any third party.pennsylvania has also enacted.stat.ann,which governs third party liability in the context of medicaid.under section,when medicaid benefits are provided to a beneficiary because of an injury for which a including an insurer is liable,both the dpw and the beneficiary may bring an independent cause of action against the.if the dpw institutes suit,it has the right to recover from such person or insurer the reasonable value of benefits so provided.id.b.if a beneficiary brings an action against a liable third party,the beneficiary may,if he so desires,include as part of his claim the amount of medicaid benefits that have been or will be provided by the dpw.id.b vi.
if the beneficiary institutes an action against such a third party,the beneficiary must notify the dpw of the suit within thirty days,id.b,and the dpw may intervene in the suit at any time before trial,id.b v.however,the dpw is not required to intervene in a beneficiary suit,and may instead wait until the su
