after production employees of mullican lumber and manufacturing company mullican lumber filed a petition with the national labor relations board nlrb or the board to decertify representation by the united mine workers of america the union,mullican lumber received information from the employees that the decertification petition revealed that a majority of the employees no longer supported the union.based on this information,mullican lumber withdrew recognition of the union.on the union subsequent unfair labor practice charges,the general counsel of the board filed a complaint against mullican lumber,alleging that the evidence mullican lumber relied on to withdraw recognition of the union was insufficient.even though neither the union nor the general counsel of the board challenged mullican lumber evidence at the hearing before the administrative law judge,nor ever denied that a majority of the employees signed the petition to decertify the union,the board agreed with the general counsel and held that mullican lumber violated a of the national labor relations act in withdrawing recognition of the union.accordingly,the board ordered that mullican lumber recognize the union and bargain with it as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of its production employees.
on the board application for enforcement and mullican lumber for review,we conclude that mullican lumber advanced substantial objective evidence,consistent with the standard articulated in levitz furniture of the pacific,and sufficient to demonstrate that,more likely than not,the production employees no longer supported the union.because the general counsel of the board did not challenge or contradict the evidence,we deny the board application for enforcement and grant mullican lumber for review.
united mine workers of america was certified on august,as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the production employees of mullican lumber at its plant in norton,virginia.thereafter,the union and mullican lumber engaged in contract negotiations for almost a year.
in august,however,a number of mullican lumber production employees no longer wished to be represented by the union,and charles dixon,the union lead negotiator,told charles tuck,mullican lumber lead negotiator,that the company employees were circulating a petition for decertification.the employees actually filed their decertification petition with the nlrb regional office on september,and the nlrb so notified mullican lumber.but mullican lumber did not then learn whether the petition was supported by a majority of production employees or only the required by board rule for a decertification election,and it did not make inquiry of the number signing the petition,as it understood that to do so would have been unlawful.see nlrb air prods,cir.
because mullican lumber did not know whether the petition was signed by a majority of the employees,it continued its efforts to reach agreement on a collective bargaining agreement with the union.the union and the company had last met in a bargaining session on september,at which time agreement had been reached on all terms except five addendums.the union had apparently signed addendums a,b,and c but had refused to sign addendums d and 
on the day after the employees filed their decertification petition,the union called a meeting of the production employees during which the employees ratified a purported collective bargaining agreement.the employees were presented all the terms that had been agreed to on september,but not addendums d and on the following day,september,the union sent a letter to mullican lumber stating that the collective bargaining agreement had been ratified and that it was the union understanding that the parties had actually reached agreement on september,so that the ratification was retroactive to that date.the september date was significant because it came before the employees had filed their decertification petition,and under the rule,no challenges to the union majority status could be entertained for the life of a valid collective bargaining agreement.see nlrb burns int l sec,d gen l cable.thus,if agreement had been reached on september,the decertification petition filed on september would have been nullified.
in response to the union letter,mullican lumber denied that the parties had reached agreement on september and sought to continue bargaining with the union.the company later wrote the union,stating that during the negotiations on september,the parties reached a proposed tentative agreement on all issues,except five addendums which were presented to the union as a complete package to reach a final settlement on the contract.although you executed addendums a,b and c on behalf of the union,you refused to sign addendums d and the company letter also pointed out that addendums d and e had never been submitted to the c ompany employees for a ratification vote and,until such time as the c ompany approves them and there is a ratification vote on all agreed upon items,in accordance with the ground rules,we have no agreement.the company concluded by saying that it was requesting the union to meet and bargain over these issues.
the union refused to bargain.instead,it filed unfair labor practice charges against mullican lumber,claiming among other things that mullican lumber and the union had reached an agreement on september.in the months that followed,the union continued to file additional unfair labor practice charges,which were recognized as blocking charges because they blocked the board processing of the employees decertification petition under the board policy of holding in abeyance such petitions when there are pending unfair labor practice charges that would have a tendency to interfere with the free choice of employees in an election.between september,and june,the union filed approximately blocking charges against mullican lumber,alleging more than separate unfair labor practices.ultimately all of the charges,including the union assertion that the parties had reached a final agreement on contract terms on september,were withdrawn by the union or dismissed by the board.
during the period after the employees filed their decertification petition,various employees began to inform the company on an unsolicited basis that the union had lost majority support.among those employees were james doug carroll,david long,shayne stapleton,and jeff mathison,all of whom specifically told mullican lumber plant manager ricky allen burchfield that the union did not have majority support.burchfield also heard feedback from unnamed employees that only four or five employees were attending union meetings and that after the union president ceased to be an employee in november,there had been no election for a new president,even though several months had passed.on may,james carroll,the employee who prepared and filed the decertification petition with the nlrb,sent the company a letter,reiterating the facts of the petition,as follows 
this is to inform you that a majority of the employees of mullican lumber,no longer want to be represented by the united mine workers of america.
out of employees have signed decertification slips noting they no longer want to be represented by the united mine workers of america.these signatures have been filed with the national labor relations board.therefore we request that management deal directly with the employees of mullican lumber,instead of the united mine workers of america.
carroll sent a copy of the letter to the nlrb.
following receipt of this letter,mullican lumber formally wrote the union on june,stating that it was withdrawing recognition of the union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees.the letter explained that mullican lumber had received written notification that out of of our employees have signed for decertification and based upon this objective evidence we withdraw recognition of the union.the union did not dispute or challenge the facts that mullican lumber asserted,but it did file additional unfair labor practice charges with the board.because the union charges were again blocking charges,they prevented the board from acting on the employees decertification petition.indeed,the decertification petition remains pending with the board,unresolved now for over six years.
acting on the union charges,the board general counsel issued a consolidated complaint against mullican lumber charging that by failing to execute a written collective bargaining agreement with the union on or about april,and by withdrawing recognition from the union on june,the company violated a and a of the national labor relations act,a,a.
after a trial on the charges before an administrative law judge alj,the alj found that the parties had not reached agreement on all essential terms of the collective bargaining agreement and that therefore mullican lumber had acted lawfully when it refused to execute the purported bargaining agreement.but the alj also found that mullican lumber failed to present objective evidence of loss of majority status and therefore violated the national labor relations act when it withdrew recognition of the union.the alj explained that the numerous oral statements made by employees were hearsay,and he discounted carroll may letter because there is no probative evidence that each of those employees was in the unit or employed on june when the respondent withdrew recognition there is no evidence that the respondent identified the employees who had purportedly signed decertification slips,determined that each employee was in the unit,or sought to authenticate their signatures.the alj thus concluded that mullican lumber had not established by objective evidence that a majority of its unit employees had ceased to support the union and therefore had committed an unfair labor practice in withdrawing recognition of the union,in violation of a of the national labor relations act.
relying on the alj conclusions,the board affirmed the alj ruling after a delay of more than four years and entered an order dated july,directing,among other things,that mullican lumber withdraw its june,letter,recognize the union,and bargain in good faith with the union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of its production employees.
the general counsel of the board filed this application for enforcement in our court,and mullican lumber filed a for review.in its response to the application for enforcement and in support of its for review,mullican lumber contends that it was justified in withdrawing recognition of the union,based on the evidence it had.it also challenges,as an inappropriate remedy,the board affirmative bargaining order.
on the application and,we review the nlrb findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.e,f nlrb transpersonnel,cir.
the general counsel contends that mullican lumber failed to meet its burden of showing that the union had,in fact,lost the support of the majority of the employees on the day it withdrew recognition,arguing that the evidence presented was insufficient.the evidence relied upon by the company consists of unverified hearsay regarding the employees union sentiment,a old employee decertification petition,and no objective evidence of the number of employees in the unit on the date of withdrawal.because mullican lumber evidence was insufficient,the general counsel maintains,the presumption of majority support survived and the general counsel was never required to present any contrary evidence to show majority support.see levitz furniture of the pacific.
mullican lumber contends that it did in fact present objective evidence that the union had lost majority support and,because the general counsel did not present any,rebuttal,or the issue,the only evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the union had lost majority status.the company adds 
compounding this error,the board allowed the general counsel to prevail on its withdrawal of recognition claim even though the general counsel withheld the decertification slips that would have conclusively established whether the union lacked majority support at the time mullican lumber withdrew recognition.these decertification slips were in the exclusive custody and control of the general counsel who chose not to introduce them or offer any evidence regarding them at the hearing.
the parties assertions thus present the issue of whether mullican lumber presented sufficient evidence demonstrating that the union had lost majority support.the parties agree that the controlling evidentiary standard was defined by the board opinion in levitz.
levitz held that an employer may rebut the continuing presumption of an incumbent union majority status,and unilaterally withdraw recognition,only on a showing that the union has,in fact,lost the support of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.at.under levitz,the employer must prove loss of majority status by a preponderance of the evidence,and to make that showing,the employer must present objective evidence that the union has lost majority support,id.emphasis added see also id.at some objective evidence.in articulating this standard,levitz overruled the prior subjective standard by which an employer could withdraw recognition from a union if the employer had a doubt as to whether the union continued to enjoy majority support.see id.at transpersonnel,at.
justifying the new standard,the board in levitz pointed out 
employers are not without access to evidence on this issue.for example,the respondent here was presented with the unsolicited views of employees regarding representation matters.indeed,had the union not asserted that it had contrary evidence,the respondent would have had a good case,based on the petition it received from a majority of the unit employees,that the union had,in fact,lost majority support.
at emphasis added.to apply the new standard,the board anticipated a scheme,explaining that once an employer presents objective evidence demonstrating the union loss of majority status,the general counsel may rebut the evidence in order to shift the burden back to the employer ultimately to make its showing by a preponderance of the evidence.if the general counsel presents nothing in rebuttal,however,the employer will ordinarily prevail.see id.at.
objective evidence does not refer to the force of the evidence,but rather its source.see allentown mack sales serv.nlrb,d.as the supreme court explained,r equiring the employer doubt to be based on objective considerations reinforces the requirement that the doubt be reasonable,imposing on the employer the burden of showing that it was supported by evidence external to the employer own subjective impressions.id.at emphasis added.while the standard referred to in allentown mack has now been overruled by levitz,the definition of objective has not.
in this case,mullican lumber presented the following evidence in support of its claim that the union had lost majority support 
first,it received information from the union negotiator that the production employees were circulating a decertification petition,and from the nlrb that the petition had in fact been filed with the nlrb on september,indicating under nlrb rules that at least of the employees no longer supported the union.
second,at least four named employees in the bargaining unit,inquiring when decertification would proceed,made statements to mullican lumber plant manager that the union no longer had the support of a majority of the employees.
third,an additional number of unnamed production employees told mullican lumber plant manager that a majority of the company production employees did not support the union and asked why decertification had not proceeded.
fourth,unnamed employees advised mullican lumber plant manager that only four or five employees attended union meetings and the members had for months not elected a president after the former president left his employment at the plant.
fifth,james carroll,the production employee who actually prepared and filed the decertification petition with the nlrb and thereby had knowledge of it,wrote mullican lumber in may,informing the company specifically that a majority of the production employees no longer want ed to be represented by the united mine workers of america and that out of employees have signed decertification slips noting they no longer want to be represented by the united mine workers of america.
sixth,mullican lumber recognized that,on the day after the decertification petition was filed,the union sought retroactively to ratify an incompletely negotiated collective bargaining agreement in an effort to nullify the decertification petition.in addition,the union filed ongoing blocking charges that had the effect of delaying the board ability to consider the decertification petition.
and seventh,the union never disputed mullican lumber assertion that the union lost majority support.
the alj held that this evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate loss of majority support largely because it was not objective evidence or because it constituted hearsay,albeit hearsay.specifically,on the evidence about attendance at union meetings,the alj found that it did not address a loss of majority status.on the evidence of oral reports from individual employees about the loss of majority status,the alj found it to be hearsay.and on carroll letter to mullican lumber,the alj found that the evidence was inadequate or uncorroborated.he stated 
although carroll letter states that of employees had signed decertification slips,there is no probative evidence that each of those employees was in the unit or employed on june when the respondent withdrew recognition.no representative of the respondent ever saw,or requested to see,the decertification slips to which carroll referred in his letter.there is no evidence that the respondent identified the employees who had purportedly signed decertification slips,determined that each employee was in the unit,or sought to authenticate their signatures.
the alj opinion did not,however,address why mullican lumber evidence was not objective or why hearsay could not be considered as probative evidence,especially when the general counsel had never objected to the evidence.in fact,most of mullican lumber evidence was precisely of the type considered objective and probative in levitz.
in levitz,the employer received a petition bearing what it believed to be signatures of a majority of bargaining unit employees,stating that they no longer wanted to be represented by the union.responding to that evidence,the employer informed the union that it would be withdrawing recognition of the union.at.the union in levitz,however,disputed the employer allegation,stating,t o the contrary,we are in possession of objective evidence that local does represent a majority of the bargaining unit employees the union is ready at any time to demonstrate this fact to you.id.while noting that the burden of demonstrating the loss of majority support fell on the employer,the board in levitz also suggested that,without the union assertion of contrary evidence,the employer would have had a good case 
we think it entirely appropriate to place the burden of proof on employers to show actual loss of majority support employers are not without access to evidence on this issue.for example,the respondent here was presented with the unsolicited views of employees regarding representation matters.indeed,had the union not asserted that it had contrary evidence,the respondent would have had a good case,based on the petition it received from a majority of the unit employees,that the union had,in fact,lost majority support.
id.at emphasis added footnote omitted.in a footnote,the board elaborated,stating that a n employer who presents evidence that,at the time it withdrew recognition,the union had lost majority support should ordinarily prevail in an a case if the general counsel does not come forward with evidence rebutting the employer evidence.id.at.however,i f the general counsel does present such evidence,then the burden remains on the employer to establish loss of majority support by a preponderance of all the evidence.id.
in this case,mullican lumber presented evidence of the type recognized in levitz to demonstrate that the union lost its majority status.most analogous was carroll letter,in which carroll,who had prepared and filed the decertification petition with the board and therefore had personal knowledge of its contents,stated that the petition revealed a loss of majority support.yet,the general counsel did not present any rebuttal evidence,nor make any arguments challenging or calling into question the evidence presented by mullican lumber.the general counsel case,instead,focused unsuccessfully on proving its charge that mullican lumber unlawfully refused to execute the collective bargaining agreement.as a consequence,the alj opinion could only speculate as to the arguments that the general counsel could have made in response to mullican lumber evidence on the lack of majority as that mullican lumber might have had more than production employees or that some of the signatures on the decertification petitions might not have been valid.but,the general counsel neither made these arguments nor presented any evidence to support them.moreover,the general counsel never even challenged the authenticity or accuracy of carroll letter or the other evidence mullican lumber presented.indeed,it was the general counsel who moved carroll letter into evidence.had the general counsel doubted the genuineness of carroll letter or any other evidence presented by mullican lumber,he could have called it into question before the alj and the parties could have conducted further investigation and inquiry into the circumstances.
in short,neither the union nor the general counsel asserted that it had contrary evidence,and therefore,under levitz,we conclude that mullican lumber had a good case,based on the evidence it presented.see levitz,at.the employees statements,and particularly the letter from carroll,were the best type of evidence that an employer could have presented about the loss of majority support,in light of the board policies prohibiting an employer involvement in decertification efforts and insuring confidentiality of decertification petition information.without the general counsel making some argument or presenting some evidence to contradict mullican lumber support of which the company had presented are not free to speculate,as the alj did,about possible that were not made and that were unsupported by any offer of proof.
in short,we are left with circumstances that fit precisely into the scenario contemplated by employer present ed evidence that,at the time it withdrew recognition,the union had lost majority support,and therefore,the employer should ordinarily prevail because the general counsel did not come forward with evidence rebutting the employer evidence.id.at.
before us,the general counsel now argues,for the first time in this case,that we should enforce the board order because,as the alj found,mullican lumber evidence was not objective and constituted hearsay.on his argument that the evidence was not objective,the general counsel misconstrues what objective evidence is,focusing on its nature as hearsay or its weight.but as the supreme court observed in allentown mack,objective evidence is evidence external to the employer own subjective impressions.at.that is precisely the type of evidence mullican lumber presented in this case.the unsolicited statements and letters from employees,stating that a majority of them no longer supported the union,were external to mullican lumber own subjective impressions.and the letter from carroll was not only unsolicited but was written by the very person who filed the decertification petition with the nlrb.we hold that this evidence meets the objective requirement.see levitz,at considering as persuasive,and therefore necessarily objective evidence,the unsolicited views of employees regarding representation matters.
with respect to the general counsel argument that some of the evidence was hearsay,the general counsel is not now in a position to say enough to exclude the evidence.the simple fact that evidence might be hearsay does not automatically lead to its exclusion.hearsay evidence might be admissible under an e
