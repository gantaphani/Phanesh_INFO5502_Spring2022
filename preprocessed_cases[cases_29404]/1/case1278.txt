dawn bennett and her firm,bennett group financial services,llc,collectively,bennett appeal the district court dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of her suit challenging the constitutionality of the administrative enforcement proceeding that the securities and exchange commission sec or commission brought against her.for the following reasons,we join the second,seventh,eleventh,and circuits that have addressed the issue,and affirm.
congress has authorized the commission to address potential violations of the federal securities laws,including the securities exchange act of exchange act,et,either by filing an enforcement action in federal district court or by instituting an administrative proceeding.see,d,a.congress further authorized the sec to delegate its adjudicative functions to an administrative law judge alj,while retain ing a discretionary right to review the action of any such alj on its own initiative or at a party request.id.a b.the sec implemented this framework through its rules of practice.see.when the commission initially assigns enforcement proceedings to an alj,the alj holds a hearing and makes an initial decision,which the respondent may appeal by petitioning for review before the full commission.id.a,a.the commission reviews the alj initial decision de novo and may take additional evidence.see id,a,see also jarkesy sec,cir.whether or not a party seeks further administrative review,the commission alone not the alj has the authority to issue the agency final decision in the proceeding.d.
in the exchange act,congress has provided that judicial review of administrative enforcement proceedings shall be available directly in the appropriate court of appeals.a.when an aggrieved person files a petition,the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive.id.a.for judicial review of final commission orders,the exchange act specifies what constitutes the agency record,id.a,the standard of review,id.a,and the process for seeking a stay of the commission order either before the commission or in the court of appeals,id.c.against this background,we turn to the present dispute.
dawn bennett founded bennett group financial services,llc as an independent investment firm around.around january,the commission began investigating bennett and her firm.
on september,the commission instituted an administrative proceeding against bennett to determine whether,as the sec division of enforcement alleged,bennett had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by materially misstating the amount of assets managed for investors,materially misstating investor performance,and failing to adopt and implement adequate written policies for calculating and advertising assets managed and investment returns.in re bennett grp.fin,llc,exchange act release,wl,order instituting proceedings.the proceedings sought to determine whether bennett conduct warranted disgorgement,civil monetary penalties,a order,and a securities industry bar.id.at.the commission assigned the initial stages of the proceeding to an alj.id.at.the alj scheduled a hearing on the merits of bennett case for january.in re bennett grp.fin,llc,sec release,wl,alj scheduling order.
on october,bennett filed this action in federal district court,seeking to enjoin the administrative proceeding and a declaration that it is unconstitutional.the complaint alleged that the sec administrative enforcement proceedings violate article ii of the united states constitution,which provides that t he executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states,const.art.ii,cl,and that the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,as they think proper in the heads of departments,id,cl.specifically,bennett alleged that aljs count as inferior officers and that the sec commissioners collectively,a head of a department failed to appoint them,and those aljs enjoy at least two levels of protection against removal,which impedes presidential supervision over their exercise of executive power and thereby contravenes the separation of powers.free enterprise fund pub.accounting oversight.
the district court determined it lacked jurisdiction over bennett case and dismissed the action on december.bennett timely appealed,seeking an injunction pending appeal and expedited review.dkt.this court denied both requests.dkt,
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction.taxpayers union soc.sec,cir.
federal district courts generally have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.see also id.however,congress may expressly divest the district courts of jurisdiction over certain claims.see,shalala.council on long term care.congress can also impliedly preclude jurisdiction by creating a statutory scheme of administrative adjudication and delayed judicial review in a particular court.see,thunder basin coal reich.
three supreme court decisions principally inform our analysis of the inquiry presented thunder basin coal company reich,free enterprise fund public accounting oversight board,and elgin department of the treasury we discuss each in turn.
in thunder basin,the supreme court considered a petitioner challenge to the federal mine safety and health amendments act of,et mine act.at.thunder basin,a coal company,objected to a mine act regulation that required it to post the names of certain union representatives authorized under the statute to accompany the secretary of labor during physical inspections of mines.see id.at citing.rather than seek review of the regulation through the mine act scheme,thunder basin filed a lawsuit in federal district court alleging that requiring it to challenge the regulation through the statute scheme violated due process.id.at.
the supreme court rejected thunder basin argument.the court described the mine act detailed structure for reviewing violations of any mandatory health or safety standard,rule,order,or regulation promulgated under the act.id.at quoting a.under the mine act,a mine operator can challenge an adverse agency order before an alj,subject to discretionary review by the federal mine safety and health review commission mshrc.id.at d.a mine operator can petition the mshrc to review the alj decision,or the mshrc can direct a review at its own initiative.see d,a i.if the mine operator remains dissatisfied with the mshrc decision,it can challenge that decision in the appropriate federal court of appeals,which exercises exclusive jurisdiction over such cases.a see also thunder basin,at.
in reviewing the statutory scheme,the court further noted that congress demonstrated its ability to preserve jurisdiction in limited circumstances the mine act expressly authorizes jurisdiction over actions by the secretary of labor to enjoin habitual violations and coerce payment of civil penalties by contrast,m ine operators enjoy no corresponding right but are to complain to the commission and then to the court of appeals.thunder basin,at footnote omitted.based on the comprehensive review process,the court found that congressional intent to preclude jurisdiction over claims was fairly discernible.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that petitioner statutory and constitutional claims even a constitutional claim that challenged the legitimacy of the administrative process itself could be meaningfully addressed in the court of appeals.id.at.
several years later,in free enterprise,the supreme court considered whether a district court could exercise jurisdiction over another challenge an article ii challenge to the public company accounting oversight board pcaob or board despite the exchange act provision found at.at.the board is a private,nonprofit corporation that supervises accounting firms under the sec oversight.under the act of,pub,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,the sec would appoint the pcaob five members,and only some of the board actions required sec approval.free enterprise,at.the statute scheme provided for review of the commission final rules and orders,such as sanctions imposed following administrative adjudication,but offered no path to judicial review for board actions that did not require sec approval.see id.
in free enterprise,the board inspected an accounting firm,released a report critical of its auditing procedures,and began a formal investigation of its practices.id.at.under the statute,none of those regulatory actions would result in a commission rule or order,and so could not trigger a path to judicial review under.see id.at.petitioners sued in federal district court,arguing that the board contravened the separation of powers,because board members enjoyed two layers of removal that impeded presidential supervision of executive power,and the appointments clause,because board members were officers that required presidential appointment and senate advice and consent.id.at.petitioners sought an injunction preventing the board from exercising its powers,and a declaration that it was unconstitutional.id.at.
the free enterprise court held that did not preclude the district court from exercising jurisdiction on the facts presented.id.at.because the board had not undertaken regulatory action that would yield a reviewable commission order or rule,the petitioners would have had to challenge a board rule at random or bet the farm by voluntarily incurring a sanction in order to trigger mechanism for administrative and judicial review.id.at citation omitted.the court concluded that this was not a meaningful avenue of relief.id.at quoting thunder basin,at.the court also noted that the petitioner constitutional challenge was collateral to any commission orders or rules from which review might be sought,and outside the commission competence and expertise because it did not involve technical considerations or inquiries.id.at.therefore,the court held that did not strip the district court of jurisdiction over petitioners claims.
in elgin,the last decision in our trilogy,federal employees failure to comply with a federal statute prompted their discharge from government agencies.elgin dep t of.elgin,one of the employees,appealed his dismissal to the merit systems protection board mspb pursuant to a comprehensive system for resolving personnel decisions involving federal employees established by congress in the civil service reform act of csra.id.at quoting united states fausto.that process requires adjudication first before the mspb,subject to review in the federal circuit,which has exclusive jurisdiction over such appeals.id.at.before the administrative process had concluded,however,elgin joined a suit in federal district court in which petitioners argued that the statutes providing the basis for their discharge were unconstitutional.id.at.
the elgin court held that the csra precluded jurisdiction over petitioners claims.id.at.after reviewing the painstaking detail of the csra provisions for federal employees to obtain judicial review of adverse employment actions,the court concluded that congress evinced a fairly discernible intent to deny covered employees an additional avenue of review in district court.id.at.significantly,the court rejected the argument that it should carve out constitutional claims from the scheme and allow them to proceed in district court,noting that a jurisdictional rule based on the nature of a constitutional claim is hazy at best and incoherent at worst.id.at.
petitioners raised three additional factors to argue that their claims were not the type that congress intended to exclude from the statute scheme,but the court disagreed on each point.id.at.first,the court emphasized that petitioners could receive meaningful review in the federal circuit,an article iii court fully competent to adjudicate their claims.id.at.second,the court reasoned that petitioners constitutional claims were the vehicle by which petitioners sought to reverse the discharge orders,and thus were not wholly collateral to the statutory scheme.id.at.third,even though the mspb could not rule on the constitutionality of the statute,the court noted that its expertise could otherwise be brought to bear on many threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim.id.at quoting thunder basin,at.thus,petitioners could not proceed outside the statutory scheme and had to wait for judicial review in due course.
under thunder basin and its progeny,determining whether congress has impliedly divested jurisdiction over agency action involves a inquiry.first,we ask whether congress intent to preclude jurisdiction is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.thunder basin,at see also elgin,at free enterprise,at.this involves examining the statute text,structure,and purpose.elgin,at.second,we ask whether plaintiffs claims are of the type congress intended to be reviewed within this statutory structure.thunder basin,at accord elgin,at.at this second stage,we consider three factors.we focus on whether the statutory scheme foreclose s all meaningful judicial review.thunder basin,at see also elgin,at free enterprise,at.we also consider the extent to which the plaintiff claims are wholly collateral to the statute review provisions,and whether agency expertise could be brought to bear on the questions presented.thunder basin,at,see also elgin,at free enterprise,at.against this background,we apply the thunder basin framework to the facts before us 
at the first step of our analysis,we readily discern from the text and structure of the exchange act congress intent to channel claims first into an administrative forum and then on appeal to a court of appeals.like the mine act in thunder basin,the exchange act includes a comprehensive scheme that provides for judicial review in the appropriate court of appeals,with substantially the same authority to affirm,modify,enforce,or set aside final agency orders in whole or in part,as well as authority to consider new arguments,reject findings of fact,remand to adduce new evidence,and issue stays.compare,with a.moreover,congress demonstrated it knew how to preserve jurisdiction,but declined to do so like the mine act,the statute here specifically authorizes district courts to exercise jurisdiction over certain actions brought by the agency but not by private parties.taxpayers union,at see also thunder basin,at.compare d,with.our sister circuits have concluded that the provisions in the exchange act are nearly identical,jarkesy,at,and materially indistinguishable,hill sec,cir,from the provisions in the mine act that the thunder basin court found eliminated jurisdiction.we agree.congressional intent to deny collateral challenges is fairly discernible from the text and structure of the exchange act.
bennett advances two main arguments at thunder basin step one,both of which we find unpersuasive 
she first relies on language in free enterprise taken out of context the government reads as an exclusive route to review.but the text does not expressly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.see.nor does it do so implicitly.at.bennett argues that this language is dispositive of the issue before us because she,too,asserts an article ii challenge to the agency authority.
bennett reads too much into the free enterprise court conclusion,which is distinguishable on the facts looking at the statutory text,the court noted that provides only for judicial review of commission action,and not every board action is encapsulated in a final commission order or rule.free enterprise,at.the free enterprise petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the board members appointments before enforcement no board rule directly implicated petitioners challenge,nor had the board issued a sanction against the petitioners.there was thus no reviewable commission action,nor even a guarantee that the board investigation would eventually culminate in reviewable commission action.the court reasoned that,in such circumstances,congress would not have intended petitioners to challenge a board rule at random or incur a sanction in order to trigger judicial review under.the court therefore allowed petitioners claims against the board to proceed outside the statutory scheme.
here,by contrast,bennett necessarily challenges commission action.id.the commission has instituted an administrative disciplinary proceeding against bennett,and she challenges the legitimacy of the alj presiding over that proceeding.unlike an inspection or investigation,a disciplinary proceeding results in a final commission order.see a,d.thus,unlike the petitioners claims in free enterprise,bennett constitutional claims fall within the fairly discernible scope of review procedures because the proceedings will result in a reviewable commission order.hill,at.
bennett second textual argument fares no better.bennett argues the exchange act saving clause,which provides that the rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity,a,shows congress did not intend to make the statutory remedies exclusive,and thus indicates that congressional intent to preclude review of constitutional claims of the type she raises here is not fairly discernible from the text.
bennett cites abbott laboratories garner,a case in which the supreme court found a similar saving clause strongly buttressed its conclusion that the statute had not eliminated jurisdiction over a challenge to a regulation,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders.there,however,the court emphasized that the provision in the statute did not cover the particular claim at issue the statute provided procedures to deal with technical factual determinations,id.at,for certain enumerated kinds of regulations,not encompassing those of the kind involved in the case,id.at footnote omitted.here,by contrast,the provision in encompasses all objections to final agency action,including the constitutional objections bennett raises.see hill,at 
we conclude that congress intent to preclude jurisdiction is fairly discernible from the statutory scheme here.
at the second stage of inquiry,in determining whether bennett claims are of the type congress intended to be reviewed within th e statutory structure,we consider the three thunder basin factors meaningful review,collateral claims,and agency expertise.at.we address each factor in turn 
with respect to meaningful review,bennett contends that consideration of her constitutional challenge will be meaningless under because the violation is exposure to the unconstitutional proceeding,rather than any adverse decision on the merits characterizing her claim as a structural,prophylactic challenge to the constitutionality of the forum itself,she contends that the only appropriate relief is an injunction to halt the allegedly unconstitutional administrative proceeding before it occurs.appellants br.at.
the supreme court has rejected analogous arguments.with respect to the nature of the constitutional challenge,in thunder basin the court recognized that a djudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies,at quoting johnson robison,but that t his rule is not mandatory.id.the thunder basin court evaluating a similar scheme under the mine act found that petitioner constitutional claims could be meaningfully addressed in the court of appeals,even when the petitioner there challenged the constitutionality of the administrative process itself.at moreover,the supreme court has similarly rejected the drawing of jurisdictional lines between agencies and federal courts based on the nature of constitutional claims.see elgin,at noting that the line between facial,and other constitutional challenges to statutes is hazy at best and incoherent at worst.bennett fails to explain why an appointments clause challenge to the alj presiding over her proceeding differs appreciably from the contention in thunder basin that compelling a firm to challenge a regulation through the mine act scheme violates due process.both attack the legitimacy of the forum 
relatedly,bennett argues that an unconstitutional proceeding is,itself,the harm that she should be allowed to avoid.the burden of defending oneself in an unlawful administrative proceeding,however,does not amount to irreparable injury.ftc standard oil of.in standard oil,a company sued in district court to enjoin an ongoing administrative proceeding,arguing that the entire proceeding was unlawful because the agency had initiated it without the evidentiary basis required by statute.id.at.the court concluded that standard oil had to first complete the administrative process before reaching a federal court,and that this scheme provided meaningful judicial review.see id.at.the court emphasized that the expense and annoyance of litigation is part of the social burden of living under government.id.at quoting petroleum,pub.serv.comm n.bennett argues standard oil is inapposite because it did not involve a constitutional claim but that distinction makes no material difference for assessing the meaningfulness of judicial review here,because thunder basin and elgin establish that petitioners can obtain meaningful review of constitutional claims through a statutory scheme similar to the one here.thunder basin,at elgin,at see also hill,at 
furthermore,cases in which the supreme court has concluded that judicial review was not meaningful are distinguishable in critical respects.bennett places principal reliance on free enterprise,where the supreme court held that was not an exclusive route to judicial review on the facts of that case.but unlike the plaintiffs in free enterprise,bennett is already embroiled in an enforcement proceeding.to bring her challenge to the constitutionality of alj appointments before an article iii court,bennett need not bet the farm in fact,she need not take any additional risks.id.at.she has already allegedly committed the actions that violate federal securities laws.
bennett misreads free enterprise when she asserts that the case applies the principle that a litigant who challenges the constitutionality of an agency forum is not required to endure the administrative process and incur a sanctions order before she has access to a court.reply br.at.that is too broad.what animated the court in free enterprise was not that a plaintiff might need to defend against a sanctions order before the agency prior to reaching federal court,but rather that the choice petitioners in that case faced incur penalties for noncompliance or challenge a rule at random made federal judicial review not meaningfully accessible.see at see also thunder basin,at.that concern is not present here,because the sec has instituted disciplinary proceedings against bennett and she can pursue her claims through the administrative scheme 
in short,we conclude bennett can obtain meaningful judicial review of her constitutional claims under by proceeding in the administrative forum and raising her claims in a federal court of appeals in due course.
turning to the second thunder basin factor,the reference point for determining whether a claim is wholly collateral is not free from ambiguity.on the one hand,the supreme court has compared the merits of a constitutional claim to the substance of the charges at issue.see eldridge,at concluding that claim was entirely collateral to the substantive claim of entitlement.on the other hand,the court has considered whether a claim is wholly collateral to the statute review provisions.elgin,at quoting free enterprise,at.under this standard,claims are not wholly collateral when they are the vehicle by which petitioners seek to reverse agency action.id.at.
bennett argues for the first reading her constitutional claim is wholly collateral to the proceeding because it challenges the legality of the forum itself and does not seek to affect the merits of the sec proceeding.appellants br.at.at one level,this makes conceptual sense even if she is successful in challenging the appointment of the commission aljs,the sec could still bring a civil enforcement action in district court on the same substantive charges.
however,we think the second reading is more faithful to the more recent supreme court precedent,even though it reduces the factor independent significance.moreover,we are joined in that interpretation by several of our sister circuits that h
