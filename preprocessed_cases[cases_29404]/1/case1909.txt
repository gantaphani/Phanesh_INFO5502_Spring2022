in an affidavit,salsbury said that she thought she had been denied a promotion and was laid off by sundance due to her sex,and wanted to file a charge of sex discrimination with the eeoc.yet she believed she could not sign the separation agreement because it purported to prohibit the filing of a charge with an agency and would have allowed sundance to sue her for return of the severance payment and for attorneys fees and costs if she signed the agreement and subsequently filed a charge with the eeoc.salsbury called sundance human resources department at its number and asked the representative if she could strike the provision that prohibited her from filing a charge with the eeoc and from suing sundance,and then sign the separation agreement.the representative told her that she could not and that any alterations would be null and void.salsbury replied that it seemed like the agreement required me to give up all my civil rights the representative told her that most terminated employees simply signed the form separation agreement to get their severance payment.salsbury decided not to sign the separation agreement.
on april,salsbury filed a charge with the eeoc.in that charge she alleged that she had been denied promotion and was laid off on the basis of her sex in violation of title vii.she also stated that she had been asked to sign a separation agreement,general release and covenant not to sue agreement in order to get a lump sum payment of hours.i did not sign this release because i believe it violates the laws administered by the eeoc.
the eeoc issued a determination dated september,finding no reasonable cause to believe that salsbury was discriminated against on the basis of sex with respect to the failure to promote or issues,and informing salsbury of her right to sue on the sex discrimination allegations.the determination added,however,that the separation agreement failed to meet the criteria as set forth in f a g of the adea,as amended by the older workers benefit protection act owbpa,for a knowing and voluntary waiver of a right or claim under the adea it stated that the separation agreement violated f c,which requires that an individual not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.moreover,the determination continued,the waiver provision in the separation agreement may produce a chilling effect,thereby undermining the commission ability to enforce the adea,title vii,the epa and the ada.the separation agreement waiver provisions may intimidate or have the effect of intimidating employees and create disincentives for them to cooperate with the eeoc in safeguarding the public interest.
on february,salsbury filed a second charge with the eeoc,alleging that sundance retaliated against her in violation of title vii by failing to rehire her for subsequent speech language positions,as she claimed it had said it would,because she had filed the earlier charge.to this second charge,the eeoc responded on july,that it had been unable to establish a violation of title vii and notifying her of her right to sue.
in her affidavit,salsbury stated that about a year after filing her first charge which she filed on april,an eeoc investigator told her that the separation agreement prohibition against charge filing was unlawful.salsbury then decided to sign the separation agreement in order to obtain the severance payment.however,by the time she signed the separation agreement in march,sundance had gone bankrupt.she states that she has not received the severance pay.in to,slightly over one hundred ohio employees of sundance were laid off in the reduction in force all of those received the offer of severance pay in exchange for signing the separation agreement ten,including salsbury,did not sign the separation agreement at that time and did not receive the severance pay.
on august,the eeoc filed suit against sundance in the district court for the northern district of ohio,alleging violations of the antiretaliation provisions of adea,ada,epa,and title vii.the complaint stated that the eeoc had brought suit to correct actions undertaken by defendant to retaliate against individuals affected by the defendant separation agreement,general release and covenant not to sue,because of their right to file a charge with the eeoc or participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding.
the relief sought by the eeoc included a permanent injunction against sundance to prevent it from instituting or maintaining the separation agreement or any similar plan that retaliates because of an employee right to file a charge with the eeoc or participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding an order requiring sundance to reform the separation agreement expressly to permit employees to file charges with the eeoc and participate in eeoc investigations or proceedings without losing severance pay and without violating the agreement and a corrective notice with a reformed separation agreement sent to salsbury and similarly situated former employees.
on for summary judgment,a magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment in favor of sundance.the district court declined to adopt the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and instead granted summary judgment to the eeoc.eeoc sundance rehabilitation corporation,d.
the district court concluded that the separation agreement conditioning severance pay on a ban on filing charges with the eeoc constituted facial retaliation in violation of ada,adea,epa,and title vii.id.at.applying ohio law to the question of severability,the district court held that with the exception of the ban,the separation agreement remained valid and enforceable.id.at.
in light of its holding that the separation agreement constitutes facial retaliation to the extent that it conditions severance benefits on an employees sic promise not to file a charge with the eeoc,the district court found no need to determine whether the eeoc could show a prima facie case of retaliation in the absence of direct evidence under the mcdonnell douglas sundance argued the eeoc could not do.the district court ordered that sundance and its officers,successors,
are permanently enjoined from engaging in the institution,maintenance management of the portion of the april sundance separation agreement,or any other similar plan,requiring all employees and former employees to waive their right to file a charge with the eeoc or participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding and 
are permanently enjoined from retaliating because of an employee or former employee right to file a charge with the eeoc or participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding and 
f orthwith,shall institute and carry out policies,practices and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for employees who wish to file charges with the eeoc or participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding and 
s hall make whole salsbury and other similarly situated employees and shall reform the april sundance separation agreement to expressly permit all employees and former employees to file charges with the eeoc and participate in eeoc investigations or proceedings without losing their severance pay and without violating the separation agreement and forthwith,shall pay to salsbury and other similarly situated employees any and all withheld severance pay with prejudgment interest and 
s hall deliver a corrective notice with a reformed sundance separation agreement to salsbury and similarly situated employees.moreover,all limitations periods for filing a charge or claim are tolled and will run anew from the date of actual delivery of the reformed notice and 
s hall pay to the eeoc its costs of bringing this action.
on appeal,sundance argues that the antiretalitation provisions of ada,adea,epa,and title vii do not provide for or recognize facially retaliatory conduct by employers that the eeoc had not proved a prima facie case of retaliation under any of the applicable statutes and that the district court abused its discretion in its award of injunctive relief.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard as the court below.united states dairy farmers of america,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the eeoc argues that the separation agreement constitutes a per se violation of the antiretaliation provisions of title vii,epa,ada,and adea.the relevant statutory provisions are as follows 
title vii,a 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.
a it shall be unlawful for any person 
to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding 
no person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this chapter.
it shall be unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by this chapter.
it shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment because such individual has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section,or because such individual has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or litigation under this chapter.
the eeoc asserts that sundance offer of the separation agreement in exchange for severance payments to salsbury and other terminated employees amounts to a violation of the antiretaliation provisions on the ground that the separation agreement is a preemptive strike against future protected activity.the separation agreement conditions severance pay on promises from the terminated employee not to file charges with the eeoc and,according to the eeoc interpretation,not to participate in eeoc proceedings,and then allows sundance to sue for the return of the payments if the former employee engages in such protected activity.the eeoc argues that the separation agreement itself constitutes a per se violation of the antiretaliation provisions.
in support of that argument,the eeoc relies heavily on eeoc bd.of governors of state colls.and,cir,which it points to as the only circuit court opinion to address squarely the legality of what it calls a preemptive retaliatory policy.in that case,a collective bargaining agreement cba gave employees a contractual right to an grievance procedure.id.at.however,a provision of the cba allowed the employer to terminate an internal grievance proceeding if an employee sought resolution of the matter in any other forum,or to refuse to entertain the grievance if the employee pursued the matter in another forum before initiating an internal grievance.an employee filed a grievance with the union.while that grievance was being processed,the employee filed a charge with the eeoc,alleging age discrimination.the employer,implementing the policy embodied in the collective bargaining agreement,terminated the grievance proceeding as a result of the employee filing a charge with the eeoc.id.at.the eeoc brought suit against the employer,alleging violation of the antiretaliation provision of the adea,d.ibid.
in its board of governors opinion,the seventh circuit noted that the cba provision at issue authorized the employer to take an adverse action termination of the grievance proceeding for the sole reason that the employee has engaged in protected activity filing an adea claim.at.it held that the provision violates section d d with respect to adea claimants because it is discriminatory on its face.id.at.in so doing,the seventh circuit rejected the employer argument that it was free to terminate the grievance process since it had no obligation to provide such a process in the first place.in dismissing that argument the seventh circuit looked to the supreme court case hishon king spalding,d,a title vii sex discrimination case.in hishon,the court stated that 
a benefit that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion,even if the employer would be free under the employment contract simply not to provide the benefit at all.those benefits that comprise the incidents of employment,or that form an aspect of the relationship between the employer and employees,may not be afforded in a manner contrary to title vii.
we do not find the seventh circuit board of governors opinion to be compelling precedent with respect to this case.in board of governors,the employer actually took an adverse action against the employee because the employee had pursued the statutorily protected activity of filing a charge with the eeoc.that action clearly constituted retaliation in violation of d.while the seventh circuit addressed what it determined to be the facially retaliatory cba provision that purported to authorize that action,that policy was before the seventh circuit because the employer had implemented it and had engaged in a retaliatory act.here,sundance has offered a contract,and,on the record before us,has engaged in no further action.
courts have held that prohibitions on filing charges with the eeoc are void and unenforceable as against public policy.the seminal case is eeoc cosmair,hair care,cir.in cosmair,the employer terminated terry,an employee,after which it offered severance benefits in exchange for a release of claims.terry signed the release,and subsequently filed a charge with the eeoc alleging age discrimination.cosmair discontinued severance benefits to terry as a result of his having filed the charge.id.at.the fifth circuit found that the employer had retaliated against terry under adea by discontinuing payments to him,and that the release he had signed did not prohibit the filing of charges with the eeoc.id.at.
in response to cosmair argument that the release did in fact bar terry from filing a charge with the eeoc,the fifth circuit held,in the alternative,that a waiver of the right to file a charge is void as against public policy.the fifth circuit stated that t he purpose of a charge is not to seek recovery from the employer but rather to inform the eeoc of possible discrimination.id.at.the court continued 
allowing the filing of charges to be obstructed by enforcing a waiver of the right to file a charge could impede eeoc enforcement of the civil rights laws.the eeoc depends on the filing of charges to notify it of possible discrimination.eeoc shell oil,d a charge not only informs the eeoc of discrimination against the employee who files the charge or on whose behalf it is filed,but also may identify other unlawful company actions.
ibid.the fifth circuit added that while an employee could not waive her right to file a charge with the eeoc,she could waive the right to recover in her own lawsuit,and that the waiver of a right to file a cause of action was not invalid because it was conjoined with a void waiver of the right to file a charge id.at.
this circuit has noted approvingly the fifth circuit rule that a waiver of the right to file a charge with the eeoc is void as against public policy.eeoc frank nursery crafts,cir courts have observed that an individual may not contract away her right to file a charge with the eeoc,as such contracts are void as against public policy.citing cosmair.the first circuit declined to decide whether a ban was void as against public policy in eeoc astra,cir,a title vii case,but in a subsequent case,american airlines,st cir,that circuit cited cosmair for the proposition that an employee could not waive the right to file a charge with the eeoc.
there can be little doubt that the filing of charges and participation by employees in eeoc proceedings are instrumental to the eeoc fulfilling its investigatory and enforcement missions.under title vii and ada,the eeoc can only investigate discrimination upon a charge being filed.see b a eeoc shell oil,d.the eeoc is not so restricted under adea and epa.see a.
a charge filed with the eeoc is not a complaint seeking relief.rather it informs the eeoc of possible employment discrimination.see shell oil,at.a title vii case.under title vii,for example,the filing of a charge allows the eeoc to investigate the alleged discrimination,and thereafter to bring a civil action against employers only if the eeoc does not bring its own suit,and the aggrieved party receives a letter,may the aggrieved party bring a private suit.see eeoc waffle house,d frank nursery crafts,at.
this court has upheld employees waivers of claims under adea,epa,and title vii where the waiver was executed voluntarily and intelligently.see,adams philip morris,cir shaheen,cir under law.the eeoc acknowledged in oral argument,as it does in its enforcement guidance on employee rights under eeoc enforced statutes,eeoc notice,at,that employees can validly waive claims under the employment discrimination laws.whether a waiver of the right to file a charge with the eeoc is enforceable,however,is a different question.given the importance of to the eeoc investigatory and enforcement responsibilities,particularly under title vii and ada,as well as the rule set out in the fifth circuit cosmair,it may be that the ban in the separation agreement at issue here is unenforceable.if so,sundance would be unable to recover if it attempted to sue under the separation agreement after paying severance to a former employee who had signed the agreement and then filed a charge with the eeoc.
but we need not rule on the enforc
