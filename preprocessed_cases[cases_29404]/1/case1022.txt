opinion of the court 
this immigration case requires us to decide,among other things,whether the fifth amendment due process clause guarantees an alien effective assistance of counsel in preparing,filing,and appealing a labor certification application and a visa petition before the start of removal proceedings.we hold that it does not,and thus deny the petition for review.
background 
petitioners margarito contreras and his wife norma,both natives and citizens of mexico,entered the united states unlawfully in and,respectively.since,margarito has been seeking permanent residency in the united states,a green card.this long,complex process requires submitting several applications with supporting documentation to the united states department of labor dol and the united states customs and immigration services uscis of the department of homeland security dhs.see khan att y,cir matter of rajah,bia.
the process involves three essential steps.first,an alien employer files a form eta labor certification application with the dol on the alien behalf.the dol will approve the application only if,among other things,there are not sufficient united states workers able,willing,qualified and available to perform the job.a a i i.
second,if the dol approves the labor certification application,the employer files it along with a form i visa petition with the uscis.a f.among other things,the employer must prove that it can afford to pay the alien the proffered wage from the time it filed the labor certification application until the time the alien obtains lawful permanent residency.g.if the uscis approves the visa petition,then it determines the alien preference classification for a visa and assigns the alien a visa number.visas are subject to numerical restrictions controlled by the state department.g.
third and finally,once a visa is immediately available,the alien applies for a status adjustment by filing a form i status adjustment application.i.if that application is approved,then the alien becomes a lawful permanent resident and the dhs issues the alien a green card.
an individual like margarito,who would not ordinarily qualify for lawful permanent residency because he entered the united states without inspection,may nonetheless apply if,among other things,he is the beneficiary of a labor certification application or a visa petition filed on or before april.see i.
unfortunately,the contrerases former immigration attorney,tahir mella who was not appellate counsel before this court provided incompetent,and at times ethically questionable,representation throughout margarito visa petition process.
in april,mella prepared a labor certification application on behalf of margarito employer,barrels italian foods and restaurant,and filed it with the dol before the april statutory deadline.for reasons unknown,the agency waited more than five years before approving the application in august.mella then filed a visa petition with the uscis in january.ten months after that,in november,the uscis denied the petition because barrels failed to prove that it could afford to pay margarito the proffered wage.the uscis written decision,which it mailed to mella office,indicated that barrels could appeal the visa petition denial but that any appeal must be filed within days.none was ever filed.according to mella,he did not file an appeal because barrels pulled out in december.to the contrary,the owner of barrels claims that she has always been willing to sponsor margarito contreras.
in january,well after the day appeal window had closed,margarito met with mella to discuss his options.mella told him that for he could file a motion to reopen the visa petition.margarito agreed.at some point,however,mella instead decided to file a motion to reconsider.notably,he neglected to mention to margarito that the day time limit to file a motion to reconsider had also passed,see a,but mella accepted the.in march mella finally filed an untimely motion to reconsider the uscis denial of the visa petition with the dhs,almost four months after the uscis denied the petition and two months after margarito paid him the.the outcome of that motion or when it was decided is not evident from the record.
shortly after mella agreed to file a motion to reopen,the dhs began removal proceedings against the contrerases,charging them with being present unlawfully in the united states.see a a i.mella agreed for another to represent them at the removal proceedings.he delegated that representation,however,to others in his office.this delegation was,according to the contrerases,contrary to mella agreement to appear personally in immigration court.
to make matters worse,the attorney mella sent to the first removal hearing might not have been fully aware of the immigration laws,as the immigration judge ij later explained charitably counsel acknowledged the denial of margarito visa petition and suggested that a timely appeal had been filed even though it had not.after further questioning,however,the ij sensed that even if the contrerases had filed an appeal,it might not have been timely.thinking her clients had no other options,counsel informed the ij that her clients would be applying for voluntary departure.the ij thought the contrerases would be shocked and confused if she entered an order for voluntary departure,so she continued the case for a second time to allow counsel to prepare.the ij noted that she would probably not continue the case again unless the dhs agreed or the contrerases could show that a timely appeal of the denied visa petition had been filed.
at the next and final hearing in april,yet another attorney from mella firm represented the contrerases.this new attorney indicated that the sole relief sought was voluntary departure,which the ij granted.one day before their period of voluntary departure expired,the contrerases through their current counsel filed a motion to reopen due to prior ineffective assistance of counsel.the ij denied that motion 
on appeal,the board of immigration appeals bia upheld the ij decision.the contrerases argued that prior counsel was ineffective for filing a labor certification application with the dol despite knowing that margarito employer could not pay the offered wage failing to file a timely motion to reconsider the denied visa petition with the dhs misleading the ij by claiming that an appeal of the denied visa petition had been filed with the dhs and failing to request a continuance rather than voluntary departure so that margarito employer could have filed a new labor certification application and visa petition.the bia concluded that the contrerases failed to show that the hearing before the ij was unfair or that,due to any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the removal proceedings,they were prevented from reasonably presenting their case.emphasis added.the bia further explained that 
the contrerases primary arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel center on margarito pursuit of his application for adjustment of status by way of an visa petition,difficulties over which we have no jurisdiction.the alleged ineffective assistance involved counsel who represented the contrerases before the dhs,counsel who had been retained several years before these administrative proceeding were initiated 
emphasis in original.finally,the bia concluded that the ij factual findings were not clearly erroneous and that she had not erred in concluding that the contrerases did not receive ineffective assistance from their former attorney during the course of the removal proceedings.
the contrerases then filed a timely petition for review.the bia had jurisdiction under b and.we have jurisdiction under.
