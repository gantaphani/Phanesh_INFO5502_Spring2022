christopher dresser was a licensed marine engineer.the united states coast guard initiated a suspension and revocation s r action against dresser license after the coast guard was notified that dresser had tested positive for tetrahyrdocannabinol thc,a metabolite detected in the urine of those who have ingested marijuana.dresser maintains that he tested positive as a result of his ingestion of hemp seed oil as a dietary supplement,not from the use of marijuana.
following hearings in the s r proceeding,administrative law judge alj boggs issued a decision and order finding that dresser had used a dangerous drug,marijuana.the decision also revoked dresser license.dresser appealed the decision to the commandant of the coast guard,who affirmed.dresser then appealed to the national transportation safety board ntsb,pursuant to that agency authority to review coast guard s r decisions the ntsb remanded the case for a new hearing because of the appearance of impropriety on alj boggs part the nature of which is not at issue in this appeal.
chief alj ignolia assigned the remanded case to alj brudzinski,who discussed the case with his docketing clerks,wilson and paladino,who are in the present action.alj brudzinski heard dresser case on remand and ruled in favor of the coast guard,again issuing a decision revoking dresser license.dresser then appealed the second decision to the coast guard commandant and simultaneously brought suit in the district court.
in that first suit,dresser i,dresser contended that alj brudzinski decision revoking his license was unconstitutional.the district court in dresser i concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over dresser request for judicial review of alj brudzinski decision because the pending appeal before the commandant meant the decision was not a final agency action as required by the administrative procedure act apa in addition,the district court held that dresser bivens claims were preempted by the administrative review framework in an unpublished decision,this court affirmed the dismissal of dresser claims arising under the apa because the pending appeal to the commandant meant that the alj decision was not final this court also held that the district court did not have jurisdiction over dresser bivens claims because such claims were inescapably intertwined with a review of the procedure and merits surrounding the decision 
after the district court dresser i order and before this court decision in that case,the coast guard commandant issued a ruling affirming alj brudzinski decision dresser then filed new complaints in the district court,which contained the same allegations of unconstitutional action on the parts of ingolia,wilson,paladino,and the coast guard together,coast guard.dresser also filed a complaint against his union health and welfare benefit plan,meba medical benefits plan,because the plan refused to pay his fees and costs associated with the litigation in federal court.the district court consolidated these cases.dresser and meba medical benefits plan reached a settlement before that consolidation,and that suit was dismissed.
the district court again dismissed dresser complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court agreed with the coast guard contention that,to obtain judicial review,dresser should have appealed the commandant decision to the ntsb and then to a federal circuit court.the district court concluded that dresser apa claims were an attempt to circumvent the channeled path for judicial review.the district court dismissed dresser bivens claims as inescapably intertwined with his apa claims.
dresser argues on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing his apa claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and his bivens claims as inescapably intertwined with his claims regarding the revocation of his license.we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction a district court interpretation of a statute or regulation is a question of law that we review de novo 
dresser contends that the commandant decision to affirm the alj decision revoking his license was a final agency decision,reviewable under the apa dresser argues that there is no statutorily specified means of obtaining judicial review of the coast guard final decision therefore,the apa general provision that final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court is subject to judicial review applies,giving the federal district court jurisdiction over his claims the coast guard contends that statutes and regulations pertaining to the coast guard and ntsb provide for an exclusive path of review,which may not be replaced by district court review of the commandant decision.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the coast guard and ntsb statutory and regulatory scheme provide for judicial review,but only in a court of appeals,and only after an appeal to the ntsb.dresser argument does not take into account all of the language of apa c and ignores the statutory provision for judicial review that precludes the apa default rule of review in a federal district court.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of dresser complaint.
to determine whether the apa default rule of review is applicable,we look to the statutes and rules the coast guard,under the authority of the secretary of the department of homeland security department has authority to conduct s r proceedings for mariner licenses s r proceedings are formal adjudicative proceedings governed by the apa and conducted by an alj unless the alj decision is appealed,the alj decision becomes final action of the coast guard days after the date of its issuance.an individual may appeal the suspension or revocation of his license to the secretary of the department within thirty days of the suspension or revocation the regulations implementing this statute provide that a ny party may appeal the alj decision by filing a notice of appeal days or less after issuance of the decision.the coast guard commandant reviews the alj decision to determine whether the alj committed error in the proceedings,and whether the commandant should affirm,modify,or reverse the alj decision or should remand the case for further proceedings.the commandant decision in such an appeal constitutes final action of the coast guard on the date of its issuance.
the ntsb statutes and regulations provide for review of the coast guard decision.section of title requires that the ntsb shall review on appeal a decision of the head of the department in which the coast guard is operating on an appeal from an s r decision.the implementing regulations govern all proceedings before the ntsb on appeals taken from decisions of the commandant of the coast guard sustaining orders of an administrative law judge revoking,suspending,or denying a license.the regulations further provide that a party appealing the commandant decision must file a notice of appeal with the ntsb within days after service of the commandant decision upon the party or his designated attorney.that period may be extended for good cause shown.the appellant brief is then due to the ntsb within days after the filing of the notice of appeal the final level of review provided in this statutory and regulatory scheme is by the appropriate court of appeals of the united states,which may review a final order of the ntsb made under chapter 
dresser argues that his appeal of the commandant decision to the ntsb is optional.accordingly,he contends that the supreme court decision in darby cisneros prevents the district court from requiring him to pursue that appeal.he reasons that the district court should have exercised jurisdiction over his complaint under the default review provision of the apa.in darby,the court held that apa c explicitly requires exhaustion of all appeals mandated either by statute or agency rule it would therefore be inconsistent,the court concluded,for courts to require litigants to exhaust optional appeals as well the court holding in darby does not support dresser position.
first,the coast of appeals path of review is not analogous to the statutory and regulatory scheme at
