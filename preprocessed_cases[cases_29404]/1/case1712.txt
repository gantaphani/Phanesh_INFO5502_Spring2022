the louisiana environmental action network lean petitions for review of several final rules by the environmental protection agency epa,pursuant to the clean air act caa or the act,et,approving revisions to the state implementation plans for ozone in the baton rouge,louisiana area.previously,in sierra club epa,cir,we held that epa allowance of an attainment deadline extension for a nonattainment area subverts the plain meaning of the caa.
arising out of the shadows of our ruling in sierra club,lean presently asserts that the epa erroneously approved louisiana revised state implementation plan,as consistent with the caa,based on criteria relevant only under the now defunct extension policy.lean therefore challenges,as arbitrary and capricious,the epa decision to approve louisiana revised state implementation plan attainment demonstration and louisiana trading provision.lean presents a separate challenge to the epa approval of louisiana substitute contingency measure consisting of emission reductions occurring outside the baton rouge area.for the following reasons,we deny the petition in part,and grant it in part,and remand to the epa for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
regulatory background 
the caa,first enacted in and extensively revised in and,establishes a complex and comprehensive regulatory system to reduce air pollution nationwide,et.under title i of the act,the epa is charged with identifying air pollutants that endanger the public health and welfare.id.the act also requires the epa to formulate national ambient air quality standards naaqs,specifying the maximum permissible air concentration of six pollutants,including a standard of parts per million for ozone pollution.see pt.a 
in,congress responded to the problem of widespread nonattainment of the ozone naaqs by adding subpart,which had the purpose of imposing carefully designed restrictions on epa discretion.whitman american trucking ass ns,d.the amendments to the act created a classification system designating areas of the country as attainment or nonattainment,based on whether or not areas were in compliance with the permissible naaqs for ozone.d.if an area fails to meet the naaqs standards,then the epa designates the area as one of nonattainment.id.nonattainment areas are further classified according to the severity of the ozone problem as marginal,moderate,serious,severe,or extreme.id.a.
the amendments also specified certain measures each nonattainment area was required to take and limited the number of years each area had to achieve compliance,ranging from to,depending on an area classification.id.a.under the caa,the following time line was established for the naaqs to be achieved november,for marginal areas november,for moderate areas november,for serious areas november,for severe areas november,for areas and november,for extreme areas.id.in accord with this time line,if the epa determines that a marginal,moderate,serious,or severe area does not attain the pertinent standard,the epa is required,by operation of law,to reclassify the area to the next higher classification.id.b.the area attainment date is then extended and the area is simultaneously subjected to the additional regulations applicable to the higher classification.id.
congress further required a permit program,designated the new source review nsr,as a component of the caa.id.a,c.under the nsr,congress required that major sources of air pollution,having the potential to emit pollutants above certain thresholds,obtain permits prior to construction or modification of the source and comply with certain requirements.id.for nsr in nonattainment areas,these requirements include complying with the lowest achievable emission rate laer and obtaining sufficient emission reductions from existing sources to offset the source increased emissions.id.c.
the caa also established a partnership,recognizing that prevention and control of air pollution at its source is the primary responsibility of states and local governments,and delegated to the states primary responsibility for implementing the naaqs standards.id.in accord with this partnership,each state failing to comply with naaqs,for any air pollutant,is required to submit a plan,known as a state implementation plan sip,specifying emission limitations applicable to pollution sources and taking additional steps to attain the relevant naaqs.id.a.sips must be designed to bring a state into compliance and also must prohibit emissions that contribute significantly to nonattainment in,or interfere with maintenance by,any other state.id.a d i i.
in areas of ozone nonattainment,a state must submit,as expeditiously as practicable,sip revisions to the epa in order to attain naaqs compliance.id.a.the revised sip submission must provide an attainment demonstration to show that the area will achieve the naaqs by the area applicable statutory deadline,id.c a,and an implementation plan for any reasonably available control measures racm that will advance the attainment date.id.c.for areas classified as serious or severe,the states must also submit reasonable further progress rate of progress sips demonstrating an average reduction of baseline emissions of per year.id.c b.additionally,nonattainment area sips must provide for the implementation of specific contingency measures to be undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further progress,or to attain the naaqs by the applicable attainment deadline.id.c.
the sips,and any revisions to the sips,must be adopted by the state after reasonable notice and public hearing.id.a.the epa must then review each submitted plan.id.k.if the plan is approved,in whole or in part,the approved provisions become federally enforceable.id.if the plan is not approved,or is determined to be incomplete,the state may be subject to sanctions and eventually federally imposed clean air measures.id.c.
present facts 
the epa first designated the baton rouge area,which encompasses five parishes,as an ozone nonattainment area in,march.in,the epa the baton rouge area as a serious ozone attainment area in accordance with the caa amendments,with a statutory attainment deadline of november.the baton rouge area is subject to ozone pollution from upwind sources outside the state of louisiana,which have contributed to the failure of the baton rouge area to attain the ozone naaqs,to be codified at pts.and.to this day,the baton rouge area has failed to attain the ozone naaqs.
on november,lean brought a citizen suit against the administrator for failure to perform a nondiscretionary act or duty.a.following the passing of the november,deadline,lean sought to ensure that the agency issue a determination as to whether the baton rouge area failure to meet the statutory deadline for attaining the ozone standard required a reclassification to the next higher classification.on march,the district court entered a judgment ordering epa to issue a determination by june,as to whether the baton rouge area had attained the applicable ozone standard.see,april.
on june,the epa determined that the baton rouge area did not attain the ozone naaqs by the november,deadline for serious ozone areas,june.in a separate rulemaking,the epa withdrew its determination,based on its ozone extension policy,and extended the attainment date for the baton rouge area to november,while retaining baton rouge status as a serious ozone area.id.
on december,in an action concerning the arthur,texas ozone nonattainment area,this court rejected the epa ozone extension policy as inconsistent with the caa.see sierra club,at.the epa then requested a voluntary remand of its extension policy to the baton rouge area,and this court granted the remand.lean epa,order at.the epa vacated its extension of the attainment date for the baton rouge area and reinstated its june,rule making action bumping the baton rouge area,by operation of law,to severe status.at.
simultaneous to the epa issuing its final rule extending the attainment date for the baton rouge area,the epa also approved the state attainment demonstration sip for the baton rouge area.at.in a separate rule making,the epa approved revisions to louisiana nsr procedures which,inter alia,included a process known as trading,to be codified at pt.under trading,regulated companies are allowed to trade an increase in volatile organic compounds voc emissions to be offset by a decrease in nitrogen oxides nox emissions.id.in yet another separate rule making,the epa approved louisiana substitute contingency measures,to be codified at pt.the original contingency measures plan consisted of tons per day of voc emissions reductions on deposit in the state emission reduction credit bank,may.following our decision in sierra club,the epa approved a substitute contingency measures plan requiring that the trunkline gas compressor station trunkline facility in saint mary parish permanently reduce its voc emissions by tons per day from the emission levels.id.the trunkline facility installed a flare,in,to dispose of volatile flash gases from several storage containers in order to comply with louisiana waste gas disposal rule and comprehensive toxic air pollutant control program.at.because the tons per day reduction from the trunkline facility is greater than the tons per day in the prior contingency measure,epa found that this sip revision will result in lower emissions and comply with the act.id.lean challenges the epa three aforementioned final rules.
discussion 
the issue presented at the outset is whether we properly have jurisdiction to reach the merits of lean challenges to the epa approval of the attainment demonstration sip and the nsr trading provision.
it is,that mootness is a threshold jurisdictional inquiry.see deakins monaghan,d article iii of the constitution limits federal courts to the adjudication of actual,ongoing controversies between litigants.in general,a claim becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.murphy hunt,d per curiam see piggly wiggly clarksville baird bakeries,cir.if a dispute has been resolved,or if it has evanesced because of changed circumstances,it is considered moot.american medical bowen,cir.this court has long been careful to note an exception to the general principle of mootness in instances where some issues of a case have become moot but the case as a whole remains alive because other issues have not become moot.itt rayonier,united states,cir.unit b see also aulenback,fha.
there can be no doubt that lean request for relief concerning the attainment demonstration sip and the interprecursor trading provisions are moot.the epa recognized that due to the baton rouge area reclassification from a serious to a presently severe nonattainment area,the attainment demonstration sip had to be revised in the aftermath of our sierra club decision.the agency approval of the trading provision was also based in part on the epa finding that an approvable attainment demonstration existed for the baton rouge area.epa hence requested,and we granted,a voluntary vacatur of the agency final rules approving the baton rouge attainment demonstration sip and the corollary trading provision.because there is no longer any possibility that lean can obtain relief for either claim,we dismiss those claims as moot,and hence resolve only the issues remaining alive.
ii.substitute contingency measures 
lean sole remaining claim is that the epa erroneously approved a substitute contingency measure,contained in louisiana revised sip,which the state initiated in response to our remand in sierra club.the substitute contingency measure consists of a tons per day voc emissions reductions from the trunkline facility in mary parish.lean argues that the epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously by approving an illegal substitute contingency measure that will not promote attainment.because the contingency measure is prohibited,lean asks that we vacate revisions of the base year emissions inventory and the epa rescission of the prior contingency measure in favor of the substitute.
we review the epa interpretation of the caa under the standards set forth in chevron,natural res.def.council,d see also sierra club fish and wildlife,cir.the first step of the chevron inquiry requires us to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then we must give effect to its unambiguously expressed intent.id.at.reversal is warranted only where an agency interpretation is contrary to clear congressional intent.id.at.
step two of chevron applies when the statute is either silent or ambiguous.under these circumstances,the court determines whether the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.deference is warranted where the agency construction is permissible.id.at.consistent with of the administrative procedure act apa,we reverse only where the agency construction of the statute is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also city of abilene united states epa,cir.
we recognize that under this deferential standard,a court reviewing an agency action may not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.city of abilene,at.while our deference to the agency expertise is significant,we may not defer to an agency decision that is without substantial basis in fact.fed.power comm florida power light,d.our court will find an agency action arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.texas oil gas ass epa,cir citing motor vehicle mfrs.state farm,d.we therefore limit the scope of our inquiry to determining if the agency judgment conforms to minimum standards of the agency action bears a rational relationship to the statutory purposes and is there substantial evidence in the record to support it.id.
lean posits that the epa approval of the substitute contingency measure is unlawful for three reasons historical reductions in emissions can not qualify as a contingency measure emissions reductions already required by law can not qualify as a contingency measure and reductions outside the baton rouge nonattainment area,without a finding that such reductions improve air quality within the baton rouge area,can not qualify as a contingency measure.we address each argument in turn.
early activated continuing reductions 
lean argues that the epa should not have approved this contingency measure because the reduction is not prospective in nature.lean challenge focuses on the agency approval of an emissions reduction at the trunkline facility which occurred in one year prior to the baton rouge area missing its attainment deadline.the epa counters by asserting that its approval of the contingency measure is a reasonable interpretation of the caa because reductions from the trunkline facility are continuing in nature.we find the epa argument more persuasive.
section c and c of the act direct that a state revised sip shall include contingency measures to take effect in any such case without further action by the state or the administrator if an area fails to attain the naaqs standard by the applicable date or comply with a rate of progress plan deadline.c emphasis added the plan revisions shall provide for the implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area fails to meet any applicable milestone emphasis added.based on general preamble guidance,the epa interpreted the control measure requirements of c and c to intend that a lthough the emissions reductions from the trunkline facility first occurred in,the reductions are continuing on an annual basis and are surplus,permanent and federally enforceable.at citing,april,epa general preamble.
the act,on its face,creates an ambiguity as to the meaning of the terms to take effect and to be undertaken.on one hand,a plain reading of the terms to take effect and to be undertaken imply a prospective,forward lo
