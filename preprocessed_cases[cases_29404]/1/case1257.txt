opinion of the court 
this is a petition for review of an order and opinion of the benefits review board the board which reversed the finding of the administrative law judge alj that respondent,southern stevedores,ssi is the employer responsible for the benefits awarded to claimant james loftus for his back injuries.we conclude that the findings of the alj were not supported by substantial evidence and will deny the petition for review.
i.the facts 
loftus had worked as a longshoreman since.although he suffered several workplace injuries before he commenced working for ssi in,none affected his back.at ssi loftus worked as a trailer mechanic and inspected,repaired and overhauled gensets.gensets were generators that were mounted under the bellies of trailer chassis.loftus described trailer maintenance and repair as follows 
well,if the landing gear gets broken off,you got to cut it off and put a new set on,reweld it and everything.if an air valve broke,you got to take it off,unhook all the hoses under the trailer to get a new get the valve off and replace a new valve and put the hoses back under the trailer.you also pull the big black tires,two at a time,to do a brake job.and the springs that hold those brakes on are very lightly stretched.
a substantial part of loftus work consisted of repairing and maintaining gensets.although management expected that it would take seven and one half hours to repair a genset,loftus and his teammate developed the ability to accomplish the task in four hours or less.he described his work on the genset 
q.how did you have to either repair or maintain a genset at southern in the period between january to september of 
well,we had to sit on a stool,your honor,it a little mechanic stool 
what a mechanic stool 
and it measures exactly one foot off the floor.it a little stool with four wheels on it and you could roll around.now where the genset was mounted on the trailer is very low.i already down a foot off the floor and i have to stick my head in that hole to get to that engine and do what i had to do.and i would be bent over constantly one foot from the floor.
q.how many men do this job 
basically,it was me and kevin doyle.
q.when you doing this,my point,do you get two men working on the same genset 
well,i would be on this side.i would take the side where the starter and the alternator and everything was and this would be the trailer.and kevin doyle would be on that side where he would drain the oil and change the oil filters and work on the control panel,which was up a little higher than the side that i worked on.
after performing this work for a number of months loftus began to have trouble with his lower back.in september he went to his family doctor who prescribed pain relieving drugs and,because it was a work related problem,advised him to seek medical care through his employer.ssi referred loftus to michael mandarino,who examined loftus on or about october.mandarino reported that loftus complained of discomfort up and down the spine and across the low back but denied arm or leg radiation of discomfort.he concluded that the complaints were consistent with a sprain and strain and advised loftus to exercise,swim as much as possible during an approaching florida vacation,to continue taking his oral medication and to return for reevaluation in two weeks.
on december and loftus returned to mandarino for tests and reevaluation.loftus had had a ct scan,a bone scan and mri scan,all of which were normal.on december mandarino noted that on examination today the patient has full motion of the lumbar spine.straight leg raise is negative.no neurological deficit are noted at this time nor has there ever been any neurologic deficit.it has been explained to loftus that all of the diagnostic studies are normal.he feels that he is capable of returning to work.app.at.
mandarino stated that loftus could return to work full duty without restriction the following.loftus did in fact return to work,and ssi made substantial adjustments in its work practices to relieve the pressures on loftus back.as loftus described it 
well,the trailer came up higher off the floor and everything.and then the trailer came up,the genset came up,everything was up high.we bought a hydraulic jack,we put it in the back.we raised the back.and they had two big chocks that we would put under the landing gear.and everything came from this high on the floor to where,you know,where you could sit and work in there.you did have to stick your head in,you know,you were bent over like this anymore.
q.did you still have to use that one footstool 
no,they had chairs just as high as this here.you could raise the chair and lower the chair.it had a back on it.
loftus returned to mandarino on april,reporting that since the december visit the job itself and the overall conditions of his job have been improved tremendously but that over the last few weeks there has been a gradual recurrence of discomfort in the spine.app.at.on examination of the lumbar spine mandarino found discomfort on motion.straight leg raising was negative.no neurological deficits were noted in the lower extremities.loftus was started on and advised to return in three days for reevaluation.
loftus returned to mandarino for reevaluation on april and may.mandarino found that none of the tests nor his examination would explain loftus disabling pain.after explaining this to loftus,mandarino cleared him orthopedically to return to full duty without restriction.mandarino advised him to have a physical with his family doctor to see if there were any nonwork related etiology for his discomfort and discharged him from his care.
on may,loftus went to gad guttman,senior orthopedic surgeon at the department of orthopedic surgery at albert einstein medical center,for a second opinion.guttman reviewed mandarino records reflecting the absence of radiculopathy,loftus return to work on december,the recurrence of back pain in april,and mandarino conclusion that from an orthopedic standpoint loftus was cleared to return to full duty.guttman also reviewed the december,report of the radiologist reflecting loftus return to work on december,the recurrence of back pain in april and mandarino conclusion that from an orthopedic standpoint loftus was cleared to return to full duty.guttman also reviewed the december,report of the radiologist reflecting that an mri showed mild degenerative changes of discs and and mild bulging without disc herniation or foraminal stenosis.these findings,guttman stated,were confirmed by the december cat scan and bone scan,all of which were consistent with the findings of degenerative changes of the lumbar spine which one would expect in a patient in this type of work,with this habitus and weight and so on.at.
guttman took loftus history and performed a physical examination.during his testimony guttman was asked whether he had an opinion as to whether loftus complaints emanating from october of had closed when he saw him in may of.guttman responded 
i felt that at the time that i examined him the patient complaints were related more to his overweight,to his overexertion and to the underlying degenerative changes.he kept working all the time and it was not unusual to have pain coming and going after such heavy work and he was in pretty bad overall condition anyway.when i saw him he was overweight and he had degenerative changes.
so as far as the specific question,in i believe his symptoms started acutely.then they resolved in december of i believe according to mandarino report.he returned back to work.then he kept on working and after four months or so he started having pain again.i called it overexertion and deconditioning and underlying degenerative changes.
because his back was hurting loftus had taken time off from his work from april to may.he saw guttman on may and took time off from work from may to may.on or about may he returned to work full time.his back still caused him discomfort and to relieve the pain he commenced seeing a chiropractor,izzo on july,continuing with him until september,when his insurance coverage expired.izzo provided relief through ultrasound,a tens device,heat packs and stretching.
at the end of august petitioner,delaware river stevedores,drs acquired ssi interest in the facility at which loftus worked.drs acquired ssi equipment including the special equipment that had been designed for loftus to relieve his back problems.operations at the facility continued as before and the nature of loftus work did not change after august of.
in the four month period january through april loftus worked an extraordinary number of overtime hours,ranging on many days from ten to eleven hours and on others from seventeen to eighteen hours.on one day he worked hours.the demands placed upon the stevedoring company to move incoming cargoes of fruit was the reason for drs heavy time demands imposed on its mechanics.
by april loftus back was again causing him serious pain.he was referred to roy lefkoe.the referral letter from branch manager,presumably of drs claims adjuster,neil davis stated we are particularly interested in having you take a complete history from the claimant,to determine whether or not his recent complaints are the result of a new injury with his present employer,delaware river stevedores,or if they are attributable to the old accident of september,
lefkoe saw loftus for an orthopedic consultation on may.he reviewed loftus medical records and took a history from loftus,who reported that i n his pain worsened without additional injury app.at.loftus reported pain radiating into both legs.
lefkoe conducted a physical examination.his diagnosis was acute and chronic lumbosocral and lumbar degenerative disc disease at and with bulging discs.he found loftus to be in acute pain and unable to continue working.he prescribed medication and physical therapy to include aquatherapy,modalities and exercise.as to the question davis addressed to him,he stated,based on all information available to me,the cause of his present back condition still is the original work injury of.app at.
loftus did not return to work rather he continued seeing lefkoe and proceeded with physical therapy.lefkoe received a july,report of neurologist steven mandel,who stated,this gentleman appears to have complaints consistent with a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy.there is evidence of chronic changes and the and distribution without evidence of any significant acute changes noted.there are only mild changes noted in his right lumbar paraspinal muscles at the and area.app.at.lefkoe prescribed medication and referred loftus to sandra kahn for injections.none of this provided relief,and loftus was referred to rosen in november.rosen administered a series of six epidural injections which had a beneficial effect.loftus testified that rosen treatment brought me back to the extent that i never knew anything was wrong with me.it was so good.app.at.
loftus was able to return to work with drs in january with restrictions.he was not called upon to go underneath the trailers.he usually wore a tens unit and occasionally took pills to relieve pain.he worked only eight hour shifts and performed no overtime.
guttman,who had reported on loftus condition after his work cessation in april saw him again in june of,about five weeks after he had ceased work because of increased pain and after loftus had come under the care of lefkoe.he saw him again in august.guttman testified that loftus was in greater pain than when he had seen him the previous year.guttman was referred to the records showing loftus longer hours during the months preceding may of.he testified 
basically they showed that he did quite a lot of overwork and in those months,i believe january through april,he did extremely heavy work,what i call overwork,and that in itself i believe can explain why he had this onset of pain after he was already working there,but during those four months he really worked extremely heavy and i believe that that could explain his pain when i saw him again which was a little bit worse in intensity than the one that he had before.
guttman was directed to assume that loftus worked unusually long hours in january,february,march and april and was asked if he had an opinion as to the cause of loftus back pain in april and may of through the time he saw him in august.guttman responded 
well,the information you give me i was also privy to review before.it just amplifies my impression that there was an exertion of work.he worked much more than the normal person would work in a day session,almost twice as much sometimes,and that was certainly very stressful for his back.so the symptoms that he reported to me and came to me was of being similar were much worse and intense when i saw him in june of than compared to the ones that i saw him in april of at which time he had hardly any symptoms and,in fact,i felt he could go back to work without problems.i did feel so when i saw him in and explanation for that,he over exerted himself.he stressed his back at work over time and that was the cause of his problems and it was ongoing.
as recited above,after guttman august examination loftus continued medical treatment and physical therapy and was able to return to work on a restricted basis in january.
ii.administrative proceedings 
in august the alj heard loftus claim for workers compensation benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,as amended,et the act.the parties to the proceeding were the claimant,loftus the earlier employer,ssi and the subsequent employer,of the four issues before the alj,only one is the subject of the present appeal,w hich of the named employers is responsible for any compensation benefits awarded.
ssi asserted that loftus suffered no work related disability as a result of work loftus performed for it but that loftus suffered a naturally occurring degenerative spinal condition to the september manifestation of low back pain therefrom.alternatively ssi asserted that if loftus was rendered disabled by work related causes,such disability arose as the result of a separate and discrete event of work overexertion while in the employ of drs between january and april,thus placing liability for compensation benefits upon drs as of the may,manifestation of low back pain and thereafter.
drs adopted ssi first contention and alternatively urged that if loftus were disabled from work activity,it was his work activity at ssi,first manifested by pain in september which exclusively placed liability for compensation benefits solely upon ssi.
the alj rejected ssi and drs first argument and concluded that loftus was entitled to compensation for total temporary disability for the periods sought.as between ssi and drs he found that ssi was the employer responsible for all benefits awarded,stating 
i find that the record evidence establishes that southern is the employer responsible for benefits awarded herein.first,there is no evidence that claimant suffered from a severe back injury or impairment or from back pain prohibiting his work prior to the september,manifestation of low back pain see tr.second,claimant back problems and same complaints of back pain persisted throughout the time period subsequent to september,up to the present tr.and claimant promptly reported this back pain to his foreman at that time tr.finally,the more probative medical and lay evidence otherwise establishes that southern is the employer responsible for benefits.
in half a page the alj marshaled the evidence he believed supported his conclusion.he rejected ssi contention that but for the four month period of intensive work loftus would not have been disabled after late april on the ground that but for the initial september,manifestation of back symptoms,claimant would not have suspended his work activities after the,symptom.app.at.
the alj attached the greatest weight to lefkoe may,opinion that loftus back condition in was caused by the original work injury of september.the alj further stated that lefkoe deposition testimony repeats this conclusion even more firmly.id.
the alj acknowledged that the episode of extra heavy work exertion while claimant was employed at drs in january through april may well have furthered his low back pain,but he went on to state that the initial precipi
