in connection with an administrative hearing before the national labor relations board nlrb or board on charges of unfair labor practices against interbake foods,llc,the board issued a subpoena duces tecum to interbake,requiring it to appear,to testify,and to produce a broad array of documents at the hearing.interbake produced some documents and asserted and attorney privileges as to others.following the nlrb general counsel challenge to three of the allegedly privileged documents,the administrative law judge alj issued an order requiring interbake to produce the documents for in camera review.when interbake refused,the board filed this application under of the national labor relations act nlra or the act,for enforcement of the subpoena,requesting that the district court order interbake to produce the three documents to the alj for in camera review so that the alj could fully consider interbake claims of privilege with respect to the three documents.
the district court denied the board application by order dated september.it concluded first that only an article iii court may determine whether subpoenaed documents are protected by the or attorney privileges.as a result,the alj order requiring interbake to hand over certain privileged documents for in camera review by him was improper.nlrb interbake foods,llc,no.rdb,wl,at.it then concluded as to the three documents in question that it need not conduct an in camera inspection because interbake ha d met its burden of establishing that the documents were privileged under federal rule of civil procedure a a,and the nlrb ha d not articulated a good faith basis for doubting interbake claim of privilege.id.at.
in this appeal from the district court order,the board contends that congress authorized aljs,in the first instance,to evaluate privilege objections to subpoenaed in camera review if that judicial review of an alj determination is available only after objections are considered and denied by the board.the board also contends that the district court abused its discretion in declining to conduct an in camera review of the three documents in question.
we agree in large part with the board position that congress conferred authority on the on aljs as its delegatees conducting administrative hearings on behalf of the receive and evaluate evidence under the federal rules of evidence and to rule on claims of privilege made with respect to that evidence.but we also hold that an alj order imposed in the course of an administrative hearing,even when ruling on evidence,can only be enforced by an article iii court.when refusal to comply with a subpoena and the board order to produce documents is based on the or privilege,the board recourse is to apply to the district court for an order enforcing the subpoena.in deciding whether to enforce the subpoena,the court must then assess the legitimacy of the claimed privilege.thus,while we do not preclude any administrative assessment of claims of privilege,we do conclude that when an assessment of those claims is necessary to a court determination of whether to enforce the subpoena,the assessment must be conducted by the court.
on the question of whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to conduct an in camera inspection of the three documents,we affirm in part and remand in part,directing the court to review the privilege claim as to the string attached to two that the court found privileged.
during the course of two unsuccessful organizing campaigns by the bakery,confectionery,tobacco workers and grain millers international union,local the union at interbake facility in front royal,virginia,the union filed unfair labor practice charges against interbake,and the nlrb issued various complaints against interbake on those charges.at the hearing on those complaints before the nlrb,conducted by alj john clark,an interbake employee,missy jones,revealed that during the campaigns,she had secretly recorded conversations with interbake colleagues and supervisors.following an investigation into the matter,conducted by interbake human resources manager,jill slaughter,fired jones for violating company policy in smuggling the recorder into interbake facility in violation of interbake electronic device policy,violating company policy by admittedly recording line team meetings,and violating interbake work conduct provisions by the manner in which she handled the recordings.the union promptly filed an additional unfair labor practice charge,alleging that jones firing was motivated by a desire to punish jones for her union activities and for testifying against interbake,and the board issued another complaint on that charge.that complaint was also assigned to alj clark,who consolidated the hearing on that complaint with the hearing on the earlier filed complaints.
at the request of the nlrb general counsel,the board issued a subpoena to jill slaughter to appear before judge clark,to testify at the hearing,and to bring with her a broad array of documents.in the designation of documents,the subpoena demanded that,with respect to any document withheld from production on a claim of privilege,slaughter describe the document author,recipient,date,and subject matter.in response to the subpoena,interbake produced approximately pages of documents and withheld about documents or groups of documents,asserting that they were protected by the or privilege.as requested by the board,interbake provided a privilege log setting forth the information requested about each document withheld.see also.a a.at the same time,interbake also filed a petition to revoke the subpoena as to the privileged documents,pursuant to of the nlra.
at the hearing,slaughter testified that the earliest she had communicated with anyone regarding missy jones termination was february.this testimony,however,conflicted with interbake privilege log,which listed two authored by slaughter on february,regarding the missy jones investigation bates nos.and.based on the inconsistency in dates,the general counsel requested that alj clark conduct an in camera inspection of those documents to determine whether they were in fact privileged.the general counsel also sought an in camera inspection of handwritten notes of a telephone conversation taken by angie otto,a,regarding the jones investigation bates no.following the arguments of counsel and the alj review of the board decision in cnn america,the judge concluded that the only proper exercise of his discretion would be to take a look at the three documents in camera.he said,i feel i have to do it,i bound to do it,and so i ca argue against the board because i have to follow what i think is their direction,and i do.so i have to order you to give me the three documents from the privilege log.after interbake stated that it was not prepared to comply with the order,the board filed this application for enforcement of the subpoena and the alj order for in camera review.
in its application,the board sought specifically an order from the district court directing interbake to comply with judge clark lawful order that it produce documents ibf,ibf,and ibf responsive to the board administrative subpoena duces tecum at such time and place as judge clark may designate for an in camera inspection so that judge clark may fully consider interbake claims of privilege with respect to those documents.following a hearing,the district court denied the application by order dated september,and this appeal followed.
the board contends that the district court erred in refusing to issue an order directing interbake to produce the three subpoenaed documents to alj clark for in camera review.this review,the board argues,would enable the alj,in the first instance,to determine whether the documents are protected by a privilege.in refusing to issue the order,the district court held that only an article iii court may determine whether subpoenaed documents are protected by the or attorney privileges.interbake foods,wl,at.this impasse between the board and the district court raises the ultimate question about the division of power between the nlrb and article iii courts.the nlrb asserts that the answer will not only be important to the narrow focus of this case but will also have consequences that might apply to any executive or independent regulatory agency or department that relies on federal courts for the enforcement of its administrative subpoenas.
with its enactment of the nlra,congress created the board and empowered it to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce.a.and to that end,congress authorized the board to file complaints charging violators with unfair labor practices and to conduct hearings on those charges.id.b.traditionally,such hearings are conducted before aljs as delegatees of the board,who are subject to board review.see b.the act provides that the hearings shall,so far as practicable,be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts.b.following a hearing,the board is empowered to issue cease and desist orders,orders reinstating employees,and orders requiring reports.such orders are subject to judicial review and enforcement.id.e,f.
to implement this charter,the board is given investigatory power with the authority to conduct hearings,subpoena testimony and evidence,administer oaths,examine witnesses,and receive evidence,all of which are generally carried out in the first instance by aljs.
specifically,as relevant here,of the nlra,states that t he board,or any member thereof,shall upon application of any party to an nlrb proceeding,forthwith issue to such party subpenas requiring the production of any evidence in such proceeding or investigation requested in such application.the board is also authorized,upon the motion of a party,to revoke the subpoena,in whole or in part,if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation,or any matter in question in such proceedings,or if in its opinion such subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required.id.the bases for revocation stated in are not,however,exclusive.see nlrb interstate builders,cir drukker commc ns,nlrb.even when a subpoena targets relevant and material,it may nonetheless be revoked if it is invalid for any other reason sufficient in law.b.in keeping with the federal rules of civil procedure,when practicable to do so,see b nlrb consol.bus transit,cir,the board has relied on rules and in determining which other reason s are sufficient to revoke or quash a subpoena,see brinks,see also eeoc.cup,cir noting the relationship between and rule.these reasons include not only those that are immediately apparent on a subpoena face but also those that can be determined through reference to authority,for instance the evidentiary rules of privilege.see.c a iii.
but when all is said,the nlra carefully recognizes the appropriate divide between the administrative authority to conduct hearings and issue orders and the exclusively judicial power of article iii judges to enforce such orders.the line of division tracks supreme court observations in interstate commerce comm brimson,abrogated on other grounds by bloom illinois,where the court stated 
the inquiry whether a witness before an agency is bound to answer a particular question propounded to him,or to produce books,papers,in his possession and called for by that body,is one that can not be committed to a subordinate administrative or executive tribunal for final determination.such a body could not,under our system of government,and consistently with due process of law,be invested with authority to compel obedience to its orders by a judgment of fine or imprisonment.
section of the nlra,providing specifically for court enforcement of subpoenas,manifests this division of authority.it provides 
in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person,any district court of the united states within the jurisdiction of which the inquiry is carried on or within the jurisdiction of which said person guilty of contumacy or refusal to obey is found or resides or transacts business,upon application by the board shall have jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring such person to appear before the board,its member,agent,or agency,there to produce evidence if so ordered 
this structural limitation on the nlrb authority,emanating from the constitution separation of powers and due process requirements,protect s against abuse of subpoena power.united states bell.
inherent in the board authority to issue subpoenas,to revoke subpoenas,to examine witnesses,and to receive evidence in accordance with the federal rules of evidence is the authority to make substantive rulings on the grounds for objection to subpoenas and to the admissibility of evidence at the administrative hearing.see nlrb duval jewelry,certainly preliminary rulings on subpoena questions are as much in the purview of a hearing officer as are rulings on evidence and the myriad of questions daily presented to him.and within this scope,board adjudicators are authorized to make rulings on questions of privilege,as they have been doing for decades.see,in re kaiser aluminum chem,taylor lumber and treating,feld sons,jackson sportswear,elias.big boy.
in most cases,an alj rulings on privilege do not require court enforcement,because the parties either comply voluntarily with the alj rulings,see,patrick cudahy,see also horizon ftc,dist.lexis,at,or the alj rulings are made without the need for inspection of the underlying documents,see,taylor lumber,at.if enforcement becomes necessary,however,the parties must then turn to the district courts to obtain it.at that time,only the district court determines whether to enforce the subpoena and,in making that determination,evaluates the claims of privilege and,if necessary,conducts an in camera review.moreover,in carrying out this judicial function,the court can not delegate its task of conducting an in camera review to an alj.
this reservation of authority to article iii courts protects against abuse of the subpoena power.while judicial scrutiny of administrative subpoenas is,to be sure,limited,see eeoc city of norfolk police,cir,courts do not simply order the enforcement of subpoenas as a matter of course,and certainly not blindly,see penfield sec,frankfurter,dissenting.citing brimson,justice frankfurter articulated the established principle 
instead of authorizing agencies to enforce their subpoenas,congress has required them to resort to the courts for enforcement.in the discharge of that duty courts act as courts and not as administrative adjuncts.the power of congress to impose on courts the duty of enforcing obedience to an administrative subpoena was sustained precisely because courts were not to be automata in carrying out the wishes of the administrative.they were discharging judicial power with all of the implications of the judicial function in our constitutional scheme.
id.at frankfurter,dissenting.
accordingly,before a court commands a party to comply with a subpoena,it must first determine that the subpoena is within the authority of the agency,the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant.united states morton salt.in short,on an application of an administrative agency for the enforcement of a subpoena in court,the respondent is guaranteed an opportunity to contest the subpoena validity through any appropriate defense.see penfield,at enumerating several grounds on which a n administrative subpoena may be contested nlrb cable car advertisers,d,a party to a subpoena enforcement proceeding may raise appropriate defenses once in district court.in addition to guarding against over breadth or a lack of specificity,the right to raise appropriate defenses includes the right to vindicate claims that a subpoena improperly calls for records protected by the or privileges.see,director,office of thrift supervision vinson elkins,llp,nlrb harvey,cir.because a respondent claim of privilege is the basis for its refusing to produce documents in response to a subpoena,it is inherent in carrying out the judicial function of deciding whether to enforce the subpoena to resolve the respondent challenge
