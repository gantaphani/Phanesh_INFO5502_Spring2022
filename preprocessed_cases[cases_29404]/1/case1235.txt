opinion of the court 
the raymond proffitt foundation and the lehigh river stocking association collectively,the foundation appeal from an order of the eastern district of pennsylvania granting summary judgment to the army corps of engineers corps.the district court concluded that the water resources development act of wrda,the statute the foundation asserts the corps is violating,provides no law to apply to the facts this case presents and that the corps actions are therefore not subject to judicial review under the administrative procedures act,et.apa.although we disagree with that specific holding of the district court,the broad deference that congress granted the corps in executing the environmental mission of the wrda places upon us the obligation to provide a correspondingly deferential judicial review.granting the corps that deference,we conclude that the foundation has failed to demonstrate that the corps has unlawfully delayed or withheld agency action or otherwise been arbitrary,capricious,or in violation of law.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
the raymond proffitt foundation and the lehigh river stocking association are organizations whose members fish,hunt,boat,raft,and otherwise recreate in and along the lehigh river downstream of the francis walter dam walter dam in northeastern pennsylvania.the walter dam is operated by the philadelphia district of the corps as part of the lehigh river basin flood control project.completed in,congress originally authorized construction of the walter dam primarily for flood control,but later expanded the mission of the walter dam in,requiring it to be operated in such a manner as will protect and enhance recreation.water resources development act of,pub,stat.congress subsequently enacted the water resources development act of.section of this act required the inclusion of environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the corps of engineers in operating,and maintaining water resources projects.wrda of.
in,the corps issued a revised manual presenting a plan of regulation for the walter dam.in this manual,the corps noted that t his dam,along with beltzville lake dam and reservoir corps of engineers project are the only major reservoirs in the lehigh river watershed intended to serve flood control purposes.the corps stated that the primary objective of the walter reservoir project is flood control.other objectives are lake and downstream recreation whitewater and drought emergency water quality storage.
in establishing the water control plan for the walter dam,the corps stated that 
releases made to meet minimum release criteria will be sufficient to maintain and enhance downstream fisheries.criteria has sic been developed to avoid abrupt gate raising and closing changes during above normal releases for flood control regulations.efforts will be made to make releases so as to minimize adverse shock effects on downstream fisheries.
nonetheless,the corps believed w ater control management needs must take precedence over fishery accommodation but the attempt should be made to adjust procedures for fishery purposes whenever possible.assessing the overall effect of the water control plan,the corps concluded the francis walter reservoir provides good habitat for fisheries.the reservoir,and the lehigh river below the dam,are listed as high water fisheries in pennsylvania chapter water quality standards.
in august of,the foundation filed a twelve count complaint against the corps and its philadelphia district commander in the district court.jurisdiction was appropriate pursuant to.count one of the complaint,brought pursuant to the administrative procedures act,asserted that the corps was unlawfully withholding or delaying agency action required by of the wrda and otherwise not acting in accordance with the wrda.the foundation alleged that these violations stemmed from two actions or inactions on the part of the corps.first,the foundation asserted the corps failed to include environmental protection as one of the missions for the walter dam in the drafting of the manual.supp.app.pls.com pl.second,the foundation claimed 
t he corps is not fulfilling,or even attempting to fulfill its mission of environmental protection because it a releases large amounts of water during high flow periods,usually in winter and spring and b fails to store water during these high flow periods and release that water during low flow periods,usually summer.
id.pls.compl.
presently,the corps basic operational rule for the walter dam is that during normal conditions the corps will match the dam outflow to its inflow.thus,the corps generally keeps the amount of water in the walter dam reservoir at a constant elevation of feet,thereby attempting to replicate in the lower lehigh river below the dam the flow that would be naturally present if the walter dam had not been constructed above.during the wetter winter and spring months,more water enters the reservoir from rainfall and melting snow.the corps therefore releases more water from the dam,resulting in a higher water flow and river level below.during drier summer months,as less water falls and drains into the reservoir,the corps releases less water from the reservoir.this results in a correspondingly lower flow and river level below 
the foundation believes that,so as to provide a better environment for aquatic species,provide recreation for fisherman sic,canoeists,and provide whitewater rafting throughout the summer,the corps is required by the wrda to improve upon the naturally occurring environment by augmenting the lower lehigh river flows in the summer.the foundation therefore sought declaratory and injunctive relief mandating the corps to change its policy and operations at the walter dam to reflect the judgments of the foundation regarding the proper operation of the dam.the corps responded to this first claim by asserting that of wrda is a mission statement which is fundamentally discretionary in nature,committed to the agency by law,and unreviewable through the apa.
the district court granted summary judgment to the corps on all of the foundation claims,holding with respect to count one that the corps actions under the wrda were unreviewable because the wrda did not provide any law to apply to this situation.raymond proffitt found.army corps of eng rs,d,the district court reasoned that the wrda environmental protection mission was placed upon the corps as a whole,not upon each individual water resources project.the corps has the discretion to apply this statutory mission to water resources projects that it operates,but is not obligated to implement it at any particular one.id.at.the text of provides only a general statement that establishes environmental protection as one of the corps primary missions.however,this language gives no guidance on how this mission is to be carried out.id.at.therefore,the district court reasoned that this statute fit within the exception from reviewability applied by the supreme court in heckler chaney,d.
the foundation appealed only from the district court judgment on count one that t he mission statement of is insufficient to provide law to apply in this case and that the foundation can,therefore,assert no violation of the wrda through the apa.d at.jurisdiction is proper in this court pursuant to.our scope of review of the district court decision on whether judicial review was available pursuant to a and whether the agency action was not in accordance with law is plenary.see davis enters,cir.however,where congress has granted discretion to an agency to make decisions,w e are only free to determine whether the agency followed its own guidelines or committed a clear error of judgment.id.at citing citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.while we may not have made the same decision as the agency,we are not free to substitute our judgment for that of the agency on an issue.id.
section of the wrda states the secretary of the army shall include environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the corps of engineers in planning,designing,constructing,operating,and maintaining water resources projects.a in the event that an administrative agency covered by the strictures of the apa violates a statute,the apa provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.both a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.in such an instance,the reviewing court shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed and hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.however,t his chapter does not apply to the extent that statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.the corps does not contend that the wrda facially precludes judicial review.rather,the corps contends that the agency actions with which the foundation is concerned are impliedly committed to agency discretion by law.a.
the apa generous review provisions must be given a hospitable interpretation.hondros civil service comm n,cir quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.o nly upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.abbott,at.quoting rusk cort,d.in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,the supreme court interpreted section a as establishing a broad presumption in favor of reviewability,holding that the exception applied only when there is no law to apply.davis,at.in heckler chaney,d,the supreme court first found occasion to apply this exception.
heckler considered whether a decision of an administrative agency to exercise its discretion not to undertake certain enforcement actions is subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act,et apa.id.at.the petitioners were prison inmates sentenced to death by lethal injection who asserted that the use of those drugs for capital punishment violated the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act and request ed that the fda take various enforcement actions to prevent these violations.id.
nothing that t he act general provision for enforcement,provides only that t he secretary is authorized to conduct examinations and investigations emphasis added,id.at.emphasis in original,the supreme court reasoned the act enforcement provisions thus commit complete discretion to the secretary to decide how and when they should be exercised.id.the court emphasized that the general exception to reviewability provided by a for action committed to agency discretion remains a narrow one,see citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d,but within that exception are included agency refusals to institute investigative or enforcement proceedings,unless congress has indicated otherwise.id.at.
since heckler,the supreme court has extended its holding to other contexts,concluding that other agency decisions were committed to agency discretion by law.a.in webster doe,d,an employee contested his dismissal by the cia director pursuant to of the national security act.that act provided that the director of central intelligence may,in his discretion,terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states id.at.quoting c current version at h.the court found that the language and structure of c indicate that congress meant to commit individual employee discharges to the director discretion,and that a accordingly precludes judicial review of these decisions under the apa.id.at.
the petitioners in brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d sought to appeal the interstate commerce commission denial of reconsideration of an earlier administrative decision solely on what the petitioners asserted had been a material error.the statute provided that the commission may because of material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances b grant rehearing.id.at.quoting g current version at c.the court reasoned that because there was no new evidence or changed circumstances alleged to the after it issued the original order,
an appeal of the order denying reconsideration an appeal from the original order places before the courts precisely the same substance that could have been brought there by appeal from the original asks them to review it on the strange,basis of whether the agency decision is not only unlawful,but so unlawful that the refusal to reconsider it is an abuse of discretion.
id.at.the supreme court reasoned that the appeal was,or would become,a mechanism for evading the statute of limitations applicable to a challenge of the original order and decided that the reconsideration denial was therefore unreviewable unless one of the two other bases for reconsideration are asserted.id.at.later,the supreme court also held that the allocation of funds from a appropriation is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.lincoln vigil,d.
to date,the supreme court has only applied the heckler exception on an ad hoc basis.nonetheless,this court has 
set forth an analytical framework to be followed before the court may determine that an agency decision is unreviewable under section a.to so hold,we must consider whether the action involves broad discretion,not just the limited discretion inherent in every agency action the action is the product of political,military,economic,or managerial choices that are not readily subject to judicial review and the action does not involve charges that the agency lacked jurisdiction,that the decision was motivated by impermissible influences such as bribery or fraud,or that the decision violates a constitutional,statutory,or regulatory command.
davis,at citing local,afge united states,cir citations omitted.in local,when we first articulated this framework and applied it to hold an agency action unreviewable,a union challenged the army decision to contract out certain services to a private contractor.o bserv ing that the statute is,for the most part,written in language of permission and discretion,the panel reasoned that on the face of the statute there is simply no law to apply in determining if the decision is correct.local,at quoting southern ry.seaboard allied milling,d overton park,at.
applying the foregoing principles,the district court erred in concluding that the wrda falls within the apa exception from reviewability contained in a because the wrda does not contain law to apply.proffitt,d at.there can be no doubt that the text of grants the corps very broad discretion.however,b road discretionary powers are merely a predicate to nonreviewability.local,at.the committed to agency discretion exception to judicial review is intended to be applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.id.at quoting overton park,at.internal citation omitted emphasis added.in count one,the foundation alleges two separate actions by the corps which purportedly violate the wrda.we consider,in turn,whether each of these agency actions are subject to judicial review.
the foundation first alleges that the corps failed to take action to include environmental protection as one of the missions for the corps both overall and specifically at the walter dam.the statute at issue certainly provides law against which we can consider those allegations.while it appears that the broad language of the wrda means that few actions the corps takes with respect to any particular water resources project will violate the apa,the wrda clearly imposes an affirmative obligation to include environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the corps of engineers in planning,designing,constructing,operating,and maintaining water resources projects.a the one common thread running through the supreme court and third circuit precedents in this area is that where an agency assertion that a decision committed to agency discretion by law has been upheld,on the face of the statute there is simply no law to apply in determining if a decision is correct.local,at emphasis added.see,heckler,at.t he secretary is authorized to conduct examinations and investigations emphasis added emphasis in original webster,at.the director of central intelligence may,in his discretion,terminate the employment whenever he shall deem such termination necessary emphasis added locomotive eng rs,at.the commission may grant rehearing emphasis added lincoln,at.the snyder act authorizes the service to expend such moneys as congress may from time to time appropriate,for the benefit,care,and assistance of the indians,through appropriations local,at we observe that the statute is,for the most part,written in language of permission and discretion.nonetheless,that is not dispositive.where a statute itself has been permissive or discretionary as to the agency,this court has even read an agency practices or regulations into the statute so as to provide a basis for review.see,hondros civil service comm n,cir the service has a regularized method for evaluating its employees against which the employee service could be compared davis,at the agency regulations or internal policies provide sufficient guidance to make possible federal review under an abuse of discretion standard even absent express statutory limits on agency discretion.
in contrast,the statute at issue here states that the secretary shall include environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the corps of engineers in planning,designing,constructing,operating,and maintaining water resources projects.a emphasis added.unlike other statutes where courts have found decisions committed to agency discretion by law,this statute is not written in language of permission and discretion.see local,at the statute requires the consideration of environmental protection when operating,and maintaining water resources projects.see a.the corps admits as much in its brief,stating that the sole command identified by proffitt under this criterion is section itself.corps br.at.certainly,how the corps implements this environmental protection mission appears to be left to the vast discretion of the corps.there is,however,no discretion granted to the corps on the issue of whether or not they are supposed to include environmental protection as a mission.they are.
section also fails the specific analytical test this court established in local,and reaffirmed in davis enterprises,for determining whether a given decision is committed to agency discretion by law.while the corps actions under the wrda appear to meet two of that test three factors,they completely fail the last.t he action by the foundation does involve charges that the agency decision violates a constitutional,statutory,or regulatory command.see at emphasis added.
in sum,the district court erred in concluding that the wrda provides no law to apply to the foundation first allegation that the corps failed to include environmental protection as one its overall missions and as one of the specific missions of the walter dam.raymond proffitt,d at.there is law to apply.as the corps itself effectively conceded at oral argument,where the corps has completely abdicated its environmental protection responsibilities,then this statute,broad as it is,provides law to apply.because the foundation complaint makes such allegations,we are free to review the corps actions to determine its compliance with.
in addition to its allegations that the corps is not including environmental protection as part of its missions,the foundation asserts that,by its actions in the actual operation of the walter dam,the corps is not fulfilling,or even attempting to fulfill its mission of environmental protection.nonetheless,just because the foundation first allegation of unlawful agency action under is amenable to judicial review,it does not necessarily follow that all of its allegations pursuant to that statute are subject to judicial review.in lincoln vigil,d,the supreme court established that while agency action pursuant to a general congressional authorization may be amenable to judicial review in a broad sense,certain specific categories of administrative decisions that courts traditionally have regarded as committed to agency discretion may not be reviewable within the context of that broader mandate.lincoln addressed a challenge by an indian tribe to certain specific expenditures of the indian health service within the context of a appropriation from congress.that appropriation authorize d the service to expend such moneys as congress may from time to time appropriate,for the benefit,care,and assistance of the indians,for the relief of distress and conservation of health.id.at.quoting.
generally,an aggrieved party can bring an action to challenge an agency expenditures as inconsistent with the permissible statutory objectives for which congress appropriated the funds.see id.at.see also morton ruiz,d considering whether the bureau of indian affair implementation of its general assistance program was consistent with congressional intent in appropriating the program funds nonetheless,lincoln stands for the principle that once that initial level of judicial review is passed,the specific execution by the agency to meet those objectives may still be left entirely within its discretion.the lincoln court held that the apa precluded judicial review of the specific allegations of those plaintiffs,reasoning that the allocation of funds from a appropriation is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.after all,the very point of a appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.lincoln,at.a s long as the agency allocates funds from a appropriation to meet permissible statutory objectives,a gives the courts no leave to intrude.t o that extent,the decision to allocate funds is committed to agency discretion by law.id.at quoting a.
as part of its allegations that the specific operational policies of the corps violate,the foundation apparently reads to prohibit the corps from implementing at each and every water resources project under its administration any policies causing harm to the aquatic life.foundation br.at.however,the wrda states only that the secretary shall include environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the corps at water resources projects.a emphasis added.congress did not clearly instruct the agency to implement that mission at any specific water resources project,let alone suggest how it should do so.because provides no objective standards that dictate how the agency must implement this mission or how it must balance environmental protection with its other responsibilities,the corps argues that properly committed to the corps discretion any judgments regarding the implementation of that mission.
we need not conclusively decide the proper interpretation of to determine whether the exception to review contained in apa a applies to these allegations.before us now are not the merits of the foundation allegations,but whether judicial review of these specific actions is precluded because on the face of the statute there is simply no law to apply.local,at.courts can not preclude judicial review simply because a party appears likely to lose on the merits.that would put the cart before the horse.rather,in determining whether judicial review is available in the first instance,we look for clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent before we will restrict access to judicial review.abbott,at.quoting rusk cort,d.we will now consider only that far.
compared to some of the more affirmative instructions congress has given the secretary and the corps in later sections of the wrda congress use of the phrase include as one of the primary missions in if that phrase really is to mean implement to the fullest at every water resources project,as the foundation suggests,strikes us as peculiar.see whitman am.trucking,d words are given content,however,by t
