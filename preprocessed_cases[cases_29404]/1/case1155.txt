this case,grounded in the principles of administrative law,requires that we review the validity of an internal revenue service irs regulation.the tax court,in considering this regulation,analyzed it under the factors provided in national muffler dealers ass united states,d,and concluded that the regulation was invalid.in coming to this conclusion,the tax court explained that the standard established in national muffler had not been replaced by chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and that the result under either standard would be the same.we do not agree with the outcome reached by the tax court.we have determined that the result would not be the same under chevron analysis as it would be under national muffler and that the regulation here should be given chevron deference.
factual and procedural background 
the irs has appealed a united states tax court decision that held reg.a i to be invalid.swallows holdings,taxpayer is a barbados corporation with two principal shareholders,raimundo and aurora elsa arnaiz.on september,taxpayer filed its first federal income tax return.in its return,taxpayer reported that it held real property in san diego,california.between and,taxpayer generated rental income from the san diego property it was not until,however,that taxpayer filed returns for tax years,and.
a foreign corporation,engaging in trade or business in the united states,is taxed on its taxable income that is connected with the conduct of that trade or business.a.deductions from income are allowed only if they are connected with the income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states.section c a.however,foreign corporations that do not engage in a trade or business in the united states are taxed at a flat rate of thirty percent of any amount received from sources within the united states.section a.the internal revenue code,generally speaking,does not allow these foreign corporations to claim deductions.section c.nevertheless,if a foreign corporation conducts real property activity in the united states,the foreign corporation can treat the income derived from the real property activity as income from a trade or business,thus qualifying the foreign corporation to claim tax deductions,interest and taxes that are otherwise unavailable.section d.
the dispute in this case arises from the filing deadlines set forth in reg.a i which the secretary of the treasury promulgated to supplement section c.the regulation requires that a foreign corporation file a return within eighteen months of the filing deadline set in section in order to claim the real property activity tax deductions.here,taxpayer filed the tax returns in question well after the expiration of the filing period.the commissioner assessed tax deficiencies accordingly 
taxpayer challenged the commissioner findings in the united states tax court,arguing that reg.a i was an invalid exercise of the secretary authority.see swallows holding.the tax court granted judgment in favor of taxpayer,focusing its inquiry on the plain meaning of c.specifically,the court held that section c requires that foreign corporations file in the manner prescribed by subtitle f id.at.the tax court interpretation of the statute centered on the meaning of the word manner in the absence of any explicit textual reference to time.the court found it persuasive that congress did not draft the statute with the familiar phrase time and manner.the court noted that congress placed time and manner together in several code sections,indicating that when congress intended a time limit to apply,it did so with the phrase time and manner.because the court found that the plain meaning of manner did not inherently include an element of time,the court concluded that congress did not intend section c to embody a filing deadline.id.at.the court found that the meaning of the statutory text was plain and unambiguous.id.at.the court nonetheless continued its analysis and held that the secretary interpretation of the statute to include a timely filing requirement in the language of reg.a i was unreasonable.at.
relying on its earlier opinion in central.sav.association subs.commissioner,the tax court determined that the standard established in national muffler had not been replaced by chevron and that the result under either standard would be the same.id.at.the court concluded that a consideration of the national muffler factors demonstrated the unreasonableness of the secretary interpretation of section c to include the timely filing requirement.id.at.the tax court listed the six factors set out in national muffler to consider in assessing the reasonableness of the agency action.the tax court described these factors as follows 
whether the regulation is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent the manner in which a regulation dating from a later period evolved the length of time that the regulation has been in effect the reliance placed upon the regulation the consistency of the secretary interpretations and the degree of scrutiny congress has devoted to the regulation during subsequent reenactments of this statute.
id.at citing national muffler,at.
the tax court found that the secretary action failed to meet several of the national muffler factors the regulation was not a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute the regulation evolved after the fourth circuit court of appeals and the board of tax appeals had repeatedly and consistently held that the statute did not include a timely filing requirement the regulations were issued after multiple reenactments of the statutory text the secretary statement accompanying the issuance of the regulations flew in the face of the prior court holdings and was a departure from the secretary previous interpretation of the regulations and the statute had been reenacted several times without change to the governing statutory language.id.at.as a result,the court held that the regulation was an unreasonable exercise of the secretary statutory power.thus,the tax court ruled in favor of taxpayer,holding that c did not include a filing deadline and that taxpayer was entitled to the rental activity deductions.the irs appealed.

applicability of chevron 
the crucial issue before us is whether the tax court erred in applying national muffler rather than chevron when evaluating the validity of reg.a i.we hold that the tax court erred in applying national muffler to the extent that the national muffler factors are inconsistent with chevron analysis.
in chevron,the supreme court reasoned that the judiciary was to afford an agency discretion to interpret ambiguous provisions of the agency organic or enabling statute.in what has become familiar administrative law parlance,the chevron court set forth a two step analysis 
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress chevron step one.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction of the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute chevron step two.
chevron,at.courts,including the supreme court,have operated under this general framework.see,cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d united states mead,d woodall fed.bureau of prisons,cir george harms const.chao,cir robert wood johnson.hosp.thompson,cir.in accordance with this precedent,we will proceed to determine if this case should be reviewed under chevron.
our inquiry would be a simple one if,as the tax court suggested,the result of this case would be the same regardless of which standard we apply.this,however,is not the case.the tax court relied heavily on factors that,although relevant to the national muffler standard,are not mandatory or dispositive inquiries under chevron.as we set out above,the tax court reasoned that the challenged regulation was not a contemporaneous construction of the statute the tax court found that the fourth circuit court of appeals and the board of tax appeals had interpreted the statute as not including a timing element,and the tax court relied on the existence of several reenactments of the statute without any change to the governing statutory language 
even if we were to assume that all of these observations are true,conclusive reliance on them is misplaced.when chevron deference is owed,chevron demands are clear.if the statutory text is ambiguous,an agency is given the discretion to promulgate rules that interpret the ambiguous provisions.judicial deference to an agency authority ends only when the agency construction of its statute is unreasonable.accordingly,we now consider whether chevron deference is appropriate here 
chevron analysis 
we note that chevron deference will not be extended to all agency action.mead,at.mead teaches that chevron deference is appropriate only in situations where congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law id.at.emphasis added.when congress does not intend a particular agency action to wield the force of law,skidmore deference may be appropriate thus,mead requires that we assess the legal effect of reg.a i,which was promulgated under.section,which is a general grant of power to the secretary,provides 
except where such authority is given by this title to any person other than an officer or employee of the treasury department,the secretary shall prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title,including all rules and regulations as may be necessary by reason of any alteration of law in relation to internal revenue.
we note first that the deference owed to regulations issued under a has been described over the years in different ways.in national muffler,of course,the supreme court listed factors such as whether the regulation was contemporaneous with the statute,the age of the regulation,and the consistency of its interpretation.at.more recently,however,in united states cleveland indians baseball,d,the court remarked that we defer to the commissioner regulations as long as they implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.id.at.quoting united states correll,d 
in armstrong world,comm r,cir,this court considered the validity of a regulation issued under section a.we cited to chevron,at,to support the need to determine if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,and if the intent of congress is unambiguously expressed,we must give that intent effect.id.at quoting chevron,at.again quoting chevron,we went on to state that i f the question has not been directly addressed,we then look to whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.under this standard,we concluded that the regulation,promulgated under section a,was not unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to the plain language of the code,id.at,and held the regulation to be valid.
as we did in armstrong world industries,we will look to chevron here to determine the validity of reg.a i.
taxpayer argues,however,that the secretary promulgated an interpretive regulation and that interpretive regulations,as a class,do not merit chevron deference.we disagree.when determining whether congress intends a particular agency action to carry the force of law,our inquiry does not hinge solely on the type of agency action involved.rather,d elegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.mead,at.there is no per se rule that relegates interpretive rules to the realm of skidmore.here,the secretary opened the rule to public comment,a move that is indicative of agency action that carries the force of law.id.at.cleary waldman,cir accordingly,the resulting regulation is entitled to chevron deference if it survives chevron two prong inquiry 
chevron step one ambiguity of the statutory text 
first,previous judicial interpretations of c do not preempt our analysis in determining if the statute is ambiguous.taxpayer argues that our analysis is unnecessary pursuant to the supreme court holding in national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,d.brand x,however,held that o nly a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation,and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill,displaces a conflicting agency construction.id.at.no such opinion exists in this case accordingly,we are not bound by previous judicial interpretations of c.
under chevron,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,our inquiry ends and the plain meaning of the statute governs the action.at.if,however,the statutory provision is ambiguous,such ambiguity is viewed as an implicit congressional delegation of authority to an agency,allowing the agency to fill the gap with a reasonable regulation.mci telecomm.bell,cir.the inquiry into the ambiguity of a statutory provision must begin with the text of the statute.the text of c reads in pertinent part 
a foreign corporation shall receive the benefit of the deductions and credits allowed to it in this subtitle only by filing or causing to be filed with the secretary a true and accurate return,in the manner prescribed in subtitle f,including therein all information which the secretary may deem necessary for the calculation of such deductions and credits.
our inquiry focuses on the requirement that foreign companies file with the secretary a true and accurate return,in the manner prescribed in subtitle taxpayer argues that the word manner does not by its nature include a timing element,thus indicating that congress did not intend for a filing deadline to exist.this is an overly narrow interpretation of manner.courts that have interpreted manner as used in c and its predecessors have struggled over whether manner includes a timing element,which indicates that the language is not clear and unambiguous.compare direct tea trading,discussing divergent conclusions and adopting interpretation that excludes a timing element,with espinosa comm r,wl reasoning that provision embodied some period,even if not expressly stated.
moreover,congress uses manner without time in other sections of the code,and,in some of these situations,manner has been interpreted to implicitly include a timing element.see c,c.in these provisions,congress did not use the phrase time and manner,yet the secretary promulgated valid regulations that include temporal components.see reg.a,a i.thus,congress does not uniformly use the phrase time and manner when it desires a particular code provision to embody a timing element.rather,we find manner,depending on the context,may be a comprehensive term.
as used in this instance,the word manner may be defined as a characteristic or customary way of acting.webster dictionary ed.under this definition,the provision is not a clear and unambiguous expression of congressional intent,as one customary way of acting may include an element of timeliness.further,congress use of manner in c prompts contextual ambiguity.we could read manner to refer to subtitle f,which itself includes timing elements.alternatively,we could read this provision as indicating that congress did not wish the timing requirements of subtitle f to apply.reading the statute this way would not foreclose the secretary from promulgating a regulation that sets a filing
