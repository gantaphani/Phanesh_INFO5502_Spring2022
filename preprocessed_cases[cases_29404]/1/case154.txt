former employees of westernbank,a failed bank taken into receivership by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,sued banco popular de puerto rico bppr,a bank that subsequently acquired westernbank deposits and certain assets,but not the fdic,on claims for severance pay under law,laws ann.tit,et.the fdic has intervened and asserted that under d d no court shall have jurisdiction over the claims because the plaintiffs either failed to file administrative claims with the fdic or failed to challenge in federal court the fdic disallowance of their administrative claims.at oral argument,the plaintiffs counsel conceded that the fdic position is correct.because the case must be remanded for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,the issues presented are likely to recur,and an opinion will provide useful precedent,we explain why there was no jurisdiction here.
this case raises several issues of first impression for us under the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,stat.we hold that the plaintiffs failures to comply with the fdic administrative claims process trigger the statutory bar,and we join a number of circuits in holding that they may not avoid the jurisdictional bar by failing to name the fdic as a defendant.accordingly,we vacate entry of summary judgment for the defendants and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
factual background 
on april,the puerto rico office of the commissioner for financial institutions ocfi closed the insolvent westernbank and appointed the fdic as receiver.that same day,the fdic informed all westernbank employees that they had been terminated because westernbank was permanently closed.the fdic notified the employees that they had a right to submit any claims that they may have had against westernbank or the fdic to the fdic under the mandatory administrative claims process,d,established by firrea.the plaintiffs neither pled nor produced evidence that they filed any such claims.all plaintiffs worked for westernbank at the time of its closure,with start dates ranging from to.
the fdic sold westernbank deposits and loans under a purchase and assumption agreement p a agreement to bppr on april,in the p a agreement,bppr agreed to assume all of the failed bank insured deposits and to purchase certain assets formerly held by westernbank.bppr did not assume any liability to westernbank employees for severance pay,and sections a and of the p a agreement provided that the fdic would indemnify bppr for liabilities of the failed bank not assumed under the p a agreement,including claims based on the rights of or of an employee of the failed bank.the p a agreement specifically contemplated claims being brought by former employees under law for severance or enhanced severance pay,and provided that the fdic would indemnify bppr for any employee claim under law based on successor liability.
many of the plaintiffs in this case became employees of bppr.between april and june,these plaintiffs signed temporary employment agreements with containing termination dates and acknowledgments by the plaintiffs that their employment relationship with westernbank had ended westernbank had ceased to exist and their temporary employment with bppr was new and did not constitute a continuation of their prior employment with westernbank.of the plaintiffs who had become bppr employees,all eventually left bppr,either through voluntary resignations or termination.
procedural history 
the plaintiffs sued bppr on october,in a puerto rico court for unjust termination in violation of law and sought severance payments based on their time employed at bppr and at westernbank the employees asserted that bppr was liable as a successor employer because bppr acquired the assets of westernbank,an ongoing business,and essentially continued the same identity and business activity as before.
on november,bppr removed the case to federal court based on federal question and the fdic moved to intervene on february,because it retained certain liabilities at issue if any actually existed.the district court granted the motion to intervene on april.
bppr moved for summary judgment on august,arguing that it was not liable for any severance claims based on the plaintiffs employment at westernbank for at least three different reasons,which are not pertinent to our disposition of this appeal.
the fdic moved for dismissal on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs claims for severance pay based on their employment at westernbank.b the fdic argued that it had retained any potential liability for such severance claims in the p a agreement.the employees had been terminated on the closing date and notified of their right to file a claim against the fdic.the fdic provided unrebutted information that some did not file any such claim,and those who did failed to file any challenge let alone timely to the fdic disallowance of their claims in the proper federal court.as a result,the fdic argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the claims.
the district court granted bppr motion for summary judgment on march,based on bppr arguments and did not address the antecedent question of whether it had jurisdiction.acosta ramirez banco popular de,civil,wl,at.the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.on appeal,they have expressly abandoned any claims against bppr that do not depend on their westernbank tenure.
federal courts are obliged to resolve questions pertaining to jurisdiction before addressing the merits of a case.donahue city of boston,cir citing steel citizens for a better env t,d see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d see also arbaugh y h,d discussing importance of determining if an issue is one of jurisdiction because it creates an independent obligation for the court,allows courts to resolve disputed evidence,and requires dismissal of the complaint in its entirety if jurisdiction is lacking.we independently determine the existence of jurisdiction.see alphas dan tudor sons sales,cir union fire ins.of pittsburgh city,cir appeals courts exercise plenary review over question of whether jurisdiction exists.in deciding the question,we may consider whatever evidence has been submitted in the case.see aversa united states,cir see also alicea hernandez catholic bishop of,cir.
a.the fdic assumed and retained severance liability for the plaintiffs tenure at westernbank 
congress adopted firrea in response to the savings and loan crisis in the.tellado indymac mortg,cir.firrea gives the fdic authority to act as receiver or conservator for failed institutions.benson jpmorgan chase bank,cir.congress wanted to facilitate takeovers of insolvent financial institutions and smooth the modalities by which rehabilitation might be accomplished.marquis fdic,cir.
as part of the rehabilitative process,the fdic,as receiver,succeeds as a matter of law to the rights,titles,powers and privileges of the failed bank,along with the responsibility to pay the failed bank valid obligations.d a,d h.the fdic may merge the failed institution with a healthier institution,and in doing so,may transfer any asset or liability of the failed institution.id.d g i i ii.through a different statutory provision,congress permits the fdic in its sole discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the fdic may prescribe,to assume liabilities of the failed institution.id.c a i.
here,the fdic,through the p a agreement,retained liabilities as to any claims by former westernbank employees arising from their employment with westernbank,which the fdic assumed by becoming receiver.see lawson fdic,cir payne sec.sav.loan ass n,cir.article iv of the p a agreement sets forth the liabilities assumed by bppr,and does not include liabilities under law.moreover,subject to limitations not relevant here,section of the p a agreement indemnifies bppr against liabilities it did not assume through the p a agreement,including claims based on rights of employees of westernbank.in addition,section of the p a agreement specifically contemplates a claim of successor liability against bppr by former westernbank employees and indemnifies bppr against such claims,providing more proof that bppr did not assume such liability.hence,any claim for severance pay for the plaintiffs tenure at westernbank is ultimately against the fdic.
b.the plaintiffs failures to comply with firrea administrative claims process create a jurisdictional bar 
because congress wanted the fdic to be able to deal expeditiously with failed depository institutions,see meliezer resolution trust,cir,firrea was also designed to create an efficient administrative protocol for processing claims against failed banks,marquis,at.this was achieved through the statutory claims process.
firrea statutory claims process requires the fdic,upon appointment as receiver,to publish notice that the failed institution creditors must file claims with the fdic by a specified date,which must be at least ninety days after publication of the notice.d b i if a claim is filed,the fdic has days to determine whether to approve or disallow the claim.id.d a i.claimants then have sixty days from the date of disallowance or from the expiration of the day administrative decision deadline to seek judicial review in an appropriate federal district court or to seek administrative review.id.d a 
moreover,firrea imposes limits on the jurisdiction of courts to hear certain claims where the plaintiff has not complied with the statutory claims process.section d d states 
d limitations on judicial review 
except as otherwise provided in this subsection,no court shall have jurisdiction over 
i any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver,including assets which the fdic may acquire from itself as such receiver or 
ii any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the fdic as receiver.
t his subsection refers to d in its entirety.marquis,at.as a result,in a case in which subsection i applied,we held that f ailure to comply with the statutory claims process deprives the courts of subject matter jurisdiction.simon fdic,cir.the same deprivation of jurisdiction holds true under subsection ii.we discuss later why failure to name the fdic as a defendant does not affect this conclusion.
claims of those who did not file administrative claims are barred 
the parties asserting jurisdiction,here the plaintiffs,have the burden of demonstrating the existence of federal jurisdiction.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d fábrica de muebles álvarez,inversiones mendoza,cir.here,it is undisputed that many of the plaintiffs never made any effort to follow the statutory claims process.these plaintiffs have obviously failed to meet the burden.see inversiones mendoza,at.
the plaintiffs who filed an administrative claim but did not seek timely judicial review under firrea are barred 
there is another wrinkle based on information in the fdic brief,which informs us that many of the plaintiffs actually filed for severance pay with the fdic following the westernbank receivership.their claims were denied and the plaintiffs never filed suit against the fdic seeking review of the denials.the fdic argues that failure to file suit within the requirement of d deprives the court of jurisdiction.
a number of courts that have considered the question have held that failure to comply with the limit operates as a jurisdictional bar.see,home capital collateral,fdic,cir astrup resolution trust,cir per curiam capitol leasing fdic,cir.our decision in simon fdic,also appears to place the requirement within the jurisdictional sweep of d d,although in that case the plaintiffs never even filed administrative claims.see at.
we agree with the fdic that the failure of the plaintiffs to comply with the requirement to seek judicial review of the denial of their administrative claims also deprives courts of jurisdiction.firrea plain language states that except as otherwise provided,no court has jurisdiction over the relevant types of claims,d d i ii,and the only judicial review provided for here is for suits filed within sixty days of the disallowance or the expiration of the decision period,id.d.we think that the provision plain language makes it clear that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional,see henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki,d.moreover,the limit is part of a comprehensive scheme designed to create an efficient process,see marquis,at,which buttresses our view that failure to comply with the requirement,like failure to file an administrative claim,triggers firrea jurisdictional limitation.
the plaintiffs may not avoid the jurisdictional bar by strategically naming bppr as the sole defendant 
had this suit been brought originally against the fdic,it would clearly have been jurisdictionally barred.see simon,at.we consider whether the jurisdictional limitation applies to suits seeking to make an end run around firrea statutory claims process by suing the purchasing bank.it does.
as the seventh circuit summarized in farnik fdic,cir,the circuits that have considered whether firrea judicial review restriction applies to assuming banks have interpreted it as focusing on the substance of a claim rather than its form.id.at.therefore,the firrea administrative exhaustion requirement is based not on the entity named as defendant but on the actor responsible for the alleged wrongdoing.id.at.
other circuits agree.in village of oakwood state bank trust,cir,the sixth circuit reasoned that even if the fdic was not the named defendant,the claims related to acts or omissions of the fdic as receiver and so the failure to comply with the statutory claims process barred the claim.id.at.
in benson jpmorgan chase bank,the ninth circuit stated,l itigants can not avoid firrea administrative requirements through strategic pleading.id.at.the court found the plaintiffs claims against the purchasing bank related to an act or omission of a depository institution for which the fdic had been appointed receiver,triggering the jurisdictional bar.id.at.
finally,in tellado indymac mortgage services,the third circuit held that because the plaintiffs claim against the assuming bank was not a claim of independent misconduct by the assuming bank,but existed only because the failed institution had failed to provide proper notice of the right to cancel the mortgage,id.at,the jurisdictional limitation applied,id.at.
looking to the substance rather than the form,the plaintiffs claims are indeed really claims against the receivership.they turn on the fdic decision,as receiver,to terminate the plaintiffs upon the closing of westernbank the fdic decision,as receiver,not to transfer to bppr any liability for employees severance pay based on their employment at westernbank in the p a agreement.the plaintiffs counsel conceded at oral argument that there are no independent claims against bppr for actions it took.that concession,coupled with our finding that jurisdiction is lacking on the severance claims related to the plaintiffs employment at westernbank,disposes of this appeal in its entirety.the plaintiffs may not avoid that reality though strategic pleading.their claims are jurisdictionally barred.
for the reasons set forth above,we vacate the district court order granting summary judgment and remand this case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.no costs are awarded.
we have explained before that although there are many options available to the fdic when a bank fails,these options generally fall within two categories of approaches,either liquidation or purchase and assumption.the liquidation option is the easiest method,but carries with it two major disadvantages.first,the closing of the bank weakens confidence in the banking system.second,there is often substantial delay in returning funds to depositors.the preferred option when a bank fails,therefore,is the purchase and assumption option generally,the purchase and assumption must be executed in great haste,often design,first serv.bank for,cir per curiam citations omitted.
