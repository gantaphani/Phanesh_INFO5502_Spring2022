robert gunville and richard oakley were terminated from their employment with the state of illinois after a change in the governing political.although they would have been eligible to be reemployed at positions throughout the state under prior interpretations of personnel rules,the new administration applied the rules much more narrowly,resulting in a lack of opportunities for reemployment for the two men.they charged certain state officials with violating their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants and we affirm.
gunville and oakley were employees of the illinois department of corrections idoc when the republican lost control of the governor office to democrat now rod blagojevich in january.gunville had been working for idoc since,beginning as a stationary fireman and working his way up to the position of plant maintenance engineer ii by.in,he was assigned to oversee the construction of two new prison facilities hopkins park correctional center in kankakee county,and grayville correctional center in white county.gunville also retained some duties at thomson correctional center,but he was the only state employee working at hopkins park and grayville in early.his position description listed kankakee county as the his county of employment.oakley too began working for idoc in,and also rose through the ranks to the position of statewide commander of the special operations response team sort.oakley held the rank of colonel at the beginning of,overseeing three regional sort commanders.although he was the sort commander,his position description listed sangamon county as his county of employment.
when the new administration took office in january,the governor directed all state agencies to find ways to improve efficiencies and save money to address a statewide budget crisis.in the ensuing months,the new administration halted construction on the hopkins park and grayville correctional centers.gunville,whose main job responsibilities related to those new facilities,was laid off as of may.oakley was also laid off on may,following a reorganization of the sort command structure.sort was consolidated from three regions into two.one of the regional commanders,cecil polley,was demoted from captain to lieutenant and his pay was cut.at this lower rank and pay,polley was then appointed the new statewide sort commander,although his duties changed little from his prior regional position.gunville and oakley believed they were targeted for layoffs because of their political affiliation.gunville was an active member of the republican party oakley had voted as a republican in some primaries.the republicans had controlled the executive branch in illinois for years when the new democratic governor took office.
in,certain correctional facilities in illinois were empty because idoc lacked operational funding for them.donald snyder was the acting director of idoc until june,when roger walker became the director.michael rumman was the director of the illinois department of central management services cms from january through june.james sledge is now the director of cms.cms is the agency that administers the personnel rules for all state agencies.julie curry,the new deputy chief of staff for the new governor,was responsible for several state agencies,including idoc.snyder hired jim underwood as the personnel manager of idoc.at the time of his hiring,underwood had no experience in personnel matters and was not interviewed for the job,but he had been a political supporter of both curry and blagojevich.curry told underwood to look for positions in idoc that could be eliminated,and underwood,together with his retiring predecessor,nanci bounds,compiled a list.underwood asked bounds to provide a list of positions created under the administration of george ryan,the outgoing republican governor,and bounds complied with that request.underwood and bounds reviewed the idoc organizational chart and together identified positions that were no longer needed.the two also considered for elimination certain positions that did not appear on the organizational chart.without discussing the list with snyder,underwood presented the resultant list to curry.underwood conveyed curry ensuing approval to bounds,who then prepared the layoff package for the may layoffs.in addition to layoffs,some departments underwent reorganizations at the same time.snyder forwarded the layoff package to cms in early may,and cms approved the layoff,which eliminated the positions held by gunville and oakley.twenty other idoc positions were eliminated at the same time,and all captains positions were eliminated,a decision that affected more than two hundred idoc employees.gunville and oakley were eligible for recall or reemployment under the personnel rules of the illinois administrative code,but neither were reemployed by idoc following the layoff.
gunville had voted as a republican in primaries from to,and believed snyder saw him at certain republican functions,including fundraisers.oakley only political activity was voting,and he consistently voted in republican primaries while he was working for idoc.gunville and oakley concede that walker and rumman did not know them and had no personal role in decisions concerning them.the district court declined to consider an additional piece of evidence concerning the defendants knowledge of the plaintiffs political affiliation.kathleen danner,an assistant to the personnel manager at idoc,testified in her deposition that she had been told that voter records were pulled for certain personnel decisions.the district court found this testimony was inadmissible hearsay,and declined to include it in the summary judgment analysis.the evidence that the defendants even knew the plaintiffs political affiliation was thin the evidence that political affiliation motivated the layoff decisions is even thinner,as we shall see.
gunville and oakley claim that their first amendment rights were violated when they were terminated because of their political affiliation.they also alleged that their fourteenth amendment rights were violated when they were not placed on reemployment lists for all of the counties in which they had been employed,but rather were placed only on lists for their last county of employment.the district court granted judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts,and the plaintiffs appeal.
on appeal,the plaintiffs urge us to reconsider the district court decision to exclude as hearsay the testimony of kathleen danner that she had been told that voter records were pulled for certain personnel decisions.gunville and oakley also contend that they have produced sufficient evidence to create an issue of material fact regarding whether they were terminated because of their affiliation with the republican party,or their lack of affiliation with the democratic party.finally,they complain that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was violated when idoc interpreted the state personnel rules to place employees on reemployment lists only for the last county of their employment,rather than for all counties in which they had ever been employed,as the prior administration had done.
to make out a prima facie claim for a violation of first amendment rights,public employees must present evidence that their speech was constitutionally protected they suffered a deprivation likely to deter free speech and their speech caused the employer action.george walker,cir fairley andrews,cir the plaintiffs affiliation with the republican party is protected under the first amendment,and they both suffered the loss of their jobs.see rutan republican party of illinois,d the first amendment forbids government officials to discharge public employees solely for not being supporters of the political party in power,unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved citing branti finkel,d.see also powers richards,cir termination of certain government employees because of their political affiliation may violate the first amendment carlson gorecki,cir with limited exceptions,public employees may not be made to suffer adverse employment actions because of their political beliefs nelms modisett,cir dismissals of public employees for reasons of political patronage are violations of the first amendment unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved.the only factor at issue here is whether those layoffs were caused by an improper consideration of their political affiliation.in order to demonstrate that the defendants were motivated by political affiliation in determining which employees to terminate,the plaintiffs must first show that the defendants knew of their association with the republican party.nelms,at.
we begin with the deposition testimony of kathleen danner because,without this evidence,the plaintiffs have virtually no evidence that any of the defendants except for snyder,who was aware of gunville party affiliation knew about their political affiliation,much less any evidence that the defendants were motivated by that affiliation in making layoff decisions.danner testified that,during this same time period,all of the idoc captains and all of the idoc assistant deputy directors were also on the chopping block.she stated that voting records were pulled during the captains layoff.she knew that voting records were obtained for all of the idoc captains but was not aware that they had been pulled for any other employees.she did not know who pulled the records.her testimony on how she learned this information was brief and is worth repeating 
q how did you become aware that voting records had been pulled 
a it came up in a conversation with the captains layoff.
q who told you that 
a underwood.
q did he pull them 
a no,i do believe he had the ability to do that.
q what did underwood say to you in regards to the voting records 
a he told me how many captains were registered republicans versus democrats.
q did you ask him how he knew that 
a i knew he obtained that information from the governor office.
q did he say anything else to you about the voting records 
the district court found that danner testimony about underwood statements was inadmissible hearsay.the court also found that danner statement was irrelevant because it related to a different layoff of idoc because the plaintiffs did not tie underwood claim to any of the defendants here.gunville and oakley now argue that danner testimony was not hearsay.they characterize underwood as a coconspirator of snyder,and contend that danner report of underwood statement falls under the exception of.d e.they also cite galli new jersey meadowlands comm n,cir,in support of their claim that this evidence is both admissible and relevant.
admissibility is the threshold question because a court may consider only admissible evidence in assessing a motion for summary judgment.haywood lucent technologies,cir inadmissible evidence will not overcome a motion for summary judgment.see also bombard fort wayne newspapers,cir evidence relied upon at the summary judgment stage must be competent evidence of a type otherwise admissible at trial.a party may not rely upon inadmissible hearsay to oppose a motion for summary judgment.see logan caterpillar,cir inadmissible hearsay is not enough to preclude summary judgment eisenstadt centel,cir hearsay is inadmissible in summary judgment proceedings to the same extent that it is inadmissible in a trial bombard,at inadmissible hearsay from an affidavit or deposition will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.
when a district court decision to grant summary judgment is premised on an evidentiary finding,we use a combined standard of review.schindler seiler,cir.we review the district court decision that a particular statement is not admissible as hearsay under an abuse of discretion standard.id.but we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.george,at schindler,at.danner deposition testimony was classic hearsay.hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c united states harris,cir.danner claimed to know that voting records were accessed and used because underwood told her so.underwood statement,as repeated by danner,was not made at a trial or hearing,and the plaintiffs seek to use it to prove that voting records were accessed and used to make layoff decisions.thus,danner version of underwood statements is not admissible and will not overcome a motion for summary judgment.see collins seeman,cir affirming district court refusal to consider in its summary judgment decision an investigator summary of unsworn statements eisenstadt,at.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the statement was inadmissible hearsay.
nor are we persuaded that danner statement would be admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule.under fed evid.d e,a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is a statement by a of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.see also united states alviar,cir party seeking admission of statement under rule d e must demonstrate that a conspiracy existed,that the defendant and the declarant were members of the conspiracy,and that the statement sought to be admitted was made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.gunville and oakley argue that there was an implicit plan to eliminate longstanding employees of the former republican administration in order to make room for democrats and supporters of the new governor.brief of appellants,at.according to gunville and oakley,circumstantial evidence shows the appearance of some undocumented conspiracy.id.they posit that underwood and snyder,one of the defendants here,were.in support of this undocumented,implicit conspiracy between underwood and snyder,gunville and oakley offer literally no evidence.they speculate that underwood must have been hired because of his political affiliation because he was not otherwise qualified for his job.snyder initially refused to answer deposition questions based on his fifth amendment privileges,and the plaintiffs assert that unspecified negative inferences may be drawn from that refusal.the plaintiffs fail to note that they never sent snyder a notice for a deposition they assert that both snyder and underwood wished to keep their jobs and therefore had an incentive to comply with the governor wishes.but they fail to cite any admissible evidence to support the existence of a conspiracy.nor do they propose any theory of how underwood statement to danner was in furtherance of that unnamed,unsupported conspiracy.in order to draw an inference in favor of a nonmoving party,there must be some evidence from which to draw the inference.but there is nothing more here than speculation and innuendo.see liu t h machine,cir a party must present more than mere speculation or conjecture to defeat a summary judgment motion.we can not construct this unsupported conspiracy out of a void,and then assume that a particular statement was made in furtherance of that conspiracy.
galli advances the plaintiffs no further in seeking to admit underwood statement.the only similarity between galli and this case is an allegation that public employees were terminated due to party affiliation.galli,at.in support of that claim,galli produced evidence that the vice chair of the defendant commission admitted to her that the commission was letting republicans go because some democrat wants the spot.id.this statement was the admission of a party opponent,admissible under rule d.there was no statement at issue in galli.gunville and oakley have no viable legal theory that would support the admission of danner statement.
oakley concedes that he is unable to prove that any of the defendants knew of his political affiliation.gunville only other evidence that the defendants knew his political affiliation and used it to make layoff decisions is his claim that snyder saw him at republican functions.at most this shows that snyder knew gunville was a republican.as f
