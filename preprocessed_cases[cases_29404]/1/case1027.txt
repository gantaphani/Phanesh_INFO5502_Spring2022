opinion of the court 
claudia moreno garcia claudia and silvia moreno garcia silvia petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of an immigration judge ij rejecting their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.although we find sufficient merit in silvia petition to order a remand,we will deny claudia petition.
claudia was born on october,in guatemala city,guatemala.in late december or early january,claudia illegally entered the united states at san ysidro,california.claudia younger sister silvia was born on april,also in guatemala city.silvia illegally entered the united states at san ysidro in october.
a little over a year after silvia entered the united states,the department of homeland security served claudia and silvia with separate notices to appear,charging removability under the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i.both sisters conceded removability but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,claiming that if they are returned to guatemala,they will be persecuted by valle del sol,a violent gang the guatemalan government allegedly can not control.
although the sisters affidavits and testimony before the ij indicate that their respective problems with valle del sol were distinct,both traced their problems with the gang back to their cousin,hilda marleny sosa del cid hilda.in,shortly after claudia and silvia father died,their mother moved to the united states,leaving her daughters with her sister gloria.hilda,who is one of gloria five children,is roughly the same age as claudia.the sisters living situation with their aunt gloria and cousin hilda was not ideal.gloria withheld the money that claudia and silvia mother sent them from the united states,and hilda was violent and associated with gang members,one of whom,jorge solis mexicanos,became her husband.mexicanos was a career criminal and a leader of valle del sol.
we first consider silvia petition for review because it presents a closer question than claudia petition.in the summer of,hilda used silvia home telephone to help valle del sol assassinate a prominent human rights activist named jose lopez lopez.after the murder was accomplished,hilda told silvia that gang members juan carlos munoz castillo aka topacio and dennis marroquin participated in the crime and warned silvia that she would be killed if she helped the authorities find lopez lopez killers.silvia safety concerns were exacerbated by the fact that she was pregnant at the time and also looking after her younger sister,danay.
on august,the investigation of lopez lopez murder led police to silvia,who refused to cooperate even after several hours of interrogation.at the end of their questioning,the police left,telling silvia they would return the following day.silvia then received a telephone call from an unknown woman who told her that hilda was concerned that silvia would report her to the police.the woman then requested a meeting with silvia in a park.silvia declined the invitation and went to stay with a friend instead.
the following day,silvia met police officers at a church.she and the officers then traveled to a restaurant where they discussed the evidence against her,the fact that a phone call that led to lopez lopez murder came from her house.the police threatened to arrest silvia,but she refused to disclose any information.after leaving the restaurant,however,silvia learned that her house had been ransacked.too frightened to return home,silvia fled to her grandfather house but was turned away because her relatives feared retaliation from hilda.silvia then turned to a lawyer who recommended she leave guatemala city and not tell anyone where she was going,but added that she should call him in a few days.silvia followed the lawyer advice and went to stay with a friend several hours away in the city of escuintla.
when silvia called the lawyer,he told her there was nothing he could do and it was unlikely any lawyer would take her case.he explained that silvia had two options side with the authorities or with valle del sol.that day,silvia contacted officials from guatemala public ministry and arranged a meeting at a restaurant.officers transported her from the restaurant to another building where,for the first time,silvia agreed to give a statement implicating hilda,topacio,and marroquin.in return for her assistance with the prosecution,the public ministry officials agreed to place silvia and her sister danay in witness protection until silvia testified and then relocate them to another country.
while in witness protection,silvia and danay were protected around the clock by armed security teams.in addition,they were moved from hotel to hotel as many as twelve times in three months because of potential security breaches.at various times prior to trial,security personnel were forced to transport silvia and danay in armored cars,strictly control their food,keep them away from windows,and arrange for a special trip to the hospital to address a problem with silvia pregnancy 
silvia claimed that despite these security precautions,hilda threatened her over the phone.silvia also learned that marroquin had evaded trial and disappeared,and that hilda brother,henry sosa,was threatening claudia and her mother in the united states.
silvia appeared in court twice in october.the first time,she did not testify because the defendants,hilda and topacio,were not given proper notice.two weeks later,silvia testified under oath outside the presence of the defendants while wearing a disguise and a bulletproof vest.notwithstanding these precautions,silvia received a phone call from an unknown individual who said that silvia was being watched during her first court appearance and that if she testified,she and danay would be killed.the caller also mentioned that henry sosa knew where her mother and claudia were living in the united states.
a little over a month after silvia testified,she and danay were relocated to mexico,where the guatemalan and mexican governments,along with the united nations and other international organizations,arranged for them to register as refugees.in mexico city,silvia and danay met with representatives from mexico refugee commission,the comision mexicana de ayuda a refugiados comar,as well as two organizations and the united nations.they were taken to a hotel,and guatemalan officials remained in mexico city to assist in their transition.
approximately two months later,in february,silvia and danay were granted refugee status in mexico,which permitted them to remain in the country as long as they renewed their status annually.according to silvia,however,the threats persisted.in the spring of,silvia saw dennis marroquin on the subway.after silvia reported the encounter to comar,she and danay were relocated to guadalajara,mexico,where they were placed in refugee housing.meanwhile,hilda,who was in prison at the time,kept calling.
in september,danay and silvia relationship fractured,and danay left mexico for the united states.silvia claimed that for the rest of her time in mexico,she was discriminated against and treated poorly because of her refugee status,which made it difficult to find a job.consequently,she decided to move to tijuana,mexico,so she could enter the united states.once in the united states,silvia moved to new jersey where she lived with her mother and claudia.
silvia testified before the ij that henry sosa called her in the united states and told her to recant her testimony.silvia refused to do so,and hilda was convicted.silvia also testified that she later saw sosa on the street in new jersey and that he began calling her house,telling her hilda would soon get out of prison and implying that some harm would befall silvia once hilda was released.silvia also testified that hilda has been released from prison and unsuccessfully attempted to enter the united states.
the ij issued an oral decision denying silvia application,finding that she was barred from receiving asylum because she had firmly resettled in mexico before entering the united states.oral decision of the ij
