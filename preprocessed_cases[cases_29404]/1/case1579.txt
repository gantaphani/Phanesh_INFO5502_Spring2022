the el paso independent school district appeals the district court award of attorney fees to under the individuals with disabilities education act.the district court determined that was the prevailing party in his suit against the school district because he had won a judicial order granting him his requested relief the court awarded attorney fees to in the amount of.we assume,without deciding,that was the prevailing party in this litigation.but because rejected a written settlement offer that included all the educational relief that he requested and reasonable attorney fees,we also conclude that unreasonably protracted the resolution of this dispute and vacate the award of attorney fees to.we affirm the dismissal of episd claim for attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
claims to suffer from attention disorder.over the past twelve years,has sought special education and accommodative services from the el paso independent school district episd under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.has been evaluated several times for special education services,admitted to special education programs,and assisted in his education through the provision of accommodative services.
in,was struggling in school,despite receiving accommodative services that included test preparation and study skills assistance.later that year,after failing the texas standardized skills assessment test for the third consecutive year,requested an evaluation for special education services.in response to this request,the school district set up a committee to evaluate academic placement.the committee determined that because was very close to passing the texas standardized skills test,there was no need to either evaluate him for special education or change his current academic placement and accommodative services.
in,after again failed the texas standardized test,requested a full evaluation to determine his eligibility for special education services.in response,episd scheduled a meeting for september,to address request.on september,cancelled the scheduled meeting and,on september,filed a request for a state due process hearing.in that filing,sought an order from the texas education agency hearing officer directing episd to perform a full independent evaluation of provide written notice to parents whenever the district proposed to change status,accommodations,or evaluation report provide notice of procedural safeguards to parents conduct an admissions,review,and dismissal committee ardc meeting and pay reasonable attorney fees.
at the required resolution meeting held on october,episd contended that there was no dispute between the parties because it was willing to provide all requested relief.specifically,episd offered to conduct a full evaluation of within sixty days of the parents consent to evaluate convene an ardc meeting within thirty days from the completion of the evaluation continue to comply with the applicable federal and state laws regarding the provision of prior written notice and procedural safeguards to parents and pay attorney fees.at the meeting,episd asked for a quantification of attorney fees.did not quantify his attorney fees demand and instead asked for an agreed order.episd demurred,contending that an agreed order was not appropriate because there were factual and legal disputes between the parties.then left the meeting.
later that day,episd formalized the offer made at the resolution meeting in a written settlement offer faxed to.the faxed letter included everything offered at the resolution meeting and initially suggested an attorney fee award of.however,episd stated that it remain ed ready to negotiate a private settlement,and in so doing,requested the amount of attorney fees that w ould be necessary to finalize the settlement.rather than continue negotiating,refused episd settlement offer,did not make a,and proceeded to a due process hearing.
at the due process hearing in november,episd reasserted that there was no dispute between the parties because it was willing to grant all requested relief to.as such,episd argued that complaint should be dismissed.notwithstanding this argument,the state hearing officer conducted a hearing on the issues presented in due process complaint.after the hearing,the hearing officer made factual findings and entered judgment in favor of,ordering episd to conduct a full evaluation of 
in april,episd and each filed suit in district court under the idea.in its suit,episd argued that the hearing officer refusal to dismiss complaint was error because the complaint was.as a result,episd urged,subsequent litigation was frivolous,and the court should award episd attorney fees.also sought an award of attorney fees,asserting in his complaint that,based on the state hearing officer ruling,he was the prevailing party.the two suits were subsequently consolidated.
moved for summary judgment on the prevailing party issue in july.the district court held that was justified in rejecting episd settlement offer and continuing his litigation to obtain an enforceable order.as part of this holding,the district court determined that there was a justiciable dispute before the texas hearing officer because episd had not offered an enforceable settlement.specifically,the district court concluded that episd settlement offer would not have been enforceable in either state or federal court,and as such,had an interest in continuing litigation to obtain a judicial order that could be enforced against episd.the district court then held that had prevailed in the litigation by obtaining a judicial order entitling him to all of his requested relief.because the district court determined that litigation was not frivolous,the court also dismissed episd attorney fee claim.
following this prevailing party determination,moved for attorney fees.in response,episd again argued that because had achieved nothing more than was originally offered,the district court should not award attorney fees to.the district court disregarded episd contentions,stating that it had considered those arguments in making its prevailing party determination.instead,the district court granted motion for attorney fees in august and awarded in fees to award that reflected the full amount of work attorney had done.episd now appeals the district court prevailing party and attorney fee decisions.
ii.discussion 
the idea requires that a party be a prevailing party in order to be entitled to attorney fees.see i b i t he court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party.thus,in an action for attorney fees under the idea,the threshold question is whether the party seeking attorney fees is the prevailing party.see jason ex rel.douglas houston indep.sch,cir per curiam.however,a finding that a party is a prevailing party only makes him eligible to receive attorneys fees under the idea it does not automatically entitle him to recover the full amount that he spent on legal representation.id.
prevailing party status 
under the idea,a prevailing party is one that attains a remedy that both alters the legal relationship between the school district and the handicapped child and fosters the purposes of the idea.jason,at.this test follows from texas state teachers association garland independent school district,where the court held that the touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which congress sought to promote in the fee statute,d see also hensley eckerhart,d p laintiffs may be considered prevailing parties if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.
more recently,in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,the supreme court clarified that a prevailing party is one that has obtained a judgment on the merits,a consent decree,or some similar form of judicially sanctioned relief,d.we now join our sister circuits in applying buckhannon in the idea and hold that a litigant must attain some judicial imprimatur on a material alteration of the legal relationship in order to be a prevailing party we have already joined our sister circuits in holding that,after buckhannon,whether a party is a prevailing party is a legal question subject to de novo review.bailey mississippi,cir collecting cases.
episd argues that is not the prevailing party.episd contends that because it offered all requested relief before litigation,attainment of relief did not alter the legal relationship between the parties and did not foster the purposes of the idea in response,points to the fact that both the hearing officer and the district court determined that was entitled to a full evaluation,thereby altering as the district court held the legal relationship between and episd and fostering the purposes of the idea by enabling the provision of an appropriate public education.
as discussed above,the idea provides that i n any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party.i b i i.the idea features a plethora of provisions dealing with attorney fees,several of which contemplate reducing the attorney fee award of a party that ultimately prevails in an administrative or judicial proceeding.for example,a prevailing party that ultimately achieves no more than what was earlier offered in settlement may not recover attorney fees incurred subsequent to the settlement offer.id.i d i similarly,a court may reduce the attorney fees awarded to a prevailing party found to have unreasonably protracted the litigation.id.i f i particularly at issue here is i d i,which provides that a ttorneys fees may not be awarded in any action for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement if the court finds that the relief finally obtained is not more favorable than the offer of settlement.id.i d i emphasis added.in imposing this bar against recovering attorney fees incurred subsequent to the offer of settlement,that provision tacitly assumes that a party may reject such an offer and nevertheless attain prevailing party status the statute permits an award of attorney fees for work performed prior to the written offer of settlement,and prevailing party status is a predicate for any such award.see id.i b i.
several of our sister circuits have addressed provisions of the idea that contemplate reducing attorney fee awards for those parties who reject settlement offers and later obtain no more than what was offered.in so doing,these circuits have recognized that such a party still prevails by obtaining judicially sanctioned relief,notwithstanding the reduced attorney fee award.in lagrange,the seventh circuit addressed argument that the idea,by virtue of its complex array of provisions dealing with attorney fees,fell beyond the scope of buckhannon and that private idea settlements could therefore convey prevailing party status.at.in rejecting that argument,the seventh circuit discussed generally the provisions of the idea that deal with settlement offers and reduction of fees.in this discussion,the seventh circuit noted that if a plaintiff rejects a settlement offer and eventually receives a judicially sanctioned victory that is less beneficial than the settlement offer was,the plaintiff,though being a prevailing party,may not get the fees incurred after the settlement offer.id.at citing i d i.similarly,the circuit and the third circuit,in addressing whether buckhannon applies to the idea,recognized that the idea contemplates reducing fees when a litigant rejects a settlement offer and does not achieve more favorable relief that what was offered,but that the litigant remains the prevailing party.see,alegria ex rel.alegria district of columbia,a parent who refuses a written offer to settle a complaint,and later prevails at an administrative hearing or in court but obtains a result that is not more favorable than the written settlement offer,would still be eligible for an award of attorneys fees for work performed prior to the settlement offer john,at section i d g define situations in which attorney fees awarded to a prevailing party may be prohibited or reduced,when a parent has unjustifiably rejected a settlement offer or when a parent has unreasonably protracted the final resolution.
however,we have held that parties that extend litigation may be denied prevailing party status.in michael ex rel.oralee el paso independent school district,wl,at cir per curiam,an unpublished opinion which is not precedential,see cir,but is nevertheless persuasive,we held that a district court did not clearly err the test in this circuit in determining that michael was not the prevailing party because michael unreasonably withheld consent for an evaluation.id.the facts in michael were substantially similar to the present and the attorney for,mark berry,were both involved,and the end result was that michael also achieved an order entitling him to a full evaluation at the due process there the district court found that michael was not the prevailing party because the results michael achieved through litigation could have been obtained at any time from the school district but for his mother refusal to give consent to the initial assessment.id.we affirmed,stating that we can not say that the district court clearly erred in determining that the purposes of the idea are not fostered by encouraging parents of potentially disabled children to withhold consent to an initial assessment in order to obtain prevailing party status.id.
we need not resolve the issue today whether a party who rejects a settlement offer and obtains from an administrative hearing officer or the district court no more educational benefit than the settlement offered is technically a prevailing party.instead,we assume,without deciding,that is a prevailing party simply because he achieved a judicial order of relief,and we consider only whether rejection of episd settlement offer should affect the amount of attorney fees award.in so doing,we leave for another day the question whether denying prevailing party status in these circumstances might also be appropriate under the idea.
attorney fees 
in considering the parties attorney fees arguments,we examine the award of fees to for work performed after episd written settlement offer the award of fees to for work performed prior to episd written settlement offer and episd claim for attorney fees.
attorney fees offer 
the first question is whether the district court abused its in awarding attorney fees to for work performed after episd written settlement the offer made at the resolution was made the day of the resolution meeting and more than ten days before the administrative proceeding.that question is answered by several provisions of the idea.
the idea envisions that the parties to a dispute should resolve their differences cooperatively.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,d the core of the idea is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.to effectuate this goal,the statute requires that p rior to the opportunity for an impartial due process hearing the local education agency shall convene a meeting with the parents and the relevant members of the educational program t eam f b i.the statute further contemplates resolution without resort to litigation by endorsing settlement agreements in the case that a resolution is reached to resolve the complaint at the resolution meeting described in f b i,the parties shall execute a legally binding agreement that is enforceable in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the united states.id.f b iii ii.
early resolution through settlement is favored under the idea.the statute bars an award of attorney fees for work performed subsequent to a written settlement offer that does not achieve anything more than that which was offered.see supra section ii a discussing i d i.notwithstanding that bar,a court may award attorney fees to a parent who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer.i e.
settlement enforceability 
because it is undisputed that did not achieve any educational benefits beyond what episd offered,the question is whether was substantially justified in rejecting episd settlement offer.the district court held that episd settlement offer would not have been enforceable if it had been reduced to an agreement.specifically,the district court determined that a private settlement would have lacked the judicial imprimatur required to be enforceable in federal court.further,the district court determined that texas had not waived its immunity from suit in state court for the type of settlement offered by episd,and accordingly,episd settlement offer would not have been enforceable in state court.the district court,after determining that would not have been able to enforce the settlement in either federal or state court,concluded that had an interest in continuing litigation to obtain an enforceable order of relief,and declined to reduce attorney fee award.with respect,we disagree.
the idea states that district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this section without regard to the amount in controversy.i a see also d.the statute further contemplates that,if the parties are able to resolve their dispute at the resolution meeting,they should execute a legally binding agreement that is enforceable in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the united states.f b iii ii see also d.pretermitting any discussion of whether could have enforced a settlement agreement against episd in state court,we determine that a settlement agreement reached at the resolution meeting would have been enforceable in federal court.
courts have recognized that federal courts can enforce idea settlement agreements reached at a resolution meeting.in ex rel.central school district,the second circuit considered whether an agreement between the parties reached outside a resolution meeting or mediation was enforceable in federal court,wl,at cir,summary order.there,filed a due process complaint seeking greater educational services in november.ex rel.cent.sch,d.the parties then met at the required resolution meeting later that november,but they were unable to reach an agreement.id.however,in may,before any administrative hearing had occurred,the parties entered into a written settlement agreement that resolved their dispute.id.
in june,the school district created a new educational plan for that reduced the level of services provided to,and,in response,again made a due process request,seeking more services and enforcement of the may settlement agreement.id.at the due process hearing,the hearing officer,despite considering the substance of educational claims,declined to exercise jurisdiction over the may settlement agreement,and the state review officer concurred on appeal.id.as a party aggrieved by the decisions of the hearing officer and the state review officer,filed suit in federal district court.the district court concluded,among other things,that the hearing officer erred in determining that he had no authority to enforce the settlement agreement,and the court accordingly remanded to the hearing officer for a new hearing.id.at.the school district then appealed the district court order to the second circuit.
on appeal,the second circuit vacated the district court remand order,wl,at.in its opinion,the second circuit considered w hether the district court had federal question jurisdiction to enforce the may settlement agreement.id.at.the court stated that while c ontract enforcement is generally a question of state law,congress has expressly provided for enforcement of idea settlement agreements in federal district courts when the agreement at issue was entered into at a resolution session required by f b.id.emphasis added.however,because the may settlement agreement was not entered into either at the resolution meeting or through mediation,the second circuit remanded the case to the district court to determine whether there wa s a jurisdictional basis for considering plaintiff contract claim.id.
district courts across the country have also recognized that idea settlement agreements reached at a resolution meeting are enforceable in federal court.see.bd.of elementary secondary,d,stating that an agreement reached at a resolution meeting would have been enforceable in federal court ex rel.burlingame sch,no.c,wl,at.june,the court also notes that the idea permits settlement agreements reached through a resolution session under f to be enforceable in federal courts traverse bay area intermediate sch.dist.dep t of,wl,at.july,w ritten settlement agreements reached during the mediation process or in a resolution session which comply with the idea requirements are now enforceable in state and federal courts.bowman district of columbia,wl,at,recognizing that a district court has jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement reached either at the resolution meeting or during mediation 
here,episd offered all of his requested educational relief at the resolution meeting.we conclude that if had accepted episd offer,he could have enforced the resulting settlement agreement in federal court as such,there was no need for to reject episd settlement offer and continue litigation solely to obtain an enforceable order of relief.
ii.substantially justified settlement rejection 
given that did not need to continue litigation to obtain an enforceable agreement covering all requested relief,we conclude that was not substantially justified in rejecting episd settlement offer.see i e.further,own filings indicate that he recognized that a settlement agreement made at the resolution meeting was enforceable 
because was not substantially justified in rejecting episd settlement offer,i d applies and prohibits an attorney fees award for work performed subsequent to the time of episd written settlement offer.see shelly ex rel.shelbie venus indep.sch,cir recognizing that the idea bars an award of attorney fees for work performed subsequent to a settlement offer of all requested relief duane,at same.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to for work performed subsequent to episd written settlement offer.
attorney fees for offer work 
the next question is whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees for work performed during and prior to the resolution meeting.we determine that the district court abused its discretion because was not entitled to an award of attorney fees for such work.
fees for participating in the resolution meeting 
the idea allows an attorney fees award for work performed in any action or proceeding.i b i.however,the idea specifically excludes resolution meetings from the scope of that definition.i d iii a resolution meeting shall not be considered a meeting convened as a result of an administrative hearing or judicial action or an administrative hearing or judicial action.see also c iii.accordingly,can not be awarded attorney fees for work performed at the resolution meeting,and the district court below abused its discretion in awarding fees for work performed at that meeting.see,ex rel.davis district of columbia,d,it is undisputed that attorneys fees for time actually spent at a resolution session generally are not compensable under the idea.ex rel.thomas seattle sch.dist,no,wl,at,plaintiff s may not be awarded fees associated with participating in resolution sessions.
ii.fees for work performed prior to the resolution meeting 
finally,we review whether is entitled to attorney fees for work his attorney performed prior to the resolution meeting.the idea states that a court shall reduce fees whenever the court finds that the parent,or the parent attorney unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy.i f i as such,we must determine whether rejection of episd settlement offer unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy such that a further reduction in the fee award is warranted 
as discussed above,when a party rejects an offer of settlement and later achieves at an administrative or judicial proceeding no more than what was previously offered,a court may,but is not required to,award reasonable attorney fees for work
