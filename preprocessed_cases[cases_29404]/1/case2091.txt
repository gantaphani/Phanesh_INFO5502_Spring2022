background 
jones is an female who was years old at the commencement of this suit.jones was hired by on february,to work in its facility in indianapolis,indiana.jones initial position was program director.on january,jones transferred positions,becoming a scheduler.on september,jones transferred positions again,becoming a human resources representative.
jones claimed that her job responsibilities increased substantially with each of these transfers and that,at the time,she considered both moves promotions.however,jones compensation did not increase.jones points to several caucasian employees who did receive pay increases upon being transferred to positions with greater responsibilities.jones,after taking on added job responsibilities,requested a pay increase from mcfall,the executive director of the indianapolis facility but mcfall refused.
jones claimed that when mcfall was executive director,caucasian employees in the human resources department were treated more favorably than employees.jones was required to submit a request pto to receive time off whereas,employees took paid vacation time without being required to submit a pto.mcfall also denied jones request for tuition reimbursement for a course she took in managing business information systems,despite having approved tuition reimbursement requests from employees.
before mcfall became executive director at the indianapolis facility in april,he was executive director of facility in sheridan,indiana.when mcfall left sheridan to come to indianapolis,jones applied for the sheridan executive director position.of the four applicants for the position,jones was the only.as part of the application process,jones interviewed with mcfall.jones claimed that,rather than engage in substantive discussions about the job,mcfall made several comments suggesting that jones would not be a good fit for the sheridan position because of her race.jones was not hired for the sheridan position.
in november,jones applied for the position of director of human resources at the indianapolis facility.jones had acted as interim director of human resources on two prior occasions and had received training for the position from the outgoing director.mcfall conducted what jones calls a interview with jones but hired a caucasian,janice neefe,for the position.
around june,the position of director of supported living became vacant.jones claimed to have told mcfall that she was interested in the position.mcfall allegedly made it clear to jones that she would not be hired for the position because she was not on his team.mcfall hired a caucasian individual for the position.
on august,jones filed her first charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.jones cited,among other alleged instances of discrimination on the basis of race,the failure to promote jones to human resources director and disparate treatment with respect to tuition reimbursement.
on september,neefe gave jones a written memorandum stating that if jones varied her schedule by more than fifteen minutes per day,she was required to confirm the requested variation with neefe.neefe took this action because jones unauthorized schedule variations vastly exceeded those of any other employee that neefe supervised.
in,jones requested time off for her wedding and honeymoon.jones indicated that she would need two weeks off at some point in late september to but that she did not know the exact dates due to the uncertainty of her fianc√© schedule.the request was approved by neefe.jones took the time off but because of changes to her husband military schedule,jones arrived back at work three days early.neefe considered jones early return a violation of neefe instruction that jones could not vary her schedule by more than fifteen minutes per day.as a result of her early return,jones received a corrective action.
in may,conducted an internal investigation of the indianapolis facility employees due to allegations of embezzlement.during the investigation,mcfall learned that jones had signed for some employee lunches that had been improperly charged to.during the investigation,jones and four other employees were suspended without pay.one of the five was terminated and the others,including jones,returned to work.
during her deposition in this case,dawna peterson,director of human resources at the time of the investigation,testified that in july or august of,mcfall called jones either a rat or a fink.in november,mcfall told another employee that jones was untrustworthy.
jones filed this suit against on june.jones subsequently filed a second charge of discrimination with the eeoc in november,alleging that the corrective action arising from the august incident was in retaliation for jones filing the initial eeoc charge.plaintiff was granted leave to file an amended complaint,adding allegations set out in her november eeoc charge.

jones title vii claim 
the district court concluded that all of jones title vii claims,except her retaliation claim,were barred due to jones failure to either timely file with the eeoc or to include those claims in her eeoc charge.the district court held that because jones did not file an eeoc complaint until august,any claims for unlawful activity that occurred before february,days prior to the date of filing the eeoc charge,were.other than the retaliation claim,this left only jones claim for failure to promote her to the director of supported living position in june and the denial of tuition reimbursement in november.because neither of those claims was presented to the eeoc,the district court held that they were barred.on appeal,jones argues that her claims should be allowed to proceed under either the doctrine of continuing violation or the doctrine of equitable tolling.jones also argues that her claim regarding the director of supported living position was reasonably related to the claims made in her eeoc charge such that it should not be procedurally barred.
jones first argues that the alleged discriminatory acts that occurred prior to february,should be actionable under the continuing violation doctrine.however,while jones offers a brief discussion of that doctrine,she fails to specify how it applies to this case.here,the discriminatory actions alleged are all discrete acts jones has not argued to the contrary.see turner,at distinguishing between discrete acts of discrimination and claims.in such cases,the law precludes recovery for those discrete acts that occur outside the relevant statute of limitations,here,days.see id.citing national railroad passenger morgan,u,morgan.thus,jones first attempt to resurrect her claims fails.
jones next argues that those claims should be saved by equitable tolling.equitable tolling may only extend a deadline when despite all due diligence,a plaintiff can not obtain the information necessary to realize that he may possibly have a claim.beamon marshall ilsley trust,cir.again,jones presents no argument as to how the facts of this case meet the applicable standard.the two claims jones attempts to save through equitable tolling are decisions not to hire jones for either the executive director position in sheridan or the human resources director position.with respect to the sheridan position in,jones alleges that mcfall,in interviewing jones for the position,avoided substantive questions about the position and instead made several comments implying that jones race made the sheridan position a bad fit for her.given mcfall comments,jones should have been aware of the possibility that she had a claim.the sa
