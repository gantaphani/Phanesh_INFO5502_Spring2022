standard of review 
the court review is limited to the decision of the bia because it did not adopt the decision and order of the ij.hazime,cir judicial review is specifically limited to the decision of the bia.
if,as the bia held,the petitioner is removable for having committed a cimt,then the court generally lacks jurisdiction to review his deportation order.see ina a c,a c,cir.
an alien is inadmissible if he has been convicted of a cimt,or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.see ina a a i i.we generally accord chevron deference to the bia decisions construing ambiguous statutory terms in the ina,and we must uphold the bia construction unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d singh gonzales,cir ali mukasey,cir the bia interpretation of the term cimt is entitled to chevron deference,cert.denied,d.however,we review de novo whether the elements of a federal crime fit the bia definition of a cimt.smalley ashcroft,cir.
petitioner convictions were for cimt 
the dispositive question in this case is whether the petitioner crimes necessarily involved moral turpitude,and therefore properly serve as the basis for his removability.the exact definition of moral turpitude has never been fully settled,but it refers generally to conduct that is inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.singh holder,cir quoting matter of,bia.moral turpitude has been defined as an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong or malum in se,so it is the nature of the act itself and not the statutory prohibition of it which renders a crime one of moral turpitude.see matter of ajami,bia.among the tests to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.id.
any crime which involves intent to defraud as one of its elements is a cimt.squires,cir.in ascertaining whether a crime is a cimt,
we must first examine the statute itself to determine whether the inherent nature of the crime involves moral turpitude.if the statute defines a crime in which moral turpitude necessarily inheres,then the conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude for immigration purposes,and our analysis ends.however,if the statute contains some offenses which involve moral turpitude and others which do not,it is to be treated as a divisible statute,and we look to the record of conviction,meaning the indictment,plea,verdict,and sentence,to determine the offense of which the respondent was convicted.
