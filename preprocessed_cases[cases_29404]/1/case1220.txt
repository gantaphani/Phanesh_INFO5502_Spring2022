opinion of the court 
david levine and triple j partners collectively levine petition for review of the decision of the securities and exchange commission sec sustaining the determination of the new york stock exchange nyse that they had violated a of the securities exchange act of hereinafter exchange act and sec rule a as well as various other sec and nyse rules,and the nyse imposition of sanctions for those violations we deny the petition.
factual background and procedural history 
although many issues have been raised in this appeal we discuss only the issue of and therefore only the facts relating to levine alleged violation of a of the exchange act,a,and its implementing regulation,sec rule a,a,as we discern nothing to add to the sec treatment of the other issues and certainly nothing that would cause us to question the sec rulings.
at the time of the events at issue in this case to,david levine was a lessee member of the nyse,a organization registered under the exchange act.levine was also the principal of triple j partners triple j,a partnership also a member of the nyse.levine was at this time an independent floor broker,commonly referred to as a broker,for every shares traded through him a commission of was charged.
one of levine customers while he was a broker was tribeca capital corporation tribeca.tribeca principal,timothy barry,had been a friend of levine since the late.tribeca also was a public customer of the oscar gruss sons oscar gruss clearing firm.
instead of placing orders for securities with levine by first going through oscar gruss,as public customers like tribeca must,barry for tribeca placed orders directly with levine for shares of putnam intermediate government trust pgt.the nyse floor specialist who handled pgt was william shanahan,who levine testified was one of his best friends.shanahan allowed levine to circumvent nyse procedures for placing orders in pgt.among other things,shanahan at times allocated more stock to tribeca than the volume that was indicated on the order list levine gave shanahan for pgt for a particular trading day.the nyse investigator who conducted the investigation into levine conduct testified before the nyse that oscar gruss and thus tribeca had the bulk of the transactions in pgt for the sample period that he reviewed.the investigator also testified that he did not think it was necessary to conduct a analysis of tribeca trades in pgt because,due to the way the trades were made which he described as buying at a low price and selling at the next available high price,there was no way that there could have been a loss.
levine claimed that he had a negotiated rate arrangement with tribeca.according to him,such an arrangement meant that a customer could pay its broker whatever the customer wanted.levine,however,also testified that he initially charged tribeca a commission of per shares traded for it and that the rate later increased to per shares when tribeca switched from oscar gruss to a different clearing firm.
from february to august,levine received several overpayments from tribeca.for example,in february,he received from it in payment even though,if levine had been paid at his per shares rate,he would have been entitled to only about in commissions.on the other hand,after shanahan was removed from his position as a nyse floor specialist,there was a period september to january during which levine was paid nothing by tribeca even though he was entitled to about in commissions.the net,however,was that,from january to february,tribeca paid levine about more than he was entitled if paid at his claimed billing rates.
levine testified that tribeca was not the only customer that paid him whatever it wanted or that missed payments.he explained that when customers missed payments,it was usually because their money was tied up.he also speculated that when barry on behalf of tribeca sent him large overpayments,it was to make up for previous months when tribeca had been unable to pay him.
during this time period,levine introduced robert miller,another independent broker,to barry and the tribeca account.miller testified before the nyse that levine told him he could make a lot of money with the account.miller stated that he made trade executions for barry and thus tribeca every month during the relevant period but that he was not paid every month.according to miller,he did not question barry about this.he stated that he had lost tribeca money and guessed that this was the reason he was not paid.
miller received in payment from tribeca in july and testified that he was amazed at its size.when he asked levine what he had done to deserve such a payment,levine kind of laughed,and then he said,i told you that if you did the right thing,he barry would pay you off.later,in september or october of that year,miller had another conversation with levine concerning a large payment from oscar gruss.miller testified that levine explained to him that tribeca was paying miller up to percent of what miller earned and that if miller wanted the payment in cash,the amount would be reduced to only percent of what miller earned for tribeca.
the nyse expert witness,joseph cangemi,testified that payments to independent brokers are generally consistent and that brokers do not usually receive payments in excess of their bills.he also testified that,although customers do occasionally miss payments,there is never a period where you get nothing consistently.cangemi reviewed the charts reflecting tribeca payments to levine and opined that there was no correlation between the payments and the work levine was doing for tribeca.cangemi noted that levine was being overpaid by tribeca by up to percent in some months.
in june,the nyse brought charges against levine and triple j based on their conduct between january and february.the nyse hearing panel held thirteen days of hearings and unanimously found them guilty on all charges.the hearing panel also imposed sanctions on them,including a suspension from membership in the nyse and a fine of.
levine and triple j asked the nyse board of directors to review the hearing panel decision.the board considered the record and written submissions by the parties and held oral argument.it summarily affirmed the decisions of the hearing panel in all respects.levine and triple j then appealed to the sec.
the sec undertook an independent review of the record.it sustained the nyse determination that levine and triple j violated the exchange act,sec rules,and nyse rules,as well as the sanctions imposed by the nyse.they now petition for review of that decision.
