central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund,and howard mcdougall,trustee collectively,the fund appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to international comfort products,llc icp with respect to the fund claims for withdrawal liability under the multiemployer pension plan amendments act mppaa or the act,et,and for breach of contract.we affirm as to the latter claim.the principal question presented as to the former is whether an entity need be contractually obligated to contribute to a pension fund,as opposed to obligated under applicable relations law,in order to be an employer for purposes of the mppaa.relying upon authority from other circuits,the district court held that the obligation must be contractual.we respectfully disagree with that authority,and thus vacate and remand as to the mppaa claim.
icp is a delaware corporation that,during the period relevant to this case,manufactured heating and cooling products at a facility in lewisburg,tennessee.we refer to icp predecessor entities also as icp.in,icp entered into an agreement with top transportation services,top,under which top agreed to provide icp with truck drivers for its lewisburg operations.under the agreement,top paid the drivers salaries and benefits,and then sought reimbursement for those costs,among others,from icp.accordingly,the relevant version of the in the agreement provided that,on a weekly basis,top shall bill icp its actual costs and expenses of operations hereunder such costs and expenses shall include,but not be limited to,direct wages,salary payments,payroll taxes and necessary fringe benefits,insurance and administration applicable to the operations.agreement.
the agreement also provided that top will handle all labor relations and the negotiating of union contracts and shall enter into any and all labor contracts covering the drivers who are its drivers and are in the service of icp.id.per that provision,top,but not icp,was a signatory to collective bargaining agreements with local union of the international brotherhood of teamsters.those agreements required top to make contributions to the is a multiemployer pension plan as defined by the employment retirement income security act erisa,on behalf of the drivers.during all periods relevant here,top invoiced icp for top contributions to the fund,and icp then reimbursed top those amounts.
in february,icp terminated its agreement with top,which in turn ceased all operations the following month.that cessation triggered withdrawal liability under the mppaa,which the fund assessed to be in the principal amount of.in letters dated april,the fund demanded payment of the assessment from both top and icp.top never paid the was by then a defunct it did invoice icp for the assessment amount.icp paid neither the assessment nor the invoice.
the fund sued top in may and obtained a default judgment for the assessment amount that july.top never paid the default judgment.in february,however,top executed an assignment of its rights under the agreement to the fund.the fund thereafter brought this action against icp,asserting that icp owed withdrawal liability under the mppaa and that icp breached its agreement with whose shoes the fund purported to it failed to pay top invoice for the assessment amount.the district court eventually granted summary judgment to icp with respect to all of the fund claims.
this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court decision granting summary judgment.mcmullen meijer,cir.
we turn first to the fund claim under the mppaa.congress passed the mppaa as an amendment to erisa in order to protect pension plans from the financial burdens that result when one employer withdraws from a plan without first funding uncovered liabilities of the plan attributable to the employer.carriers container council,mobile,l longshoreman ass n,cir.the fund asserts its claim against icp under a of the act,which provides if an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan in a complete withdrawal or a partial withdrawal,then the employer is liable to the plan in the amount determined under this part to be the withdrawal liability.only an employer,therefore,can be subject to withdrawal liability under the mppaa.
the mppaa does not itself contain a definition of the word employer,carriers,at,which has made the task of constructing one unavoidable for the courts.all of the circuits to have addressed the issue,however,agree upon a common definition.that definition is drawn from title i of erisa,id.at,whose definitions do not apply elsewhere in the act of their own force,but may otherwise reflect the meaning of the terms defined as used in other titles.nachman pension benefit guar,d.title i of erisa defines employer as any person acting directly as an employer,or indirectly in the interest of an employer,in relation to an employee benefit plan.adapting that definition to the mppaa context,four circuits have held that the term employer,for purposes of the act,means a person who is obligated to contribute to a plan either as a direct employer or in the interest of an employer of the plan participants.korea shipping new york shipping ass l longshoremen ass pension trust fund,cir emphasis added see also carriers,at same seaway port auth.of duluth ila marine ass restated pension plan,cir same central states,and areas pension fund central transport,cir same.
this definition furthers the act purposes by prevent ing a contributor to a plan from withdrawing its support without covering its share of unfunded liabilities.carriers,at.the definition is also consistent with the structure of the title i definition of employer.the title i definition is different in kind from the common law definition,which looks for direct relationships,direct supervision,direct payment.id.under title i,the focus is instead upon the entity relation to an employee benefit plan.emphasis added.and we agree that the relevant relation,for purposes of determining withdrawal liability under the mppaa,is whether the entity had an obligation to contribute to the plan in the first place.like the other circuits,therefore,we hold that the contributing obligor definition drawn from title i applies to the term employer in section a.carriers,at.
although we now have a definition of employer,we still must determine what that definition means.seaway,at.and there we respectfully part company with several of our sister circuits.the ninth circuit has held,without explanation or citation to authority,that t he word employer describes one who was a signatory employer with respect to the plan.elliott,carpenters pension trust fund for california,cir emphasis added.the other two circuits to have addressed the seventh and the their holdings back to the eighth circuit holding in seaway.there,the court surveyed the fact patterns in five cases applying the definition of employer,and found one fact common to all of the parties held subject to withdrawal liability they were contractually bound to make pension contributions,either in collective bargaining agreements,general cargo agreements,or shipping association agreements.seaway,at emphasis in original.thus,applying the relevant case law,the court held that the entity at issue there was not an mppaa employer because it had not signed any contracts explicitly obligating it to make pension contributions.id.
the eighth circuit reiterated its position in a case factually similar to this one,namely rheem central states and areas pension fund,cir.there,the court cited the one fact common passage from seaway,and proceeded directly to hold the nature of the obligation to contribute establishing an entity as an employer for mppaa purposes,therefore,is contractual,and the party who is signatory to a contract creating the obligation to contribute is the employer for purposes of establishing withdrawal liability.id.at emphasis added.the seventh circuit applied that same rule a year any analysis of its merits,or even expressly adopting central transport,at.the seventh circuit thereafter expressly adopted that again without analysis of its transpersonnel,roadway express,cir.thus,in the seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits,an
