opinion of the court 
sarah boone challenges the social security commissioner determination that she is not disabled and therefore not entitled to supplemental security income ssi disability benefits.she makes several arguments,each of which pertains to the administrative law judge alj determination that she can perform work that exists in significant numbers in the regional or national economy we agree with boone that the record lacks substantial evidence that she can perform such work and,thus,is not disabled.we therefore reverse and remand.
background 
boone applied in november for ssi disability benefits under title xvi of the social security act,alleging disability due to back and leg disorders,carpal tunnel syndrome,and high blood pressure.to show disability for purposes of ssi,a claimant must demonstrate that she lacks the ability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.a a.the alj found that boone suffers from severe impairments but,as noted above,that she is not disabled because there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that she can perform.
boone was years old at the alleged onset date of her disability in november.she has an eleventh grade education and,although she has not worked since,has past experience as an office cleaner as well as a meat weigher and wrapper.
after she was involved in a bus accident in the,boone underwent back surgery.she has sought assistance from pain specialists since that time.the alj found that she has a continuing back disorder caused by degenerative disc disease,spinal stenosis,a disc bulge,and left leg radiculopathy,and that she suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome and right knee pain the alj therefore concluded that boone is severely impaired.
looking to the effect of boone impairments,the alj found that she can not perform her past work as an office cleaner or meat weigher and wrapper,but that she does retain the capacity to perform a range of light level work.in particular,she can stand,walk,and sit for six hours out of an day.any employment must,however,permit her to sit and stand at will every thirty minutes.she can lift and carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently.she has no limitations in pushing or pulling,but must not be required to perform repetitive hand activity.only occasionally can she climb,balance,kneel,stoop,crouch,or crawl.
on the basis of the physical limitations identified by the alj and considering boone age,education,and unskilled work history,a vocational expert ve testified that boone has the ability to work as an inventory clerk,a home health aide,or a sales counter clerk.according to the ve,there are inventory clerk jobs in the regional economy and such jobs in the national economy there are home health aide jobs regionally and nationally and sales counter clerk jobs exist regionally and nationally.the alj concluded that these occupations represent a significant number of jobs existing in the national economy and,accordingly,that boone is not disabled.
after the appeals council denied her request for review,boone timely appealed to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the parties filed for summary judgment.a magistrate judge recommended granting the commissioner motion for summary judgment,which the court did on june.boone timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and g.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the commissioner but may reverse only if the alj findings were not supported by substantial evidence.burns barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance but more than a scintilla it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.id.
a process is used to determine disability for ssi benefits eligibility,see,but in this case only step five is in dispute at the fifth step,the commissioner bears the burden of proving that,considering the claimant residual functional capacity age,education,and past work experience,she can perform work that exists in significant numbers in the regional or national economy.d a see also bowen yuckert,d sykes apfel,cir.
vocational expert testimony 
at the fifth step of the evaluation process,the alj often seeks advisory testimony from a vocational expert.in addition,the alj will generally consult the dictionary of occupational titles dot,a publication of the united states department of labor that contains descriptions of the requirements for thousands of jobs that exist in the national economy,in order to determine whether any jobs exist that a claimant can perform.burns,at see also id.at the social security administration has taken administrative notice of the reliability of the job information contained in the dot.citing d.boone argues for reversal of the alj determination on the grounds that the ve testimony that boone can work as an inventory clerk,a home health aide,and a sales counter clerk conflicts with the dot and that neither the ve nor the alj addressed the conflict.while we do not adopt a general rule that an unexplained conflict between a ve testimony and the dot necessarily requires reversal,we do conclude that the ve testimony in this case is not substantial evidence 
in response to the alj hypothetical question as to the availability of jobs for an individual with boone residual functional capacity,age,and experience,the ve testified 
there would be some jobs that this individual could perform given the limitations that have been outlined in the hypothetical,and i going to have to think about this a bit.but i think that i would look at the following positions the first job that i,i would identify as appropriate would be an inventory clerk.i be glad to give any of those definitions through explanations of these jobs.there very little,if any,use i mean there very little use of the hands,and it certainly not provide sic bimanual repetitive activities.and they in a region,there about of those jobs.in the nation,there.the job that i,that i was i thinking about,but i think still would be appropriate and this is what i hesitating about,would be a home health aid sic at the light exertional level.it would be of those jobs in the region and nationally.a third job that i would look at as a possibility would be i kind of going over in my mind the number of positions,but i want to make sure they kind of fit.what i looking for,i think,is an unskilled,sales counter clerk,which there are about in the region and nationally.
we consider first the three occupations identified by the ve as suitable for boone.the dot classifies the occupation inventory clerk in the medium exertional level with a specific vocational preparation svp of dot.occupations with an svp of or are.because the alj found that boone can do only a limited range of light,unskilled work not medium or work she can not perform the job of inventory clerk as it is described in the dot.
likewise,the dot describes a home health aide job as falling in the medium exertional level and with an svp of dot.the ve specified that boone could work as a home health aid e at the light exertional level.on,boone counsel asked the ve about the extent of lifting required of a home health aide.she replied 
one of the things that i think you have to look at when you talk about a home health aid e is,is that there are various levels of,of care needed that are provided to the elderly or the disabled.some people need a lot of physical care and need to be able to transfer it,need to be able to do heavy lifting.there are some people that for instance,that might have slight problems and just need help with their a little bit of help with their adl to act as a companion.and that at that exertional level,it fairly light 
although the ve did recognize that boone can not perform all home health aide jobs,it is unclear whether the numbers that the ve had earlier provided regionally and nationally included the medium exertional level jobs in the home health aide occupation.we also lack any basis to conclude that the ve discounted the semiskilled jobs,which boone can not perform,from the number of jobs identified.
finally,although the dot does not include an entry for sales counter clerk,it does list sales clerk and sales attendant positions.a sales clerk has an svp of,a semiskilled occupation and therefore inappropriate for boone.dot.although sales attendant is an unskilled occupation with a light exertional level,according to the companion volume to the dot special characteristics of occupations,the job involves frequent reaching,handling,and fingering,which boone limitation on repetitive hand activities may preclude.moreover,the sales attendant position would not seem to accommodate boone need to be able to sit or stand at will,but instead likely requires standing or walking throughout the shift id.
thus,according to the dot,boone can not perform any of the occupations identified by the ve.neither the ve nor the alj in his opinion acknowledged the conflict between the ve testimony and the dot or explained why the ve testimony should be relied on despite the conflict 
in burns,we addressed the import of an unexplained conflict between ve testimony and the dot.we recognized that there is a split among circuit courts,with several holding that an alj may base his conclusions on a vocational expert testimony that conflicts with the dot,id.at,one requiring the alj always to prefer the dot over the testimony of a vocational expert,and others adopting a middle view in which the alj must explain any decision to prefer the testimony of a vocational expert over the dot.id.we did not,however,need to choose among the various alternative options to resolve a conflict between ve testimony and the dot because we remanded on other grounds.id.at although the individualized analysis that the middle course represents seems to be the most sensible of the options,we again do not hold that the failure of an alj prior to the enactment of ssr to discover and explain a conflict necessarily requires reversal.
we are further troubled,however,by the hesitation with which the ve identified the three possible occupations for boone.see sias sec y of health human,cir i f the expert is unable to testify without qualification about the jobs a claimant can perform,the alj may not rely on his opinion.hall bowen,cir interpreting an earlier sixth circuit case as holding in favor of the claimant because of the failure of the vocational expert to testify without qualification that jobs which the plaintiff could perform actually existed in the economy.citing graves sec y of health,welfare,cir.here,the ve testified 
there would be some jobs that this individual could perform given the limitations that have been outlined in the hypothetical,and i going to have to think about this a bit.but i think that i would look at the following positions 
emphases added.discussing the home health aide occupation,the ve stated 
the job that i,that i was i thinking about,but i think still would be appropriate and this is what i hesitating about,would be a home health aid sic at the light exertional level.
emphasis added.and regarding the sales counter clerk,she said 
a third job that i would look at as a possibility would be i kind of going over in my mind the number of positions,but i want to make sure they kind of fit.what i looking for,i think an unskilled,sales counter clerk,which there are about in the region and nationally.
emphasis added.
given this hesitation,the conflict between the ve testimony and the dot which worked to boone disadvantage as to each occupation identified by the ve,and the failure of the ve and the alj to acknowledge much less explain the conflict,we conclude that the ve testimony does not by itself provide substantial evidence of a significant number of jobs in the economy that boone can perform.we must consider,however,whether the record otherwise contains such evidence.
erosion of the occupational base 
there is no dispute that,because of her age,limited education,and unskilled work experience,boone is disabled if she has the physical ability to do only sedentary work.see pt,subpt.p,app,g individuals approaching advanced age age may be significantly limited in vocational adaptability if they are restricted to sedentary work.when such individuals can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work and have no transferable skills,a finding of disabled ordinarily obtains.the parties also agree that boone is not disabled if she can perform the full range of light work.see id.her residual functional capacity does not,however,fall neatly into either category.rather,as noted above,the alj found that boone can do a limited range of light work.
boone asserts that the alj committed per se reversible error by failing to specify how limited the range of light work that she can perform is and by not addressing whether she is also limited in the range of sedentary work that she can do.social security ruling directs that if the claimant residual functional capacity does not coincide with any of the established categories,the alj will consider the extent of any erosion of the occupational base and assess its significance.id thus,boone argument,in the language of ssr,is that the alj should have assessed the extent of the erosion of the occupational base for both the sedentary and light work that she can perform.
ssr further states,however,that where difficult judgments are involved in the categorization of a claimant work ability,ve assistance is advisable.id.the ruling so advises because a ve can provide a more individualized analysis as to what jobs the claimant can and can not perform than does a determination of the claimant remaining occupational base.id consequently,we shall not interpret ssr to mandate reversal whenever the alj does not set out specific findings concerning the erosion of the occupational base if,as here,the alj has received the assistance of a ve in considering the more precise question whether there are a significant number of jobs in the economy that the claimant can perform.at the same time,however,the absence of those findings means that we are hindered in considering whether substantial evidence supports the alj ultimate determination that boone is not disabled.
the commissioner contends,however,that,because the alj found that boone can do a limited range of light work,she can perform the unskilled sedentary occupations,see pt,subpt,app,a,and the approximately unskilled light level occupations,see id.a,that exist in the national economy.
we can not agree.ssr makes clear that if a person must alternate periods of sitting and standing,as boone must have the option to do,she is not functionally capable of doing either the prolonged sitting contemplated in the definition of sedentary work and for the relatively few light jobs which are performed primarily in a seated position or the prolonged standing or walking contemplated for most light work.id.thus,the requirement,found by the alj,that boone employment allow her the option to sit or stand at will every thirty minutes precludes her from performing the prolonged sitting contemplated in the definition of sedentary work as well as most light work.id.moreover,u nskilled types of jobs are particularly structured so that a person can not ordinarily sit or stand at will.id.there are some jobs in the national economy typically professional and managerial ones in which a person can sit or stand with a degree of choice.the sedentary and light jobs that boone physically can perform are,therefore,likely to require a higher degree of skill than she is capable of performing.see also d if the claimant is closely approaching advanced age age,the commissioner will consider that her age along with a severe impairment s and limited work experience may seriously affect her ability to adjust to other work.moreover,boone inability to perform repetitive hand movements will further limit the number of unskilled sedentary jobs she can perform.see ssr b ilateral manual dexterity is necessary for the performance of substantially all unskilled sedentary occupations.
given that ssr suggests that boone can not perform most sedentary or light jobs because of her need to have the
