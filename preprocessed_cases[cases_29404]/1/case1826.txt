background 
zhao,a citizen of the people republic of china,illegally entered the united states in february.on january,almost eight years after zhao arrival,the department of homeland security initiated proceedings against zhao to remove him to his native china,citing the violation of a a i,which requires aliens entering the united states to be admitted or paroled.an alien who is present in the united states without being properly admitted or paroled is inadmissible as a citizen.
on february,zhao filed an application for withholding of removal under b a.this provision prohibits the attorney general from removing an alien if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see ka gonzales,cir.zhao application for withholding of removal under b a was based specifically on a fear of persecution arising from his opposition to china coercive family planning policies after his wife forced abortion 
zhao also applied for withholding under the cat.see c.according to this provision,an applicant is eligible for withholding of removal if he can show it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.zhao claimed fear of torture based on the same explanation in question one his opposition to his wife forced abortion.
summary of zhao application for withholding under the act and the cat 
according to zhao,his wife,qing yang,was born on october.they met when they were seventeen years old and fell in love.he describes having a traditional marriage on july,without civil registration with the consent of his father.his wife became pregnant five months later,in december of that year.zhao stated that,according to previous china family planning policy,you have to be or older to have a baby,and they were not old enough to obtain birth permission in early february,the government officer knows sic this news.they come to my house to take my wife away.we had a big fight.i tried to stop them to touch my wife,so they pushed and hit me.zhao continues by saying he could not stop them from taking his wife to the local hospital where she was forced to take an abortion.he reports that he was detained in the police department for a month because he did not agree with the action the chinese government took against his wife forcing her to have the abortion.he was fined rmb for release 
zhao describes that his wife was depressed for a long time after she lost her baby and wanted to stay with her mother.zhao felt helpless,hopeless and angry.he recounts further that,one day,when he was walking down the street he happened to see the officer who took his wife away.he describes that,i was thinking about my baby and my poor wife and i ca help myself i caught the officer and hit him a couple of times and run sic away.he states that he then went to his house to see his wife and right after he arrived,his dad called and told him that the police officer came to my house to try to arrest me,so my father told me do come back,run as far as possible.since then,zhao reports on his application,we are in government not decent citizen list.we had no future in china.i was running around in my relatives houses for about sic year.zhao describes that he then found a snakehead through a friend of mine and left his country in february he reports entering the united states los angeles in february without his wife.zhao application concludes that if he returned to china,he fears he would be tortured,harmed or mistreated,specifically,by being jailed by the chinese government.
summary of zhao testimony at his removal hearing 
zhao removal hearing occurred on march,thirteen months after completing the application.zhao testimony was inconsistent with his application on several key points.
first,he testified that the individuals from the family planning center came for his wife to force her to have the abortion on december.second,zhao testified that when he encountered the family planning official on the street he hit him once and my friend push me away,take me away.third,he testified that a female cousin called him at his house to warn him that police had come to arrest him.fourth,he testified that in the year between the february confrontation with the officer when he left home and february when he came to the united states,he went to guangzhou and shenzhen.he testified that he had stayed with friends in those cities,and had no relatives in hong kong or singapore.he then testified that he came to the from hong kong where he had been sightseeing,but later testified that he came to the from singapore.fifth,zhao failed to testify on direct or that he was put on a not decent citizen list as stated on his application.
additionally,zhao testified that since coming to the united states he married a woman who was in the process of obtaining her green card.at the hearing,he told the ij that this woman was three months pregnant.
zhao provided no corroborating evidence at the hearing.zhao testified that he sent an affidavit from his father to his attorney long ago,but at the hearing only provided a letter,untranslated from his native chinese,to the ij.he also testified that he did not obtain an affidavit from his cousin because it did not get to my mind at that time.he had no proof of his marriage in china or of the abortion.
findings of the immigration judge 
in her findings and conclusions,the immigration judge explained in great detail the role of the ij in the credibility determination,the importance of credibility to the applicant burden of proof,and her analysis of the evidence before her.
the ij elaborated that the credibility of the respondent was of extreme importance in assessing his clams for relief and protection.citing in re,i n bia,she stated,before determining whether the applicant meets the statutory criteria required for withholding of removal under the immigration and naturalization act and withholding under the convention against torture,this court must make a threshold determination of the alien credibility.citing in re dass,i n,bia,she explained that the applicant testimony could be sufficient as the sole evidence in support of a claim for relief and protection where it was believable,consistent and sufficiently detailed in light of general conditions in the home country to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis of the alleged fear.although the lack of corroborating evidence is not necessarily fatal,the ij explained,quoting in re,i n bia,the applicant had an affirmative duty to corroborate his claim to the degree he could or otherwise reasonably explain the failure to do so.zhao did neither.
the ij wrote a page analysis supporting her finding that zhao was not credible.in arriving at her conclusion,she considered the rationality,internal consistency and inherent persuasiveness of the respondent testimony compared to his written application for relief and found it was not believable or consistent his failure to provide corroborating evidence,and found it was not reasonable and zhao explanations for the inconsistencies and failure to provide corroboration,and did not find them convincing.she found that these inconsistencies went to the heart of zhao claims.
the ij also explained that,even had she found zhao credible,she would have denied his application on the merits.specifically,the ij set forth in an additional seven page analysis that zhao could not meet his burden of proof with his general and meager testimony china had changed country conditions making it safe for him to return,as set forth in a department of state country report on human rights practices zhao could not show fear of persecution in his native fujian province since the profile of asylum claims and country conditions the profile cited only isolated cases of forced abortions and sterilizations there in the early zhao claim that he would encounter difficulties due to the child conceived in the was too tenuous since,according to the profile,couples occasionally seek asylum based on a claimed fear that an unauthorized child already born in the united states or one that has been conceived here would prompt difficulties in china but there is no known policy as to such instances zhao claimed fear from having no idea what local government would do to him and that he had nothing left in china was vague and zhao fear,after striking the family planning official,was of prosecution for a criminal offense rather than persecution for political beliefs.further undercutting the merits of zhao claim,the ij found evidence,based on zhao testimony of unrestricted sightseeing in hong kong,that he could relocate within china without fear of persecution.
in conclusion,the ij stated,
the respondent has not been back to china,if you believe his testimony,for more than ten years.this court can not,on this record,determine that anyone would seek to target the respondent based upon any past persecution that he claims he suffered as a result of his wife undergoing the first forced abortion and his resistence to that or any fear of future persecution arising out of any fear he has due to this attack on this police officer.
based on the foregoing,the ij den ied the respondent applications for withholding under the act and the torture convention on the merits.
findings of the board of immigration appeals 
zhao appealed the ij decision,asserting first that she erred by basing her adverse credibility finding on purported inconsistencies and omissions in the record when his testimony did not preclude the possibility that he had suffered from physical harm by the chinese officials.next,zhao argued that the ij violated his due process rights by failing to articulate any legal standards upon which she based her credibility determination.finally,zhao asserted that the ij decision to deny relief based on adverse credibility was erroneous.
using a clear error standard,the bia reviewed the ij factual determinations and accepted her finding that zhao was not credible.citing sylla ins,cir holding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by specific reasons,the bia concluded that the ij decision was based on conspicuous,inadequately explained discrepancies in the respondent testimony,and between his testimony and his withholding application and statement the bia next rejected zhao assertion that the ij failed to base her findings on applicable legal standards.finally,given zhao lack of credibility,the bia affirmed the ij,finding no error in the immigration judge decision denying his application for removal.
like the ij,the bia found that,even if credible,zhao could not advance a claim for withholding of removal based on a fear that an unauthorized child conceived or born in the united states would prompt difficulties in china.citing in re,i n bia concluding that the chinese government did not have a national policy forcing sterilization of parents returning with a second child born outside of china,the bia determined that zhao could not claim that he feared persecution for a child conceived with his new wife because it would really be his first child and would not violate china policy.
the bia also based its opinion in part on an issue not raised by the ij.noting that the ij properly concluded that zhao and qing were not legally married,the bia determined that respondent was ineligible for withholding on the basis of his girlfriend alleged coerced abortion.relying on in re,i n,at bia holding that an alien can establish fear of persecution based on spouse forced abortion,the bia ruled that zhao could not assert qing forced abortion as a basis of fear of persecution because she was not his spouse 
the bia noted that zhao also requested withholding of removal under the cat.the bia determined,however,that zhao failed to provide substantial evidence that he was tortured in the past in china or that any government official would torture him upon return.thus,the bia also denied zhao request for withholding of removal under the cat.
the bia dismissed zhao appeal on august.zhao now appeals the bia decision.
ii.law and analysis 
withholding of removal under the act and the cat 
to establish a claim for withholding of removal under section b b of the act,an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened in the country directed for removal on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ins stevic,d.see also footnote,supra.a person who has been forced to abort a child,undergo sterilization,or who has been persecuted for refusal to undergo such a procedure shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.a in re,i n bia.
this court has elected to revise its initial opinion,now published at cir,because the government has asked us to incorporate the attorney general opinion in in re,i n bia,a case that overrules any per se grant of asylum to applicants whose spouses have been subject to forced abortion or forced sterilization.our acknowledgement of the attorney general opinion does not alter the substance,rationale,or ruling on the issues presented for review.
in re instructs the bia and ij to cease applying the rule,articulated in in re,i n bia en banc,and in re,i n bia en banc,that applicants whose spouses have been forced to undergo abortion or sterilization are per se deemed to have been persecuted for the purposes of establishing refugee status the attorney general held 
t he board and immigration judges shall cease to apply the per se rule of spousal eligibility articulated in and and shall instead engage in a assessment of whether a section a applicant who has not physically undergone a forced abortion or sterilization procedure can demonstrate that i he or she qualifies as a refugee under section a on account of persecution for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program ii he or she has a fear of being forced to undergo an abortion or involuntary sterilization procedure or of being persecuted for failing or refusing to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program iii the specific facts of his or her case justify asylum on grounds other than those articulated in section a or iv he or she satisfies the requirements for derivative asylum expressly set forth in section b a of the act.
in re,i n at.
to establish eligibility for relief under the cat,the applicant must show he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.see footnote,supra.
standard of review 
when the bia adopts the ij reasoning and supplements the ij opinion,that opinion,as supplemented by the bia,becomes the basis for review.ka gonzales,cir citing singh ashcroft,cir this court reviews any legal conclusions de novo and factual findings and credibility determinations for substantial evidence.id.the court of appeals directly reviews the decision of the ij while considering the additional comment made by the bia.mapouya gonzales,cir.
although this court reviews the bia legal conclusions de novo,it must defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of the ina.koulibaly mukasey,cir quoting patel gonzales,cir.factual findings are reviewed under a substantial evidence standard in which we uphold a bia determination as long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.quoting marku ashcroft,cir mapouya gonzales,cir.under this deferential standard,the court may not reverse the board determin
