this case has been here once before.in our earlier decision,we enforced an order of the national labor relations board the board,which had found that aluminum casting engineering company,or the company violated the national labor relations act nlra when,in,it deviated from its established practice of awarding annual,wage increases to all employees because of their attempts to unionize.see nlrb aluminum casting eng g,cir uew i.in uew i,we enforced the board order requiring to m ake whole all employees who were not granted annual wage increases in to date.id.at emphasis omitted.we noted,however,that should be given the opportunity to prove that it would not have awarded an wage increase in and the following years.id.at.
after a investigation,the administrative law judge alj determined that a wage increase had been withheld unlawfully from the employees in.the alj further determined that liability for this wage increase was limited to,and,consequently,was not required to build this additional cents per hour into its employees wages for and the following years.a majority of a panel of the board agreed it reasoned that carrying forward the wage increase into and the following years would result in a windfall for the employees and would be inconsistent with the remedial purposes of the national labor relations act,stat,as amended,et.second supplemental decision and order,nlrb,slip op.at.therefore was ordered only to award back pay to employees for the hours they worked in the board did not,however,require to build this wage increase into each employee base wage.
in this petition for review,united electrical,radio machine workers of america uew maintains that the board back pay award should have been incorporated into the employees base wage for that year,so that all subsequent pay raises would be added to a base wage that included this pay increase.in short,they submit that,beginning in,the employees base wage should have been equal to the wage rate they actually received in plus an additional cents per hour any additional wage increases they received in and beyond should have been added to that adjusted base wage.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we believe that the uew is correct.accordingly,we grant the petition for review,set aside the decision of the board and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a detailed discussion of the factual background of this case may be found in our prior opinion,uew i,at.for the convenience of the reader,we shall repeat here the key details of compensation practices that are necessary for an understanding of this phase of the litigation.
in,announced that its hourly employees would receive a wage increase,effective february,and would later receive an additional wage increase,effective august.these wage increases,which were based on rises in the cost of living in the milwaukee area,the company performance and the wages offered by comparable companies,became a permanent addition to the employees wages.consequently,these wage increases were added to the employees existing wage rates and resulted in a new base wage.raises in subsequent years were added to this base wage.
in,wage increases again were implemented.these increases,like the increases,became a permanent addition to the employees wages.although no wage increase was given in,the pattern of awarding wage increases continued in,and each of these wage increases became a permanent part of the employees wages,resulting in a new base wage.
no wage increase was awarded in.claimed that,in that year,it had abandoned wage increases in favor of a new,merit and compensation system.the board found,however,that,at least in,merit and wage increases were ancillary to,and not substitutes for,the wage increases.the board also determined that failure to award wage increases in was in retaliation for the employees organizational activities and that therefore had violated sections a and a of the nlra.id.at.we sustained these determinations.see id.at.
after a subsequent proceeding,the board determined that,in,had abandoned the use of wage increases and had adopted a program that awarded wage increases based on merit and the completion of training programs.therefore,reasoned the board,the company was not obligated to award additional wage increases in or in subsequent years.moreover,ruled the majority of the board panel,the new wage increases that were added in and the following years should be added to the employees actual wage rates,which were not adjusted to include the wage increase wrongfully denied to the workers in that year.the dissenting member of the board took the view that,although the company was permitted to change prospectively the manner in which it awarded wage increases after,it must build those later increases on the adjusted base wage of the worker as of the end of,a methodology that would incorporate the wrongfully denied wage increase into the employees wages.

given this standard of review,we must begin our analysis with a careful,respectful study of the board opinion and the position that it takes in the brief that it has filed before us.in the board view,the company must award compensatory back pay for its violation of the act only for the hours actually worked by its employees in.the evidence shows,the board continues,that the company switched from a policy of increases to a policy of merit and increases in.therefore,it reasons,the wage increase need not be included in the base wage to which the merit increases are added.it relies heavily on our statement in uew i that should be permitted to demonstrate that it had abjured raises which would suffice to excuse from making any adjustments for,and it would also establish this new baseline for future years as well.uew i,at.
in reaching this conclusion,the board undertook a detailed factual analysis and determined that lawfully had created a new compensation system in.it assumed that,in,the company allocated all of the funds available for wage increases to merit and wage increases under the new compensation system.in the board view,the decision to award only increases constituted a new compensation system that was not based on a baseline for bargaining unit labor costs that incorporated a increase in.second supplemental decision and order,nlrb,slip op.at.in essence,the board assumed that the compensation system would have been altered if the company had made increases in.to support this view,the board reasoned that,if had issued an wage increase in,it necessarily would have had less money available for merit and wage increases in,and the amounts of those new wage increases necessarily would have been decreased as a result.see respondent br.after the merit increases,therefore,each employee had been restored,as closely as possible,to the economic position in which he would have been absent misconduct.
uew,agreeing with the dissenting board member,submits that the board misconstrued our language in uew i and also failed to resolve any ambiguities against the wrongdoer.according to uew,our statement in the underlying case if introduced evidence that it had abjured raises forever not only would that suffice to excuse from making any adjustments for,but it would establish this new baseline for future years as well was intended to relieve from making additional wage increases in and the following years,if the board determined that the company had,in fact,abandoned that compensation structure.it did not,however,excuse from the obligation of permanently incorporating the wage increase into its employees base wages and adding any increases in and the following years,however determined,to that base.to support this view,uew notes that,based on past practice,it is clear that any increase awarded in would have been permanently incorporated into the employees wages in subsequent years.furthermore,uew submits,to the extent that there is any ambiguity as to whether the back pay award should be permanently incorporated into the employees wages,that ambiguity is attributable solely to unlawful conduct and not the implementation of a new compensation program thus,it concludes,the board should have resolved any ambiguities in favor of the employees and permanently incorporated the increase into the employees wage rates.see campbell,nlrb,nlrb noting that remedies should restore employees to the position they would have obtained absent the unfair labor practice,and indicating that any ambiguity regarding the status that would have been obtained without the unlawful conduct must be resolved against the wrongdoer.
central to the board determination was its reading of a passage of our opinion.the board focused on our statement that,if could show that it had abandoned increases,it would be excused from making any adjustments for,and it would also establish this new baseline for future years as well.uew i,at.the board read this statement to mean that,if could demonstrate that it had abandoned the use of increases in,it could add any wage increases in and the following years to a baseline that reflected what actually was paid to the employees,exclusive of the wrongfully withheld wage increase.second supplemental decision and order,nlrb,slip op.at.
we can not accept the board reading of our earlier opinion.in uew i,we addressed the company claim that the board original order was so broad that the company would be obliged to award annual wage increases in and in each of the following years.in reply to that argument,we simply held that,once the workers were made whole for the violation of the act in,the board original order should not be construed as requiring the company to continue to grant additional increases in subsequent years if,in any of those years,it had decided to institute another,lawful system.in short,it was our understanding that the board order required the company to make the employees whole for the violation that had occurred.once the company had done so,it was free to implement any system that it chose,so long as that new wage system complied with the act.our point was that the board did not have before it the question of any wage increases for the years following.the board order expressly did not bind to a perpetual practice of granting wage increases.id.at.therefore,we determined,if could demonstrate that general wage increases are passé and it has found a better way to maintain competitive wage levels the order does no more than require payment of the increase.id.
this interpretation of our prior opinion is logical,given the limited issue under discussion in uew i whether the board order impermissibly required to award increases for and each of the following years.id.at.just as importantly,it is the only interpretation that is compatible with the law governing remedial measures under the act.the board must make workers whole for losses suffered on account of an unfair labor practice under the act.phelps dodge nlrb.more specifically,in awarding back pay,the board must attempt to recreate the relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice.franks bowman transp,d citation and quotation marks omitted.
the board contends that,in instituting the merit increase policy,in effect addressed,albeit indirectly,its remedial obligations because it lawfully allocated the money actually available to it for wage increases solely to merit and training raises,without consideration of an increase.respondent br.the board assumes that had only a limited pool of funds available for wage increases in,and that,had implemented an increase in,the size of that the size of the wage have decreased by an amount equal to the amount of funds allocated in the increase.therefore,the board concludes,employees received the same wage rate in as they would have received if had awarded both the wage increase and the reduced wage increases.accordingly,the board maintains that its remedy is appropriately tailored to fulfilling its remedial obligation for the violation.
we can not accept this argument.at the outset,the record simply does not support the board conclusion that,had the company not violated the act in and instead paid the expected wage increase in that year,the pool of funds available for the merit and program necessarily would have been reduced by the amount paid out as a result of the increase.the record is indeed vague on the total amount of funds available for distribution in,the total amount of raises actually awarded in,and methodology for awarding the wage increases offered in that year.in fact,when a compliance officer requested that provide documentation relating to its decision to abandon the compensation system in favor of an alternative reward system,was unable to provide any minutes or documents reflecting the reasoning behind its decision.see ex at,statement of compliance officer gifford.
more importantly,even if the pool of funds available for the increases had included the amount of money that otherwise would have been distributed had the company awarded an wage increase in,it is not clear that those funds would have been distributed in a manner that would have placed each wronged worker in the position he would have been in had the wage increase been awarded.the board points to no evidence that the company wage increases took this consideration into account.indeed,the parties seem to agree that,when it implemented the wage increases,the company simply ascertained the base wage of the employee,excluding the wrongfully withheld increase,and added to that amount whatever wage increase it deemed appropriate under its new method.
in the same vein,the board also submits that,if the wronged workers had received the wage increase wrongfully withheld in,they well might not have received the merit increases that were distributed in.this argument is speculative,and,contrary to the board suggestion,the wronged workers should not have to bear the burden of any ambiguity in this respect.after all,the ambiguity is the result of the company illegal withholding of the increase.therefore the company,not the individual worker,must bear any loss from the lack of available evidence.because it violated the law,the company did not compute correctly the base wage of each worker because it violated the law,the company is not in a position to show whether the pool of funds available for the merit increases included all of the money that it would have distributed in had it acted legally because it violated the law,the company is unable to show whether,in and subsequent years,every wronged employee received a wage increase equal to the raise wrongfully denied him in and the amount that would have been awarded him under the merit and program.the company,not the workers,must bear any loss for the company illegal activity.
conclusion 
the board interpretation of our earlier opinion is erroneous.its factual conclusions are unsupported by the evidence in the record.therefore,because the board remedial order is based on an error of law and an unsubstantiated finding of fact,we must grant uew petition for review and set aside the board order.accordingly,we grant the petition for review,set aside the board order and remand the case to the board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
