maryland general hospital mgh appeals from the district court order upholding the decision of the secretary of health and human services to deny mgh a new provider exemption to the medicare program caps on reimbursement for routine service costs.see e we vacate the district court order and remand with instructions for the court to enter judgment in favor of mgh.
under the medicare program,skilled nursing facilities snfs are entitled to reimbursement from the federal government for the reasonable costs of providing services to medicare patients.see u,v a west supp.there are,of course,numerous exceptions to and limitations on that reimbursement,including certain caps imposed on the reimbursement for routine service costs.see a west supp.congress,however,has expressly authorized the secretary to establish appropriate exemptions and adjustments to these limits on routine costs.see c west supp.one such exemption established by the secretary is the exemption for new providers of skilled nursing services,which allows higher reimbursement rates for the first two years of operation.see e.the new provider exemption thus allow s a provider to recoup the higher costs normally resulting from low occupancy rates and costs during the time it takes to build its patient population.paragon health network,thompson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the establishment and operation of skilled nursing facilities and other health care facilities in maryland,as in most states,requires navigation through a complex maze of statutes and regulations.but for purposes of this case,it suffices to say that a certificate of need is required for the operation of a skilled nursing facility,and the certificate of need limits the number of beds that the facility may operate.under certain circumstances,however,facilities in maryland have the right to put as many as additional beds into operation,without acquiring a new certificate of need.see,health ii f,h,h i supp.these additional beds are generally referred to as waiver beds.see brief of appellant at.
in,mgh established the transitional care center,a skilled nursing facility.prior to that time,mgh had not operated such a facility.to get the transitional care center up and running,mgh purchased from three skilled nursing facilities the right to operate beds.the facilities from which mgh purchased the bed rights were not connected or related to mgh in any way.the contracts between mgh and the selling facilities anticipated that the beds being sold to mgh would be operational is,beds that were in use by the selling facilities and authorized by their certificates of need.but when the maryland health resources planning commission approved the transaction,it characterized the transaction as involving the transfer of waiver beds rather than operational beds.
mgh thereafter applied for the new provider exemption.after going through several layers of review within the department of health and human services,mgh request was denied.mgh then sought review of the secretary decision by the district court.see f west supp providing for judicial review of final reimbursement decisions by the secretary.on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the secretary decision was based upon a reasonable interpretation of section e.the court therefore denied mgh motion and granted the secretary motion.this appeal followed.
the medicare act specifies that judicial review of reimbursement decisions is to be governed by the familiar standards of the administrative procedure act.see f.under the apa,a court must hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a west.when the question before the court is whether an agency has properly interpreted and applied its own regulation,the reviewing court must give the agency interpretation substantial deference.thomas jefferson shalala,d.but d eference,of course,does not mean blind obedience,garvey ntsb,and no deference is due if the agency interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,thomas jefferson,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the new provider exemption is fairly straightforward.it provides that 
e xemptions from the limits imposed under this section may be granted to a new provider.a new provider is a provider of inpatient services that has operated as the type of provider or the equivalent for which it is certified for medicare,under present and previous ownership,for less than full years 
e.section e does not define provider,but the structure and wording of the regulation suggest that the provider is the business entity or institution providing the skilled nursing services.this reading is consistent with the meaning attached to a similar term in another part of the medicare act.see u defining provider of services as a hospital,critical access hospital,skilled nursing facility,comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility,home health agency,or hospice program.this reading of the regulation is also supported by the explanation of the new provider exemption contained in the version of medicare provider reimbursement manual prm in effect at the time mgh purchased the beds 
a new provider is an institution that has operated in the manner for which it is certified in the program or the equivalent thereof under present and previous ownership for less than full years.for example,an institution that has been furnishing only custodial care to patients for full years prior to its becoming certified as a hospital furnishing covered services to medicare beneficiaries,shall be considered a new provider for full years from the effective date of certification.however,if an institution had been furnishing hospital health care services for full years prior to its certification,it shall only be considered a new provider in its third full year of operation,which is its first full year of participation in the program.
although a complete change in the operation of the institution,as illustrated above,shall affect whether and how long a provider shall be considered a new provider,changes of the institution ownership or geographic location do not in themselves alter the type of health care furnished and shall not be considered in the determination of the length of operation.
prm emphasis added.these repeated references to an institution indicate that application of the new provider exemption depends upon the ownership and operation of the business entity that is providing the skilled nursing services.there is no dispute that neither mgh nor any previous owner of mgh had provided inpatient skilled nursing services before the transitional care center was established.thus,it would appear that mgh meets the requirements for a new provider as set forth in e.
the secretary,however,insists that mgh is not a new provider because the waiver beds were previously owned by unrelated skilled nursing facilities that had been operating for more than three years.according to the secretary,mgh transitional care center 
was created by purchasing the right to operate nursing home beds formerly held by three existing snfs.thus,a change of ownership of these beds created the transitional care center.under the secretary rules,one must look to whether the past owner of these beds operated as a snf for three or more years there is no dispute that each of the prior owners of these beds operated as an snf for more than three years.therefore,mgh does not qualify for an exemption to the cost limits.
brief of appellee at internal quotation marks omitted.
we find this argument to be rather remarkable.section e quite plainly focuses on the newness of the provider institution itself,a reading with which the secretary purports to agree.see brief of appellee at stating that when determining whether the new provider exemption is applicable,the secretary looks at the operation of the institution under both past and present ownership as required by the regulation emphasis added.when applying the exemption in this case,however,the secretary has not focused on the newness of the institution providing the services,but has instead focused on the newness of one particular asset of that institution.such an approach could be sustained only if section e were ambiguous and the secretary interpretation reasonable.see martin occupational safety health comm n,d in situations in which the meaning of regulatory language is not free from doubt,the reviewing court should give effect to the agency interpretation so long as it is reasonable.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the secretary points to paragon health network,thompson,cir,in which the seventh circuit found the term provider as used in section e to be ambiguous.in that case,paragon health network,opened a new skilled nursing facility and transferred the rights to operate beds from another skilled nursing facility.the seventh circuit concluded that provider was ambiguous as used in section e because it might sometimes be difficult to determine when certain internal changes to an institution would be enough to give rise to a new provider 
i f a facility fires all its staff and hires a new one,but makes no other changes,an ordinary user of the english language probably would consider the snf with the new staff to be the same provider as it was before.similarly,a snf that replaced all of its old equipment with new models would still be the same provider as it was before the modernization.even if a snf both fired its staff and replaced all of its equipment,one might still call it the same provider if the administration and physical plant remained the same.of course,if all the various things that make up a snf were new in the sense that they had not been part of another facility,then one would have to call that snf a new provider.conversely,if a nursing facility did not change any of its aspects,it would unquestionably continue to be the same provider rather than a new one.the difficulty in drawing a line between these two extremes is what makes the word provider ambiguous as used in the regulation.
paragon,at.because it found provider to be ambiguous,the court found reasonable the secretary denial of the new provider exemption based on the transfer of the beds.see id.at.
in our view,the court approach in paragon is problematic.first,the fact that it might be difficult to draw a statutorily created line in a case with unusual facts does not mean that ordinary terms used in the statute suddenly become ambiguous.moreover,as the district court observed in ashtabula county medical center thompson,d,the difficulties that the seventh circuit believed its hypotheticals illustrated largely do not exist when provider is understood to mean the institution or facility providing the services 
focusing on the nature of the word provider,the very series of hypotheticals posed by the seventh circuit leads to the conclusion that that term is unambiguous.the first three scenarios posited by the court are examples of one institution taking certain actions that fail to create any new institution,and the court sensibly concluded that these actions would not result in the creation of a new provider a facility fires all its staff and hires a new one a snf replaces all of its old equipment a snf both fires all its staff and replaces its old equipment,but retains the same administration and physical plant.in each of these examples,some institution a facility or a snf changes even its characteristics,but remains in existence as that same institution,without giving rise to any new institution.in the court final hypothetical,however,all the various things that make up a snf are new,and the court rightly concluded that such a scenario would evidence the creation of a new provider.in this case,the seventh circuit described not just one facility that changes certain of its characteristics but ultimately remains the same institution rather the court put forth a scenario involving a second,distinct entity where all the various things that make up a snf are new.perhaps the old institution is gone,and perhaps not,but that is of little consequence.the question is whether a second,new new provider has come into existence,and in the court final hypothetical,one clearly has.
ashtabula,d at.because the seventh circuit effectively found provider to be ambiguous by ignoring the ordinary meaning of that term,we find the court analysis to be unpersuasive.
notwithstanding the absence of a definition of provider,we simply can not conclude that section e is ambiguous.given the ordinary meaning of the word provider and the manner in which it is used in the regulation,section e can only be understood as focusing on the business institution that is providing the skilled nursing services.if that institution,whether under its current or prior ownership,has operated as a skilled nursing facility for more than three years,then it is not entitled to the new provider exemption.if that institution under current or prior ownership has not previously operated as a skilled nursing facility,then it is entitled to the new provider exemption,even if the institution has purchased some of its assets from skilled nursing facilities that have operated for more than three years.see ashtabula,d at concluding that the term provider refers to the institution applying for the exemption not merely to its intangible characteristics or attributes and holding that a newly created facility was entitled to the new provider exemption notwithstanding the institution purchase of certificate of need rights from an unrelated snf.because mgh under any ownership had not previously operated a skilled nursing facility when it applied for the exemption,we conclude that mgh qualifies as a new provider under section e 
in sum,we conclude that provider as used in section e unambiguously refers to the business institution providing the skilled nursing services.it therefore follows that the regulation permits consideration of the institution past and current ownership,but not the past and current ownership of a particular asset of that institution.the secretary interpretation,however,equates the ownership of an institution providing skilled nursing services with the ownership of a particular asset of that institution.since there is no language in the regulation that would permit the denial of the exemption because an asset of the new institution was previously owned by an unrelated snf,the secretary interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation and can not be allowed to stand see gardebring jenkins,d explaining that a reviewing court should be hesitant to substitute an alternative reading for the secretary reading of his own regulation unless that alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language see also a requiring a reviewing court to set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions that are not in accordance with law.
the secretary focus on the ownership of the beds may well be reasonable when considered against the realities of the skilled nursing industry.for example,the secretary might reasonably believe that the new provider exemption should be applicable only when a new facility increases the options available to the community it serves by increasing the number of beds actually in use in that community.and we realize that,as is implicit in the secretary argument,the right to operate beds is perhaps the most important part of a skilled nursing facility,so that the transfer of beds takes on special significance.
nonetheless,while the reasonableness of an agency interpretation of a regulation is important if the regulation is ambiguous,an interpretation that is inconsistent with the plain language of an unambiguous regulation can not be upheld simply because the interpretation,standing alone,seems reasonable enough.if section e fails to adequately address the considerations the secretary believes important when determining whether the new provider exemption should be applied in any given case,then the secretary should amend the regulation he can not reach the desired result by interpreting the regulation in a way wholly unconnected to the regulation plain language.
in this case,the secretary interpretation is altogether
