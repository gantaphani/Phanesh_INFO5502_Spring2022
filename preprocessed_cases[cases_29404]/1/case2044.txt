with this opinion,the court reviews the national labor relations board the board november,order and decision by which the board asks this court to enforce the order it issued against respondent,v s schuler engineering,company or schuler engineering in that decision,the board found that the company violated sections a and a of the national labor relations act,as amended,et the act or nlra by refusing the request of intervenor united steelworkers of america,afl the union to bargain and furnish information.
schuler engineering has refused to recognize the union as the representative of the employees,alleging that the board improperly granted its certification of the union as the collective bargaining representative.regarding its claim that the board wrongly certified the union in the underlying certification case schuler engineering first says the board wrongly ordered a second election after finding the first election invalid.the board found the first election invalid because of a company prohibition against posting union material on the employee bulletin board and a solicitation of grievances by the company president.second,schuler engineering alleges that the board erred when it certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative after denying,without hearing,the company objections to the second election.in objecting to the second election,the company argued that an altered sample ballot,an employee conduct,and a supervisor allegedly conduct warranted a new election.
because we find that substantial evidence supports the board election certification and its finding that schuler engineering violated the act by failing to bargain in good faith,we certify the board order requiring the company to bargain collectively with the union.
background 
schuler engineering is an ohio corporation with an office and place of business in canton,ohio,where it fabricates steel products.
on february,the union filed a petition with the board seeking certification as the representative of the production and maintenance employees at the canton facility.after the parties agreed on the terms of an election,the board conducted a election on march.the union lost the election by one vote,with twenty employees voting against union representation and nineteen voting in favor of union representation.
the union objected.among its objections,the union contended that the company surveilled,harassed,and discriminated against union supporters.more important for purposes of this appeal,the union argued that the company interfered with the rights of employees to collectively bargain by both adopting a rule prohibiting the posting of union literature on the employee bulletin board and by the company president soliciting grievances to discourage support for the union.
after affording a hearing on the objections,the board rejected the union challenge to certain ballots and surveillance,harassment and discrimination claims.in a july,decision,the board,however,set aside the election and ordered a new vote because the company improperly prohibited union literature on the employee bulletin board and solicited grievances 
on september,the board conducted a second election.the union won the election,with employees voting in favor of union representation and fourteen voting against it on september,the company filed objections to the election.seeking to stop certification,the company alleged that the union improperly disseminated an altered sample ballot,that a union supporter openly campaigned in the voting area,and that a supervisor who supported the union interfered with the employees rights.after reviewing the company objections,the regional director recommended overruling the objections without a hearing and certifying the union to represent the bargaining unit.
the company excepted to the regional director recommendation.on december,the board overruled the company objections to the second election and certified the union as the employees representative.
after being certified as the representative for collective bargaining purposes,the union solicited negotiations with the company regarding terms and conditions of employment.the company refused to negotiate and the union filed an unfair labor practice charge.the board regional director issued a complaint alleging that the company refused to bargain and provide requested information in violation of section a and of the act a and.the company admitted its refusal to bargain and provide information,but defended against the complaint on the ground that the union was improperly certified.
rejecting this defense,the board found the company had engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce by refusing to bargain and provide information,in violation of section a and of the act.
discussion 
schuler engineering acknowledges it refused to bargain or provide information but argues that it had no duty to bargain because the board improperly certified the union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative in support of this argument,schuler engineering first says the board wrongly set aside the first election,an election the union lost by one vote,because of the company misconduct.second,schuler engineering says the board erred when it rejected,without hearing,the company objections to the second election,an election the company lost by a wide margin with of voters asking for union representation.
standard of review

board review of original election 
on march,the board held a election at schuler engineering.the union challenged certain ballots and objected to the election,arguing that the company had surveilled,harassed and discriminated against union supporters promulgated a rule prohibiting the posting of union literature on the employee bulletin board and solicited grievances to discourage support for the union.
after an investigation,the board regional director ordered a hearing on the union objection to the election.after the may,hearing,the hearing officer recommended rejecting the union objection based upon surveillance,harassment and discrimination but recommended that the board set aside the election because the company solicited grievances and prohibited union literature on the employee bulletin board.after company exceptions to the recommendation were denied,the board adopted the hearing officer findings and recommendation.
on september,the board conducted the second election.the employees voted to fourteen in favor of union representation two ballots were challenged,a number insufficient to affect the outcome.

the board found the company interfered with a fair election in two regards.first,the board found that the company interfered with a fair election by restricting union supporters access to a company bulletin board and by soliciting grievances.
restriction of employees use of the bulletin board 
schuler engineering had long maintained a bulletin board in the time clock area for its exclusive use.in late,the company installed a second bulletin board in the employees lunchroom for exclusive use by employees.employees used the bulletin board to place notices of car sales,church notices,and other informal postings.explaining the limits on postings on the employee board,the company of operations said the only restriction on postings was that they could not be obscene.
after the union representation campaign,the company posted literature on its board expressing opposition to the union organizing campaign.in addition to expressing opposition to the union campaign,the company began restricting,for the first time,postings on the employee bulletin board and began stopping the posting of materials.also for the first time,the company began requiring company approval before employees could post materials on the employee board.
in march,an employee posted a letter with a somewhat tone on the employee bulletin board.shaheen determined that all employees should read it and placed the letter on the company bulletin board.at the same time,the company prohibited the postings of materials on the employee bulletin board.
generally,an employer may not restrict communication among employees regarding representation or issues except when such a restriction is necessary to maintain production or discipline.nlrb,cir see also nlrb babcock wilcox.
the right of includes the right to use the company bulletin board for union notices if the bulletin board has been used for other notices without any required advance authorization.green giant,nlrb,wl nlrb of ohio,cir.an employer can not discriminate against the posting of employee support for organization unless the posting interferes with production or discipline.union carbide nlrb,cir see also roadway express,nlrb,cir.
while recognizing that sixth circuit authority holds that where a policy permits employee access to bulletin boards for any purpose,section of the act,section,secures the employees right to post union materials.union carbide nlrb,cir.schuler engineering argues that the board changed this authority in caterpillar,nlrb,wl.
in caterpillar,the board adopted an administrative law judge finding that the employer violated employee rights under section a of the act a by removing employee postings that supported the union.in dicta,the administrative law judge stated that he started his analysis 
with the assumption,arguendo,that the employer is entitled to implement a rule permitting employees to post on employee bulletin boards meeting notices,thank you cards,bereavement notices,and items so long as those items are short enough to be quickly read while prohibiting employees from posting anything that requires more than a few seconds to read and any materials espousing particular points of view.
id.at.however,as the administrative law judge stated,the employer in caterpillar had no such short enough to be quickly read rule.the administrative law judge impressions are not the holding of the case but are dicta.and as dicta,they do not establish a board rule and are not sufficient precedent to sway this court.
but more important,the company,in its discussion on the matter,completely ignores clear board precedent and clear precedent of this circuit.for example,in waste,nlrb,wl,at,the board adopted an administrative law judge reasoning that 
it has long been held that an employer violates the act if it prohibits the posting of material relating to and in the course of concerted activity of its employees,while having previously allowed the posting of other miscellaneous matters by the employees.the employer motivation in this regard,no matter how well meant,is irrelevant.it is also irrelevant as to how the employer treats antiunion literature,once it is established that other employee notices are treated disparately from prounion notices.
citations omitted.to like effect,the board in benteler,nlrb,enforced mem.cir,found that when an employer allows the use of employee bulletin boards for personal matters,the employer may not thereafter stop the posting of union flyers 
schuler engineering therefore violated section a of the act,a,when it removed employee postings that supported the union and when it refused permission to make similar postings.
solicitation of grievances by the company president 
in addition to finding that the company violated the act by impairing employees ability to communicate by stopping use of the employee bulletin board,the board found that the company had violated the act by soliciting employee grievances with the implication that they would be resolved if the employees turned their backs on union representation.
in response to the board finding that the company violated the act by soliciting grievances,schuler engineering says the board abused its discretion because substantial evidence does not support its finding.however,more than sufficient evidence supports the board finding.
the background of this issue began shortly before the march,election.on march,company president werner niehaus visited and walked through the schuler engineering,canton,ohio plant,talking with employees.in his discussion with the employees,niehaus ask ed the employees for time to deal with these problems and that they could have another vote on the union in the future if they wanted.he made promises to meet further with employees and he asked employees for a commitment to give him time and to vote no in the quickly upcoming election.niehaus also asked the employees whether he should fire the current management niehaus followed up with a letter to employees proposing a series of meetings to discuss employee problems.
discrediting claims that the president had talked to employees in a similar fashion on earlier occasions,the board found that the record,even when limited to the testimony of niehaus alone,establishes a classic solicitation of grievances by an employer.
under the act,an employer can not solicit grievances from employees during a union organizing campaign with the express or implied suggestion that the problems will be resolved if the union is turned away.an employer violates section a of the act by soliciting grievances when such solicitation is accompanied by an express or implied promise of benefits specifically aimed at interfering with,restraining,and coercing employees in their organizational effort.itt,nlrb,wl.
the solicitation of grievances is not itself an unfair labor practice.but when the circumstances of the solicitation implicitly or explicitly promise to correct grievances the solicitation may violate section a.solicitation of grievances can violate section a because the combined program of inquiry and correction suggests that union representation is unnecessary.reliance,nlrb,wl,enf,cir.an employer who has not previously solicited grievances but begins to do so in the midst of a union campaign creates a compelling inference that the employer is implicitly promising to correct the problems.id.
as we described in nlrb arrow molded plastics,cir 
it is an unfair labor practice,however,to solicit employee grievances where the solicitation is accompanied by the employer express or implied suggestion that the grievance will be resolved or acted upon only if the employees reject union representation.

the board found that niehaus had never previously engaged employees in similar solicitations when an employer institutes a new practice of soliciting employee grievances during a union organizational campaign,there is a compelling inference that he is implicitly promising to correct those inequities he discovers as a result of his inquiries and likewise urging his employees that the combined program of inquiry and correction will make union representation unnecessary.orbit lightspeed courier,nlrb,wl.
we review the board findings under an abuse of discretion standard.and we must give the board leeway in this area specially committed to its expertise if its findings are reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.in finding that the company violated employee rights through solicitations,the board had more than sufficient evidence.
board decision to order a new election 
making a somewhat more plausible argument,schuler engineering contends that the board abused its discretion in ordering a new election,even if the board had grounds to find violation of the act in the solicitation and bulletin board issues.but given the narrow margin of the march,election,the company fails to prove to this court that the board abused its discretion in ordering a new election.
to justify a new election,the objecting party must show not only that unlawful acts occurred,but also that they interfered with the employees exercise of free choice to such an extent that they materially affected the results of the election.nlrb bostik,usm,cir quoting nlrb white knight,cir.to justify a new election,the unlawful acts must interfere with the employees free choice and must materially affect the election.

second,the company engaged in the unlawful actions on the doorstep of the election.niehaus solicited grievances in exchange for a no vote only five days before the election.the temporal proximity to the election supports the board finding that the company improperly interfered with employees free choice.the company policy change regarding the bulletin board also came near the election.see contech div.nlrb,cir torbitt castleman,nlrb,cir e ven a small benefit granted during the critical period may be actionable.

company objections to the second election

the board conducted the second election on september.in that election,the employees voted in favor of union representation by a to fourteen margin the company filed three objections to the election.first,the company alleged that the union improperly disseminated an altered sample ballot.second,the company said that a union supporter improperly campaigned in the voting area.third,schuler engineering claimed that a supervisor improperly campaigned in support of the union.
after conducting an investigation,the regional director recommended that the board overrule the company objections and certify the union as the representative of the employees.after receiving exceptions from the company concerning this recommendation,the board agreed with the regional director recommendation and certified the union as the employees representative.in ruling upon the company objections,the board denied the company requests for a hearing.the company contends that the board was required to afford a hearing and contends that the board wrongly overruled its objections to the election.
altered election notice claim 
in reviewing whether an altered election notice warrants overturning an election,the board determines whether employees were likely misled to believe that the board itself took a position in the election.as described in sdc,
w e believe that the crucial question should be whether the altered ballot in issue is likely to have given voters the misleading impression that the board favored one of the parties to the election.when it is evident that the altered ballot is the work of a party,rather than the board,employees are perfectly capable of judging its persuasive value.
in nlrb hub plastics,cir,we held that when reviewing altered ballots on a notice,we first look to whether the source of the alteration is apparent.the principal consideration is whether the altered document on its face identifies the party responsible for its preparation.id.at.if the source of the alteration is clear,then the election stands,because the employee will know that the document is propaganda,and will treat it accordingly.id.if the source of the document is not apparent,then we consider whether the document has the tendency to mislead employees into believing that the board favors one party cause.id.
