opinion of the court 
this matter is the most recent in a line of cases involving the commonwealth of pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw and various institutions administered by that agency at issue once again is the commonwealth alleged failure to comply effectively and expediently with the integration mandate and administration provisions of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,and section of the rehabilitation act ra.we hold that dpw asserted defense to the integration mandate claim of pennsylvania protection and advocacy,pp a is legally insufficient and that the district court erred in its legal conclusion that the nondiscriminatory administration provisions were not violated.as such,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background and procedural history 
pp a is a nonprofit pennsylvania corporation designated by the commonwealth as the advocate and protector of the rights of individuals with disabilities,including those who are institutionalized.pp a brought this action on behalf of residents of south mountain restoration center south mountain,a psychiatric transitional facility run by dpw office of mental health and substance abuse services omhsas.south mountain is the only facility operated by the commonwealth.
under pennsylvania mental health and mental retardation act of act,dpw is charged with providing suitable services to persons with mental illness and retardation.it endeavors to do so as a matter of official policy in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.consistent with this policy and the act,county mental health and retardation offices plan for and develop mental health and retardation services,including residential services,for individuals who have serious and persistent mental illness retardation.
dpw also provides services in the community for pennsylvanians who are elderly medically fragile,including programs that feature nursing staff and extensive assistance with daily living activities.some of the participants in these programs suffer from serious and persistent mental illness and also receive psychotherapeutic services.dpw employs state and federal funds to implement its programs.
the services and support offered by dpw enable many persons with mental disabilities who are also elderly have serious medical needs,including those who might require level care,to live productively in their communities or other integrated settings.pp a argues that residents of south mountain are systematically denied participation in these varied and successful programs,depriving them of integrated treatment in violation of the ada and the ra.
as of august,south mountain had residents down from in and in.the median age of the residents was,and over of the residents were admitted from state psychiatric facilities.many south mountain residents have been institutionalized for decades in facilities approximately residents of whom have been institutionalized for more than years.
in june,in response to an inquiry from the statewide community hospital integration planning committee concerning the need for services for residents of omhsas facilities,professional staff of south mountain determined that of its residents could function in the community now if the necessary community support services were in place and operational and that none of its residents were precluded from leaving due to serious medical problems that can not be met in the community.dpw concedes this report was submitted,but dispute s that the statements are material because the figures were computed on the assumption that resources were unlimited,and resources are not unlimited.
pp a filed its initial complaint in september and its second amended complaint,which is before us here,approximately one year later.the second amended complaint alleged that dpw was operating south mountain in violation of the ada and ra because its failure to include south mountain residents in integrated treatment programs instead limiting them to institutionalized treatment at south mountain ran afoul of the laws i mandate to integrate patients,where appropriate,in the community,and ii prohibiting against discriminatory administration.dpw vigorously disputed these allegations.
in january and february,the parties filed for summary judgment.in january,after extensive discovery and briefing in connection with these motions,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting dpw summary judgment and denying pp a the same.the court held as a matter of law that granting pp a relief would require a fundamental alteration of dpw programs,and thus it was shielded from liability by the fundamental alteration exception to the integration mandate described in olmstead,d.the district court decision rested solely on this fundamental alteration ground.on the basis of its disposition of the integration mandate claim,the district court also granted summary judgment to dpw on pp a discriminatory administration claim.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment here and,for the reasons described below,vacate the district court order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
pp a filed its lawsuit pursuant to,title ii of the ada,of the ra,and title xix of the social security act,et.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard as the district court,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the plaintiffs.debiec cabot,cir citing.c.we are required to review the record and draw inferences in a light most favorable to the party,yet the party must provide admissible evidence containing specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e see pamintuan nanticoke mem l,cir wetzel tucker,cir.
iii.applicable law 
ada and ra integration mandate 
primarily at issue in this case is the integration mandate embodied in the regulations that implement the ada and ra this mandate requires states to administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d implementing the ada integration requirement see also d implementing the ra integration requirement.t he most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities is a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.pt.app.in short,where appropriate for the patient,both the ada and the ra favor integrated,treatment over institutionalization.frederick,at.
the integration mandate is qualified by the fundamental alteration exception,which provides that 
a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.
b emphasis added.
this case requires us to construe the fundamental alteration defense to the integration mandate in light of the supreme court opinion in olmstead and our subsequent decision in frederick in olmstead,a plurality of the supreme court held that a violation of the integration mandate should be found when 
the state treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate,
the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual,and 
the placement can be reasonably accommodated,taking into account a the resources available to the state and b the needs of others with mental disabilities.
olmstead,at.the third prong of this olmstead test embodies the fundamental alteration defense and thus is the object of our focus.
in frederick we considered this third prong.we explained that the olmstead plurality characterized the state available resources and responsibility to other institutionalized mental health patients as primary considerations in evaluating a defense.frederick,at.in assessing these primary considerations,we noted 
f actors that are relevant to the defense includ e but are not limited to the state ability to continue meeting the needs of other institutionalized mental health patients for whom community placement is not appropriate,whether the state has a waiting list for community placements,and whether the state has developed a comprehensive plan to move eligible patients into community care settings.

scope of budgetary constraint analysis 
though clearly relevant,budgetary constraints alone are insufficient to establish a fundamental alteration defense id.at explaining that a singular focus upon a state fiscal constraints will not suffice to establish a defense see also townsend quasim,cir explaining that budgetary considerations are insufficient to establish a fundamental alteration defense and focusing on whether the asserted extra costs would,in fact,compel cutbacks in services to other benefits recipients fisher oklahoma health care,cir the fact that a state has a fiscal problem,by itself,does not lead to an automatic conclusion that the provision of integrated treatment will result in a fundamental alteration.the appellants in frederick argued that the district court erred in focusing exclusively on budgetary constraints.frederick,at.despite an erroneous statement by the district judge implying that budgetary constraints alone would support a fundamental alteration defense we upheld his ultimate conclusion,finding that he had properly analyzed a host of relevant factors,including i unsuccessful attempts at fund procurement ii evidence that the defendant had responsibly spent its budgetary allocation,overtime savings to increase funding for mental health services,and had a favorable bed closure rate iii the fact that defendant ability to increase the number of community care placements was hampered by community opposition to further expansion and iv that increasing the number of community placements would eventually lead to a diminution of services for institutionalized persons.id.at.we agreed with the frederick appellants,however,that it would have been legal error for the district court to find a fundamental alteration solely on the basis of budgetary constraints.id.at.
commitment to action 
in frederick,stressing that what is at issue is compliance with two federal statutes enacted to protect disabled persons,we read olmstead s third prong to require that a state agency asserting a fundamental alteration defense be prepared to make a commitment to action in a manner for which it can be held accountable by the courts.id.at.that is,the fundamental alteration defense can not be read to exempt in toto noncomplying agencies.a state can not meet an allegation of noncompliance simply by replying that compliance would be too costly or would otherwise fundamentally alter its noncomplying programs.any program that runs afoul of the integration mandate would be fundamentally altered if brought into compliance.read this broadly,the fundamental alteration defense would swallow the integration mandate whole.see townsend,at p olicy choices that isolate the disabled can not be upheld solely because offering integrated services would change the segregated way in which existing services are provided s uch a broad reading of fundamental alteration regulation would render the protection against isolation of the disabled substanceless.
instead,the only sensible reading of the integration mandate consistent with the court olmstead opinion allows for a fundamental alteration defense only if the accused agency has developed and implemented a plan to come into compliance with the ada and ra.frederick,at.when such a plan exists,a remedy that would force the agency to abandon or alter its compliance efforts could sacrifice widespread compliance for immediate,individualized relief.imposing such a remedy might be and.thus,as the supreme court explained,the larger plan must be taken into account in assessing the immediate need s ensibly construed,the defense would allow the state to show that,in the allocation of available resources,immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable,given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities.olmstead,at.the states have undertaken this responsibility in part because they are obliged to do so under applicable federal law,including the ada and ra.it would make no sense to exempt a state from liability under the ada and ra in a particular case on the basis of its need to fulfill its larger obligation to the mentally disabled as a whole while at the same time relieving the state of its larger obligation.any interpretation of the fundamental alteration defense that would shield a state from liability in a particular case without requiring a commitment generally to comply with the integration mandate would lead to this bizarre result.
when an agency has implemented a sufficient compliance plan,when it has demonstrated a commitment to comply with the ada and ra,we must be wary of judicial mandates that could thwart or undermine the agency authority to carry out that plan as it sees fit yet when a person with standing brings suit alleging violation of the ada and ra in a particular case,we discharge our responsibility by confirming that a general plan does exist and by imposing upon the agency,as a condition to the assertion of a fundamental alteration defense,the minimal burden of demonstrating that there will be ongoing progress toward community placement under the general plan.frederick,at.without such a preliminary showing,an agency can not establish a fundamental alteration defense.
prohibition against discriminatory administration 
the implementing regulations of the ada provide,inter alia,that 
a public entity may not,directly or through contractual or other arrangements,utilize criteria or methods of administration i t hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability or ii t hat have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity program with respect to individuals with disabilities.
b i ii.the ra contains virtually identical provisions.b i ii.having laid out the regulatory framework and governing precedent,we now apply them to this case.
iv.analysis of this case 
ada and ra integration mandate 
the district court concluded that it need not determine if the first two prongs of the olmstead test were satisfied because summary judgment in favor of dpw on the basis of its fundamental alteration defense was warranted under olmstead prong three,d at.we thus turn to the third prong first.
olmstead prong three 
scope of budgetary constraint analysis 
pp a argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in endorsing dpw fundamental alteration defense solely on the basis of its analysis of budgetary constraints.we agree.
writing before the publication of our frederick opinion,the district court understandably could not divine the dictates of that decision.it concluded that defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the ada and ra claims on the basis of that part of its defense asserting that it does not have sufficient resources to move south mountain residents into the community and provide services for others with needs.id.emphasis added.as discussed at section,supra,this basis is insufficient as a matter of law under frederick 
unlike the frederick decision,the district court opinion here does not disclose additional relevant factors such as unsuccessful attempts at fund procurement,evidence that dpw responsibly spent its budgetary allocations,evidence of a favorable bed closure rate,defendants ability to increase the number of community care placements in light of community opposition to further expansion,or the potential diminution of services for insti
