constance patterson patterson appeals from a order affirming the social security administration ssa decision to deny her application for disability benefits.this case presents an issue of first impression in our circuit whether an administrative law judge alj failure to follow the special technique required by a when evaluating a claimant mental impairment requires remand or may constitute harmless error.we hold that such an error does not automatically require remand,but that the error was not harmless on these facts.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court order with instructions to remand to the alj for appropriate review of patterson mental impairment.
patterson filed an application for disability insurance benefits on july.the ssa denied patterson application initially and on reconsideration.patterson then filed a timely request for a hearing on may.
after a hearing,an alj also denied her application,finding that patterson was not disabled during the period for which she sought benefits.in so ruling,the alj claimed to have reached his decision on the objective medical record,but he based his findings regarding patterson impairments primarily on the conclusions of one doctor,horn.with regard to the alj evaluation of patterson mental impairment specifically,the alj failed to follow the procedures outlined in a the regulation,and discuss other evidence that conflicted with horn opinion,such as contrary opinions of other physicians or contradictory portions of medical test results.understanding where the alj went wrong in evaluating patterson disability requires background knowledge of the complex web of regulations governing the alj review,which we discuss at great length infra part.for now it suffices to note that,on appeal,the ssa concedes error in the alj failure to assess patterson mental impairment and its effect on her working abilities in the manner prescribed by the regulation.
patterson sought review of the alj decision,but the ssa appeals council denied her request,rendering the alj decision the final decision of the ssa commissioner for purposes of judicial review.g.patterson timely filed suit in federal district court,claiming that the alj ignored regulatory requirements and reached a decision unsupported by substantial evidence.before the magistrate judge,patterson requested a reversal of the ssa determinations and a remand for an award of benefits,or alternatively,further administrative proceedings.the magistrate judge recommended affirming the ssa,on the grounds that substantial evidence supported all of the alj challenged findings,and the alj failure to articulate his findings in accordance with the regulation constituted harmless error.the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation and affirmed the ssa decision.patterson timely appealed.
on appeal,patterson seeks a remand to the ssa for proceedings consistent with the regulation and other applicable regulations the ssa counters that any missteps by the alj constitute harmless error because this court can itself apply the special technique in determining whether substantial evidence supports the alj denial of benefits.
we review an ssa decision only to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and conforms to applicable and valid regulations.g shively heckler,cir.where an insufficient record precludes a determination that substantial evidence supported the alj denial of benefits,this court may not affirm for harmless error.see meyer astrue,cir.see also shinseki sanders,noting that general case law governing application of the standard applies equally to administrative cases.because the alj failure to follow the regulation frustrates effective judicial review in this case,we reverse the district court order with instructions to remand to the ssa for proceedings consistent with its own regulations.
below,we first outline the statutory and regulatory framework governing the ssa grant or denial of benefits,and how the alj applied that framework here.next,we explain why we can not accept the ssa invitation to apply the special technique ourselves in the first instance.we do not decide whether failure to follow the special technique requires remand in every case,but we are satisfied that the error here requires remand.
the social security act the act provides for benefits to claimants below retirement age who are under a disability.a e.ssa regulations set out a process for determining disability benefits.a.steps through ask whether the claimant is working if not,whether she has a severe impairment and if she does,whether the impairment meets or equals a listed impairment.see id.satisfying step warrants an automatic finding of disability,and relieves the decision maker from proceeding to steps and.see id.d see also sullivan zebley.
if the claimant satisfies steps and,but not step,then the decision maker must determine the claimant residual functional capacity,that is,an evaluation of her ability to perform work despite her limitations rfc assessment.e.in determining the most a claimant can still perform,the decision maker must evaluate all relevant record evidence.id.this rfc assessment is a holistic and evaluation the alj can not conduct it properly without reaching detailed conclusions at step concerning the type and severity of the claimant impairments.
after conducting the rfc assessment,the alj proceeds to step.id.a iv,f.at step,the decision maker determines whether the impairment prevents the claimant from performing past relevant work.id.a iv 
the regulation affects how an alj evaluates and documents his process at steps through if the claimant alleges a mental impairment.id.a.when evaluating and documenting the severity of a claimant mental impairment at steps and and its concomitant impact on the rfc assessment relevant to step the alj must follow the special technique.id.a a emphasis added.
under the regulation,if the alj determines that a mental impairment exists,he must specify the symptoms,signs,and laboratory findings that substantiate the presence of the impairment s and document his findings.id.a b.the alj must also document a specific finding as to the degree of limitation in each of the four areas of functional limitation listed in a c.id.a e.in the first three areas of functional limitations a activities of daily living,b social functioning,and c concentration,persistence,or pace the alj must rate the degree of limitation using the following scale none,mild,moderate,marked,and extreme.id.a c.the alj must rate the fourth functional area d episodes of decompensation using the following scale none,one or two,three,four or more.id.next,the alj must determine if the mental impairment is severe,and if so,whether it qualifies as a listed impairment.id.a d.if the mental impairment is severe but is not a listed impairment,the alj must assess the claimant rfc in light of how the impairment constrains the claimant work abilities.see id.a d.the regulation specifically provides that the alj must document all of the special technique steps.id.a e.
the claimant carries the burden of proof at steps through.see d a.if a claimant carries her burden,the burden shifts to the ssa at step to demonstrate that the impairment does not prevent the claimant from engaging in other substantial gainful employment.see g,f.to do this,the ssa commissioner must present evidence that demonstrates that other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can do,given her residual functional capacity and vocational factors.id.c 
in the present case,at steps and,the alj found that patterson was not working,and had severe physical and mental impairments.at step,he determined these impairments did not meet or equal any listed impairment.in reaching these conclusions,the alj mentioned the findings of two.horn and ritterspach however,the alj did not evaluate the severity of patterson mental impairment in accordance with the special technique,nor did he document application of the special technique in his decision as required by the regulation.a e.in addition,the record contained evidence that conflicted with the findings
