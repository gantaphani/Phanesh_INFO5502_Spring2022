section of the railway labor act rla,stat.codified as amended at et,grants adjustment boards exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes over the interpretation or application of collective bargaining agreements affecting the railroad and airline industries.at issue in this case is a claim by the international brotherhood of teamsters the union that it has a right to designate a representative on a safety committee established by its collective bargaining agreement with united parcel service ups.the district court dismissed the suit,concluding that it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the adjustment board.the union responds that the dispute lies outside of the board exclusive jurisdiction because it involves a dispute between labor and management about the d esignation of representatives,third.concluding that the union has construed the board exclusive jurisdiction in too narrowly and the term representatives in,third too broadly,we affirm.
the union represents maintenance technicians and other workers employed by ups at gateways across the country hubs for the company airborne shipping business.ups and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement that established,among other things,a safety committee at each of the larger gateways.representatives of both parties sit on these safety committees,where they work together to address the safety concerns of employees at the gateways.at gateways with fewer than employees,the local safety committee chairman works with ups safety manager to resolve employee safety concerns.
in april,local hired john tulipana,to be its safety committee chair and the union chair of the louisville gateway safety committee.ups,however,refused to acknowledge tulipana as chair of the louisville committee,arguing that the collective bargaining agreement mandated that a ups employee hold the position.on november,the union filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky,seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under of the railway labor act.claiming that ups had refused to treat with tulipana on health and safety issues,the union complained that ups has interfered with its employees choice of representative and has violated,third and fourth of the act.ja.ups filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,which the district court granted.even if ups had failed to treat with tulipana in this safety committee position,the district court held that the dispute qualified as minor under the railway labor act and was committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the system adjustment board.op.at.

enacted in,the railway labor act was designed to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any railroad engaged therein caused by disputes.see also,at noting that the act would ensure continuity and efficiency of interstate transportation service,and protect the public from the injuries and losses consequent upon any impairment or interruption of interstate commerce through failures of managers and employees to settle peaceably their controversies.in,congress extended the act to every common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.act of april,stat.codified at.
in attempting to prevent labor disputes from crippling freight and passenger delivery in the railway and airline industries,the act divides labor disputes into four categories representation disputes,major disputes,minor disputes and collateral disputes governed by independent state or federal laws.representation disputes are governed by,ninth of the act and address conflicts that arise before certification of a union and that concern who will represent employees in future labor negotiations.see virginian ry.system federation,ry.employees.the employees free dom to organize and to make choice of their representatives without the coercive interference and pressure of a company union and the statutory protection of the freedom of choice of representatives was continued and made more explicit by,third and fourth.see also airlines,int l of teamsters,d,circuit justice representation disputes involve defining the bargaining unit and determining the employee representative for collective bargaining.under,ninth,of the act,the national mediation board has exclusive jurisdiction over representation disputes.internal quotation marks omitted.
major disputes occur after certification over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them and arise where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one,and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy.they look to the acquisition of rights for the future,not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.elgin,joliet ry.burley.see also pittsburgh lake erie ry.labor executives ass n,d disputes about proposals to change rates of pay,rules,or working conditions are known as major disputes.burlington of maint.of way employees,d a dispute over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them is a major dispute in the parlance of railway labor law and is governed by the railway labor act.citation and quotation marks omitted atchison,topeka santa fe buell,d labeling major disputes as those arising out of the formation or change of collective bargaining agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
a minor dispute contemplates the existence of a collective agreement the dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted case in either case the claim is to rights accrued,not merely to have new ones created for the future.burley,at.see also hawaiian airlines norris,d m inor disputes grow out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.minor disputes involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation,develop from the interpretation application of the contracts between the labor unions and the carriers and pertain only to disputes invoking rights.internal quotation marks and citation omitted pittsburgh lake erie,at.minor disputes are those involving the interpretation or application of existing contracts.buell,at.a minor dispute grow s out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.internal quotation marks omitted conrail ry.labor executives ass n,d this court adopted the terminology,drawn from the vocabulary of rail management and rail labor,as a shorthand method of describing two classes of controversy congress had distinguished in the rla major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them.id.at.where an employer asserts a contractual right to take the contested action,the ensuing dispute is minor if the action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties agreement.where,in contrast,the employer claims are frivolous or obviously insubstantial,the dispute is major.
finally,disputes over rights granted by other provisions of federal and state law,which are not otherwise covered by any of the previous dispute categories,are largely unaffected by the act.hawaiian airlines,at.a cause of action is not by the rla if it involves rights and obligations that exist independent of the cba.id.at.this arguably justified standard,however,was employed only for policing the line between major and minor disputes.recognizing that accepting a party characterization of a dispute as minor ran the risk of undercutting the rla prohibition against unilateral imposition of new contractual terms,the court held that a dispute would be deemed minor only if there was a sincere,nonfrivolous argument that it turned on the application of the existing agreement,that is,if it was arguably justified by that agreement.obviously,this test said nothing about the threshold question whether the dispute was subject to the rla in the first place accordingly,we agree with the supreme court of hawaii that respondent claims for discharge in violation of public policy and in violation of the hawaii whistleblower protection act are not by the rla.buell,at.it is inconceivable that congress intended that a worker who suffered a disabling injury would be denied recovery under the federal employee liability act fela simply because he might also be able to process a narrow labor grievance under the rla to a successful conclusion.as far as a worker right to damages under the fela is concerned,congress enactment of the rla has had no effect.
how a dispute is characterized affects the path for resolving it.representation disputes are committed to the jurisdiction of the national mediation board by,ninth of the act,which gives the board authority to investigate and resolve such disputes,ensuring that the selection of representatives occurs without interference,influence,or coercion.the decision of the national mediation board to certify a particular representative under,ninth of the act is final and not reviewable in federal court.see switchmen union of am.mediation.where congress took such great pains to protect the mediation board in its handling of an explosive problem,we can not help but believe that if congress had desired to implicate the federal judiciary and to place on the federal courts the burden of having the final say on any aspect of the problem,it would have made its desire plain.airlines,at,circuit justice representation disputes involve defining the bargaining unit and determining the employee representative for collective bargaining.under,ninth,of the act,the national mediation board has exclusive jurisdiction over representation disputes.
the act provides two distinct routes for settlement of major and minor disputes.burley,at.after an initial stage of mandatory negotiation,major disputes are subject to mediation by the national mediation board created by the act,voluntary arbitration and eventually the possibility of presidential intervention.id.at.if each procedure is tried and fails,the parties may resort to other legal tactics,such as strikes,lockouts or other forms of economic.id.
to address minor disputes,congress amended the act in to give the national railroad adjustment board power to settle such disputes definitively.id.at.act of june,stat.codified as amended at et.after the amendments,if either party filed a minor dispute with the board,the board had exclusive primary jurisdiction to issue a decision that was binding as to both parties.day,d noting that the national railroad adjustment board ha s exclusive primary jurisdiction over disputes between unions and carriers based on the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.
in,congress extended most of the obligations and rights established by the act to the airline transport industry,requiring the parties to use system,group,or regional boards of adjustment,instead of the national railroad adjustment board,to resolve minor disputes.int l ass of machinists cent.airlines,d.congress gave the system boards the same exclusive jurisdiction over minor disputes in the airline industry that the national railroad adjustment board has over such disputes in the railroad industry.noting that minor disputes shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes but,failing to reach an adjustment in this manner,the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to an appropriate adjustment board see also hawaiian airlines,at.airlines,at,circuit justice.save for relying on system boards rather than the national railroad adjustment board as the forum for resolution,the act makes the resolution process and its applicability to minor disputes identical for the airline and railway industries.cent.airlines,at.the statute directed that minor disputes be handled on the property in the usual manner,but failing adjustment either party could take the matter to the adjustment board,which was to hear and decide it.this provision is applicable both to rail and air carriers.
federal courts may enjoin strikes arising from minor disputes,consolidated rail,at,and may enjoin efforts to change the status quo during the resolution of a major dispute,id.at.parties may also seek review of arbitration decisions in federal court,though j udicial review of these boards determinations has been characterized as among the narrowest known to the law.buell,at.
finally,employment disputes not by the dispute resolution procedures in the act are resolved in the manner dictated by the appropriate state or federal law.so,for example,claims under the federal employer liability act may be filed in federal court,see buell,at.claims under a state wrongful termination law may be filed in state court,see hawaiian airlines,at.and claims under,first of the railway labor act for protection from discrimination by a bargaining representative may be filed in federal court,see conley gibson,d of trainmen howard.
in assessing whether the union may bring this claim in federal court,the parties share three pieces of common ground.they agree that the dispute arises under the railway labor act and not under an independent state or federal law.they agree that this dispute is not a representation dispute under,ninth of the act,requiring investigation and resolution by the national mediation board.and they agree that this was not a major dispute,which is to say it was not a dispute regarding the formation of a collective bargaining agreement.they part company,however,over whether the dispute was a minor one subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the system adjustment board and whether,even if the dispute was a minor one,the union has a separate statutory right to bring this claim against ups in federal court under,third.
we begin by addressing the union claim that this is not a minor dispute.minor disputes,the supreme court has held,involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.hawaiian airlines,at.internal quotation marks omitted.a conflict thus is minor i f the disputed action of one of the parties can arguably be justified by the existing agreement or if the contention that the labor contract sanctions the disputed action is not obviously insubstantial.conrail,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the act imposes a relatively light burden on a railroad or airline to establish exclusive arbitral jurisdiction under the rla so long as the employer asserts a contractual right to take the contested action,the ensuing dispute is minor if the action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties agreement.id.at.
in this instance,ups has shown that its action was arguably justified by the terms of the parties agreement.the company assert ed a contractual right to refuse to recognize tulipana as the union representative on the louisville safety committee.in a letter dated april,ups labor manager,bob ragar,explained to the president of local,joe darmento,that article,section b,c and d of the cba clearly refers to the individuals being on or chairing the safety committees as being employees.tulipana does not meet this criteria.ja.in a subsequent letter,dated april,ragar stated that article,of the collective bargaining agreement limits membership on the safety committees to ups employees who are members and appropriate company representatives.ja.noting that there had never been a member of a safety committee who was not an employee of ups,ragar added that n othing has changed in the contract to now allow such a practice.id.connie clifton,the aircraft maintenance health and safety manager for ups,also noted in a letter to darmento,dated june,that t he question of whether tulipana can be on the safety committee is simply a contractual issue.ja.
under these circumstances,the collective bargaining agreement arguably justified ups interpretation.the contract does not directl
