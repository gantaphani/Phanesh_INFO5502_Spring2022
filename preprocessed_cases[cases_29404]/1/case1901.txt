after a protracted trial and an unsuccessful appeal to this court,gencorp filed a rule b motion asking the district court to set aside a judgment in favor of olin corporation on the basis of cooper industries aviall services,d.gencorp also asked the district court to stay execution of the judgment.the district court denied both motions.we affirm.
in the,gencorp and olin built a plant in ohio and stored the hazardous waste generated by the plant at two different sites.although the agreement between the companies originally contemplated placing the plant under gencorp sole control,olin ultimately retained ownership of the plant.in,the environmental protection agency epa notified olin that it was a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla for the of big d,one of the two disposal sites.after negotiations failed,the epa issued two unilateral administrative orders under cercla,for each site.the orders established remedial design and remedial action plans for the sites and required olin to comply with them.ja.the government also brought a civil action against olin under cercla,seeking reimbursement of the response costs which it ha d incurred in conducting a response action at big ja.in addition,the complaint asked for a declaratory judgment that olin would be liable for all future costs incurred by the united states in conjunction with the response activities at the big d campground site.ja.
this action began in when gencorp requested a declaratory judgment disclaiming any cercla liability for the costs of the sites.olin counterclaimed,seeking contribution for its response costs under cercla f,f,and arguing that gencorp should be jointly and severally liable for the response costs under cercla a,id.a.in,gencorp agreed to dismiss its declaratory judgment action,after which the parties litigated olin counterclaims.gencorp also amended its response to olin counterclaim,adding the claim that olin had breached its contract to insure the plant.
the district court eventually dismissed olin claim for joint and several liability under,reasoning that as a potentially responsible party olin recourse lay in the contribution provision of cercla f.see centerior serv.acme scrap iron metal,cir.the district court then held a bench trial and ruled for olin on its contribution claim on may.the district court concluded that gencorp was responsible for of the costs of big d and of the costs for the other site,leading to a judgment against gencorp and in favor of olin for million in contribution costs and million in prejudgment interest.
gencorp asked the court to reconsider its decision based on the plain language of f,arguing that a potentially responsible party like olin could seek contribution only during or following any civil action under cercla or.ja f.claiming that olin had not been subject to such a civil action,gencorp argued that t he express language of the statute bars olin contribution claim.ja.gencorp acknowledged that the sixth circuit had not confronted the issue before and that district courts had taken conflicting positions on it.gencorp also noted that the sixth circuit case most on did not undertake to define the scope and limits of the contribution action itself,ja,and that the fifth circuit had recently issued a decision favoring gencorp interpretation of section f,see aviall,cooper,cir.the district court rejected gencorp motion.it noted that the fifth circuit had since vacated and reversed the panel decision,see aviall,cooper,cir en banc,and reasoned that the final sentence of section f assured that potentially responsible parties could proceed with contribution claims even in the absence of a civil action.see f.
after rejecting gencorp motion for reconsideration,the district court entered a final judgment for olin on its contribution claim under civil rule b.the district court stayed consideration of gencorp claim pending the resolution of a dispute between olin and its insurers in the district court for the southern district of new york.
on appeal,gencorp did not raise the issue presented in its motion for reconsideration.our court rejected the issues that gencorp did present on appeal and ultimately affirmed the judgment with one reservation.gencorp,olin,cir.we held that the statutory language of cercla g required a district court to enter a declaratory judgment as to future costs if a claimant succeeds in a contribution suit,but that such a judgment necessarily was limited by article iii case or controversy requirement.id.at.u nable to find sufficient evidence of future response costs,we remanded the case to the district court for initial consideration of whether a case or controversy exists,and if so,for the entry of a declaratory judgment.id.
after the sixth circuit issued its decision on november,gencorp petitioned for rehearing en banc.at that point,it pressed the civil action argument for the first time in the court of appeals,noting that the supreme court had granted certiorari to the fifth circuit on the question.see cooper,aviall,d.on december,the supreme court announced its decision in cooper industries,d,holding that f authorized contribution actions only when the claimant had been subject to a civil action under sections or.our court thereafter denied gencorp petition for rehearing en banc,and the supreme court thereafter denied gencorp petition for a writ of certiorari,gencorp,olin,d.
on remand,gencorp filed a rule b motion asking the district court to set aside the judgment based on the supreme court decision in cooper industries and filed a rule h motion asking the court to stay execution of the underlying judgment against it.the district court denied both motions on november.gencorp asked this court to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal,which this court denied on november.on november,gencorp satisfied the judgment,and five days later the district court discharged the supersedeas bond.gencorp appeals the district court orders denying its rule b and rule h motions.
we review the denial of both motions for abuse of discretion.see browder director,dep t of,d arban west publ g,cir.that standard is met,we have held,when we have a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.blue diamond coal trs.of umwa combined benefit fund,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
