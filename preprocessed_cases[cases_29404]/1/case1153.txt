opinion of the court 
this case involves a challenge to two orders of the federal communications commission fcc enacting new rules regarding competitive bidding for wireless communications spectrum licenses.petitioners assert that the new rules are invalid and that an auction conducted pursuant to those rules must be nullified.for the reasons that follow,the petition for review must be dismissed because it is incurably premature.
the communications act of directs the fcc to design a system to allocate spectrum licenses by establish ing a competitive bidding methodology via regulation.j.in doing so,the fcc shall seek to promot e economic opportunity and competition and ensur e that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the american people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,including small businesses,rural telephone companies,and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.id.j b.such businesses are known as designated entities or des.see a.the fcc must ensure that des are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of services,and,for such purposes,consider the use of tax certificates,bidding preferences,and other procedures,j d,and require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits.id.j e.
on june,petitioner council tree communications,council tree,a company organized to identify and develop investment opportunities for minority and businesses in the communications industry,wrote an ex parte letter to the fcc proposing changes to the competitive bidding regulations.in particular,council tree sought to prevent abuse of de benefits by prohibiting those des affiliated with large incumbent wireless companies from receiving bidding credits at spectrum license auctions.these credits are discounts of or from a de winning bid.
on february,the fcc released a further notice of proposed rulemaking in the matter of implementation of the commercial spectrum enhancement act and modernization of the commission competitive bidding rules and procedures,which proposed and sought comment on modifications similar to those suggested in council tree letter to the fcc.
after receiving over fifty comments and reply comments,the fcc released on april,and published in the federal register on may,a second report and order and second further notice of proposed rulemaking second order.may,codified at pt.that second order adopted new rules that take bidding credit eligibility away from des that have certain material relationships with other entities and extend the repayment period to prevent the unjust enrichment of des that lose their eligibility after winning a license.dissatisfied with these rules,on may,petitioners filed a petition with the fcc to reconsider the second order.
on june,the fcc released an order on reconsideration of the second report and order reconsideration order.june,codified at pt,to clarif y certain aspects and address certain procedural issues raised in petitioners petition for reconsideration.the reconsideration order did not expressly grant or deny the petition,but essentially rejected all of the arguments contained therein.
instead of waiting for the fcc to publish its reconsideration order in the federal register,petitioners filed a petition for review with this court on june,along with an emergency motion to stay the effectiveness of the new rules and the auction of advanced wireless services licenses auction,which would be conducted pursuant to the fcc new rules petitioners challenge those rules as not in accordance with the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedure act,b arbitrary and capricious under the relevant provisions of the communications act of,j,and the telecommunications act of,and not in compliance with the regulatory flexibility act,et.they also seek to nullify the results of auction.in addition to opposing each of these challenges,the fcc argues that we lack jurisdiction over the petition,which was filed seven days before the fcc published its reconsideration order in the federal register on june.on june,a motions panel of this court issued a per curiam order denying petitioners emergency motion for stay.
we begin,as we must,with questions of jurisdiction whether petitioners petition for review is incurably premature and,if so,whether the motions panel earlier per curiam order vitiates that prematurity

in the case at bar,it is undisputed that at the time petitioners filed their june,petition for review,their petition for reconsideration of the second order was still pending before the fcc and remains pending to this day,see reply br.at,so the petition for review is incurably premature as to the second order.see telestar,fcc,per curiam court lacks jurisdiction to consider prematurely filed petition even after the agency rules on a rehearing request a new petition must be filed.
the petition for review is also incurably premature with respect to the reconsideration order because it does not comply with the hobbs act.title a refers to chapter of title,commonly called the hobbs act,see stone ins,d,to determine when a petition for review of an fcc order must be filed with a federal court of appeals.the hobbs act timing provision states in relevant part 
on the entry of a final order reviewable under this chapter,the agency shall promptly give notice thereof by service or publication in accordance with its rules.any party aggrieved by the final order may,within days after its entry,file a petition to review the order in the court of appeals wherein venue lies.

it is not a principle of law that all agency action need be reviewable as soon as it is effective and indeed that all agency action need be reviewable at all.here the governing statutes,and,provide that review is unavailable until the date the fcc gives public notice,whether or not the order becomes effective and otherwise ripe before then.

like at t in western union,petitioners here filed their petition for review seven days before the reconsideration order was published in the federal register.their petition is therefore incurably premature as we are not bound by western union,however,petitioners criticize it.specifically,they argue that the court of appeals for the circuit did not examine the specific sequencing language of and did not recognize that,which explicitly ties judicial review to public notice,does not apply to orders that do not expressly rule on a reconsideration petition.neither criticism is persuasive.
first,petitioners insist that establishes a date of entry of the final order antecedent to the date of notice by publication.the pertinent fcc regulation states otherwise commission action shall be deemed final,for purposes of seeking reconsideration at the commission or judicial review,on the date of public notice as defined in b of these rules.b.and,as noted previously,for rulemaking proceedings the fcc defines public notice as publication in the federal register.id.b.petitioners concede that these two regulations doom their reading of,but argue that they impermissibly trump the statute.we disagree.
the supreme court has stated repeatedly that the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.long island care at home,coke,d quoting chevron natural res.def.council,d.under chevron,we first determine whether a statute is silent or ambiguous on the question we face if so,we next determine whether the agency regulation is based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute.mercy home health leavitt,cir.
here,congress has not directly spoken to what entry means in the hobbs act.petitioners argue that contains specific sequencing language placing entry before notice by publication,so whatever entry means,it can not mean publication in the federal register.we are unpersuaded.the first sentence of says merely that when entry occurs,notice by service or publication must also occur.it remains ambiguous whether entry might not occur until publication in the federal register.our reading of the text is buttressed by the fact that prior to the promulgation of b,there had been considerable confusion in the application of to fcc decisions.see itt world commc ns,fcc,cir newman,id.at mansfield,urging the fcc to promulgate straightforward regulations explaining how and when their reviewable orders are to issue internal citation omitted.indeed,in direct response to this judicial invitation,the fcc promulgated b.see in the matter of addition of new section,memorandum opinion and order,wl statutory terms entry of a final order and the date upon which public notice is given have the same meaning,published at,march.
because congress has not defined entry in the hobbs act and its meaning is ambiguous,we proceed to step two of the chevron analysis and consider whether the regulations are based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute.first,it appears that the fcc definition of entry as federal register publication is inherently reasonable.compare with horsehead,at even absent any pertinent agency regulation,default rule is that promulgation means federal register publication see also kentucky brock,cir administrative agencies have considerable latitude in determining the event that triggers commencement of the judicial review period.quoting associated gas distribs.ferc,per curiam.second,courts give considerable weight to a consistent and longstanding interpretation by the agency responsible for administering a statute.int l union of,radio mach.workers westinghouse,cir quoting united states ass of sec.dealers,d.here,b and b have tied entry to federal register publication with respect to fcc rulemaking orders since b was first promulgated in.see,small bus.in telecomms.fcc,goodman fcc.
in addition,we observe that some members of congress have indicated their approval of these regulations.when congress amended in,the house conference noted 
the senate amended of the communications act by providing that specified pleading periods for seeking agency reconsideration or judicial review of commission decisions commence from the date on which the commission gives public notice of its decisions 
recently,the commission adopted rules which refine the meaning of public notice.addition of new to the commission rules,amendments to b,report and order.
by adopting these rules,the commission determined that public notice,as that term is used in,only can take the form of a written document.see b of the commission rules as amended,b.the kind of written document constituting public notice will be governed generally by the kind of proceeding that is involved.for example,in notice and comment rulemaking proceedings,public notice of a final commission decision will occur on the date such decision is published in the federal register.see b the conferees believe that in rulemaking proceedings it is important that the public have the opportunity to obtain a copy of the full text of the commission decisions before pleading periods for appeal begin.see b.
at,as reprinted in.if the conference believed that either b or b contravened a statute,it would not have cited both approvingly as the basis for the legislation therefore,the fcc regulations interpreting entry in the hobbs act as publication in the federal register are eminently reasonable,and we must defer to that interpretation.
petitioners also criticize western union for relying on,which deals primarily with fcc orders ruling on petitions for reconsideration.the fcc order at issue in western union unquestionably did not rule on a petition for reconsideration,and yet,in dismissing the petition for judicial review of that order,the court of appeals for the circuit relied on the final sentence of a,which states 
the time within which a petition for review must be filed in a proceeding to which section a of this title applies,or within which an appeal must be taken under section b of this title in any case,shall be computed from the date upon which the commission gives public notice of the order,decision,report,or action complained of.
a.the foregoing sentence plainly applies to all petitions for review to which a applies,whether or not the fcc order to be reviewed granted or denied a petition for reconsideration.indeed,even if the surrounding statutory text unquoted rendered the provision general applicability ambiguous,the legislative history of previously quoted indicates that in relying on regulations that apply to judicial review of all fcc rulemaking orders,congress intended that the last sentence of a apply just as broadly.armed with the plain language,legislative history,and the absence of case law to the contrary,we find that the final sentence of a applies to all a petitions for review.
finally,the supreme court statement that the requirement of administrative finality is to be interpreted pragmatically,bell new jersey,d,does not alter our conclusion.had petitioners filed their petition for review after the hobbs act filing period had expired,we would have lacked jurisdiction,despite the fact that the reconsideration order unquestionably would have been final.filing a petition before the filing period begins likewise deprives us of jurisdiction.see horsehead,at id.at although the result we reach may seem harsh,we note that nothing prevented petitioners from supplementing their premature petition with a later protective petition.quoting western union,at accordingly,a pragmatic interpretation of finality does not save petitioners here finality is a necessary condition of judicial review,but it is not sufficient under the applicable statute,which limits our appellate jurisdiction ab initio to petitions filed within the period prescribed by statute.
in sum,because we find persuasive the line of cases from the court of appeals for the circuit beginning with western union,we hold that a petition to review a rulemaking order of the fcc is incurably premature when it is filed before the rulemaking order is published in the federal register.title a governs this petition for review by reference to the hobbs act,and the date of entry of the fcc reconsideration order is the same as the date the fcc gave public notice thereof.both b and a mandate such a construction.title b,which then defines public notice as publication in the federal register for rulemaking orders,is a reasonable inter
