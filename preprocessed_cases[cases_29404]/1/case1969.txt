the cleveland national air show challenges an order of the federal aviation administration faa denying its request for a waiver that would allow it to conduct its air show within a congressionally mandated zone surrounding jacobs field,the home of the cleveland indians.because the faa reasonably interpreted the waiver provision and because the air show other challenges to the waiver decision are unconvincing,we affirm.
congress has charged the faa with promot ing safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce,a,and has granted it authority to prescribe regulations and minimum standards for other practices,methods,and procedure s the administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce and national security,a.the administrator also may enact regulations and orders without notice or formal rulemaking when the administrator is of the opinion that an emergency exists related to safety in air commerce and requires immediate action.c.
one such emergency occurred on september.in response to the attacks on the pentagon and world trade center,the faa ordered the air traffic system shut down for all civil operations.when the faa permitted flights to resume,it subjected them to enhanced security restrictions.on december,for example,the faa issued notice to airmen,which created zones over any major professional or collegiate sporting event or any other major open air assembly of people unless authorized by air traffic control.at the same time,the faa established procedures allowing pilots to seek waivers from the restrictions.
on september,the faa issued notice,which superseded notice.the new regulation scaled back the number of zones,limiting them to any stadium having a seating capacity of or more in which a major league baseball,national football league,ncaa division one football,or major motor speedway event is occurring,and required pilots to observe zones from one hour before until one hour after the end of the event.notice.the notice exempted local airport arrivals and departures in contact with air traffic control as well as department of defense,law enforcement and aeromedical flight operations.once again,the faa created a waiver procedure for pilots to seek an exemption from the zone.
on february,congress entered the picture.section a of the consolidated appropriations resolution,stat,required the secretary of transportation to keep the zones established by notice in effect,to rescind all existing waivers and to grant new waivers only when the applicant fit within a listed exception.one of the exceptions allowed a waiver for operational purposes of an event,stadium,or other venue,including in the case of a sporting event equipment or parts,transport of team members to and from the event,stadium,or venue.a b.at the same time,the statute said that the secretary could modify after one year so long as the new standards provided a level of security at least equivalent to that provided by the statutory waiver policy.b.
on march,in response to this legislation,the faa issued notice,which superseded notice,provided the requisite restrictions and included the required waiver provision.
on january,congress returned to the topic in passing another appropriations appropriations act,stat.as before,the act required the faa to keep the zones of notice in effect.a.this time,however,congress required the zones over walt disney world and disneyland,created by notices and respectively,to be maintained and included a slightly modified waiver provision.id.the new waiver provision again limited the faa authority to grant waivers,permitting it to do so only for narrow reasons,including with respect to an event,stadium,or other venue for operational purposes.a b i.unlike the former provision,the new one did not allow the faa to modify the waiver procedure in one year.see id.
on each labor day weekend since,the cleveland national air show has hosted an aerial demonstration along the shore of lake erie at burke lakefront airport in cleveland,featuring the united states navy blue angels,the united states air force thunderbirds and numerous other performers.to host this event,the air show has applied each year to the faa for a certificate of waiver or authorization,which allows pilots to conduct operations that would otherwise violate faa regulations such as the rules concerning speed and minimum altitude.until august,it appears that the air show received these certificates without incident or interruption.
on august,less than two weeks before labor day,the faa responded to the air show june request for a certificate,granting it in the main but denying it for all flights on friday,september,after.in explaining its partial denial,the faa told the air show that the first pitch of a cleveland indians baseball game was scheduled for that night,putting the zone established by notice into effect.
a flurry of correspondence followed.on august,the air show sent a letter to the faa contesting the denial.the same day,an faa official sent the air show an indicating that the denial was mandated by congress.ja.on august,the faa responded to the air show and again said that congressional law required it to deny all flights in the area after,friday night.on august,the air show wrote another letter offering several reasons why the indians game and air show could run concurrently.on august,during a phone conversation,the faa granted the certificate for flights during the indians game but did so only with respect to department of defense aircraft.on august,the air show sent yet another letter contesting the faa interpretation.on september,two days before labor day,the air show wrote a fourth letter,again disputing the faa interpretation and again complaining that the denial would disrupt the air show.that same day,the air show acknowledged in a press release that a fter many discussions and much analysis,we now agree that the faa hands are tied by this law.ja quotation omitted.
on september,the air show nonetheless filed a petition for review of the faa order in this court and an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal.on september,the day of the show,this court denied the requested stay and later that day denied the air show emergency motion for rehearing.
before reaching the merits of the air show petition for review,we must assess whether we have authority to resolve this matter.article iii,of the constitution gives us authority only to decide cases or controversies,and a dispute that has become moot no longer satisfies that requirement.see chirco gateway oaks,cir.mootness occurs when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.a dispute remains live when a litigant can point to a governmental action or policy that has adversely affected and continues to affect a present interest,weinstein bradford,d per curiam quotation omitted,or can establish that the issue at hand is capable of repetition,yet evading review,pac.terminal icc.the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception applies when the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.weinstein,at.
while the air show that sparked this litigation has come and gone,the disagreement between the air show and the faa over the correct interpretation of the waiver provision is not moot.for one,the policy continues to affect a present interest of the air show.super tire eng g mccorkle,d.not only did the agency interpretation of the statute disrupt the air show program,but it also currently interferes with the air show ability to schedule future events.for over years,the air show has taken place at burke lakefront airport,which lies within the zone of jacobs field the home of the cleveland indians and of browns stadium the home of the cleveland browns.if the indians or the browns happen to schedule a game during labor day weekend,the air show will be interrupted.further complicating matters,ncaa division one football teams sometimes play games in cleveland browns stadium,pr
