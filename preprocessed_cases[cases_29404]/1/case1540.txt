we consider today,as a matter of first impression,whether a state statute,providing that a request for a due process hearing must be filed within sixty days of an agency decision,is inconsistent with the individuals with disabilities education act idea.we conclude that as long as a party seeking such a hearing is supplied with the required statutory notice,this limitations period does not conflict with federal policies embodied in the idea.
both cases before us involve requests for idea services on behalf of autistic children.the north carolina public school system has developed a nationally recognized program for educating autistic children known as the teacch program.but the parents of both children involved in these cases concluded that the lovaas program,a rival method for the education of autistic children,offered their children more hope for a normal life.accordingly,the parents placed their children in lovaas therapy.when the parents asked school officials to reimburse them for the cost of the lovaas program under the idea,those officials refused.both sets of parents continued to negotiate for a time with school administrators,and then filed petitions for due process hearings.state administrative law judges aljs dismissed all or most of the claims in these petitions as untimely.
we first briefly outline the statutory scheme at issue here and then the specific relevant facts of the two cases before us.
the idea creates a federal grant program to assist state and local agencies in educating disabled children.see supp.iv.to receive funds under the idea,states must provide disabled children with the opportunity to receive a free appropriate public education,a,by providing special education and related services in an individualized education program iep.a.t o ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education,the idea requires states to establish and follow certain procedures.a.among these is the requirement that,if parents of a disabled child and an educational agency disagree as to the appropriateness of an iep or a question of financial responsibility,parents have the right to resolve the matter at an impartial due process hearing,which shall be conducted by the state educational agency or by the local educational agency,as determined by state law or by the state educational agency.f.
north carolina has implemented the idea in,et.in this statute,as instructed by the idea,north carolina has provided parents the right to an impartial due process hearing,which is referred to in state law as a r ight of r eview at a contested case hearing.c.
the idea itself imposes no time limit on the period in which parents may request a due process hearing.the chapter of the north carolina code implementing the idea,however,directs that e xcept as otherwise provided in this section,the administrative review shall be initiated and conducted in accordance with article of chapter of the general statutes,the administrative procedure act apa.d.
the north carolina apa,in turn,provides that a contested case shall be commenced by filing a petition.a.it further provides 
unless another statute or a federal statute or regulation sets a time limitation for the filing of a petition in contested cases against a specified agency,the general limitation for the filing of a petition in a contested case is days.the time limitation,whether established by another statute,federal statute,or federal regulation,or this section,shall commence when notice is given of the agency decision to all persons aggrieved who are known to the agency by personal delivery or by the placing of the notice in an official depository of the united states postal service wrapped in a wrapper addressed to the person at the latest address given by the person to the agency.the notice shall be in writing,and shall set forth the agency action,and shall inform the persons of the right,the procedure,and the time limit to file a contested case petition.when no informal settlement request has been received by the agency prior to issuance of the notice,any subsequent informal settlement request shall not suspend the time limitation for the filing of a petition for a contested case hearing.
id.f emphasis added.
in,the family moved to north carolina from maryland in august,after had been diagnosed as autistic at a teacch center in north carolina.when the family arrived in north carolina,parents initially placed in a lovaas program.pleased with progress,in march his parents contacted the buncombe county school authorities seeking funding for the lovaas program under the idea.extensive negotiations followed,including several meetings,letters,and the preparation of a draft iep.parents repeatedly rejected any proposed placement of other than in the lovaas program.
in june,the parents decided that had substantially recovered because of the lovaas therapy and wished him placed in regular public school classes.in that same month,was medically reevaluated and school officials agreed with the parents that was no longer disabled.
in july,the parents again requested funding for past participation in the lovaas program.the parents and attorneys for the buncombe county board of education exchanged letters in august discussing settlement of this claim.in neither the august letters,nor in any prior or subsequent correspondence,did the board state that it was providing written notice of its final decision to deny all but nominal reimbursement for the lovaas program or that the applicable limitations period for filing a petition for a due process hearing was sixty days from the date of that denial.the board did forward with one of the august letters a copy of the current idea notice and attorneys fees provisions,as well as recently amended north carolina mediation provisions.
in april,the parents filed a petition for a due process hearing,seeking reimbursement for lovaas therapy.a state alj found that one of the board august settlement letters was final rejection of the parents reimbursement claim,and that their petition had been filed days after the august letter,on april.the alj concluded that the board provided the parents with the requisite notice pursuant to.accordingly,the alj held that the parents petition was untimely.a state review officer affirmed this decision.the parents then filed a complaint in the district court,which granted summary judgment to the board,reasoning that the alj had correctly ruled that the limitations period barred the claim.
the facts of cm are similar to those in cm was diagnosed with autism at age two and her parents brought her from new hampshire to north carolina to take advantage of the teacch program.in,cm began the teacch program,where she made educational progress.however,after learning of lovaas therapy,cm parents removed her from teacch and enrolled her in the lovaas program.
in december,cm parents asked henderson county school authorities to fund her participation in the lovaas program under the idea.after a series of meetings,school officials proposed an iep for the school year,which placed cm in a full day program with teacch.this iep was mailed to the parents on february,with an accompanying letter explaining why school officials believed that the iep set forth an appropriate plan for cm.the february,letter also discussed the possibility of mediation,explaining that mediation does not in any way limit or delay a formal due process hearing or other legal procedure.finally,the letter noted that y ou indicated that you have a copy of the handbook of parent rights,which outlines appeal options available and forwarded another copy of the handbook to the parents.again,neither in this letter nor in later communications did the school board state that it was providing written notice of its final decision to deny reimbursement for the lovaas program or that the applicable limitations period for requesting a due process hearing had been triggered.
the parents responded by requesting first mediation and then a reevaluation of cm by outside consultants.although the parents and school authorities exchanged numerous letters,mediation never occurred however,outside consultants did the child.as the previous iep was about to expire,school officials began to prepare a new iep for cm.after further negotiation and of cm,school officials and cm parents participated in iep meetings during august and september for the school year.the iep again proposed placing cm in the teacch program,and the parents again objected,favoring the lovaas program.
on november,the parents filed a petition for a due process hearing,seeking reimbursement for cm participation in the lovaas program for the,and school years and placement in lovaas therapy in the school year.that petition was consolidated with a petition that cm parents had filed on june,seeking reimbursement for costs associated with obtaining outside evaluation of cm.on march,another state alj not the alj that ruled in found the parents claims untimely and granted summary judgment to the henderson county schools with respect to the reimbursement claims and assertion of idea violations in the,and school years.the alj reasoned that the parents rights to file a contested case expired days after the february,correspondence.on december,after a hearing,still another alj entered a final order finding the proposed iep appropriate.on march,a state review officer affirmed all of these decisions.
the parents then filed a complaint in the district court seeking to recover on the claims rejected by the aljs,asserting new idea claims for the and school years,and a host of other new contentions.ultimately,the district court rejected all of the parents claims with respect to the limitations period,the court concluded that the alj had properly applied that limitations period to bar the parents claims for the,and school years.
we consolidated and cm on appeal and permitted the state of north carolina to intervene as an appellee,urging affirmance.we also permitted the north carolina school boards association to appear as an amicus,urging affirmance,and the united states to appear as an amicus,urging reversal.we appreciate the assistance of the intervenor and amici.
although the idea itself sets no limit on the time in which parents may request a due process hearing,no party before us nor any amici maintains that parents have an unlimited period in which to request such a hearing.rather,all agree that the most appropriate limitations period should be borrowed from state law and that borrowed period should control the time allowed to request an idea due process hearing.
when congress fails to provide a statute of limitations,federal courts borrow the most analogous state statute of limitations,provided that it is not inconsistent with underlying federal policies.see county of oneida oneida indian nation,d.therefore,we must first evaluate which north carolina statute of limitations constitutes the most analogous limitations period.next we must decide whether that period is in any way inconsistent with the federal policies contained in the idea 
the school board,the state of north carolina,and their amicus contend that the most appropriate limitations period for an initial request for an idea due process hearing in north carolina is days and that this period should,therefore,be borrowed.they rely on.d,which directs that initiation of administrative due process hearings in special education cases be conducted in accordance with the state administrative procedure act,which,in turn,provides a limitations period.see.f.
the parents and their amicus,the united states,assert that borrowing this short limitations period would be inconsistent with the idea purposes because it ensures that many legitimate claims will be forfeited through inadvertence or inability to locate representation in such a short time,rendering ineffective the protections congress created for children with disabilities.brief of united states at.furthermore,they maintain that such a short period would interfere with attempts by the parents and school to seek an amicable resolution short of litigation by forcing administrative review almost immediately upon completion of the iep process.id.they suggest that north carolina statute of limitations for statutory actions for which no limitations period is otherwise provided,see,constitutes a better borrowing choice.
logic virtually compels the conclusion that a state special education statute,specifically enacted to comply with the idea,like,constitutes the state statute most analogous to the idea.accordingly,when a state legislature incorporates into its own special education statute a limitations period,as the north carolina legislature has here,that period almost certainly constitutes the state limitations period for idea purposes.see generally schimmel spillane,cir see also cleveland.heights sch.dist.boss,cir dell board of,cir.thus,we hold the limitations period in is the period associated with the state statute,most analogous to the idea 
whether that statute of limitations is inconsistent with federal policies animating the idea,however,presents a more difficult question.to resolve it,we must first ascertain what policies congress intended to further in the idea.congress enacted the idea to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.d.
to achieve that purpose,the act embodies a federal policy that idea disputes should be resolved quickly to ensure that disabled children receive their statutorily guaranteed free appropriate public education while they can most benefit from it.the act requirement of yearly placement reassessment,d,demonstrates congress understanding that children develop quickly,and that placement decisions can soon become outdated.if a limitations period is too long,remedies may be delayed by months or years of litigation and become anachronistic before ever being implemented.the act intent would obviously be thwarted if placement decisions were not carried out until after a child could benefit from those placements.senator williams,the idea principal author,recognized this in the final senate debate,stating that i can not emphasize enough that delay in resolving matters regarding the education program of a handicapped child is extremely detrimental to his development.cong.rec.
an equally important idea policy is to encourage parents to participate in the education of their disabled children and to provide them with the procedural tools to enforce the mandate of the act.indeed,the supreme court has specifically recognized the centrality of this federal policy 
it seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.
board of educ.rowley,d.
thus,the idea requires that schools collaborate with parents in developing ieps,d b,directs states to provide a due process hearing for parents who disagree with school authorities decisions involving their child education,f,and establishes a parental right to file an action in federal court if dissatisfied with the result of that due process hearing,i.an unduly short limitations period might eliminate the intended collaborative nature of the idea parties will not continue to negotiate if parents are forced too quickly to initiate a due process hearing to preserve their rights.moreover,to take advantage of their right to a due process hearing and judicial review,parents must have sufficient time to understand any adverse decision by school authorities,evaluate any idea claim arising from an adverse decision,hire an attorney if necessary,and then proceed to challenge the adverse decision.congress did not establish procedural rights as impediments to idea claims or as a means to foreclose parental involvement in their children education.rather,these rights were created to supply a simple and efficient method to encourage parental participation and facilitate parental enforcement of the idea.
so important did congress find this policy that it specifically directed school officials to provide parents of disabled children with all necessary information regarding the procedures guaranteed by the act so that parents could take advantage of its protections.for example,the idea requires school authorities to supply detailed written notice whenever they propose or refuse to initiate or change the identification,evaluation,or placement of a child.see b and c.the act also mandates that at several distinct phases of negotiations between parents and school officials,school officials must provide parents with a procedural safeguard notice.see d.again,the notice must be detailed and,among other things,must contain information about the right to a due process hearing.see d.the policy behind these detailed notice requirements is obvious.congress wanted to eliminate the possibility that disabled children would lose their right to benefits or that parents would forfeit their role in their children education because of ignorance of the act and its procedural safeguards hence,congress placed the onus upon school authorities to inform parents of their idea rights.
in the context of original judicial idea actions sometimes inaccurately described as appeals from state administrative due process hearings,see kirkpatrick lenoir.bd.of,cir,federal courts have struggled to accommodate these competing policies.some have upheld short limitations periods as consistent with the policy of speedy resolution of disputes and simply ignored the question of whether such short periods improperly interfere with parental involvement and procedural rights.see,boss,at adopting limitations period adler educ.of new york,cir adopting limitations period.other courts have found short limitations periods fundamentally inconsistent with the idea policy of parental participation in decision making procedures and its panoply of guaranteed procedural rights,and so have rejected such periods without much consideration of the countervailing policy of quick resolution of idea disputes.see,birmingham omaha sch,cir scokin texas,cir tokarcik forest hills sch,cir.
the cases have attempted to take account of all relevant federal policies.they have upheld a short limitations period only when satisfied that it was accompanied by features that could significantly mitigate infringement on procedural rights and parental participation most notably,these courts have found a requirement in the idea that school authorities provide clear notice of the relevant limitations period.see,spiegler district of columbia.see also amann town of stow,cir.if parents receive such notice and nonetheless fail to act within the allotted time,their claims are barred,see amann,at,but if parents do not receive this notice,school authorities can not invoke limitations against them,see spiegler,at.
in schimmel,we,too,attempted to balance the various federal policies embodied in the idea.we concluded that a very short limitations period would conflict with the federal policies,and instead virginia statute of limitations best furthered these policies.id.at.our most serious concern with the suggested alternative limitations period was that parents unrepresented by counsel might be unaware of and so unfairly penalized by a very short limitations period.id.although we recognized that it had been held that the idea required that educational agencies inform parents of the applicable limitations period,it was not clear to us that the idea actually impose d such a duty on educational agencies.id.moreover,in schimmel,the virginia statute of limitations clearly contained no such obligation,and the defendant school board specifically contended that it had no duty to inform the parents of the statute of limitations.id.given these facts,we held that the statute of limitations str uck an appropriate balance between the need for speedy resolution of disputes and the need to ensure that the parties have a fair opportunity to obtain judicial review.id.at 
recently,in manning fairfax.sch,cir,we considered what limitations period applied to initiation of idea administrative due process hearings in virginia.we were not asked to apply a short to statute of limitations,id.at,but rather,were faced with a choice of no limitations period,a limitations period,or the period.id.at.in this context,we followed schimmel and borrowed the same general limitations period borrowed in that case.we reasoned that t here is nothing to persuade us that disputes in administrative idea proceedings are so different in nature from those in judicial idea actions as to justify application of disparate limitations periods.id.at moreover,we quoted with approval schimmel determination that the limitations period struck an appropriate balance for the competing policies embodied in the idea,remarking that this period was not so prohibitively short that it undermine d the idea policy of providing parents an opportunity to protect their disabled children educational rights.id.
schimmel,manning,and the cases provide some helpful guidance in elaborating on the relevant policy concerns and appropriate balancing approach.moreover,schimmel establishes circuit precedent that a generally applicable,very short limitations period for idea actions in federal court,without any requirement that school authorities provide clear notice of the limitations period,is inconsistent with federal policies embodied in the idea.although in manning we were not confronted with an argument urging adoption of a very short limitations period,we certainly suggested that for similar reasons such an abbreviated limitations period for initiation of an idea administrative due process hearing would also conflict with these policies.see manning,at and relying on schimmel determination as to the proper balance of federal interests,holding that the period was not prohibitively short,and noting that school authorities did not claim that a or limitations period applied.however,no schimmel,not manning,not any of the considered the application of a statutory scheme like that encompassed in.d and f to requests for idea administrative due process hearings 
indeed,the north carolina statutory scheme apparently differs in a fundamental respect from any statute previously considered by any court in any idea context.it contains an explicit requirement that school authorities clearly and fully notify parents of the limitations period.under north carolina law,the limitations period only commences when notice is given of the agency decision to all persons aggrieved who are known to the agency.f.moreover,t he notice shall be in writing,and shall set forth the agency action,and shall inform the aggrieved persons of the right,the procedure,and the time limit to file a contested case petition.id.emphasis added.thus,without clear and complete written notice that a final agency decision has been taken,that parents can contest the decision by filing a petition for a due process hearing,and that such petitions must be filed within days of the contested agency decision,f abbreviated limitations period is never triggered.not only do the school authorities concede that the statute so directs,see,brief of appellee buncombe county bd.of educ.at section f only applies to cases where a school system triggers the provision by providing written notice of the limitations period and notice of the school system decision,but a review of north carolina case law indicates that its courts would not countenance any departure from,or relaxation of,statutory requirements.see clay employment sec.comm n,statutes of limitations should be not extended by construction.pearson nationwide mut.ins,requiring strict compliance with statutory notice requirement williams bowden,same cameron barkley american ins,notice must be in exact form specified in statute.
does f notice requirement sufficiently accommodate the federal policies we found inconsistent with the short limitations period in schimmel obviously,this clear and specific notice provision does much to further the idea strong commitment to informing parents fully of their procedural rights.it goes hand in glove with the extensive notice provisions contained in the idea itself.see b,c,and d.moreover,the notice requirement in f ameliorates o ur most serious concern in schimmel,that parents would be unaware of and thus penalized by a very short limitations period.schimmel,at.
on the other hand,this limitations period although twice as long as that at issue in schimmel does not provide a vast amount of time for parents to exercise the right to a due process hearing.this abbreviated time period also may be in some tension with the idea policy of encouraging parental collaboration in placement decisions involving their children.therefore,although the notice provision in f goes a long way to alleviating the concerns we voiced in schimmel,it is not clear that such a provision alone makes an otherwise limitations period acceptable.given the holdings in schimmel and manning,if the limitations period at issue here had not been specifically selected by the state legislature to apply to these actions,it would be a close question whether circuit precedent required us to find it contrary to the policies embodied in the idea.
but,unlike the statutes at issue in schimmel or manning,the north carolina legislature has specifically mandated that the limitations period applies to idea disputes.thus.c d,the portion of the north carolina code implementing the idea and establishing idea due process hearings,provides that administrative review shall be initiated and conducted in accordance with,which in turn sets forth the limitations period.moreover,in doing so,north carolina has acted in full accord with the congressional directive that states conduct administrative due process hearings as determined by state law.f.
manning and schimmel did not implicate an attempt by a state to legislate a statute of limitations specifically for idea proceedings.when a state does do this,as north carolina has,we believe a federal court should give the chosen state limitations period special deference when determining whether it conflicts with policies animating the idea.see boss,at accordingly,although we recognize that in schimmel we concluded that policies embodied in the idea required that we reject a short limitations period,we believe a different result is required here.principally because the statute at issue here,unlike that in schimmel,contains an express requirement of clear and unambiguous notice of the agency action and of the commencement and time of the limitations period,and also because,again unlike schimmel,the state expressly designated that this abbreviated limitations period govern idea administrative proceedings,we conclude that adoption of this limitations period is not inconsistent with federal policies animating the idea.
the parents in each case before us contend that even if we should hold,as we now have,that the limitations period applies to requests for idea administrative due process hearings in north carolina,it does not bar their claims because they did not receive the required notice of the limitations period.the school authorities,of course,argue to the contrary.in each case they rely on certain letters sent to the parents.
in,the school system maintains that two letters sent to the parents in response to the parents settlement demand meet the statutory requirements of f.on july,father mailed to the school system representative a long letter attempting to settle the parents claims for reimbursement and threatening resort to a due process hearing if the school board did not provide reimbursement within ten days.the school responded in letters dated august,and august.the first august letter states that the school system was inclined to make a of some portion of the expenses actually incurred,but notes that p rior to making any offer,however,the board of education must be consulted and must approve the payment.the letter explains that school authorities hoped to obtain settlement authority,if any,within the next week.it then notes the parents threat and remarks that the parents of course,have the right to file a due process petition at any time,however,the reality of school systems requires that the governing board be consulted and that process takes time.the letter encloses copies of the most current authorization of the idea and recent north carolina legislation amending state idea mediation rules.the second letter is very short and simply makes a conditional to settle the parents claim for pending final approval by the board.
in cm,school authorities rely upon a letter sent by the director of programs for exceptional children of the henderson county schools,to cm parents on february.the letter accompanies that year proposed iep for cm and explains in some detail the decisions made in that iep and the process leading to these decisions,including previous discussions with the parents.the letter then mentions the possibility of mediation,noting that while not mandatory it is certainly a positive step in resolving differences and does not in any way limit or delay a formal due process hearing or other legal procedure.the letter concludes by noting that the parents had indicated that they had a copy of the north carolina handbook on parents rights,july,edition,which outlines appeal options available,and encloses another copy of the handbook.
in both cases,the aljs determined that these facts demonstrated that the school authorities provided the parents with the requisite notice pursuant to b.we find no error in the historical facts found by the aljs,but we believe that the aljs misapplied the law to the facts the school authorities did not provide the statutorily required notice.although f does not require notice in a specific form,it does,as the school boards and state concede,mandate that parents be provided express written notice of the commencement of the limitations period.as the state puts it,the its be applied to parents without notice.brief of intervenor state of north carolina at see also brief of appellee buncombe county bd.of educ.at in order for a claim to be barred by the limitation in north carolina a school system must affirmatively provide parents with notice of the limitation.in neither nor cm did the school system affirmatively provide the parents with the required notice,and so by its terms the limitations period can not be applied to the parents.
section f instructs that the limitations period begins only when aggrieved persons are provided written notice of the agency decision the notice must set forth the agency action and inform aggrieved persons of the right,the procedure,and the time limit to file a contested case petition.f.to satisfy these requirements,the written notice must communicate that the agency has acted and that this action is one that triggers the right to file,within sixty days,a contested case petition for a due process hearing.unless the school authorities do this,parents,who will often have already engaged in lengthy negotiations with the school system,will likely and understandably conclude that a school is simply stating its present bargaining posture,which is open to further negotiation and does not trigger any limitations period.the instant cases illustrate this precise problem.
in,the letters on which the school board relies merely articulate a conditional settlement.they were part of negotiations offers and exchanged in this context are rarely considered by their senders or recipients as the final word on anything,even when they claim to be so.of course,the school system letters here did not make this claim.rather,both were expressly made contingent on approval by the board of education of buncombe county.indeed,it is hard for us to believe that,had the parents accepted the school system,and the board had failed to ratify it,school authorities would not have expected more negotiations to have ensued thereafter these letters were part of a lengthy correspondence between the parents and the school.there was nothing about them to indicate to the parents that they had more significance than any other letters received from school officials.parents can
