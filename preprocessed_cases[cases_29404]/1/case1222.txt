opinion of the court 
william allen complains of the determination of the social security administration agency that allen is capable of substantial gainful employment.allen was awarded social security benefits in based on his disorder,and schizoid condition.these benefits were discontinued in based on the agency determination that allen condition had improved.allen appealed this decision and the appeals council remanded the decision,specifically requiring,among other things,that if warranted by the expanded record the administrative law judge alj obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant occupational base allen urges that the ruling of the alj on remand denying his continued benefits was not supported by substantial evidence because the alj relied on the grids notwithstanding the fact that the impairment from which he suffers was not exertional.allen urges that the commissioner was required to come forward with testimony from a vocational expert regarding the occupational base in light of the nature of allen limitations.
the district court affirmed the determination of the agency that allen condition had improved,reasoning that because the findings and opinions of plaintiff treating,examining and sources confirm that plaintiff condition improved to where he could perform substantial gainful activity,plaintiff failed to show that his medical impairment resulted in functional limitations that precluded all successful gainful activity.the district court also held that reliance on the grids,as well as on social security rulings,was sufficient in order for the commissioner to satisfy its burden of proof and the alj had discretion whether or not to call a vocational expert.while we agree generally with the district court ruling that the commissioner can satisfy his burden in this manner,we disagree with the way in which the alj applied the social security ruling at issue here,and we will reverse the district court order and remand for it to refer the matter to the agency for further findings 
we review the agency factual findings only to determine whether the administrative record contains substantial evidence supporting the findings.see g sykes apfel,cir.we exercise plenary review over all legal issues.see id.
background 
allen grant of benefits came up for periodic continuing disability review in october,pursuant to sections i and of the social security act,i and,at which time the issues were whether his medical condition had improved,and whether he had the ability to obtain gainful employment.see.
when benefits were originally awarded to him in,allen had completed a functional assessment questionnaire,in which he indicated that he lived with his mother,needed help taking care of his personal needs,and did not prepare his own meals.he indicated that on some days he did not get out of bed.his mother did the shopping,and he barely left the house.he stated,i think i god,so i waste money.further,with respect to his interests and recreational activities,he noted that all he did was to sleep and fantasize,and that he did visit others because i do trust humans.asked to elaborate on his medical condition,he wrote sometimes i think the world is coming to an end,that i god,that i the devil and that i the richest man in the world.i also think the tv is talking to me.
at that time,edward tabbanor opined that allen had a history of emotional difficulties,and that although he was on medication and is pleased with his present adjustment he is functioning marginally and is involved in no organized activities.he should be encouraged to seek the services of vocational rehabilitation.tabbanor concluded that allen was not a good candidate for gainful employment.
the agency terminated allen benefits in january,based on its own determination that,as of november,he had the ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.reconsideration of the denial was denied,but allen then requested a hearing before an alj,which was held in may,at which he appeared and testified.
the alj considered the applicable standard,namely,that he needed to determine whether there had been a decrease in the medical severity based on changes in symptoms,signs,laboratory findings manifested by the impairment,noting that the medical improvement must be related to ability to work.if there was a medical improvement and an increase in the individual functional capacity to do basic work activities,the alj noted,he would determine that medical improvement related to the ability to do work has occurred.b.
the alj cited extensive improvement in allen condition,giving appropriate details as to specific areas of improvement,and describing the findings of two physicians,edward tabbanor and luis zeiguer.the alj concluded,in summary fashion,that based on the evidence,the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform substantial gainful activity,including his past relevant work as a salesperson.the alj then concluded that the benefits had been correctly terminated.
on appeal,the appeals council took the alj to task for failing to include an evaluation of the severity of allen mental impairment or effects pursuant to a an evaluation of the credibility of allen subjective complaints as required by social security ruling p and and an indication of allen exertional or nonexertional limitations.the appeals council stated that it was unable to determine how the decision has been reached that the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work.
the appeals council then remanded allen case to the alj,instructing the alj to further evaluate the claimant subjective complaints,evaluate his mental impairment in accordance with the technique described in a c,consider the maximum residual functional capacity,and if warranted by the expanded record,obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant occupational base social security ruling.the appeals council included the following in concluding its directive the hypothetical questions should reflect the specific established by the record as a whole.the administrative law judge will ask the vocational expert to identify examples of appropriate jobs and to state the incidence of such jobs in the national economy.
a hearing was held on august,at which allen appeared and testified.allen testified that he had completed college and had taken some graduate courses.he had held a few jobs,as a draftsman,a salesperson,and a telemarketer,but was fired from every job within three months.he was on medication,and took public transportation to get to the doctor office and to the hearing.he testified that he had a short fuse and sometimes would make him angry.working in a workplace setting was difficult when he experienced manic episodes and he missed work because of lack of sleep.
the record before the alj included assessments from three doctors.robles,who had treated allen in at the newark beth israel medical center,noted that allen bipolar disorder made him likely to decompensate if under pressure or with large groups of people.tabbanor,who had rendered an opinion when allen first qualified for benefits,opined that allen was compliant with medical supervision and lithium medication with fair results.he presents as a fair candidate for resumption of gainful employment.zeiguer noted that allen explained that he has not sustained employment because under stress of employment production demands he tends to develop paranoid ideation and gets into conflicts.the opinion then went on to note the potential for decompensation,although experiencing very limited psychiatric hospitalization and concluded that allen showed good enough concentration for simple repetitive chores.
the alj issued his opinion on november,referencing the opinions of tabbanor and zeiguer,and noted that the beth israel psychiatric records indicated that the claimant was doing well and his condition had stabilized.the alj did not refer to the decompensation note contained in robles report.the alj found allen symptoms to be not fully supported by objective medical evidence alone,and his allegations that he was unable to work after november,because of his mental impairments to be not fully credible.
the alj then noted that allen impairment was severe,but not of listing severity.he then followed the dictates of a and a,examining allen residual functional capacity,noting that allen had mild limitations in his activities of daily living and concentration,moderate limitations of social functioning which decrease when he takes his medication,and that he had not experienced episodes of decompensation.the alj concluded that allen had made medical improvement in the symptoms of bipolar disorder.this was based primarily upon tabbanor opinion in as compared to his first opinion,in.drawing on tabbanor opinion that claimant was capable of gainful employment,and zeiguer opinion that claimant was capable of performing simple chores,the alj concluded that allen had the residual functional capacity for simple routine repetitive work at all exertional levels.however,he was not capable of his past relevant work,as a salesman,because it was classified as,and claimant was no longer capable of performing work.
stating that the commissioner had the burden of showing that significant jobs existed in the local or national economy that claimant was capable of performing,given his medically determinable impairments,and functional limitations,the alj then concluded 
the claimant has a college education and a work background.the claimant is capable of performing a full range of unskilled work at all exertional levels.a finding of not disabled was reached by application of rule,appendix,subpart p,regulations part,used as a framework for decision making.the mental limitations for simple,routine,repetitive work do not significantly erode the base of jobs that claimant is capable of performing.ssr accordingly,in reaching the ultimate conclusion regarding the availability of jobs in the economy that allen is capable of performing,the alj relied on ssr without requiring testimony from a vocational expert.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the alj decision,finding substantial evidence in the record to support the alj findings that allen condition had medically improved since november,that this medical improvement was related to allen ability to work and that allen had the residual functional capacity to perform simple,repetitive work at all exertion levels.thus,the district court held that the alj was correct to conclude that although allen could not likely return to his past relevant work,there existed other jobs in the national economy at the sedentary level that allen could perform.the district court further held that the alj did not have to consult a vocational expert in order to make his determinations as to whether allen was able to perform basic mental functions,as the decision whether the consult such an expert was within the discretion of the alj.the district court noted that the alj distinctively noted that based on social security ruling,he found that plaintiff mental limitations did not significantly erode the base of unskilled work available.this court may defer to the ssr since there exists no evidence in the record,nor allegations by plaintiff,to establish that ssr is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the act and once published,ssrs are binding on all components of the social security act.walton halter,cir.
discussion 
on appeal,allen challenges the alj reliance on the grids when presented with nonexertional impairments.allen contends that the alj ruling runs contrary to our opinion in sykes apfel,cir,in which we stated 
the commissioner can not determine that nonexertional impairments do not significantly erode occupational base under guidelines grids without taking additional vocational evidence establishing that fact.
allen posits that in sykes,we specifically forbade the alj from invoking the dubious framework exception by considering himself or herself to be a vocational expert.allen contends,in addition,that the alj decision violates the agency own rulings and regulations.
while allen argument has an initial appeal,because the grid framework clearly classifies work in terms of strength,thus tying it to physical exertion,nonetheless,as we discuss below,the agency has used,and the courts are thus directed to employ,the grids as a framework when nonexertional limitations are also at issue.here we are presented with exclusively nonexertional limitations by virtue of allen mental diagnosis.accordingly,we must determine whether the grids still are an appropriate framework and whether if nonexertional limitations are present,a vocational expert must be called by the commissioner in order for it to meet its burden at the step 
here,the alj relied on the regulations as a framework,and then relied on social security ruling ssr in reaching his ultimate conclusion that allen could engage in substantial gainful employment allen contends that only a vocational expert could make that last link,and that relying on an agency ruling does not satisfy the agency burden.
the issue before us,then,in the broadest sense,requires an inquiry into the role that social security rulings play in agency determinations,and,more specifically,whether,here,reference to the specific ruling was an appropriate substitute for the testimony of a vocational expert 
we start our analysis with the supreme court opinion in heckler campbell,d,in which the supreme court clearly established the general rule that the agency may rely on rulemaking authority to determine issues that do not require consideration.in that case,a challenge was leveled at the guidelines themselves,with campbell arguing that the alj had the obligation to examine specific types of work in order to determine whether she could obtain substantial gainful employment when presented with the issue as to what jobs she could perform,given her back condition,which permitted her to do only light work.the alj rejected that argument,and relied on the guidelines in his finding that a significant number of jobs existed that someone in her condition could perform.the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed,holding that the secretary must engage in individualized scrutiny of her limitations and possible relevant jobs,and must identify specific alternative occupations available in the national economy that would be suitable for the claimant.at.
the supreme court rejected the court of appeals view,noting that after the alj makes the assessment as to the claimant individual abilities,he must then determine whether jobs exist that a person having claimant qualifications could perform.with respect to that second inquiry,the court noted 
the second inquiry requires the secretary to determine an issue that is not unique to each types and number of jobs that exist in the national economy.this type of general factual issue may be resolved as fairly through rulemaking as by introducing the testimony of vocational experts at each disability hearing.
thus,heckler stands for the broad proposition that the commissioner can satisfy its burden of proof regarding availability of jobs in the national economy via rulemaking rather than requiring actual evidence on a basis thus,agency rulemaking,as long as it is not arbitrary or capricious,is permissible as a substitute for individualized determinations,thus doing away with the need for evidence to support the determination at step.
in walton halter,cir,we had occasion to examine the extent to which the agency rules and regulations are binding on the agency.there,the commissioner reached a conclusion with respect to the onset date of the claimant disease based upon medical evidence which was not clearly dispositive.we concluded that the alj could not,consistent with ssr and the necessity of establishing an onset date based on substantial evidence,simply draw an inference from the record evidence that lacked medical support.id.at.in other words,because ssr required a medical basis for the alj conclusion,the alj determination that ran afoul of the ruling was not supported by substantial evidence.in this way,we required adherence to the ssrs,finding them to be controlling.
more recently,in,our court had occasion to consider the application of these directives in the context of a different fact pattern,namely,one that involved nonexertional as well as exertional limitations.in sykes apfel,sykes had a number of severe impairments,including left eye blindness.the alj in sykes relied on the guidelines as a framework and,on review,we concluded 
u nder heckler campbell,and in the absence of the rulemaking establishing the facts of an undiminished occupational base,the commissioner can not determine that a claimant nonexertional impairments do not significantly erode his occupational base under the guidelines without either taking additional vocational evidence establishing as much or providing notice to the claimant of his intention to take official notice of this fact and providing the claimant with an opportunity to counter the conclusion.
in sykes,the alj had denied sykes application,summarily concluding that the exclusion of jobs requiring binocular vision from light work positions did not significantly compromise sykes broad occupational base.we disagreed,and concluded that either vocational evidence or rulemaking establishing the fact of an undiminished occupational base was necessary.id.at.
allen contends that the alj ruling here,and thus the district court as well,is contrary to sykes.however,whereas sykes spoke to the situation in which rulemaking regarding the degree of diminution in the occupational base was lacking,here the alj specifically referred to rule ssr.ssr addresses the precise issue presented here,namely,the interplay between nonexertional impairments and the grids,which we will discuss more fully below.
after the sykes opinion,the agency issued an acquiescence ruling to specifically address how the agency would deal with issues of this kind in cases within the geographic limits of the third circuit.there,the agency noted that,thereafter,at step,the agency would not use the grid framework exclusively when there were nonexertional limitations,but would,in addition 
take or produce vocational evidence,such as from a vocational expert,the dot,or other similar evidence such as a learned treatise or 
provide notice that we intend to take or are taking administrative notice of the fact that the particular nonexertional limitation s does not significantly erode the occupational base,and allow the claimant the opportunity to respond before we deny the claim.
however,the agency then went on to specifically state 
this ruling does not apply to claims where we rely on an ssr that includes a statement explaining how the particular nonexertional limitation s under consideration in the claim being adjudicated affects the claimant occupational job base.when we rely on such an ssr to support our finding that jobs exist in the national economy that the claimant can do,we will include a citation to the ssr in our determination or decision 
accordingly,the alj use of the guidelines as a framework in this case,and his reliance upon an ssr at step to determine allen occupational job base is not an improper application of either the case law or rules established by the agency.further,from the standpoint of common sense,the grids use for exertion level are not totally irrelevant if a claimant has only a nonexertional impairment,for there would still be an applicable exertional level,the claimant could do work requiring heavy exertion.
however,the alj reliance on ssr in this instance,and in summary fashion,gives us pause.while the agency excerpted a certain portion of ssr as conclusive on the relationship between the type and degree of mental limitation and the size of the occupational base,nonetheless,the alj conclusion in this regard fails to focus on any of allen limitations.instead,the alj opinion parrots the attributes of work,not the limitations experienced by allen,noting that allen was capable of performing a full range of unskilled work at all exertional levels but then stating,as the complete mental impairment analysis,the following the mental limitations for simple,routine,repetitive work do not significantly erode the base of jobs the claimant is capable of performing.ssr.
the difficulty we have with this reasoning is that the appeals council in its remand order specifically admonished the alj to state the claimant exertional and nonexertional limitations.instead,the alj refers to ssr as though it resolves the issue.however,ssr is a ruling that specifically addresses the relationship of different mental impairments to job activity.
ssr provides that where individuals have nonexertional limitations of function or environmental restrictions,the table rules rules still provide a framework for consideration of how much the individual work capability is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs.where a person has solely a nonexertional impairment t he table rules do not direct conclusions of disabled or not disabled.conclusions must,instead,be based on the principles in the appropriate sections of the regulations the ruling then notes that its purpose is to clarify policies applicable in cases involving the evaluation of solely nonexertional impairments.wl at.
the policy statement of ssr notes that the first issue to be considered is the residual functional capacity reflecting the severity of the particular nonexertional impairment with its limiting effects on the broad world of work.id.at.the ssr makes clear that,while there may be a need to consult a vocational resource,the publications listed in sections and of the regulations will be sufficient vocational resources for relatively simple issues.in more complex cases,a person or persons with specialized knowledge would be helpful.id.at.
within the discussion of mental impairments in the ruling are several examples of different attributes of individuals which would,or would not,limit the occupational base for jobs in the national economy.the ruling contains a general discussion that merits repeating 
given no medically determinable impairment which limits exertion,the first issue is how much the person occupational entire exertional span from sedentary work through heavy or very heavy reduced by the effects of the nonexertional impairment s.this may range from very little to very much,depending upon the nature and extent of the impairment s.in many cases a decision maker would need to consult a vocational resource.
the ssr then proceeds to address certain examples of nonexertional impairments,commenting on their impact on the occupational base.in introducing the topic of mental impairments,it states the decision maker must not assume that failure to meet or equal a listed mental impairment equates with capacity to do at least unskilled work.this decision requires careful consideration of the assessment of rfc.id.at.the ssr also includes a discussion of the impact of the inability to handle stress,and addresses how an individual with a difficult reaction to the demands of work may have difficulty meeting the requirements of even a job.further,it notes that the reaction to stress is highly individualized.the section ends with the notation that any limitations created by an individual response to demands of the workplace must be reflected in the rfc assessment.id.at.
notwithstanding the alj reference to,and apparent reliance on,this ruling,we are at a loss to find within the ruling itself the conclusion the alj seems to find regarding the occupational base for one with allen mental limitations.
the alj makes broad statements regarding allen rfc,as we referenced above,but his conclusion only addresses in general fashion the mental limitations for simple,routine,repetitive work.it does not reference any aspect of ssr that relates allen particular nonexertional limitations to the occupational job base.thus,we have difficulty in determining what the alj believed were allen mental limitations for simple,routine,repetitive work,and how they fit into the various categories or examples set forth in ssr.while,surely,the agency can use its rules as a substitute for individualized determination,nonetheless,there must be a fit bet
