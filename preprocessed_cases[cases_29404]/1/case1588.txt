the united states brought suit against arthur mcferrin mcferrin seeking to recover a tax credit that the government alleges was erroneously paid by the internal revenue service irs to mcferrin.after a six day bench trial,the district court held that the government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the tax credit was not properly supported and,consequently,should not have been granted.the district court ordered repayment of the erroneously paid refund plus interest.for the following reasons,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
mcferrin is a prominent chemical who kmco,kmco,a corporation,in.kmco manufactures commodity and specialty chemicals,mainly for the petrochemical industry.mcferrin owns three other corporations which are related to kmco kmco port arthur,kmtex kmtex,south coast acquisition,sc acquisition,and south coast deleware,sc deleware.sc acquisition and sc deleware are the only partners in another corporation,south coast terminals sc terminals.this case concerns tax returns filed by these corporations and mcferrin for tax year and,specifically,tax credits for increasing research activities under.mcferrin owns all of the corporations,and their income was part of his income tax return.
in,all of the corporations and mcferrin originally filed tax returns for tax year and did not claim any credits for increasing research activities.in may,kmco contracted with alliantgroup,to conduct a study to determine if it was eligible for an increasing research tax credit.based upon this study,in september,mcferrin and all of the corporations filed amended tax returns claiming a credit for increasing research activities.mcferrin income tax return claimed an overall credit of.less than a month later,the irs,as a result of a clerical error,issued the refund,which,including interest,was for.
on october,the united states filed suit to recover this amount plus interest.its complaint alleged,among other things,that the amended return included no supporting documents and thus there were no documents provided to substantiate the claimed credits.on summary judgment,the district court found that sc terminals amended return was untimely filed and therefore mcferrin had to return the portion of the refund relating to sc terminals and its owners sc deleware and sc acquisition.the issue of whether the tax credits to kmco and kmtex were substantiated was tried for six days before the district court which ruled in the government favor and ordered mcferrin to repay the refund with interest.
the district court held in its conclusions of law that research was only qualified research if it expanded or refined the existing principles in the field,had a high threshold of innovation,and had broad effect.in addition,the court held that qualified research only applied if a process of experimentation involving the forming and testing of hypotheses had occurred,rather than trial and error testing.using these definitions,the court determined that while some of the projects may have involved some research,it was unpersuaded that those few projects involved qualified research for purposes of the research tax credit.the district court also determined that there were no records of the hours worked on any given project or of the hours worked or supplies used that involved research.the court was unwilling to credit the rough estimates given by employees years after the fact.

in an action to recover an improperly paid refund,the united states,as plaintiff,bears the ultimate burden of proof to show not only that some amount has been erroneously refunded but also how much that amount is.soltermann united states,cir see also united states commercial bank of peoria,cir in an action to recover an erroneous refund,the government bears the burden of proof.tax credits are a matter of legislative grace,are only allowed as clearly provided for by statute,and are narrowly construed.see stinson estate united states,cir see also helvering nw.steel rolling mills.new colonial ice helvering.taxpayers are required to retain records necessary to substantiate a claimed credit.see reg.a,e.if the taxpayer can establish that qualified expenses occurred,however,then the court should estimate the allowable tax credit.see cohan comm r,cir t he board should make as close an approximation as it can,bearing heavily if it chooses upon the taxpayer whose inexactitude is of his own making.but to allow nothing at all appears to us inconsistent with saying that something was spent.see also mendes comm r,wl refusing to estimate costs as taxpayer had failed to substantiate any qualified deduction fudim comm r,cch,accepting that qualified research occurred,and then estimating the time spent on that research based on testimony and other evidence in the record.
discussion 
failure to sufficiently plead 
mcferrin first argues that the substantiation claims tried before the district court should have been dismissed because the government failed to plead with the particularity required by federal rule of civil procedure.we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to dismiss.coop.benefit adm rs,ogden,cir.we accept as true all facts,viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.in re katrina canal breaches,cir internal quotation marks omitted.rule states that i n alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.under the more general liberal notice standards of federal rule of civil procedure a,all that is required is a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.
this case was tried based on a failure to substantiate tax claims with sufficient documentation.mcferrin argues that because the government claimed that he misrepresented facts,it was required to meet the more rigorous rule standards.but no fraud or mistake was alleged.rather,the government only alleged a failure to document,which appeared several times on the face of the complaint.there was therefore no need for the government to plead a lack of substantiation with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of rule,as there was no allegation of fraud or mistake,only a lack of documentation.as such,the district court did not err in allowing the case to go to trial 
qualified research under

in determining that discovering information meant going beyond the current state of knowledge in the field,the district court relied on cases from other circuits as well as the tax court.see eustace comm r,cir agreeing with the tax court that research must produce an innovation in underlying principle united stationers,united states,cir q ualifying research must go beyond the current state of knowledge in that or refine its principles.norwest subsidiaries comm r,wl the fact that the information is new to the taxpayer,but not new to others,is not sufficient for such information to come within the meaning of discovery for purposes of this test.but see tax accounting software united states,cir t he taxpayer must show that he discovered new in
