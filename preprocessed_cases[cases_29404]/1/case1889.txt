ii.background 
james dixon,is an male who worked as a special agent for the fbi detroit field office between and.between and,dixon served as the applicant coordinator for the detroit office applicant program.in this position,dixon was responsible for all aspects of recruiting new agents to the fbi for the detroit office.
from november to february,assistant special agent in charge robert reutter oversaw the applicant program,and directly supervised dixon work.dixon alleges that reutter exhibited racial animus towards him and henry glaspie,dixon colleague and assistant in managing the applicant program,who is also.for instance,dixon testified that reutter expressed concern to him and glaspie about two agents running the applicant program and,therefore,required them to report their activities on a weekly basis.reutter also allegedly stated that he did not want the boards that interviewed prospective new agents to consist of three agents when minority applicants were being interviewed.dixon also testified that while reutter was jovial and social with white agents,he was chilling and cold to him,that reutter condescended to agents,and that he treated agents as though he thought they were incompetent.
in december,dixon complained about reutter discriminatory behavior to special agent in charge anthony davis,who is also.according to dixon,davis said that dixon allegations about reutter concerned him and that he would take care of the problem.in february,davis relieved reutter of his position overseeing the applicant program and davis himself took over those duties.the attorney general concedes that reutter dismissal from the applicant program was apparently as a result of dixon complaints.
in approximately june,dixon transferred from the applicant program to the white collar crime unit.a few months later,in november,reutter became the head of the white collar crime unit and remained in that post until he left the detroit field office in.during this period,reutter and dixon did not have direct contact,but reutter was dixon supervisor.as part of his responsibilities,reutter reviewed the annual performance evaluations prepared by dixon immediate supervisor and approved them.dixon testified that reutter had the authority either to approve or disapprove of these performance evaluations.during his tenure in the white collar crime unit,dixon testified that his evaluations were always favorable,and included ratings of superior and excellent.
in,dixon resigned from the fbi to assist his wife in a business venture.in,dixon applied for reinstatement.the fbi initiated the reinstatement process by interviewing dixon and references provided by dixon as friends or acquaintances employed by the fbi,which included carey thornton thornton,john anthony anthony,and larry kuhl kuhl.
the fbi interviewed anthony,and he recommended against reinstating dixon.anthony based his negative review on an alleged incident that occurred in the early,when dixon was assigned to applicant recruitment in detroit,and anthony was the principal legal advisor.the two men,along with special agent robert nelson nelson,sat on an interview panel together.dixon was the lead interviewer on this panel and was responsible for submitting the panel opinion of the interviewee.
as anthony recalled the incident,the panel voted to reject a minority applicant,but dixon subsequently changed the results to a favorable determination without nelson or anthony permission or knowledge.according to anthony,he confronted dixon,and dixon acknowledged that he had changed the rating,and apologized.because of the incident,however,anthony questioned dixon integrity and honesty,opining that dixon was not sufficiently trustworthy to work for the fbi.
given this incident,bureau investigators also interviewed nelson.nelson essentially conveyed to investigators what they heard from anthony,although nelson added that,when it happened,he reported dixon conduct to then assistant special agent in charge reutter.apparently,a formal report of the incident was never made,as evidenced by the fact that dixon personnel file with the fbi contained no mention of it.in nelson opinion,the fbi would make a grave mistake by rehiring dixon because nelson believed dixon lacked integrity and fidelity,and could not be trusted.
the fbi then contacted reutter and asked for his views on whether dixon should be reinstated.by,when he was solicited for his opinion,reutter was serving as special agent in charge of the philadelphia division.reutter recalled that two agents had accused dixon of changing an applicant score,and he recalled that dixon had admitted doing so.based upon this incident and reutter recollection that dixon had poor work habits,a poor work ethic,and little enthusiasm for his job during his early years with the fbi,reutter described dixon efforts as mediocre at best and recommended against reinstating dixon.
another of dixon former supervisors,david ries ries,supervised him in and,and ries opinion was that dixon demonstrated a lack of commitment,although ries believed dixon was capable of performing his duties.ries also questioned dixon dedication and refused to make a recommendation concerning dixon reinstatement.kuhl,a former supervisor and one of the referrals provided by dixon,described dixon as competent and articulate and commented favorably on his character,abilities,reputation and loyalty.he recommended dixon for reinstatement,although he commented that he would have liked to have interviewed dixon to discern his motivations for seeking reinstatement.finally,thornton,the last of dixon referrals and one of his former,recommended in favor of reinstating him.thornton opined that dixon was an effective investigator,who conducted his business in an appropriate manner.
after reviewing these various recommendations,on april,the fbi wrote dixon a letter informing him that he would not be reinstated.dixon maintains that he did not receive this letter and that he did not learn about the fbi decision until when he called the detroit field office to inquire about the status of his application.during this call,the fbi would reveal only that its refusal to reinstate dixon was predicated upon negative evaluations from some of dixon former colleagues and supervisors.following this telephone conversation,dixon submitted a request under the freedom of information act foia to receive his personnel file from the fbi.dixon received the requested documents in may,which included a copy of reutter negative recommendation.
on july,dixon contacted an eeo counselor.he filed a formal eeo complaint on august.after the agency adjudication process was completed,dixon complaint for discriminatory retaliation ultimately was dismissed.dixon,at.on november,dixon filed suit in the eastern district of michigan asserting,among other things,that reutter negative appraisal constituted retaliation in response to dixon complaints about reutter racially discriminatory behavior,and that this unlawful retaliation formed the basis for the fbi decision not to reinstate dixon.the district court dismissed dixon case on march,on the grounds that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because,although he brought suit under title vii for unlawful retaliation,he did not include these allegations in his eeo complaint.
in an opinion issued on december,we reversed the district court judgment.we held that in a statement attached to his eeo complaint,dixon set forth sufficient factual detail to apprise the eeoc of his retaliation claim.dixon,at.
on remand,the attorney general moved to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment,arguing that dixon failed timely to seek eeo counseling and therefore had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies or,in the alternative,that dixon failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation.the district court granted the motion on july.the court held that the limitations period for seeking eeo counseling was equitably tolled and did not bar dixon retaliation claim.the district court further held that dixon failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation because he had not shown a causal connection between the protected title vii activity and the adverse employment decision.on august,dixon timely appealed.

standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,employing the same standard as the district court.farhat jopke,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the movant has the burden of proving the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.celotex catrett,d.in response,the nonmoving party must present significant probative evidence to show that there is more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.moore philip morris,cir.in determining whether the movant has met his burden,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
equitable tolling is warranted 
the attorney general argues that dixon case should be dismissed because he failed timely to avail himself of administrative remedies.dixon argues that he is entitled to the benefit of equitable tolling.
a plaintiff who alleges that a federal agency has engaged in race discrimination must initiate contact with an eeo counselor within days of the date of the alleged discriminatory act.a steiner henderson,cir.a district court may dismiss a case where a plaintiff has failed to comply with this requirement.id.because the limitations period is a prerequisite to filing suit and not a jurisdictional requirement,it is subject to equitable tolling,waiver,and estoppel.mitchell chapman,cir.
the equitable tolling doctrine does not delay the start of the limitations clock,but rather halts its ticking after the limitations period has accrued.amini oberlin college,cir.thus,in the title vii context,the limitations period begins to run when the adverse employment decision is communicated to the plaintiff,but may be tolled by equitable circumstances.eeoc united parcel,cir per curiam stating that the united states supreme court has held that the limitations period does not begin to run on a claim for employment discrimination until an employer makes and communicates a final decision to the employee.
the supreme court has observed that equitable tolling is typically applied only sparingly.irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.the following five factors are relevant to a determination of whether tolling should be allowed lack of notice of the filing requirement lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the defendant and the plaintiff reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the particular legal requirement.seay tennessee valley,cir.the foregoing factors are not exclusive and the tolling decision should be made on a basis.amini,at.
we review a district court equitable tolling decision for an abuse of discretion.dunlap united states,cir stating that a de novo standard of review applies where the facts are undisputed or the district court rules as a matter of law that equitable tolling is unavailable and that an abuse of discretion standard applies in all other cases.
the district court concluded that dixon failed to meet the first,second,and fifth factors set forth above.nonetheless,the district court permitted equitable tolling of the day limitations period because it determined that this court decision in dixon i mandated such a ruling and that dixon delay in initiating eeo counseling was due to the fbi lag in delivering plaintiff personnel file to him.
we agree with the district court that equitable tolling should apply in this case,but disagree with the logic behind the district court decision.this court decision in dixon i did not compel the district court to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling rather,we conclude that dixon delay in seeking eeo counseling was due to circumstances beyond his control,namely,the lack of a prompt response to his foia request.accordingly,equitable tolling is warranted here.
the attorney general challenges the district court equitable tolling ruling.see el paso nat.gas neztsosie,d a bsent a,an appellee may urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record,although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court.the attorney general insists that dixon had a duty to initiate eeo counseling within days of learning,in,that the fbi had denied his application for reinstatement.at this point,says the attorney general,dixon should have surmised that reutter played a role in the reinstatement process and that dixon was rejected due to reutter racist attitudes.instead,according to the attorney general,dixon impermissibly waited to seek eeo counseling until approximately three years later,on july,after he had requested and received his fbi personnel file.
the attorney general argument is without merit.the law does not demand that dixon exercise clairvoyance.dixon learned for the first time in that his request for reinstatement had been denied when he called the detroit field office to check on the status of his application.the record reflects that all dixon knew,because it was all the fbi would tell him,was that the negative reinstatement decision was due to negative comments from coworkers and supervisors.such cursory information was hardly sufficient to apprise dixon of the potential taint of racial animus in the fbi review process.
equitable tolling permits a plaintiff to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations if despite all due diligence he is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of his claim.seay,at quoting cada baxter healthcare,cir.the limitations period for seeking eeo counseling accrued in when dixon learned of the fbi adverse employment action,but at that time dixon did not have a basis for believing that his denial was attributable to unlawful discrimination.in seay,this court held that equitable tolling was proper where the defendant omitted critical information plaintiff needed to raise his suspicions about the defendant possible racially discriminatory motive in rejecting him.id.at.similarly,in cada,the seventh circuit stated,
if a reasonable man in cada position would not have known until july that he had been fired in possible violation of the age discrimination act,he could appeal to the doctrine of equitable tolling to suspend the running of the statute of limitations for such time as was reasonably necessary to conduct the necessary inquiry.
in amini,this court declined to apply equitable tolling where it concluded that the plaintiff college professor failed diligently to pursue his rights.the court found that the plaintiff could have discovered that he had a possible employment discrimination claim by directly asking the defendant college who it had hired instead of him.rather,the plaintiff only endeavored to learn the identity of his competitor by checking the college web site and scanning a departmental announcement board.amini,at.the amini court stated that t he case for equitable tolling relief would be di
