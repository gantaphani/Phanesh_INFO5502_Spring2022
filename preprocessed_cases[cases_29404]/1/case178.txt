petitioner ka cheung cheung,a native and citizen of hong kong,came to the united states in.rather than head home by the date his entry visa required,he stayed here.in,an immigration judge ij ordered cheung removed after determining that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not maintained ten years of continuous physical presence in the united states as required by section b a d of the immigration and nationality act ina.cheung appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed the ij decision.on appeal to this court,cheung argues that the bia erred as a matter of law by failing to address his argument which challenged the ij conclusion that he did not establish ten years of continuous physical presence.discerning no error,we deny the petition.
background 
cheung was legally admitted to the united states on october,by way of an h visa.his visa allowed him to remain in the united states until october.in october of,cheung applied for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a united states citizen.the petition for adjustment of status was approved on june.a few years later,on february,cheung and his wife had their first child,a son.
for reasons unknown,on august,cheung wife requested that the petition she filed on behalf of her husband be withdrawn.two months later,on october,it was.the very same day,the department of homeland security dhs or the government served cheung with a notice to appear nta in the nta and pursuant to a c i,dhs charged cheung as an alien who sought to procure a visa,other documentation,or admission into the united states by fraud or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact.cheung,in writing and through counsel,denied the charge on april.
thereafter,on april,dhs amended cheung nta by filing form i entitled additional charges of.in the i,dhs withdrew the original fraud charge against cheung and in its place,added an entirely new charge alleging that cheung was removable because he had remained in the united states for longer than his h visa had permitted.in support of this new charge,dhs alleged that cheung was admitted to the united states at or near an unknown place on or about october,as a visitor with authorization to remain until october,and remained in the united states beyond october.
on june,cheung filed a written memorandum with the ij acknowledging that he had overstayed his visa,but nonetheless arguing that he was eligible for relief in the form of cancellation of removal approximately a month later,on july,cheung appeared at a hearing before the ij and admitted through counsel the factual allegations in the amended nta and conceded removability pursuant to a b.at the hearing,he reiterated the arguments raised in his written memorandum,specifically that the nta was defective because it did not provide him with notice of the substituted overstaying and that it should not be a bar to the discretionary relief he sought.because cheung admitted he had overstayed his visa and was removable,the ij found that cheung was ineligible for cancellation of removal.after both cheung and the government agreed to waive the issuance of a formal oral decision,the ij entered a written form order in which he ordered cheung removed to hong kong.
cheung appealed the ij decision to the bia on august,presenting the same arguments that he had before the ij.on july,the bia upheld the ij decision ordering cheung removed to hong kong and dismissed cheung appeal.this appeal followed.generally,this court lacks discretion to review decisions of the attorney general which fall within his discretion,reno american arab anti discrimination,however,cheung appeal presents a purely legal question over which we have jurisdiction see a.
ii.standard of review 
in cases where,as here,the bia adopts portions of the ij opinion,but adds its own rationale as well,we review both the bia and the ij decisions.see idy holder,wl,at cir see also villa londono holder,cir citing mu√±oz monsalve mukasey,cir.we review factual findings,including the determination of whether the ten year continuous presence requirement has been met,under the substantial evidence standard.see villa londono,at see also bernal vallejo,cir.under this deferential standard,we must accept the ij factual findings so long as they are supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.seng holder,cir.simply put,in the absence of any error of law,we will set aside the agency resolution of a claim only if the evidence is such as would compel a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary conclusion.villa londono,at quoting seng,at.
however,q uestions of law are treated differently and engender de novo review,with some deference to the agency reasonable interpretations of statutes and regulations that are within its sphere of authority.seng,at.that said,cheung does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence.rather,his only contention on appeal centers around a question of law which we will turn our attention to now.
iii.discussion 
in order to be eligible for cancellation of removal,among other things not at issue in this case,cheung must prove ten years of continuous physical presence in the united states.see b a see also d.pursuant to d,the so called rule,an alien stops accruing continuous physical presence upon service of a nta.see id.a ny period of continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien is served a notice to appear see also vasquez holder,cir stating that an alien accrual of physical presence is cut off on the date that he is served with a notice to appear.
cheung argues that it was error to apply the rule to the october,nta because the charge alleged,fraud,was subsequently withdrawn and a new charge,overstaying,was added with the filing of form i approximately six months later.according to cheung,but for the single original charge of fraud,no nta would have ever issued as of october,since at that time,there were no other charges alleged within the nta.moreover,cheung argues that the october,nta,when issued,was defective because it failed to give him notice of t he subsequent charge against him,as well as the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated.a d.therefore,he argues that service of the first nta did not constitute a event for purposes of accruing continuous physical presence and that he is therefore eligible for cancellation of removal.
cheung admits that he arrived in the united states on october,and that he was served with the nta on october.a rather straightforward calculation confirms that based on those two dates,cheung missed the ten years continuous physical presence requirement by a mere five days.that said,our inquiry on appeal is to determine whether there is any merit in cheung argument that the first nta did not stop time for purposes of accruing continuous physical presence.we find that there is not.
we think a proper starting point is with this court decision in magasouba mukasey,cir,which we find instructive for purposes of the present situation.in magasouba,the petitioner was ordered removed after being convicted in state court of two offenses stemming from his selling of pirated copies of dvds and cds.id.at.the nta alleged that petitioner was removable based on the following convictions a theft offense which constituted an aggravated felony pursuant to a g and two crimes of moral turpitude.id.in response to the nta,petitioner filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings.id.realizing that neither allegation in the nta could hold water,the government issued a form i,the same exact form issued here,and included an amended charge based solely on a r id.at.the petitioner failed to object to the filing of the new charge within the i and received additional time to respond to the new charge.id.nevertheless,he argued on appeal that the government could not repair the defective notice to appear simply by filing a new charge on form i rather,it was required to dismiss the original notice to appear and issue a new one.id.according to the petitioner,had that procedural process been followed,the judge would have barred the govern
