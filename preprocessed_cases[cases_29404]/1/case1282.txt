r b f coal,and old republic insurance company collectively,seek relief from an order of the department of labor dol benefits review board brb holding responsible for the payment of benefits to a coal miner,turl mullins,and survivor benefits to his widow,deloris mullins,under the black lung benefits act,blba,et the parties agree that the mullins family is entitled to benefits.the only remaining dispute is whether or another operator is liable for the claim.we find that is liable,and therefore affirm the decision of the brb.
before discussing the undisputed facts of this case,it is helpful to understand the statutory schemes at issue.the blba provides benefits to miners who are disabled by pneumoconiosis.a,a,c.the mine operator that employed the disabled miner is liable for payment of those benefits.see id.b.in instances where a miner claiming benefits was employed by multiple coal mine operators,the blba authorizes the secretary of labor to promulgate regulations to establish standards for apportioning liability among operators.id.h.
the responsible operator the operator ultimately found liable for the blba claim is the most recent company to employ the miner,so long as that employer qualifies as a potentially liable operator.a.the regulation then outlines five criteria an employer must satisfy in order to be a potentially liable operator,only one of which is relevant to this case the operator its insurer must be financially capable of assuming liability.id.e.once a miner files a claim,a dol district director determines whether any of the miner previous employers qualify as potentially liable operators.id.a.if one or more operators are considered potentially liable operators,the district director names the potentially liable operator that most recently employed the miner as the responsible operator.id.b,d.
the dol bears the initial burden of proving that the operator it designates as responsible is a potentially liable operator under id.b.if the responsible operator designated by the district director believes that another party should be designated as the responsible operator,that operator bears the burden of proving that another operator more recently employed the miner,and that the later employer meets the criteria.id.c.
the virginia property and casualty insurance guaranty association vpciga,is a state chartered association established by the legislature to provide prompt payment of covered claims to reduce financial loss to claimants or policyholders resulting from the insolvency of an insurer.code ann.all insurance companies that conduct business in virginia are required by state law to join,and the association is funded by mandatory contributions from those members.id.
when a member insurer becomes insolvent,the vpciga takes on liability for some,but not all,of its obligations.see id.a.the vpciga is required to pay covered claims as that term is defined in the guaranty act.id.in relevant part,the guaranty act provides notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,a covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the vpciga after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer.id.a b.
turning now to the facts of this appeal,turl mullins worked as a coal miner for several years including stints with between and and wilder coal wilder between and mullins was diagnosed with pneumoconiosis in,and filed a claim for benefits under the blba in that same year.as discussed above,under dol regulations,liability for those benefits falls to the mine operator that most recently employed the miner for at least a year,so long as that employer is financially capable of assuming liability for the claim.by the time mullins filed his claim,wilder was out of business.further,its insurer,rockwood insurance rockwood,a member of the vpciga,had been declared insolvent by a pennsylvania court in august of.see boyd stevenson coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir.following rockwood insolvency,the court appointed a liquidator who set the final date for filing claims against rockwood as august.see uninsured employer fund mounts.app,aff.the vpciga assumed responsibility for claims filed before that date,covered claims but not for claims filed after that date.see.code ann.a.
a dol district director found that mullins was entitled to benefits and that was the responsible operator.contesting its liability,requested that the case be transferred to an administrative law judge alj for a hearing.
the alj concluded that the district director gave a valid reason for not naming the more recent employer,wilder,as the responsible operator.first,wilder was out of business.second,wilder insurer,rockwood,was insolvent.and third,the vpciga was not liable for the claim because the august,bar date to file claims against rockwood had passed.the alj then determined that,according to dol regulations,the burden shifted to to show that wilder was in fact financially capable of assuming liability.
the alj then found that had failed to show either that wilder or rockwood was capable of assuming liability for mullins claim or the claim qualified as a covered claim under the guaranty act obligating the vpciga to assume liability for the claim.the alj also found that because this was not a covered claim,the district director had no duty to notify the vpciga or name it as a party.the alj concluded that was properly named as the responsible operator and was liable for mullins claim.
appealed the alj determination to the brb arguing that the alj incorrectly found that was the responsible operator also argued that to the extent that the guaranty act prevents the vpciga from assuming liability for mullins claim,it violates c,which prohibits an insurance company from limiting its liability for black lung claims.the brb disagreed and found that the prohibition did not apply to guaranty associations contrary to employer argument,insurance guaranty associations are not covered by c,which prohibits private insurance carriers from limiting their liability for black lung claims.as such,the brb affirmed the alj finding and denied motion for reconsideration.petition to this court followed.
this court reviews the legal conclusions of the brb and the alj de novo to determine whether those conclusions are rational and consistent with applicable law.westmoreland coal cox,cir.quoting milburn colliery hicks,cir.
challenges the brb determination that wilder was incapable of assuming its liability for mullins claim.claims that since wilder liability was fully covered by rockwood,which was a member of the vpciga,then it can not be found to be incapable of assuming liability because the vpciga is now obligated to pay the claim.for the reasons below,we disagree.
wilder is not a responsible operator for the purposes of the blba.a mine operator can not be the responsible operator if it is financially incapable of assuming liability.e.
it is undisputed that wilder is bankrupt and is itself incapable of assuming liability.it is also undisputed that wilder insurance company,rockwood,is insolvent and is incapable of assuming liability.according to dol regulations,an operator insurance policy shall not be considered sufficient to establish the operator capability of assuming liability if the insurance company has been declared insolvent and its obligations for the claim are not otherwise guaranteed.id.e.thus,the issue is whether or not liability for wilder claims are otherwise guaranteed.id.under the guaranty act,wilder obligations for the claim are not otherwise guaranteed by the vpciga.
as discussed above,the final date for filing claims against rockwood was august.mullins claim was filed in,seventeen years after the final date to file his claim against rockwood had passed.as such,this is not a covered claim under the guaranty act,and the vpciga is under no obligation to pay it.see mounts,at holding that vpciga liability was limited to covered claims and that claims filed against rockwood after august,were not covered claims.
contends that the august bar date for filing claims against rockwood is void based on our decision in boyd steven
