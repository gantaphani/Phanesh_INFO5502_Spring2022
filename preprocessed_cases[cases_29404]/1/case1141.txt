opinion of the court 
the age discrimination in employment act adea prohibits an individual from bringing suit under that statute until days have passed since he or she filed a charge alleging unlawful discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.see d.during the pendency of this appeal,the supreme court considered what qualifies as a charge in federal express holowecki,d.it explained that,in addition to the information required by relevant regulations an allegation and the name of the charged party,if a filing is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee.id.at.we apply that standard in this case,and after doing so conclude that the document submitted to the eeoc by appellant morris holender is a charge within the meaning of the adea.this suit,brought more than days after holender filed his charge with the eeoc,is thus allowed under the adea.that the eeoc,near the end of the period,asked for further,unnecessary information does not,as it commendably concedes in an amicus brief,change this result.we thus vacate and remand.
factual background and procedural history 
on august,holender submitted a document to the eeoc.the first page was an eeoc form.it bore the title charge of discrimination.the corner included an assigned charge number.it provided holender date of birth and contact information,and the name and contact information of mutual industries north,mutual.holender checked the box indicating age under the heading cause of discrimination based on.the space left for the particulars of the alleged discrimination referred to an attached sheet.holender signed the form in two places in the box for the charging party and in the box for the signature of complainant.holender did not check the box next to the statement that i want this charge filed with both the eeoc and the state or local agency,if any.i will advise the agencies if i change my address or telephone number and cooperate fully with them in the processing of my charge in accordance with their procedures.the form was not notarized.
the second page,also signed by holender,was an affidavit entitled eeoc complaint of morris holender.it read in full as follows 
i,morris holender,do hereby bring this eeoc complaint against mutual industries,located at grange avenue,philadelphia,pa.i am bringing the instant complaint for age discrimination.
on or about wednesday,july,i interviewed for a position as a customer service representative.i interviewed with one edmund dunn.during the course of the interview,he expressly stated,i am not allowed to ask these questions under law,but if i were to ask you these questions,but remember that i am not allowed to ask you,what year did you graduate from high school i knew that dunn was specifically seeking information about my current age.feeling uncomfortable and attempting to obtain the job,i reluctantly informed dunn that i graduated high school in.
i was told the company was looking to fill the position immediately and that i would be contacted as soon as my reference was checked.dunn never contacted my specified reference,and moreover,never contacted me following my interview.dunn also specifically told me that i meet all of the position qualifications,yet i was still not contacted.i am currently years old and believe that i was not hired specifically because of my age.
it is my further opinion that dunn has made similar age inquiries and selectively not hired other prospective job applicants solely because of their age.i am therefore filing the instant charge on behalf of all persons similarly situated.
nearly two months later,the eeoc sent a letter dated october,to counsel for holender.it stated b efore the eeoc can formally docket this matter as a charge and begin its investigatory mediation process,certain information from client is required.it enclosed questionnaires entitled charge information,selection,discipline,witness and remedy.it advised holender that,o n receipt of the completed questionnaires or equivalent information,the eeoc will review your response to determine whether or not this inquiry should be formalized as a charge.it asked holender to provide the documents within days.holender did not do so.he instead filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on november,days after submitting the document to the eeoc.he asserted a single claim for violation of the adea.
mutual moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.it argued that holender had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to bringing suit he had not provided the eeoc with the information it had requested and thus had not permitted it to finish its inquiry into this charge.the district court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.it concluded that holender had failed to satisfy the relevant administrative exhaustion requirements and entered summary judgment in favor of mutual.
holender timely appealed.he argues that he satisfied the administrative exhaustion requirements by submitting the document that he describes as a charge.the eeoc has filed an amicus brief in support of his claim.it states that,even though it did not treat holender submission as a charge,it should have done so 
ii.analysis 
standard announced in federal express holowecki 
the adea provides that n o civil action may be commenced by an individual until days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the eeoc.d.as the supreme court explained in holowecki,the adea does not define the term charge and eeoc regulations give some content to the term,but fall short of a comprehensive definition.holowecki.at.
says charge shall mean a statement filed with the commission by or on behalf of an aggrieved person which alleges that the named prospective defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in actions in violation of the act.section a identifies five pieces of information a charge should contain the names,addresses,and telephone numbers of the person making the charge and the charged entity a statement of facts describing the alleged discriminatory act the number of employees of the charged employer and a statement indicating whether the charging party has initiated state proceedings.the next subsection,b,however,seems to qualify these requirements by stating that a charge is sufficient if it meets the requirements of,if it is in writing and name s the prospective respondent and generally allege s the discriminatory act s.
id.emphasis in original.
the supreme court deferred under auer robbins,d,to the eeoc position that the regulations identify the procedures for filing a charge but do not state the full contents a charge document must contain.holowecki.at citing auer,at,for the rule that it accepts an agency position unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the interpreted regulation.
the supreme court then addressed the question of what elements must be included in a charge beyond those listed in the regulations.id.it deferred under skidmore swift,to the eeoc view that,
i n addition to the information required by the regulations,an allegation and the name of the charged party,if a filing is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee.
holowecki.at.
the supreme court acknowledged that,under the permissive standard it announced,a wide range of documents might be classified as charges.id.at.it described this result as consistent with the design and purposes of the adea,and noted that most adea filings appear to be pro se.id.the court rejected the contention that a filing does not become a charge until acted upon by the eeoc,reasoning that it would be illogical and impractical to make the definition of charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over which the parties have no control.id.at.the court thus passed to the question w
