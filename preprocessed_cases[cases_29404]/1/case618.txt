in,the occupational safety and health administration osha issued citations to loretto oswego residential health care facility loretto oswego for violating employee safety standards under the occupational safety and health act the osh act.loretto oswego reached an agreement with osha officials settling all matters related to the citations save one whether several violations were repeated under a.this question,the parties agree,depends entirely on whether loretto oswego and a pair of other entities operated as a single employer for purposes of the osh act.an administrative law judge alj found that the three entities did operate as a single employer,and hence held that the violations were repeated.loretto oswego appealed that decision to the occupational safety and health review commission the commission,which reversed.the secretary of labor,hilda solis the secretary,now petitions for review of the commission decision.we deny her petition.
background 
at the time of the citations in question,loretto management corporation lmc oversaw a number of corporations the affiliates that operated nursing home facilities in upstate new york.these corporations,nearly all of which used the loretto name,included loretto oswego,which operated a nursing home in oswego,new york they also included,among others,loretto rest residential health care facility loretto rest and loretto utica residential health care facility loretto utica,which operated nursing homes in syracuse and utica,new york,respectively.loretto rest had beds,while loretto utica had about beds and loretto oswego had beds.lmc headquarters were located on the same site as loretto rest,known as the brighton campus.
in light of past violations by loretto rest and loretto utica,osha designated several of the citations it issued to loretto oswego as repeated.the citations issued to loretto oswego alleged that the facility did not comply with osha standards regarding eye protection,hepatitis b vaccination,medical evaluations,bloodborne pathogen training,oxygen cylinders,machinery servicing,and electrical equipment.the secretary asserted that lmc oversaw loretto oswego,loretto rest,and loretto utica so that these entities functioned as a single employer at the time of the alleged violations.loretto oswego does not dispute that,if they were a single employer,the violations were repeated.the parties agree,moreover,that if the violations were repeated,loretto oswego must pay a penalty of,and if they were not,then loretto oswego must pay only 
lmc bylaws describe,at a minimum,potential control by lmc over the affiliates.the bylaws state the corporation will control,oversee,coordinate,represent and support the interests of all present and future loretto corporations.after listing various loretto corporations,including the three affiliates at issue here,they continue 
the corporation reserves to itself the following powers for each affiliate 
a approval of annual operating and capital budgets.
b approval of the employment of the chief executive officer.
c access to all information regarding the operation of the affiliate including financial statements,minutes of board meetings and committee meetings,and any other relevant data.
d participation and cooperation by each affiliate with the corporation and the other affiliates in all matters of common interest.
under the bylaws,a board of trustees is to supervise a president who,as the chief executive officer of lmc,shall have and exercise charge and supervision of the implementation of the goals and policies of the corporation though operation of its facilities and personnel.the bylaws also set out descriptions of several other salaried lmc employees,including a chief financial officer and several.
what lmc actually did with the above mentioned management authority is a more complicated question.formally,at the time of loretto oswego violations,the three affiliates had the same president and chief executive officer james introne,who also was lmc president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer michael sullivan,who also was lmc chief operating officer.in these roles,introne had the power to hire,discipline,and fire the administrators and other personnel at the affiliates,while sullivan oversaw all accounting functions for lmc and the affiliates,including budgeting and strategic planning.loretto rest management further overlapped with lmc in various ways,with employees charged to oversee lmc affiliates on issues they personally managed for loretto rest.
loretto oswego,by contrast,had less direct contact with lmc.introne delegated to karen jeffreys,the affiliate licensed administrator,his power to hire,fire,and discipline loretto oswego employees he retained the authority to terminate jeffreys,but the record does not disclose any specific directions,as opposed to general oversight,that he gave in relation to loretto oswego operations.jeffreys,moreover,prepared loretto oswego budget.although lmc board of trustees had final say over budgetary approval and lmc employees reviewed loretto oswego finances,the record contains no evidence that sullivan or the board dictated jeffreys budgetary decisions.there is evidence that lmc employees provided guidance and training to loretto oswego employees on various issues.the record,however,indicates only a few concrete instances,outlined below,in which these actions translated into particular policy prescriptions for loretto oswego.
introne oversaw loretto oswego,primarily,through mitchell marsh.marsh served as lmc vice president of residential health care facilities and,simultaneously,as the licensed administrator of both loretto rest and another loretto affiliate,nottingham.according to marsh,his positions as administrator were his primary responsibility.in his role at lmc,marsh testified,he acted as the company liaison to loretto oswego and loretto utica.this job consisted,in marsh words,of ensuring that the facilities met introne standards,namely that they kept balanced budgets and complied with state and federal regulatory requirements.
marsh visited loretto oswego and loretto utica about once a month,when he would review financial statements and clinical reports and then conduct a walkthrough,surveying the environment and the residents.he also completed annual performance evaluations of the site administrators for introne.in his testimony,marsh emphasized actions he took to ensure compliance with new york state department of health requirements regarding resident care.on a few occasions,he organized mock inspections of the facilities to practice for state resident care inspections.as to employee safety requirements under the osh act,marsh testified that he would be advised of osha citations issued to the facilities and would inform introne of them.
four other individuals played a particularly prominent role in the secretary case scott larue,anthony tullio,gregg lawson,and arthur coughlin.larue served as lmc vice president for support services.in this role,larue testified,he spent percent of his time managing the housekeeping,maintenance,food service,and human resources operations at loretto rest,and advised other affiliates on request.tullio was loretto rest director of support services.he testified that he managed housekeeping,maintenance,and laundry at loretto rest,while also providing information and training in these areas to other affiliates.although tullio nominally was responsible to loretto rest administrator,marsh,in fact tullio reported to larue.lawson also reported to larue,and served as lmc corporate human resource manager,managing benefits,payroll,and labor relations.according to lawson,he spent to percent of his time on matters related to loretto rest and the remainder consulting for other affiliates as needed.lawson testified that it was his responsibility to ensure that all affiliates complied with federal employment laws like the family medical leave act.
coughlin oversaw aspects of employee safety and workers compensation at the affiliates beginning in november.larue testified that he hired coughlin to manage these issues at loretto rest and instructed him to write a safety program for loretto rest that the other affiliates could adopt if they wished.on march,coughlin circulated to the affiliates a memorandum detailing a safety policy.the policy addressed a long list of workplace hazards and stated f ailure to adhere to written corporate safety policies and rules will be considered serious infractions and will result in disciplinary actions,up to and including termination.the memorandum also stated that lmc safety manager was responsible for recommending health and safety policies ensuring overall corporate compliance with policies,statutes,and regulations monitoring the effectiveness of the safety programs and providing central health and safety services to all areas of loretto.larue and coughlin testified that the policy,contrary to its terms,could only be enforced at loretto rest.larue claimed that he had not had a chance to review most of coughlin policy until after it had been sent to the affiliates.
osha inspectors identified the alleged violations in february,shortly before coughlin circulated this policy.prior to the inspection,the affiliates had adopted and renewed a common policy regarding bloodborne pathogen exposure,particularly exposure to hiv and to hepatitis b and c.this policy,drafted and updated by melva neff,a nurse at loretto rest,spoke of general requirements for loretto.neff testified that she brought copies of the policy to meetings attended by representatives of lmc and the affiliates.she also testified that she provided trainings on bloodborne pathogen exposure at sites other than loretto rest upon request,including at loretto oswego.additionally,prior to the inspection,loretto oswego adopted two targeted safety policies that apparently derived from other affiliates.these policies referred to other affiliates by name and did not refer to loretto oswego.one policy,seemingly from nottingham,concerned procedures for turning off machinery while it is serviced,known as safety,and contained written procedures that referred to loretto rest.the other policy,which listed the name and address of loretto rest on its cover,addressed hazard communication.coughlin testified that he provided training and assistance to affiliates regarding employee safety as needed,but he did not visit loretto oswego at any time before the inspection.
when the inspectors first arrived at loretto oswego,on february,jeffreys informed them that lmc was loretto oswego controlling corporation.she then requested,after phoning lmc,that the inspectors wait until two individuals sent by lmc had arrived coughlin and tullio.the inspectors agreed.during the inspection,conducted in part that day and in part on february,coughlin and tullio accompanied the inspectors with jeffreys and darlene nesbitt,loretto oswego director of facilities.coughlin identified himself as corporate safety manager and brought a copy of the circulated safety policy.at times,jeffreys referred questions to coughlin and tullio she also excused herself at various points to deal with other issues at the facility.when the inspectors found violations,coughlin and tullio instructed loretto oswego employees to correct them.at a conference after the inspection,coughlin gave abatement dates for those violations that had not yet been corrected.and at two final settlement conferences,held in march,coughlin pointed out to the inspectors those violations that had been corrected.
in the course of the inspection,the inspectors spoke with loretto oswego and lmc employees about the relationship between the two entities.most important for the secretary are two statements attributed to larue,who was also present at the settlement conferences.at one of the conferences,larue allegedly told the inspectors that coughlin was responsible for going to all lmc affiliates and ensuring that they took care of safety issues.in his testimony before the alj,larue did not recall making this statement to the inspectors.in a subsequent visit by an inspector to lmc offices,larue also allegedly stated that lmc board of trustees could influence the staff at loretto oswego and that,depending on the area,he and marsh could as well.according to the inspector,dwayne gary,larue identified finance,human resources,and information technology as areas in which they could exercise their influence.this alleged statement by larue was in tension with the implication of other testimony that lmc employees could only give advice to loretto oswego.
the secretary has also highlighted a range of other indicators of interrelation between lmc and the affiliates.these,as summarized in the alj decision,included the following the administrators of all the affiliates gathered for monthly meetings at loretto rest to share information loretto rest operated a central food commissary,which provided food to all but one of the affiliates and five nursing facilities a single loretto website listed job opportunities for the affiliates and listed benefits for loretto employees all service and maintenance employees at the affiliates belonged to the same union the labor contracts entered by the affiliates,while separate,were negotiated at the same time and introne signed the labor contract entered by each affiliate and the same insurance agency handled all affiliate workers compensation claims.
the record contains conflicting testimony regarding the employing entity of some of the individuals described above.marsh testified that he was an employee of loretto rest,not lmc,and testified that jeffreys did not report to him.but jeffreys and neff both identified marsh as an employee of lmc,and larue initially did as well,though in later testimony he identified marsh as an employee of loretto rest.lmc organizational chart and,by implication,its bylaws identified marsh as an employee of that entity jeffreys,moreover,testified that she reported to marsh tullio and coughlin testified that they were employed by loretto rest rather than lmc.the record suggests,however,that tullio and coughlin reported to larue,an employee of lmc,and did not report to marsh,who would have been their supervisor at loretto rest.finally,neff stated at a deposition that she worked for lmc,but later testified she was an employee of loretto rest she explained that after her deposition marsh had told her she was employed by loretto rest.
on these facts,the alj upheld the secretary repeated designation,holding that lmc and its affiliates operated as a single employer.sec y of labor loretto oswego residential health care facility,slip op,available at http loretto oswego i.
in so holding,the alj described the single employer test,under commission precedent,as follows when two companies share a common worksite such that employees of both have access to the same hazardous conditions,have interrelated and integrated operations,and share a common president,management,supervision or ownership,the purposes of the act are best effectuated by the two being treated as one.id.at quoting sec y of labor advance specialty,wl,at.the alj then found that each of the three prongs had been met.
as to common worksite,the alj held that although the affiliates were geographically distinct,they presented the same employee health risks.id.at.as to common management,the alj held that lmc employees had the power to oversee the actions of the affiliates.id.at.in this respect,the alj found that marsh,tullio,coughlin,and neff were all employees of lmc and did not credit testimony to the effect that loretto facilities operate as separate,independent entities and that administrators at individual facilities are free to disregard loretto policies and the advice and counsel of loretto management.id.at.the alj specifically rejected larue and coughlin testimony that the affiliates did not need to comply with lmc safety policy.id.finally,the alj held that lmc and the affiliates had sufficiently interrelated and integrated operations to constitute a single employer,particularly given sullivan oversight of affiliate finances,marsh oversight of the administrators,coughlin position as safety manager,and the actions of larue,coughlin,and tullio at the inspection.id.at.
on appeal,the commission reversed,applying the same single employer test.sec y of labor loretto oswego residential health care facility,wl,loretto oswego ii.it noted,first,that lmc and the three affiliates shared the same president,chief executive officer,and chief financial officer.id.at.it held,however,that this outward appearance of a common identity gave way upon a closer look at the ways in which lmc and the affiliates had operated.id.although lmc oversaw loretto oswego affairs in certain respects,the commission held,it rarely intervened or dictated policy.the commission found that the evidence of integration was particularly weak in relation to safety matters at the time of the inspection.at that time,it found,coughlin safety policy was not in effect and neff bloodborne pathogen policy only addressed a single aspect of employee safety at the affiliates.id.at.the commission held that notwithstanding lmc involvement in the inspection,there was little evidence that lmc personnel addressed employee safety matters in their interactions with loretto oswego.id.at.lastly,the commission found that loretto oswego did not share a common worksite with lmc or the other two affiliates,as the entities were located in different cities.id.at.given the lack of integration and the lack of a common worksite,the commission held that loretto oswego and the other affiliates did not operate as a single employer.id.
the secretary timely petitioned for review,challenging aspects of the commission legal analysis and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting its conclusion.we have jurisdiction pursuant to b.venue is appropriate given that the violations in question occurred in this circuit.see id.

the secretary asserts,first,that she has adopted a variant of the single employer test different from the one applied by the commission and the alj.without explaining how she adopted this different variant,the secretary argues that,under her variant,we should look to four factors interrelated operations,common management,centralized control of labor relations,and common ownership.the formal contrast between this test and the commission test is clear enough the secretary test omits the commission common worksite prong,divides common management and common ownership into two prongs,and adds a centralized control of labor relations prong.
this test is not a novelty of this litigation.the national labor relations board nlrb has long utilized it in construing the term employer under the national labor relations act nlra.in radio television broadcast technicians local union broadcast service of mobile,the supreme court approved of the test as applied under the nlra.this court has subsequently applied it under that statute and in construing the term employer under both title vii of the civil rights act of and the americans with disabilities act ada.see lihli fashions nlrb,cir per curiam nlra cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir title vii parker columbia pictures,cir ada.other federal courts have employed the test under all these statutes as well as other labor statutes,including the labor management relations act,the fair labor standards act,and the age discrimination in employment act.see pearson component tech,cir collecting cases.
in the secretary view,the same single employer test should apply under the osh act as under the nlra and analogous labor statutes.the secretary argues that her position on this issue of statutory construction is entitled to deference.she advances two arguments.first,she contends that the remedial purposes of the osh act and the breadth of its definitions of employer and person suggest applying the same liberal construction of the single employer test to that act as to the others.pet r br.second,she claims that the commission initially adopted the nlrb test in construing the term employer under the osh act and,without explanation,substituted its test for the test.the secretary asserts,and loretto oswego does not dispute,that no federal court of appeals has spoken to the content of the single employer test under the osh act.likewise,we are not aware of any federal cases that address the issue.
as a preliminary,the secretary has not shown that the commission initially applied the nlrb test and then reformulated its test in subsequent cases.according to the secretary,the commission applied the nlrb test in advance specialty,the same decision the alj in this case quoted as enumerating the test the secretary challenges.in advance specialty,the commission described the nlrb test with approval after noting that it was well settled that corporate entities may be disregarded in order to effectuate a clear legislative purpose.advance specialty,wl at.it did not adopt the nlrb test,however instead,the commission held that the entities at issue operated as a single employer under the osh act given that they shared a common worksite such that the employees of both have access to the same hazardous conditions,ha d interrelated and integrated operations,and share d a common president,management,supervision or ownership.id.at.the commission has looked to these same three factors ever since.see sec y of labor taylor,wl,at,sec y of labor vergona crane,wl,at july,
in any event,although we have concluded that the secretary interpretation of the osha act,even if expressed solely as a litigation position,is due more deference than the commission interpretation of the statute,see chao,at,we need not entertain the secretary position where,as here,that position was not pressed to the commission during the adjudicatory process from which the secretary appeals.the secretary never argued to the commission that the alj applied an improper variant of the single employer test.indeed,the secretary spent much of her brief to the commission defending the single employer test without distinguishing between variants,and citing to commission precedents that applied the test that she now seeks to challenge.the secretary did,at times,speak as if the nlrb test applied.she stated the nlrb test at one point,citing to case law quoting the language in advance specialty that described this test.additionally,in her discussion of the facts,the secretary used four headings consistent with the four nlrb factors,advancing,by implication,the fourth prong as centralized control of employment and health.j.but this was not,in our view,enough to present to the commission the secretary current argument to us that the test should be applied and the commission test abandoned.see collins const,at.
while it is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal,this rule is not absolute.greene united states,cir.we may exercise our discretion to address such issues when,for example,we think it necessary to remedy an obvious injustice.id.this is not such a case.the osh act confers a limited jurisdictional grant on this court,which counsels that we take extra caution regarding issues not raised before the commission modern cont oshrc,cir.the merits,meanwhile,are not so clear as to raise the specter of an obvious injustice.with little explanation,the secretary attempts to squeeze the osh act particular concerns regarding workplace safety into a generic test oriented toward labor relations.moreover,she offers no reason whatsoever for eschewing the commission prior consideration of physical worksites.
if the secretary wishes to alter the commission approach to the single employer test,she has many avenues by which to do so.she could challenge the commission approach in subsequent cases before aljs and,ultimately,the commission.or she could issue a regulation on the matter.the secretary,not the c
