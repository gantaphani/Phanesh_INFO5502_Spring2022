community services,community services group csg,a corporation that provides caretaker services for persons with disabilities,brought this action against the wind gap municipal authority authority,the municipal agency that administers sewer services in wind gap borough,alleging violations of the fair housing amendments act fhaa,et.csg claims that the authority violated the fhaa by charging increased fees to,and imposing additional administrative burdens upon,a house leased and used by csg to provide caretaker services to three mentally retarded women residing there on the basis that the house was a personal care home,and hence a commercial facility,under the relevant regulations governing sewer service.the district court granted summary judgment to csg,principally because it concluded that the authority classification of the house as a personal care home was a proxy for handicapped status and,therefore,the regulation discriminated on its face based on disability.because we disagree with the district court conclusion that the regulatory classification and treatment of the house constituted disparate treatment because of a handicap,we will reverse and remand.
factual background 
the house at issue is a,home located in a residential community at east first street,wind gap borough,northampton county,pennsylvania.the house was built in by the family of one of its current residents,cindy both cindy and her mother lived in the home until.
in,as cindy mother health was declining,the family established a trust for the benefit of cindy and her three siblings.one of the primary purposes of the trust was to ensure that cindy,who was born with down syndrome,would be adequately cared for as she and her mother grew older.to this end,the deed to the house was transferred to the trust,and cindy sister arranged for services for cindy and her mother through the northampton county mental retardation office office and the northampton county office of aging,respectively.by,the services had been increased to include a caretaker.in november,cindy mother moved out of the house and into a nursing home.
cindy continued to live in the house with the assistance of a caretaker funded jointly by her family and the office.the following year,however,when the county and the family determined that they no longer had the resources to continue funding,personal assistance for cindy,they arranged for two other women in need of similar services,cassie and linda,to move into the house permanently in december.all three women,adults in their forties and fifties,have mental retardation and,as the district court found,although they are substantially limited in their ability to learn,work,communicate,and care for themselves,with the assistance of a caretaker,the women are able to conduct their daily life activities and live together in a manner.
the caretaker services are provided by csg,which provides both residential and services to persons with disabilities in several counties in pennsylvania,including northampton county.csg leases the house from the trust and works with the office to meet state and federal requirements,including the documentation incident to the performance of services and obtaining reimbursement from funding sources.csg caretakers assist cindy,cassie,and linda with their daily activities,such as bathing,food preparation,housecleaning,and transportation via a garaged at the house to the women day program and vocational rehabilitation.the women do not require or receive clinical care,therapy,rehabilitation,or other similar services at the home.typically,there are one or two caretakers at the house when the women are at home and no caretakers in the house when the women are at their programs during the day.one caretaker stays overnight,but does not sleep in the house.once a month the caretakers have a meeting with a supervisor at the house.
in september,csg obtained zoning approval from the wind gap zoning hearing board in preparation for cassie and linda move to the house.although the house was zoned for use as a dwelling but not a group home,the board granted a variance,as a reasonable accommodation under the fhaa,for csg to operate a community living arrangement at the house.the board subsequently notified the borough of wind gap and the authority of the approval.at meetings of the authority board,cindy sister and csg regional director explained that csg would provide caretakers to assist the residents,that the house would be used as a family residence,and that there would be no change in the use of the property.
on october,the authority sent cindy sister a letter informing her that it was necessary to apply for a sewer connection permit and submit a feasibility review agreement along with a deposit to determine the use of the home.csg submitted the feasibility review agreement,applied for a sewer connection permit,and submitted the deposit on november.at the same time,csg also requested a reasonable accommodation under the fhaa to allow the house to remain classified as residential.as explained in a letter dated november,the authority returned the uncashed check and declined to consider the application because the documents were not executed by the deed owner,the trust 
in december,csg notified the authority that linda and cassie were moving into the house that month.in january,the authority changed the house sewer service classification from residential to commercial and increased the number of sewer billing units sbus or equivalent dwelling units edus,the measure by which the authority charges for sewer service,from one to two.under the rules and regulations governing sewer services when obtained from sewer system of wind gap municipal authority regulations in effect at the time,a residential unit was defined as a private dwelling unit,a dwelling unit in a double house or in a row of connecting houses,or a dwelling unit in an apartment building,condominium or in any other multiple dwelling or multiple use structure,and all such units were assessed one sbu.the commercial unit classification was defined by a schedule assessing a variable number of edus to a unit based on whether it was considered,inter alia,a house,apartment,or condominium trailer hotel,nursing home,personal care home,or boarding house without restaurant or bar,dining or other business restaurant bar or tavern without residence restaurant bar or tavern with residence fitness center without showers,pools,sauna,hot tub offices and business facilities photo lab or car the authority did not offer an explanation for the reclassification,nor was one requested by the trust or csg.
in may,the authority sent a letter to the trust demanding that it pay the deposit and a tapping fee.counsel for csg responded by requesting that the house be classified as a residence and that the authority grant a reasonable accommodation.the authority did not respond.csg continued to pay the increased quarterly sewage bill under protest.in november,counsel for csg requested an explanation for the reclassification.the authority did not respond.on july,the authority filed a municipal lien for against the property for the trust failure to pay the tapping fee.csg paid the fee under protest on august,in order to satisfy the lien and csg counsel sent a letter to the authority solicitor to request an explanation for the reclassification.the solicitor did not respond.on october,csg counsel sent a second letter to the solicitor this letter also went unanswered.the municipal lien on the house was not released until july,subsequent to the filing of the complaint initiating this action.
ii.procedural history 
csg filed the instant action on november.see cmty.servs.group wind gap mun,civ,wl,dist.lexis.the complaint generally averred that in providing services to the house the authority had violated the fhaa by discriminating against plaintiffs on the basis of the house residents disabilities.during discovery,the administrator of the authority,robert hahn,explained for the first time that the authority reclassified the house because the lessee of the property,csg,was a company using the house as a personal care home,a facility that was expressly included in the commercial classification under the regulations.at the completion of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment,and after a hearing on february,the district court granted summary judgment to csg.the court concluded that the regulation on which the authority based the reclassification of the house to commercial because it was a personal care home discriminated against persons who need personal care,and because such persons are by definition handicapped under the fhaa,the regulation violated the act.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.
the district court first noted that csg had brought three fhaa claims,the first two alleging that the authority policies and actions constituted disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination and the third alleging that the authority failed to grant a reasonable accommodation.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.of these three claims,the court focused primarily on the disparate treatment claim,and more specifically,on analyzing whether the regulation upon which the authority reclassified the house was facially discriminatory.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the court noted at the outset that if the regulation made a classification on the basis of homes for the handicapped,it would clearly violate the fhaa.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the question,then,was whether the classification of the house as a personal care home coincided with or was a proxy for this clearly unlawful classification.id.
the court discussed the development of the proxy theory in a number of facially discriminatory classification cases dealing with proxies for handicapped under the fhaa,specifically relying on horizon house developmental services,township of upper southampton,aff,cir,where the district court had concluded that an ordinance imposing a distance requirement between homes where permanent care or professional supervision is present was facially discriminatory because it singled out for disparate treatment individuals who were unable to live independently and,thus,were handicapped under the fhaa definition the court reasoned that because personal care homes provide professional personal care and supervision,and residents who require personal care in their homes are not able to live on their own and need assistance with their daily life activities,personal care home was a proxy for handicapped and the ordinance was,therefore,facially discriminatory.cmty.servs.group,wl at,dist.lexis,at.
further,the court noted that the authority only first offered an explanation for the reclassification during the litigation when administrator hahn explained in his deposition that the house was reclassified because csg was a company and the house was being used as a personal care home,a facility that was expressly included in the commercial classification under the regulations.the court rejected this explanation because the ordinance did not provide that only personal care homes were to be classified as commercial,and even if it did,it would still violate the fhaa because the act does not protect only entities.
the district court then turned its attention to whether there was a valid justification for treating personal care homes differently from residential dwellings.it rejected the commercial classification and the authority purported interest in applying rates uniformly to all customers.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the court did recognize that the authority had a legitimate interest in using an efficient rating system,but determined that there were less discriminatory alternatives to serve that interest,including actually classifying properties based on status or residences versus larger buildings,or by basing its ratings on the number of occupants per square foot.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.
having held that the ordinance was facially discriminatory,the court noted that it need not decide the plaintiff other two claims based on disparate impact and denial of a reasonable accommodation.however,the court then proceeded to discuss both claims very briefly,setting out the standards for evaluating such claims and concluding that the classification would have a disproportionate impact on disabled people as residents of personal care homes and,again,the authority had no legitimate reason for the classification,and the authority never responded to csg numerous letters requesting a waiver of the increased fees and administrative burdens and the authority had not shown that the request was not reasonable in light of the fact that the sewer usage of the house was less intensive than other residential dwellings.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.at the conclusion of its opinion,the court noted that the plaintiff motion should be granted on those two claims as well.id.wl at,dist.lexis at 
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the authority appeals the district court decision,arguing that the court erred in its determination that the status of csg was not a valid reason for classifying the house as commercial,in its viewing disputed facts in a light most favorable to the party moving for summary judgment,and in its analysis of the disparate impact and reasonable accommodation claims.the district court had jurisdiction over csg fhaa claims under and a,and we have jurisdiction to review the final decision of the district court under.we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same test as the district court.goodman mead johnson,cir.to affirm the grant of summary judgment,we must be convinced that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the party.c.
iv.discussion 
fhaa background 
the fair housing act fha,passed by congress as title viii of the civil rights act of,prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of,inter alia,race,gender,and national origin.et.under the fhaa,which congress passed in to extend the coverage of the fha to include people with disabilities,it is unlawful 
to discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap of 
a that person or 
b a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold,rented,or made available or 
c any person associated with that person.
f.by its express terms,this section applies to the provision of services or facilities to a dwelling,such as sewer service,and courts have specifically allowed claims under this section to be brought against municipalities and land use authorities.see generally,zoning bd.of adjustment,cir.further,under f b,discrimination includes a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
plaintiffs alleging violations of the fhaa under these sections may bring three general types of claims intentional discrimination claims also called disparate treatment claims and disparate impact claims,both of which arise under f,and claims that a defendant refused to make reasonable accommodations,which arise under f b.see,at.to evaluate these claims under the fhaa,courts have typically adopted the analytical framework of their analogues in employment law,including their coordinate analyses once plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of discrimination under a specific claim 
disparate treatment discriminatory animus claims facially discriminatory classification claims 
generally,to prevail on a disparate treatment claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that some discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor behind the challenged action.see cmty.hous.trust dep t of consumer regulatory affairs,d,it is well settled that a defendant decision or action constitutes disparate treatment,or intentional discrimination,when a person disability was a motivating factor behind the challenged action or decision.tsombanidis city of haven,d,citing arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.the discriminatory purpose need not be malicious or invidious,nor need it figure in solely,primarily,or even predominantly into the motivation behind the challenged action.cmty.hous.trust,d at tsombanidis,d at see also horizon house.at in order to prove intentional discrimination it is not necessary to show an evil or hostile motive.it is a violation of the fhaa to discriminate even if the motive was benign or paternalistic.the plaintiff is only required to show that a protected characteristic played a role in the defendant decision to treat her differently.cmty.hous.trust,d at citing arlington heights,at.
where a regulation or policy facially discriminates on the basis of the protected trait,in certain circumstances it may constitute per se or explicit discrimination because the protected trait by definition plays a role in the process,inasmuch as the policy explicitly classifies people on that basis.dibiase smithkline beecham,cir quoting eeoc elgin teachers ass n.hence,where a plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged action involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination,or a facially discriminatory classification,a plaintiff need not prove the malice or discriminatory animus of a defendant.bangerter orem city,cir.rather,the focus is on the explicit terms of the discrimination.int l union,united auto.aerospace agric.implement workers johnson controls,d.
facially discriminatory classifications proxy theory 
consistent with the focus on language rather than a showing of discriminatory animus in evaluating facially discriminatory classification claims,courts have developed a proxy theory for such claims,recognizing that a regulation or policy can not use a technically neutral classification as a proxy to evade the prohibition of intentional discrimination,such as classifications based on gray hair as a proxy for age or service dogs or wheelchairs as proxies for handicapped status.mcwright alexander,cir.for example,in erie county retirees ass county of erie,we concluded that an employer violates the age discrimination in employment act adea by offering retirees different health coverage from that offered to retirees because medicare status is a direct proxy for age,as eligibility follow s ineluctably upon attaining age,cir alteration in original quoting erie county retirees ass county of erie,d.such a situation was,we explained,distinguishable from the situation in hazen paper biggins,where an employer termination of an employee a few weeks prior to attaining ten years of service required for the vesting of pension benefits was held by the supreme court not to be disparate treatment under the adea because,although age and years of service may correlate,they are analytically distinct and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily age based,d.our conclusion in erie county that medicare status is an criterion was consistent with the reasoning of the court of appeals for the second circuit in johnson new york,cir.there,the court held that an air base termination of a security guard when the guard attained age and could not maintain active status in the air national guard due to forced resignation in that organization violated the adea because the plaintiff age and termination we re inextricably linked and the sole cause of plaintiff loss of dual status and his consequent termination was his age.id.at 
discrimination because of a handicap 
regardless of whether plaintiff frames a disparate treatment claim under the fhaa as one alleging discriminatory animus or one alleging a facially discriminatory classification,the most fundamental element of the claim is that plaintiff must demonstrate that defendant alleged discrimination was because of a handicap.f.this requirement,plainly read from the language of the fhaa,is very often glossed over or,perhaps,so obvious as not worthy of discussion here,however,it does not appear to us to be so obvious and thus the focus of our inquiry on this point is whether handicapped or disabled protected trait under the being used as the basis for different treatment.dibiase,at explaining that inquiry involves whether a policy facially discriminates on the basis of the protected trait and explicitly classifies people on that basis emphasis added.
in the context of a facially discriminatory classification claim,to determine whether the basis of the alleged discrimination is indeed handicapped status,we must examine the language of the challenged regulation or policy,aided,if applicable,by any evidence of record that informs the analysis.for example,as we indicated above,a classification based on service dogs could,in many contexts,constitute a proxy for discrimination because of a handicap.however,were the challenged regulation to require all domesticated dogs to submit to mandatory vaccination,the express inclusion of service dogs would not discriminate because of a handicap,it would discriminate because a service dog is a domesticated dog.here,we need to determine whether different treatment of a personal care home was necessarily disability based.
the district court concluded that because personal care home coincided with the fhaa definition of handicap,the use of the term constituted facial discrimination because of a handicap and,consequently,the authority assessment of increased fees and burdens to the house violated the fhaa.yet,we are not so sure.first,we question whether,on this record,personal care home necessarily means home for the disabled or handicapped.handicap is defined under the fhaa as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of a person major life activities,a record of having such an impairment,or being regarded as having such an impairment.h see also supra note.personal care home,however,is nowhere defined in the regulation at issue.on its face,the term personal care home has nothing to do with handicapped or disabled status.without any context to inform our interpretation of this term,personal care home could fairly be used to describe any number of facilities providing services to residents who may not necessarily have,have had,or be regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity under the fhaa definition of handicap.this could include a home where the elderly juveniles including juvenile delinquents,abused or neglected children,or orphans the homeless battered women or offenders would be cared for.see,horizon house.at alliance for the mentally ill city of naperville.
second,even if personal care home were equated with homes for the disabled or handicapped,we do not believe that the regulatory classification of such a house as commercial was necessarily because of the disabled or handicapped status of the house residents rather than the commercial nature of csg as the lessee of the property.the testimony of administrator hahn offers further support for a rationale.thus,we do not agree that this case lends itself to a facially discriminatory classification theory because the challenged regulation does not facially discriminate against csg because of the handicapped status of the residents.
although we are examining the classification on its face,we should nonetheless look at the record evidence and go beyond the use of a potentially technically neutral classification,mcwright,at,so as to ferret out any indicia that the disparate treatment was covertly because of a handicap,and also to see if the opposite is the case.in this sense,the term facially discriminatory classification seems to be a bit of a misnomer,but it is not,for we are scrutinizing conduct to better understand the basis for the facial treatment.
we find this fact pattern to be distinguishable from most of the true proxy cases where courts have had little difficulty leaping from the term personal care home or something substantially discrimination based on handicapped status because it was obvious,in light of the language and the record evidence,that the term was used to classify plaintiff facility and treat it differently because of the disabled status of the facilities residents.see,larkin.dep t of social,cir cmty.hous.trust,d children alliance city of bellevue.alliance for the mentally ill.horizon house.a review of these cases reveals that this leap was aided by a combination of four common elements that are lacking here first,the alleged discriminatory classification was actually defined by the challenged regulation in terms that largely coincided with the fhaa definition of handicap second,the classification was used specifically to single out facilities for handicapped individuals for different treatment because of their disability third,there was often direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus indicating an intent to discriminate because of the disabled status of the facilities residents and fourth,the defendant purported reason for treating plaintiff facility differently was predicated on a justification for treating disabled persons differently that was of questionable legitimacy.
in both larkin and horizon house,the courts struck down laws that imposed distance requirements between residential care facilities for persons who were handicapped under the fhaa.in each case,the challenged law singl ed out for regulation group homes for the handicapped with a classification comprising only such facilities.larkin,at noting that the act,by its very terms,applied only to adult foster care facilities which house the disabled,and not to other living arrangements see also horizon house.at concluding that defendant township reactionary enactment of an ordinance imposing a distance requirement between plaintiff family care homes singled out for disparate treatment those who are unable to live on their own and who,in the language of the fair housing act,are handicapped.in alliance for the mentally ill,children alliance,and community housing trust,the courts invalidated laws that singled out for regulation group homes for the handicapped by distinguishing family homes from either residential board and care occupancies,group facilities,or residential facilities,each latter classification constituting a proxy for handicapped status.alliance for the mentally ill.at noting that although the municipal fire code did not use the words handicapped or disabled,special provisions for residential board and care occupancies defined as facilities that house four or more unrelated persons for the purpose of providing personal care services applied primarily to handicapped persons children alliance.at determining that distinguishing families from group facilities based on the presence of a staff providing care and supervision for and assistance with the daily living activities was a proxy for a classification based on the presence of individuals under eighteen and the handicapped as both groups require supervision and assistance and,therefore,facially discriminated on the basis of familial and handicapped status cmty.hous.trust,d at concluding that the definition of a residential facility as a residential facility for persons who have a common need for treatment,rehabilitation,assistance,or supervision in their daily living called for the application of different standards to persons on the basis of their disability,even though the law did not make such a distinction expressly.
these cases are fundamentally different from what we have here.first,regarding the language of the challenged regulation,each of the cases involved a classification that was expressly defined in terms that the court found coincided with the fhaa definition of handicap.as we discussed above,here,the challenged classification personal care home is not defined at all under the regulation.consequently,there is nothing on the face of the regulation to suggest that personal care home necessarily means home for the disabled.
second,also regarding the language of the challenged regulation,in the cases the challenged classification was used to single out only facilities for the disabled for different treatment with the only possible explanation being that it was because of the disabled status of their residents.the disabled status of the facilities residents was the dispositive trait for the facilities classification and different treatment.in the instant matter,however,the classification of the many facilities subject to increased fees and burdens associated with sewer alleged,with different sewer charges assessed against numerous different types of facilities based on whether they were deemed residential or commercial.the term personal care home the alleged proxy for disabled not used to single out facilities for assessment of increased fees.rather,the term was included in an illustrative list of a number of different types of facilities used to encompass what the authority deemed to be commercial for the purpose of assessing fees.further,far from being singled out,personal care home was grouped with other rooming facilities in a subset of the commercial list.this subset included hotels,motels,nursing homes,and boarding houses,the common characteristic of which appears to be that all such facilities provide room and boarding services.given that the facilities in this group typically charge a fee for the provision of these services,the logical inference is that personal care homes fit within this subset of the commercial category because personal care homes typically board adults and have a commercial quality.as such,the label personal care home does not,on its face,single out for regulation group homes for the handicapped in the same way as was present in the other cases referred to above.larkin,at.disabled status was not,at least ostensibly,the dispositive trait for different treatment.additionally,this use of the term personal care home does not demonstrate that the protected trait by definition plays a role in the process by classifying people on that basis dibiase,at.
third,beyond the language of the regulation,in a number of the cases there was direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus directed at plaintiff facility because the facility provided services to handicapped individuals.although a plaintiff need not,consequently,a court need not find malice or discriminatory animus of a defendant under a facial discrimination claim,bangerter,at,clearly,evidence of some intent to disadvantage a class of people makes the determination of the basis for the overt disparate treatment much easier.see supra note.there is no evidence in the record here that the enactment of the regulatory provision or the authority reclassification of the house was motivated by any discriminatory animus unlike the circumstances in horizon house,the authority did not enact the regulations in response to csg seeking zoning approval with the specific intent to burden csg,the trust,or the residents of the house.the regulations used to reclassify the house were already in force.also,unlike horizon house,alliance for the mentally ill,children alliance,and community housing trust,there is no indication that there was any opposition by neighbors or other agencies of the municipality.indeed,the zoning approval process,the hurdle at which a number of plaintiffs in the cases fell,ended successfully for csg with the zoning hearing board granting a variance to allow csg to provide caretaker services at the house.lastly,there was no circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus of the character noted in children alliance there was no evidence of a policy to protect the neighborhood from the adverse impacts of group homes nor is wind gap lacking group homes.
fourth,and last,in the cases,each defendant purported reason for treating plaintiff facility differently was predicated on some justification for treating disabled persons differently,and such justification was found by the court to be unsupported or otherwise invalid whereas in these cases the reason for different treatment seemed little more than makeweight,here we view initial examination which is all we really have presented to us as a matter of record to be reasonable.it is not unreasonable,and most likely within the discretion of the authority as a matter of policy,to presume that commercial facilities have a greater proportionate use of the municipality sewer service as compar
