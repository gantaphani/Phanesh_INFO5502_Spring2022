timothy black and thomas sorge challenge a decision of the surface transportation board affirming an arbitration panel ruling denying them relief under a railroad merger labor protection agreement.we deny the petition.
in,the interstate commerce commission icc approved the grand trunk western railroad acquisition of the detroit,toledo and ironton railroad company and the detroit and toledo shore line railroad company.see norfolk ry,toledo ironton,wl.the icc conditioned its approval of the merger on grand trunk adoption of several of which grand trunk and the affected railroad unions eventually incorporated into a master agreement.ja see,revised and recodified at requiring the icc to impose conditions on any railroad merger to ensure that the employees are guaranteed certain benefits for at least four years after the merger.
the master agreement.the master agreement incorporated what have come to be known as the new york dock which railroads may move employees from one work site to another in order to achieve the benefits of a merger transaction so long as they guarantee workers certain employment protections,including at least six years of compensation.canadian,see new york dock dist.terminal,wl appendix iii.disputes arising from application of the new york dock conditions are subject to binding arbitration.new york dock,at.
in addition to incorporating the new york dock conditions,the master agreement went a few steps granting each employee benefits until he or she qualifies for early retiree major medical benefits,ja,and by providing that no reduction in force of employment shall occur other than principally by death,retirement,discharge for cause,or resignation,norfolk,at.to accommodate employees of the smaller detroit and toledo shore line railroad company,the agreement provided that such employees shall be obligated to accept a reasonably comparable position,which does not require a change in residence in order to maintain their protection hereunder.ja.
agreement h of the working agreements.the master agreement was not.it required grand trunk to enter into separate working agreements with each of the unions before the master agreement became effective.in,grand trunk and the brotherhood of railway carmen adopted the working agreements to implement the master agreement.agreement h of the working agreements provided that i t is the intent and purpose of this agreement to provide for expedited changes in services,facilities and operations and for the orderly transfer of protected employees,work and positions between the and railroads and within the two railroads and that grand trunk will not be required to hire a new employee at any point for a position that is subject to the working agreement at a time that a protected employee who is qualified for such position is receiving protection compensation as a furloughed employee.ja agreement h,section i.agreement h was intended only to clarify conditions,responsibilities and obligations of protected employees,not to eliminate or reduce any existing conditions,responsibilities or obligations as pertaining to protected employees.ja agreement h,section v.
agreement h obligated grand trunk to try to fill vacant positions with local employees.ja agreement h,section ii.if it could not do so,grand trunk had the option of offering the position to furloughed protected employees at other points receiving compensation in reverse order of seniority.id.agreement h,section ii.in the event transferred employees needed to change their residence,they could elect one of four options they could transfer to the position they could transfer to another available job in the system while maintaining their seniority at their original work site they could take a lump sum buyout or they could be furloughed without protective benefits but subject to recall.ja.
agreement h likewise provided that w ork,positions employees may be transferred to another seniority point.ja agreement h,section i.under this agreement,then,grand trunk could transfer a position to another point in the system,though it had to try to fill the new position with local employees.ja agreement h,section i a a.if it could not,grand trunk could assign the junior protected employee at the point where the work is being transferred from to such position.id.agreement h,section i a b.if that worker had to change his residence,he had the same four options outlined above.ja agreement h,section i a b.by contrast,when the railroad abolished a position,agreement h provided only that the displaced worker would maintain his seniority at his original work site.ja agreement h,section i b.
the extra board agreement.in,grand trunk and the brotherhood of railway carmen agreed to modify the method of compensating union members furloughed with compensation.the resulting extra board agreement stated that all employees who would otherwise stand to be furloughed as a result of a reduction in force will be placed on an extra board instead of receiving dismissal allowances,ja,which is to say they would stand ready to work in case of an unexpected personnel shortage at their local work site.the agreement,together with several side letters,clarified that all references to furloughed protected employees receiving protection compensation would now apply to protected employees on an extra board.ja march,side letter to extra board agreement.
underlying claim.in april,grand trunk abolished seven carmen employees who inspect and maintain the railway cars used in freight and passenger its toledo,ohio railyard.because the rail system had carmen vacancies at the time,grand trunk offered each of the displaced carmen four options in accordance with the provisions of agreement h filling one of the vacancies at a railyard in flint,michigan,displacing a carman at another facility,accepting a buyout or remaining in toledo without compensation but eligible for recall.
black and sorge,two of the carmen,rejected these options,demanding instead that they be placed on an extra board at the toledo railyard.the two carmen claimed that section of the master agreement prohibited grand trunk from transferring them to another location and that the extra board agreement required grand trunk to place them on an extra board because their positions had been abolished.grand trunk responded that carman positions are available at flint,michigan,freeing it of any obligation to create an extra board.ja.grand trunk also construed their refusal to be transferred or bought out as choosing furlough without protection,but it said that it would give the two men additional time to accept the vacant carman positions in flint.id.
black and sorge first sought to resolve this dispute through their union,the brotherhood of railroad carmen.the union refused to help,noting that because the two men had declined grand trunk offers of employment,there were no agreement provisions to now pursue a claim.ja.when the union also refused to represent the two men in arbitration with grand trunk,they obtained their own counsel and pursued arbitration of their claim.
a divided arbitration up of a representative from grand trunk,a representative of the carmen and a neutral the claim.in the panel view,agreement h obligated claimants to accept a transfer to fill an available vacancy or have their protective benefits suspended.ja.not only was this interpretation entirely consistent with the past practice on the property,the panel concluded,ja,but it also was consistent with new york dock awards that hold that employees must accept positions that would require them to move or else be placed on furloughed status without benefits,ja.the panel also found that there was no evidence that the parties to the agreement ever considered it to limit the carrier right to transfer protected employees.ja.
black and sorge appealed the arbitration award to the surface transportation board,the successor agency to the icc.see icc termination act of,stat.applying the deferential lace curtain standard of review to arbitration awards,the board denied their appeal.see chicago transp,wl lace curtain,af sub nom.int l of workers icc.the board rejected their contentio
