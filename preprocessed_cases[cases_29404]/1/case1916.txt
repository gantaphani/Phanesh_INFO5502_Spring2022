introduction 
factual and procedural background 
vanguard fabricates,installs,and maintains fire suppression and security products,including sprinkler systems,fire extinguishers,kitchen hoods,and alarm systems.vanguard has four facilities in michigan that install fire security systems throughout the state.vanguard installs two types of systems sprinkler systems that spray liquid onto the area below and special hazard or chemical systems that spray a gas or powder onto an area that may be harmed by water computer room or paper storage areas.
in march or april of,vanguard installers began organizing a union.following a election in july of,where the union won,the union was certified as the representative of employees who were engaged in the installation and service of fire protection sprinkler pipe and chemical system pipe.the certification did not include other employees.
following unsuccessful contract negotiations,the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the board which included allegations that the company unlawfully subcontracted for bargaining work.pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on june,the parties agreed that the modified description of the bargaining unit work would include installation and repair of fire sprinkler systems without geographic limitation,and restaurant systems.the bargaining unit work,thus,did not include installation and repair of other chemical or gas special hazard systems or the testing or inspection of the systems.these charges are not part of the order under review by this court,but the modifications made to the scope of the bargaining unit were effective at the time of the company withdrawal of recognition.negotiations for an initial contract continued with the changes to the bargaining unit.
in early,the union filed the charges at issue in the instant appeal which allege vanguard began to charge its bargaining unit employees for cell phone overages,which the union contended,was a unilateral change in the terms and conditions of employment without notice to or bargaining with the union,as required by the act.the union also alleged that vanguard committed an unfair labor practice by demanding on july,that the union provide a detailed agenda prior to the august,scheduled meeting and refusing to negotiate after twice receiving agendas.
in addition,the union charges included the allegation that vanguard illegally withdrew recognition of the union.approximately two months after refusing to meet,vanguard formally withdrew its recognition of the union by letter dated october.in the letter,vanguard stated that it received a petition signed by a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit which stated that they no longer wished to be represented by the union.the disaffection petition was signed by eight employees.at the administrative hearing,the parties stipulated that at the time vanguard withdrew recognition,the bargaining unit included eleven employees.the parties did not agree,however,as to the bargaining unit status of four of the eight employees who signed the petition.the contested employees were sean wiggers,evan timmerman,nate sloan,and austin aamodt.
the charges were investigated and a complaint was issued,after which a hearing before alj locke ensued in march of.at the hearing,general counsel to the union amended the complaint to add an alternative the alj found that sean wiggers,evan timmerman,and nate sloan were employees in the bargaining unit,then vanguard improperly granted discretionary wage increases without bargaining with or notice to the union.the record indicates that alj locke recognized this amended count was pled in the alternative.subsequent to the amendment at the hearing,vanguard admitted these allegations and added the defense that these allegations were untimely.
on september,alj locke issued his decision and order which held that vanguard committed unfair labor practices by unilaterally implementing changes to the cell phone reimbursement policy without notice or bargaining refusing to bargain unless the union first complied with demand for an agenda withdrawing recognition of the union without the required majority of bargaining unit employees signatures and withdrawing recognition of the union based on a petition that was tainted by the company prior unfair practices.
vanguard filed exceptions to alj locke decision,which was affirmed in most part by the board.the board held that it was unlawful for vanguard to withdraw recognition without the support of a majority of bargaining unit members,and thus found it unnecessary to decide whether the disaffection petition was tainted by prior unfair practices.
national labor relations act 
the act makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with the rights of employees to organize.see.specifically at issue in this appeal are sections a and of the act.section a of the act makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section of this title.a.section a of the act makes it unlawful for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees,subject to the provisions of section a of this title.a.
ii.analysis 
summary enforcement of uncontested findings 
vanguard failed to challenge the board decision that vanguard violated sections a and of the act by granting wage increases,higher starting wages,and higher vacation accrual rates to certain employees without first giving notice or an opportunity to bargain to the union.vanguard also failed to contest the board finding that vanguard violated sections a and of the act by refusing to provide the union with requested information about jobs that had been awarded to vanguard but had yet to commence.as this court has previously stated,a n employer failure to address or take issue with the board findings and conclusions with regard to violations of the act effectively results in abandonment of the right to object to those determinations.nlrb talsol,cir quoting nlrb kentucky may coal,cir.
in cases in which the employer fails to challenge a portion of the board findings on appeal,this court may summarily enforce the board order with regard to those issues.talsol,at see also nlrb fabrications,cir stating that the board uncontested findings of unfair labor practices are entitled to summary affirmance.when an employer fails to challenge certain adverse findings of the board,as did vanguard in this appeal,the employer effectively admits the truth of those findings and loses the right to object to them.kentucky may coal,at.accordingly,the board is entitled to summary enforcement as to the uncontested portions of its decision and order.
standard of review 
this court reviews the nlrb legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings under a substantial evidence standard.harborside healthcare,nlrb,cir quoting.river cmty.care,nlrb,cir.factual findings are supported by substantial evidence if a reasonable mind might accept the evidence as adequate to support a conclusion.lee nlrb,cir.even if this court conclusion as to the substantiality of factual evidence would be different under de novo review,it defer s to the board reasonable inferences and credibility determinations as to factual evidence.clemens hosp.nlrb,cir.in reviewing the nlrb interpretation of the act,this court is deferential to the board interpretation.id.so long as the nlrb interpretation of the statute is reasonably defensible,this court will not disturb such interpretation.id.
given the standard of review,we must decide whether there is substantial evidence to support the board findings that vanguard violated the act by withdrawing union recognition insisting that the union produce an agenda and enforcing the cellular telephone reimbursement policy.for the reasons stated below,we find that there is substantial evidence to support each of the board findings.
withdrawal of union recognition based on employee petition 
a letter dated october,from vanguard attorney,timothy ryan,to the union attorney,james tucker,stated that vanguard was withdrawing its recognition of the union based on an employee petition signed by a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.in order to comply with section a of the act,an employer may only withdraw recognition where the union has actually lost the support of the majority of the bargaining unit employees.levitz furniture of the pacific,nlrb.this court noted in pleasantview nursing home,nlrb,cir,that lack of majority support may be shown by a petition signed by a majority of members of the bargaining unit.the issue in this case is whether the disaffection petition relied on by vanguard in withdrawing its recognition of the union indicated that the union no longer enjoyed the support of a majority of the bargaining unit members.
there was substantial evidence on the record for the board to conclude that,despite the disaffection petition signed by eight employees,the union continued to enjoy the support of the majority of the bargaining unit members.vanguard alleged that the bargaining unit consisted of fourteen members and that seven of them signed the disaffection petition,resulting in a loss of majority support for the union.the union alleged,and the board found,that the bargaining unit consisted of eleven members and that only four of them signed the disaffection petition,meaning that the union continued to enjoy the support of seven out of eleven,a definite majority,of the bargaining unit members.the parties stipulated that eleven employees were members of the bargaining unit.the three employees whose bargaining unit status was uncertain included nathan sloan,evan timmerman,and sean wiggers.
during the course of initial contract negotiations,the union filed unfair labor charges against vanguard.on june,the union and vanguard entered into an informal settlement agreement which modified the description of bargaining unit work to consist of 
the installation and repair of fire sprinkler systems without geographic limitation,and restaurant systems of the type performed by marty shields,but shall not include the installation and repair of any other chemical or gas special hazard systems,and shall not include the visual inspection and related testing of any systems.
the board found that because sloan,timmerman,and wiggers were not performing bargaining unit work when they signed the petition,their signatures on the petition were not to be counted.
nathan sloan testified that he began working for vanguard in june as a shop employee and remained in that position until he was laid off for one day on august.maintenance shop work was not included in the description of bargaining unit work.when sloan returned to work he was told he would be a sprinkler fitter,a position within the bargaining unit,however,the board found that he spent much of august continuing to work in the shop.during portions of the final week of august and the first week of september,sloan work included sprinkler installation,however,the remainder of september was again spent working in the shop.sloan testified that he also spent the month of october working in the shop and the record does not support a contrary finding.relying on arlington masonry supply,nlrb,holding that one must,for a sufficient amount of time,regularly perform duties similar to those performed by unit employees in order to be considered a member of the bargaining unit,the board found that,based upon the small amount of time he spent performing bargaining unit work,nathan sloan was not a member of the bargaining unit.while there was evidence that a small portion of sloan time was dedicated to bargaining unit work,this court has held that it will not overturn factual findings of the board simply because the evidence could have been viewed differently.talsol,at.
evan timmerman began working for vanguard in march,and was assigned to the special hazards systems,which is not included in the bargaining unit.while there was some evidence that timmerman spent a portion of his time installing sprinkler systems,the evidence on the record indicated that the percentage of timmerman work time spent performing such bargaining unit work was not high.the board had substantial evidence to conclude that timmerman did not spend enough time prior to or during october the time the disaffection petition was presented regularly performing duties that would have entitled him to inclusion in the bargaining unit.as timmerman was not a bargaining unit employee in october,his signature on the petition is of no consequence.
sean wiggers began working for vanguard in late june as a sprinkler system installer,but in december or january,wiggers was assigned to the special hazards systems which is not a part of the bargaining unit.wiggers has worked in the special hazards unit since the time of his reassignment,thus,he was not a bargaining unit employee in october and his signature on the petition is also inconsequential.
the record provided the board with substantial evidence to conclude that sloan,timmerman,and wiggers were not bargaining unit employees when they signed the petition.that determination meant that there were only eleven bargaining unit members at the time the petition was signed.because aamodt,sloan,timmerman and wiggers were not in the bargaining unit,only four of the eight signatures on the petition represented bargaining unit members.the union continued to be supported by seven of the eleven bargaining unit members,therefore,vanguard withdrawal of union recognition violated section a of the act.levitz,nlrb at an employer may only withdraw union recognition when the union actually loses the support of the majority of bargaining unit members.
interestingly,vanguard does not seem to challenge the board findings that sloan,timmerman and wiggers were not members of the bargaining unit.vanguard instead makes a futile attempt to characterize a portion of the union alternatively pled complaint as an admission by the union that sloan,timmerman and wiggers were members of the bargaining unit.the union complaint initially alleged that vanguard violated the act by withdrawing union recognition while the union maintained the support of the majority of the bargaining unit members.in order to find this allegation true,alj locke would have needed to find that sloan,timmerman,and wiggers were not members of the bargaining unit.the union amended the complaint to allege,in the alternative,that if sloan,timmerman,and wiggers were found to be members of the bargaining unit,then vanguard violated the act by unilaterally increasing their wages without negotiating with the union.vanguard attempts to argue that the union alternatively pled complaint became an admission or stipulation that the three men were in the bargaining unit once vanguard admitted such fact.vanguard argument is without merit.
alj locke concluded that sloan,timmerman,and wiggers were not in the bargaining unit,therefore,he never reached the allegations in the union alternatively pled complaint.vanguard would have this court believe that
