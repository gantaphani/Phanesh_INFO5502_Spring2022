appellant keith mark dillon appeals from the dismissal on summary judgment of his suit under for abuse he allegedly suffered while being held as a prisoner in jena,louisiana.for the reasons described below,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further development of the record in this case.
on august,when hurricane katrina made landfall in southeastern louisiana,dillon was being held as a prisoner at the jefferson parish correctional center jefferson,within the new orleans metropolitan area.due to the devastation caused by the hurricane,the louisiana department of public safety and corrections dpsc evacuated dillon and other inmates from jefferson on august,and moved them to a temporary facility in jena,louisiana jena.dillon alleges that he was beaten and mistreated by appellees in late september during his detention at jena,resulting in hearing loss and other injuries.shortly after this alleged abuse,in early october,dpsc transferred dillon to allen correctional center allen in kinder,louisiana,and the temporary facility at jena closed.
in july,dillon filed this section suit alleging violations of his civil rights during his incarceration.he proceeded pro se until late march,after which he was represented by counsel.in november,appellees filed a motion to dismiss dillon suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and shortly thereafter the magistrate judge hearing this case recommended that appellees motion be granted.however,the district court rejected the magistrate recommendation and under rule d converted appellees motion into a motion for summary judgment,as the parties had submitted evidence with their briefing going beyond the factual allegations in their pleadings.subsequently,the district court granted summary judgment for appellees in march,on the ground that dillon had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing this suit.this appeal followed.
under the prison litigation reform act plra,prisoners must properly exhaust such administrative remedies as are available prior to filing a section action concerning prison conditions.a woodford ngo,d.louisiana has a administrative remedy procedure arp for inmates,which they are required to use before filing suit in district court.admin.code tit,a.generally,the inmate commences the first step of the grievance process by writing a letter to the warden of his or her institution briefly setting out the basis for his or her claim and the relief sought.g a.the grievance letter should be written within days of the alleged event that is the subject of the complaint.id.the warden has days from the day the grievance is received to respond to the request.id.if following transfer to a new institution,the inmate files a grievance regarding an action taken by his or her former institution,the former institution will complete the processing through the first step.g.furthermore,i f the inmate believes the complaint is sensitive and would be adversely affected if the complaint became known at his or her institution,he or she may skip the first step and file his or her complaint directly with louisiana assistant secretary of adult services.g a.
the inmate may proceed to the second step of the arp by appealing to the secretary of the dpsc if he or she is dissatisfied with the first step response.g a.if the inmate never receives a response to a first step grievance,then he or she is entitled to proceed to the second step of the process upon the expiration of the first step response time limit.g a.if the inmate is not satisfied with the second step response,he or she may then file suit in district court.g b.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.in re egleston,cir internal quotations omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.murray earle,cir.whether a prisoner has exhausted administrative remedies is a mixed question of law and fact.carty thaler,cir.similarly,while it is a question of law whether administrative remedies qualify as being available under a,availability may sometimes turn on questions of fact.see snider melindez,cir.
since exhaustion is an affirmative defense,the burden is on appellees to demonstrate that dillon failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.jones bock,d.consequently,appellees must establish beyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the defense of exhaustion to warrant summary judgment in their favor.see martin alamo cmty.coll,cir.
dillon does not seriously dispute that he failed to satisfy the steps of the arp that are prerequisite to filing a section action.rather,he argues that his suit should not be barred because there was no remedy available to him during the period following the alleged abuse.alternatively,he also argues his failure to exhaust should be excused on the basis of estoppel or the special circumstances surrounding his detention at jena.
in opposition to appellees various motions seeking to dismiss this case,dillon submitted affidavits alleging that no administrative grievance procedures were available to prisoners at jena and that prisoners were explicitly told not to submit grievances.dillon asserts that when he sought to file an administrative complaint at jena after he was abused in late september,appellee brad rogers ordered him to kneel down for approximately an hour and told him to forget about filing a grievance.he also claims that guards checked prisoners outgoing mail and destroyed writings detailing abuses,blocking him from filing a sensitive issues grievance under.admin.code tit,g a.nevertheless,dillon did give a visiting lawyer a grievance,which he expected the lawyer to deliver to the dpsc.dillon discovered after he had filed suit that the lawyer had failed to forward the grievance to the dpsc.
after the dpsc transferred dillon to allen in early october,the period during which he could have filed a grievance under section g a had not yet elapsed and would not do so until late december.however,dillon alleges that allen captain wheaton and inmate counsel dennis coleman told him that he could not file an administrative grievance at allen for abuse suffered at jena.nevertheless,dillon claims to have submitted several grievances at allen,requesting medical treatment for injuries sustained at jena and inquiring whether he was actually barred from filing a grievance at allen for abuse at jena.even if these grievances filed at allen could qualify as first step grievances applicable to the claims advanced in this suit,dillon never pursued them to the second step of the arp process under section g a.
dillon argues this suit may proceed because there were no administrative remedies available to exhaust at jena and allen.when the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief or to take any action whatsoever in response to a complaint,exhaustion is not required under the plra because there is no available remedy.booth churner,d see also days johnson,cir per curiam finding remedy unavailable when prisoner injury prevented him from filing grievance,overruled by implication on other grounds by jones,at.we are unable to determine whether administrative remedies were available for dillon because the record was not sufficiently developed when the district court granted summary judgment for appellees.
the district court did not address whether any administrative remedies were available to dillon at jena,instead focusing its analysis on whether remedies were available at allen.we agree with the district court that the focus should be on availability at remedies were available to dillon at allen,their unavailability at jena would not suffice to excuse his failure to exhaust.dillon was allegedly beaten at jena in late september and was transferred in early october.when he arrived at allen,he could have filed a timely grievance for mistreatment at jena anytime before late december.see.admin.code tit,g a establishing deadline for filing grievance following incident.if impediments to filing grievances render remedies unavailable at one facility,remedies may become available again once a prisoner has been transferred,unless there are other problems at the new facility.see bryant rich,cir.
consequently,we turn to assessing the availability of remedies at allen.dillon raises two arguments concerning availability at allen.first,he contends that the closure of jena resulted in the unavailability of administrative remedies at allen.section g provides that if an inmate files a request after transfer on an action taken by the sending institution,the sending institution will complete the processing through the first step.admin.code tit,g.since jena closed after dillon transfer,he asserts jena could not complete the processing of his grievance,and therefore there was no administrative remedy available to him at allen for the abuse he suffered at jena.
second,dillon argues that his failure to exhaust should be excused because captain wheaton and inmate counsel dennis coleman allegedly told him that he could not file a grievance at allen for abuse suffered at jena.while dillon styles this as an estoppel argument,these statements by wheaton and coleman could conceivably impact whether any remedies were available to dillon under a.see brown croak,cir concluding that statements by prison officials about administrative remedy process may render remedies unavailable.the district court rejected dillon assertion that these statements excuse exhaustion,relying on lyon vande krol,where the eighth circuit held that a prisoner mistaken subjective understanding of a grievance procedure is irrelevant for determining whether remedies are actually available,cir.the district court also found that allowing dillon to rely on wheaton and coleman statements would be inconsistent with this circuit strict approach to the plra exhaustion requirement.see days,at citing richardson spurlock,cir and wright hollingsworth,cir.under our strict approach,we have found that mere substantial compliance with administrative remedy procedures does not satisfy exhaustion instead,we have required prisoners to exhaust available remedies properly.see wright,at spurlock,at.however,our strict approach does not absolutely foreclose the possibility that prison officials statements concerning administrative remedies can render such remedies unavailable.we have long recognized the importance of ensuring that inmates have avenues for discovering the procedural rules governing their grievances,see alexander tippah county,cir per curiam premising ruling that remedies were available on prisoner knowledge of grievance procedures ferrington.dep t of,cir per curiam premising ruling that remedies were available on fact that prisoner was well aware of the general procedural requirements described in the inmate handbook,as has the eighth circuit.see gibson weber,cir premising ruling that remedies were available on prisoners admission of receipt of prisoner guidebook and guidebook explanation of the applicable grievance procedure and its application to all aspects of inmate life.when a prisoner has no means of verifying prison officials claims about the administrative grievance process,incorrect statements by officials may indeed make remedies unavailable.
unfortunately,we are unable to determine whether the district court grant of summary judgment was appropriate,as no discovery has been conducted in this case and the record is fragmentary as a result.first,there is not enough evidence in the record concerning what dillon knew or could have discovered about the arp system for us to determine whether wheaton and coleman alleged statements made remedies unavailable.since dillon filed grievances at allen and asked the lawyer visiting jena to mail a grievance directly to the dpsc,it is clear that dillon had some understanding of the arp system.what is less clear is what dillon knew or could have discovered about the proper manner to proceed with a grievance regarding events at jena after its closure and his transfer.the record does not contain a copy of the allen inmate handbook or other guides to the arp system that dillon could have relied on instead of wheaton and coleman.the record does indicate that upon incarceration,prison officials usually describe the arp system to new inmates at orientation.however,before katrina,dillon was incarcerated at jefferson,a parish facility,and the record suggests that dpsc facilities like allen could have different grievance procedures than parish facilities do.without a firmer grip on what dillon could have discovered about the truth of wheaton and coleman claims in materials like an inmate handbook,we can not determine if summary judgment was warranted.
second,during oral argument,we questioned appellees counsel about the applicability in this situation of section g directive that a first step grievance concerning jena should be processed at jena.in response,counsel stated that the dpsc was operating under emergency procedures while dillon was incarcerated at jena and allen,and that consequently the dpsc could suspend any rules as necessary during this period,such as the rule that jena process all first step grievances from transferred inmates.since the record does not clearly establish whether this provision was in force while dillon was at allen,we find it inappropriate at this time to rule on its meaning.carpenters local union,cir concluding that summary judgment was inappropriate because record did not contain complete copy of collective bargaining agreement being interpreted.
these problems notwithstanding,appellees assert that there is sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that administrative remedies were available at allen.specifically,they point to dpsc records showing that from the date of dillon transfer to allen in early october until the date this suit was filed in july,at allen filed grievances.during the same period,dpsc headquarters directly received five grievances from.while this evidence demonstrates that katrina and rita evacuees did file grievances while at allen,and that they also sent grievances directly to dpsc headquarters,there is no indication that any of these grievances concerned events that took place at jena and,even if they did,that any remedy was available in light of the facility closure.due to the fragmentary nature of the record,we direct the district court to permit dillon to conduct discovery concerning exhaustion and the availability of administrative remedies.
in addition to arguing that administrative remedies were unavailable,dillon contends that appellees should be estopped from raising the defense of exhaustion.specifically,he points to his treatment at jena,where appellee brad rogers allegedly ordered dillon to kneel in rogers office until he forgot about filing a grievance,and where corrections officials allegedly destroyed all outgoing mail containing grievances.also,as another basis for estoppel,dillon relies on the alleged advice from wheaton and coleman indicating that filing a grievance at allen for problems at jena was not possible.
estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked to avoid injustice in particular cases,and a hallmark of the doctrine is its flexible application.heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford county,d.in a number of plra cases,we have held that estoppel provides a basis for excusing a prisoner failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see,days,at wendell asher,cir,overruled by implication on other grounds by jones,at.however,in this case,we conclude that estoppel is not appropriate.a party claiming estoppel must,among other things,demonstrate that he or she reasonably relied on the conduct of the other to his or her substantial injury.mangaroo nelson,cir.in this case,dillon can not show detrimental reliance on the alleged interference with the arp process at jena because it was not the cause of his inability after his transfer to file a grievance concerning his treatme
