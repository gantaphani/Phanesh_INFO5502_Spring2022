after beverly miller was fired from her job of over years as the manager for jefferson county,kentucky,she sued the administrative office of the courts aoc as well as various county officials.she alleged a first amendment violation on the basis that her termination was in retaliation for bringing to light various administrative problems,and further claimed that she was deprived of her right to due process because she was not afforded notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to her termination.miller also brought a claim under the kentucky whistleblower act.
the district court dismissed the claims against the individual defendants in their official capacities and against the aoc on the basis of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.miller claims against the officials in their individual capacities were dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity.she now appeals the dismissal of her claims and the dismissal of her kentucky whistleblower act claim.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.miller employment as manager 
in,miller was hired to serve as the manager for jefferson county,kentucky by judge michael mcdonald.she reported directly to the chief judge.miller retired in,but soon thereafter was reappointed to the same job.instead of being called the manager after her reappointment,however,miller was classified as a supervisor.but her pay did not change,and she performed the same duties managing the jury pool.she continued to perform these duties until she was fired on april.
the issue of whether miller served as a tenured or nontenured employee was a difficult one,according to the district court.judge mcdonald,who hired miller,testified that the position was tenured.he said that the position was essential to the operation of the court and should not be subject to replacement with each new chief judge.her appointment letter,however,stated that miller was to serve at the pleasure of the court.miller argues that,in addition to judge mcdonald intent to hire her as a tenured employee,two other sources of information show that she was a tenured employee the court of justice coj policies and the coj personnel documents.
the coj policies state that they apply to employees and officials unless a specific exception is clearly indicated.aoc director cicely lambert testified that this provision sets up a system whereby employees of the aoc are considered to be tenured unless they are specifically listed in the exceptions portion of the rule.job classifications like secretaries for judges in all courts,law clerks and staff attorneys,and trial court administrators are listed among the exceptions.the defendants argue that miller falls under the exception for the job classification of trial court administrators,even though her official title was manager and later supervisor.
under the coj policies,tenured employees are entitled to various procedures,but nontenured employees serve at the pleasure of their respective appointing authority and are not so entitled.the defendants acknowledge that miller was not afforded the procedures required for tenured employees,but insist that she was not tenured and therefore not entitled to those procedures.
in addition to the coj policies,miller points to the fact that she served a probationary period,a requirement only for tenured employees.she also claims that her annual pay increment was inconsistent with the coj policies regarding nontenured employees.
the defendants,on the other hand,highlight that miller has conceded that she was not a classified or merit employee under kentucky revised statutes chapter.under chapter,these types of employees are considered to be tenured and are entitled to the procedures.miller calls this argument a red herring,contending that the appropriate places to look to determine the tenured status of a coj employee are the coj policies and the employee personnel file,not the listings in chapter.
the nature of miller complaints that allegedly resulted in her termination 
in her complaint,miller alleges that her termination resulted from two separate communications that she initiated about issues of court administration.one involved her complaints regarding fraud,waste,and mismanagement in the conduct of the chief court administrator tim vize and the court administrator roger mccubbins that direct ly result ed in her termination,in violation of the kentucky whistleblower act.the other concerned an email she sent regarding the loss of privately donated funds,allegedly causing her termination in violation of her right to free speech under the first amendment.these two sets of allegations will be addressed in turn.
miller complaints regarding vize and mccubbins 
miller claims that she disclosed to chief judge wine,aoc director lambert,vize,and others,both verbally and in writing,that vize and mccubbins were being paid to perform duties with respect to the jury pool which they,in fact,had never performed.the job descriptions for chief court administrator and court administrator have two relevant sections characteristics of the class and examples of duties.under the characteristics of the class heading,both descriptions state that the employee performs highly responsible duties in jury management.then,as an example of these duties,both descriptions state that the employee a ssists in the calling and pooling and coordination of jurors,answers public inquiries and individual juror complaints and questions,distributes and handles juror questionnaires.
miller sent a letter on april,to judge wine,vize,mccubbins,and others highlighting that these duties were not being performed.specifically,she stated as you know,for over years,the court administrators in jefferson county have not performed these duties assigned by aoc.
miller complaint regarding the loss of privately donated funds 
on april,miller sent an email message to over recipients,including judge wine,the aoc,and the judges of jefferson county.the substance of this loss of funding for new orientation video is set forth below 
in february,i applied for grant money from the louisville bar and kentucky bar foundations for the purpose of updating our jury orientation film.several other people put a lot of time and effort into securing money for this project,including former chief circuit judge jeff morris,chief district judge bill ryan,judge william knopf,dan goyette,creighton mershon,bill schneider and others.
we were awarded money from both foundations as a joint venture in spring of.unfortunately,the timing coincided with the loss of staff in our office which left us critically understaffed for over a year.in september we were assigned a clerk but our staffing shortage continues today due to the workload has more than doubled.sic without automation and no additional staff assigned to this office since,we are barely able to keep our heads above water,much less find the time to devote to this project as well as other projects to sustain our office.
i have documented several times,when requesting help,my concern about the possibility of losing our funding because of not being able to proceed with the project.
regrettably,the kentucky bar foundation has asked that the money be returned.
if aoc can provide any assistance to jefferson county in remedying our problem,it would be greatly appreciated.
miller termination 
in response to miller april,email,judge wine asked that vize contact the aoc in order to ascertain what procedures were necessary to terminate miller.vize contacted three individuals kevin smalley,an attorney for the aoc cicely lambert,the aoc director and former general counsel and rita cobb,the aoc personnel director.all three individuals advised vize that miller was a nontenured employee.
judge wine testified that,in the months prior to miller sending this email,he was already having problems with miller.these problems had caused wine to consult smalley,lambert,and cobb about the proper procedures to terminate miller.wine also discussed these problems with kentucky supreme court justice martin johnstone.wine testified that t he decision to terminate miller was made prior to receiving that from her.we were in the process of working with the aoc,coj,to determine what needed to be said,how the letter needed to read,and those discussions had finished a week prior.as to whether the email influenced the decision to fire miller,wine said that i t did help her cause.
on april,judge wine called miller into his chambers.he gave miller the option of resigning or being terminated.miller refused to resign,so wine fired her.in a letter dated the same day,wine explained his reasons for firing miller.he first recognized that miller had raised concerns about staffing issues in the office,but reiterated his disagreement with her assessment that they truly needed more staff.several corrective measures had already been implemented,even some suggested by miller herself,but to the extent that any further workforce issues remained,wine concluded that better time management by miller herself would have solved the problem.despite repeated attempts to help,wine wrote in his termination letter,miller continued to display conduct that is unprofessional and inappropriate,resulting in a very negative influence on morale and the operations of the office.he also stated that miller had been hostile and argumentative and displayed insubordinate behavior to her immediate supervisor,vize.for these reasons,wine concluded that he was compelled to present miller with th e letter of termination effective immediately.
procedural background 
miller original complaint set forth claims against the aoc,vize in both his official and individual capacities,and chief judge wine in his official capacity only.the complaint was later amended to account for the fact that judge wine was replaced by judge shake as chief judge of the jefferson county circuit court.miller thus alleged claims against the aoc,vize in both his official and individual capacities,judge wine in his individual capacity,and chief judge shake in his official capacity.miller later moved to amend her complaint for a second time,but this motion was denied.this denial is discussed in more detail below,in response to one of miller claims on appeal.
on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity,the district court dismissed the claims against vize in his official capacity,judge shake in his official capacity,and against the aoc,except to the extent that miller requested prospective,injunctive relief.in the final order entered by the district court,however,miller complaint was completely dismissed without further explanation.
the district court separately addressed miller claims under against vize and judge wine in their individual capacities.according to the court,miller failed to allege a violation of her first amendment rights,therefore entitling vize and wine to qualified immunity on that claim.with respect to her due process claim,the district court assumed that miller had a property interest in her job and that she was terminated without proper notice and a hearing.the district court nevertheless held that vize and wine were entitled to qualified immunity because their decision to terminate miller was reasonable given the advice they received when they investigated whether she could be terminated as an employee.summary judgment was therefore entered in the defendants favor on these constitutional claims.
finally,with respect to miller whistleblower act claim against vize and judge wine in their individual capacities,the district court concluded that miller failed to state a viable claim.the act,according to the court,protects employees against retaliation for the good faith reporting of suspected violations of the law or administrative regulations.miller complaints did not involve this type of protected information.summary judgment was therefore entered in the defendants favor on the claims as well.
miller raises three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in concluding that vize and judge wine were entitled to qualified immunity on her and due process claims,whether the district court erred in denying miller request to amend her complaint for the second time,and whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to vize and judge wine on miller whistleblower act claim.
miller does not challenge on appeal the district court dismissal of her claims against the officials for prospective relief even though the district court never provided any reasons for dismissing these potentially meritorious claims.furthermore,she never discusses the dismissal of her claims for prospective relief in her opening brief.this court has held that issues are waived when not raised in the appellant opening brief.bickel korean air lines,cir see also blatter,cir en banc holding that issues not presented in an opening brief are waived.any argument that miller has in this regard is therefore waived.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the law of qualified immunity 
in determining whether a law enforcement officer is shielded from civil liability due to qualified immunity,this court typically employs a analysis whether,considering the allegations in a light most favorable to the party injured,a constitutional right has been violated,and whether that right was clearly established.estate of carter city of detroit,cir citing saucier katz,d.this court occasionally considers a third step in the qualified immunity analysis,in addition to the two steps listed above.see estate of carter,at panels of this court occasionally employ a qualified immunity analysis,as opposed to the analysis set forth here b oth the approach and the approach can be said to capture the holding of saucier.citations omitted.when utilized,this third step requires an inquiry into whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.champion outlook nashville,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court since saucier has continued to use the approach to qualified immunity,but this court has noted that the approach may in some cases increase the clarity of the proper analysis.see estate of carter,at.if,on the other hand,the case at issue is one of the many cases where,if the right is clearly established,the conduct at issue would also be objectively unreasonable,then this court has collapse d the second and third prongs in an effort to avoid duplicative analysis.caudill hollan,cir.throughout the analysis,the burden is on miller to show that the individual defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.silberstein city of dayton,cir once the qualified immunity defense is raised,the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.
on appeal,miller challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity with respect to her first amendment claim and her claim that she was denied due process in the manner that she was terminated.these arguments will be addressed in turn.
miller first amendment claim 
in order to make out a prima facie case that she was terminated in retaliation for engaging in speech protected by the first amendment,miller must show that she engaged in constitutionally protected speech that is,that her speech touched on matters of public concern,that she was subjected to an adverse action or was deprived of some benefit,and that the protected speech was a substantial or a motivating factor in the adverse action.banks wolfe county bd.of,cir citations and quotation marks omitt
