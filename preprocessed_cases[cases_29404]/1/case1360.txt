following the denial of its application for a conditional use permit to construct a wireless communication tower at an elementary school,t mobile northeast llc filed suit in federal court,alleging that the denial violated the telecommunications act of.the district court agreed and issued an injunction directing that t mobile application be granted.because we,too,conclude that the denial is not supported by substantial evidence as required by the act,we affirm.
based on complaints about a gap in coverage in the denbigh area of newport news,virginia,t mobile identified nelson elementary school nelson elementary as a target location for a new wireless communication tower.t mobile subsequently entered into an agreement with the newport news school board to lease a parcel of land at the school for construction and operation of the tower.under the local zoning ordinance,however,construction of the tower at the school required the issuance of a conditional use permit.thus,in april,t mobile submitted an application for the permit to the newport news planning department.
at the time,although already located at local high schools,no communication towers were located at local elementary schools.accordingly,the planning department and the school board conducted a joint study into the appropriateness of building towers at elementary schools.while the study was ongoing,t mobile scheduled a meeting to explain its application in more detail and to respond to any questions.although households near nelson elementary were notified of the meeting,fewer than ten residents attended.the questions at the meeting focused on the visual impact of the tower and its potential radiation effects.
in an august report report,the planning department noted that e lementary school sites are desirable to mobile phone service providers for building cell phone towers because the sites usually are embedded within residential neighborhoods.id.the report also recommended nelson elementary as an acceptable site for a tower,finding that the school had more land than needed for recreational areas,a tower should not unduly impact the adjacent residences,the zoning of the surrounding areas did not permit a tower and no towers were in the area,although residences were nearby,an extensive wooded buffer will remain that will reduce the tower visibility from adjoining properties,and a tower will have minimal impact on the surrounding properties and neighborhood if a stealth design is used.id.
subsequently,the city council the city held a work session to discuss the report.several councilmembers expressed concerns about the location proposed for the tower.id.voicing concern that communication towers posed a health risk to children id.arguing that communications towers were dangerous to a child developing mind id.noting that personnel who monitored the towers could pose a safety risk to students.ultimately,the city agreed to consider nelson elementary as a potential site,but decided to study alternative locations as well.
thereafter,following discussions between t mobile and the planning department,t mobile submitted a new,permit application.following a public hearing,the newport news planning commission unanimously recommended that the city approve t mobile application.
the city held a separate public hearing on t mobile application where nine citizens spoke six in favor of the application and three in opposition.those in favor emphasized the need for better cell phone coverage and the economic benefit the school board would receive by leasing the land to t mobile.the supporters were all affiliated with t mobile,either as customers or employees.t mobile also submitted a petition with the names of customers who supported the tower.
lisa murphy,counsel for t mobile,explained how increased cell phone use necessitated constructing towers in residential areas.she addressed emissions concerns,noting that the emissions were akin to those from a radio and stating that the tower was fully compliant with all of the federal requirements.id.additionally,the record before the city included photographs from a balloon test,designed to demonstrate the visual impact of the tower.the city also had before it a memorandum from the county assessor in neighboring york county,asserting that he was not aware of any instances where the location of a cellular communications tower has had a negative impact on property values in york county and that he received no contrary information from several other adjacent localities.id.
three local residents spoke in opposition to the tower.rachel weaver,a neighborhood resident and mother of a kindergartener at nelson elementary,expressed concern about radiation exposure to the children,id,and the property values of nearby homes,id.michael charnock,another local resident,argued that the decrease in value of our homes,much less the repercussions of what could happen to our children,counseled against constructing the tower.id.cliff manuel,the minister of a church neighboring the school,also opposed the tower,arguing that the last pristine possible resource that we have are the children of newport news.id.additionally,an email from another resident,dennis crawford,was before the city.in it,he raised concerns about the tower health effects on children and its impact on the residential area,and questioned h ow many more eyesores do we want to locate in denbigh id.
after closing the hearing,the city voted without explanation to deny t mobile application.
on july,t mobile filed suit against the city of newport news and the city council in the eastern district of virginia,alleging violations of section of the telecommunications act of.t mobile complaint alleged that the denial was not supported by substantial evidence,in violation of c b iii and unlawfully based on concerns of potential health effects from emissions,in violation of c b iv 
after considering the parties for summary judgment,the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendation,finding that the city denial was not based on substantial evidence.the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment to t mobile on this claim,issuing an injunction ordering the city to approve t mobile application,and denying the city motion for summary judgment.because the magistrate judge found that after removing any discussion of health effects from the record,the city denial is not based on substantial evidence,he determined that he need not decide the second claim id.
although both parties filed objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,the district court adopted it in full id.the city timely appealed.
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court,and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.pueschel peters,cir citing nader blair,cir and battle seibels bruce ins,cir alteration omitted.under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
congress enacted the telecommunications act of to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies,stat.the act sought to limit the ability of state and local governments to frustrate the national purpose of facilitating the growth of wireless telecommunications,but also intended to preserve state and local control over the siting of towers and other facilities that provide wireless services.commc ns of charlottesville bd.of sup rs of albemarle county,cir.to strike this balance,the act preserves the power of the local zoning authority over decisions regarding the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities,while placing certain limits on that authority.c a.
two of those limitations are at issue in this case.first,the act requires that a ny decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.id.c b iii second,the act forbids the regulation of wireless service facilities based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the commission regulations concerning such emissions.id.c b iv 
the city argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to t mobile on its substantial evidence claim,contending instead that summary judgment should have been granted in the city favor,and failing to grant summary judgment to the city on t mobile health effects claim.we reject these contentions and therefore affirm.
the act requires that the city denial of t mobile application be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.c b iii emphasis added.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,but less than a preponderance.see at t wireless pcs,city council of city of virginia beach,cir.it has been described as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting universal camera nlrb.when reviewing the decision of a local elected body,a reasonable mind is the mind of a reasonable legislator.id.so framed,we have noted that i t is not only proper but even expected that a legislature and its members will consider the views of their constituents to be particularly compelling forms of evidence.id.in reviewing whether the denial of a permit application is supported by substantial evidence,a court is not free to substitute its judgment for the agency or in this case the legislature it must uphold a decision that has substantial support in the record as a whole even if it might have decided differently as an original matter.id.quoting nlrb grand canyon mining,cir.
the city first argues that the district court in effect shifted the burden from t mobile to the city by analyzing whether there was substantial evidence in the written record to support the city denial of the application without first determining whether t mobile presented evidence sufficient to meet the conditions required by the local zoning ordinance for the city to issue the permit.appellants br.according to the city,the tower could be built only with the issuance of a conditional use permit under the newport news zoning ordinance,in turn,a conditional use permit shall be issued only if eight conditions have been met.citing newport news code the city specifically faults the district court for failing to assess t mobile evidence on the first of these conditions requiring that the specific use of the tower be compatible with and not injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property,nor significantly diminish or impair property values within the immediate vicinity.id.absent a review of the evidence offered by t mobile,the city argues,the district court did not determine if substantial evidence supported the decision actually made by council.appellants br.in sum,the city suggests that t mobile lack of evidence amounts to substantial evidence supporting the city denial.we disagree.
although we review de novo the grant of summary judgment in favor of t mobile,we do not sit as an appellate zoning board making a de novo determination of whether the application satisfied the relevant municipal requirements.appellee br.the act instead directs that we determine whether substantial evidence supports the city decision to deny a request.c b iii emphasis added.thus,we ask only whether the denial not the application itself is supported by substantial evidence.
in making this assessment,we look to the applicable zoning ordinance to determine whether the reasons for the city decision are contemplated therein.see,sprint spectrum,platte county,cir citing the zoning ordinance in noting that aesthetic concerns can be a valid basis on which to deny sprint permit emphasis added t mobile central,llc unified gov t of wyandotte county,cir concluding that the court must look to the requirements set forth in the local zoning code to determine the substantive criteria to be applied in determining whether substantial evidence existed emphasis added.here,however,the district court did not find that the city denial was based on factors extrinsic to the ordinance.rather,effectively assuming the validity of these factors,the court concluded that the meager opposition did not amount to substantial evidence.see finding that although citizens need not be armed with a slew of experts,where the only cohesive thread of opposition was found in four citizens passing comments on property values,such opposition was not substantial evidence.
in any event,the district court order belies the city notion that the court ruled w ithout reviewing the evidence presented to support the permit.appellants br.to the contrary,the district court noted that t mobile submitted its application in response to customer complaints of a gap in coverage the court also outlined the specifics of the tower,stating that it would be located behind the elementary school,and adjacent to a foot wide wooded buffer,consist of a foot monopole tower,with flush mounted antennas to minimize its profile,not be surrounded by an equipment shed,and not be marked or lit.further,the court took note of the balloon test conducted to demonstrate the visibility of the proposed tower and of t mobile efforts to field questions about visual impact and radiation effects from the tower.id.finally,the court observed that following review of an extensive report which considered the proposed location and impact of the tower at nelson elementary,the planning commission unanimously voted to recommend approval.id.in sum,we are satisfied that the district court thoroughly reviewed the evidence supporting the permit and did not impermissibly shift the burden to the city and its citizens.
next,the city contends that the district court erred in finding that its denial of the application is not supported by substantial evidence.we do not agree.
as our cases demonstrate,determining whether substantial evidence supports the denial of an application submitted pursuant to the act is necessarily a inquiry.for example,in communications,we concluded that substantial evidence supported the board denial of an application to build a foot tower on the ridgeline of a mountain.at.there,at least ten citizens spoke against the tower,objecting in part to the tower visibility,its inconsistency with environmental preservation goals,and its impact on the character of the area,and forty citizens signed a petition in opposition.id.at.additionally,there was evidence that the tower would be inconsistent with the local plans and ordinance.id.on these facts,we found that the denial was supported by substantial evidence.
we also upheld the board denial of an application as supported by substantial evidence in at t wireless pcs,winston salem zoning board of adjustment,cir.in winston salem,eight neighborhood residents testified that the proposed tower the first of its kind in the area ris ing well above the tree line would negatively affect the aesthetics and overall integrity of the neighborhood.id.one resident testified that,in his experience as a mortgage banker,the tower would adversely affect the resale value of the homes surrounding it.id.in addition,local residents signed a petition in opposition.finally,the board considered evidence that the tower could negatively affect a nearby historical house.id.at adding that the local historic resources planner testified about the architectural and historical significance of the house,noting its cultural importance to the entire winston salem community.we concluded that the board considered competent,material and substantial evidence that a court must accept to support its denial of the application.id.at.
in virginia beach,we emphasized the repeated and widespread opposition of a majority of the citizens who voiced their views at the planning commission hearing,through petitions,through letters,and at the city council meeting,f d at,in finding substantial evidence f
