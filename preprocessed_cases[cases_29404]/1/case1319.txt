carolyn colvin,the acting commissioner of social security,contends on appeal that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in ruling that radford condition met or equaled listing a,and that it erred in remanding with instructions to award benefits.

the social security administration has promulgated regulations containing listings of physical and mental impairments which,if met,are conclusive on the issue of disability.mcnunis califano,cir.a claimant is entitled to a conclusive presumption that he is impaired if he can show that his condition meets or equals the listed impairments.bowen city of new york,d

e vidence of nerve root compression characterized by distribution of pain,limitation of motion of the spine,motor loss atrophy with associated muscle weakness or muscle weakness accompanied by sensory or reflex loss and,if there is involvement of the lower back,positive raising test sitting and supine.
part,subpart p,app,a.it is the assessment of these criteria at the root of this appeal.
radford worked as a tree trimmer.in december,when he was,he sustained an injury lifting part of a tree at work and sought emergency medical care for pain in his lower back,legs,and knees.the treating physician diagnosed a back sprain and discharged radford with medication.
over the next five years,radford consulted several doctors who collectively observed at various points in time different symptoms of nerve root compression present in radford.
in june,radford applied for social security disability benefits.a state agency medical consultant found that radford had discogenic and degenerative disorders of the back,but concluded that radford was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.a second consultant concurred.
the alj denied radford claim.the alj found that radford had two severe impairments lumbar degenerative disc disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder but that neither qualified as an impairment under listings a disorders of the spine or chronic pulmonary insufficiency,and neither constituted any other type of impairment listed under sections musculoskeletal,respiratory system,neurological,and malignant neoplastic diseases.the alj provided no basis for his conclusion,except to say that he had considered,in particular,the listings above,and had noted that state medical examiners had also concluded after reviewing the evidence that no listing was met or equaled.
the alj also found that radford would be unable to continue working as a tree trimmer,but that he could work as a food and beverage order clerk,surveillance system monitor,or addresser.thus,the alj concluded that radford was not disabled within the meaning of the act.
the appeals council declined radford request for review,rendering the alj decision final.
radford sought judicial review in federal court,asserting that the alj had erred by finding that radford had not established that he met or equaled the listing impairments.radford astrue,wl,at.on for judgment on the pleadings.c,the district court agreed with radford,concluding that the alj determination that he had not met listing was not supported by substantial evidence because the alj opinion failed to apply the requirements of the listings to the medical record.id.at.the district court further concluded that the extensive medical record showed that radford fell within listing a because all of the required medical findings were present in radford extensive medical record.id.at.accordingly,the district court reversed the decision of the alj and remanded the case with instructions to award benefits.id.
the district court denied the commissioner motion for reconsideration,and the commissioner timely appealed.
the commissioner contends that the district court improperly substituted its own view of the social security administration regulations for that of the commissioner by effectively interpreting listing a to require that the listed criteria be present intermittently at some point in the medical record.emphasis added.instead,the commissioner argues that the listed signs and symptoms must be simultaneously present over a period of time sufficient to establish that the impairment has lasted or can be expected to last at severity for a continuous period of at least twelve months,emphasis added.she contends that the alj applied the standard correctly in concluding that radford did not meet listing 
in apparent recognition of the novelty of this interpretation,counsel for the commissioner retreated from it during oral argument.the commissioner somewhat modified contention is that listing a contains a requirement to meet or equal listing a,the claimant has the burden of producing evidence that his nerve root compression is characterized by sufficiently proximate and perhaps simultaneous medical findings of distribution of pain,limitation of motion of the spine,motor loss atrophy with associated muscle weakness or muscle weakness accompanied by sensory or reflex loss,and positive raising test.
the commissioner contention is unpersuasive.the interpretation advanced is not supported by the text or structure of the regulation.we therefore reject the commissioner invitation to read an additional requirement into listing because this appeal turns on construction of an administrative regulation,we review the district court ruling de novo.precon dev,army corps of engineers,cir observing that statutory construction is a question of law.
the first step in construing a regulation is to consider the text,chase bank usa,mccoy,d,and the text here does not contain a requirement governing when symptoms must present in the claimant.listing a provides that certain disorders of the spine are among the impairments conclusively establishing disability.it requires only e vidence of nerve root compression characterized by,disti
