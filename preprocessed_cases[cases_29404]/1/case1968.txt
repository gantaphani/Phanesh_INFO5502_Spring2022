amended opinion 
this case marks another chapter in a controversy between incarcerated felons,their visitors,and the michigan department of corrections mdoc.in,mdoc issued regulations affecting prisoners visitation privileges,including a permanent ban on virtually all visitation for prisoners found guilty of two or more substance abuse violations.after a bench trial,the district court ruled that mdoc visitation limitations,including the substance abuse regulation,violated the prisoners constitutional rights under the first and eighth amendments and their fourteenth amendment substantive and procedural due process rights.a panel of this court affirmed the district court judgment and the district court issued an order of compliance enjoining the mdoc from implementing the regulations.the supreme court granted the mdoc petition for certiorari on the prisoners first,eighth and fourteenth amendment substantive due process claims and reversed this court affirmance in overton bazzetta,d.the court did not grant certiorari with respect to the plaintiffs fourteenth amendment procedural due process claim,nor otherwise address it directly.on remand,the district court declined to dissolve its injunctive order of compliance,ruling that its procedural due process holding was not disturbed by the supreme court decision.
mdoc appeals the district court refusal to dissolve the injunction,arguing that although the supreme court did not grant certiorari on this court procedural due process holding,it implicitly foreclosed any facial procedural due process challenges to the substance abuse regulation.thus,at issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to dissolve its injunctive order in light of overton.for the reasons stated below,we hold that the district court abused its discretion because its procedural due process ruling is inconsistent with overton.accordingly,we reverse the district court opinion and order denying mdoc motion for summary judgment and granting the plaintiffs motion to enforce compliance.our reversal is without prejudice to any claim by an individual prisoner that the regulation,as applied to that prisoner,imposes an atypical and significant hardship,thus implicating a protected liberty interest.
background 
in,mdoc issued regulations limiting the visitation rights of prisoners,in part to control the widespread use of drugs and alcohol.overton,at.among other limitations,the regulations authorize the director of the mdoc to restrict permanently all visits for a prisoner who is found guilty administratively of t wo or more violations of the major misconduct charge of substance abuse,possession of narcotics,alcohol,unauthorized prescription drugs,or drug paraphernalia,or for failure to submit to a drug test.bazzetta mcginnis,cir internal quotations omitted.according to the substance abuse regulation,prisoners whose visits have been permanently restricted nevertheless receive visits from attorneys or their representative s,or qualified clergy and staff from the office of the legislative corrections ombudsman bazzetta mcginnis,d.inmates may also request that the visitation ban be lifted after six months or two years,depending on the underlying infractions.id.reinstatement of visitation privileges is within the warden discretion.id.
in august,the plaintiffs,a class of prisoners incarcerated by mdoc,and their prospective visitors,challenged the substance abuse regulation on its face id.at.they asserted that the permanent ban on visitors for two violations of the drug abuse policy infringed the prisoners first amendment right of intimate association and was not reasonably related to a valid penological objective constituted cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the eighth amendment and violated the prisoners fourteenth amendment procedural due process rights.id.at.the case proceeded to a bench trial and,on april,the district court held that the regulations violated the prisoners rights under the first,eighth and fourteenth amendments.id.
in addressing the plaintiffs procedural due process claim,the court first asked whether michigan prisoners have a liberty interest in visitation that had been infringed by the substance abuse regulation.id.at.the court noted that a liberty interest arises from two distinct the implicit guarantees of the due process clause itself,or as a result of state action.id.the court addressed only whether the prisoners derive a liberty interest from the substance abuse regulation.id.accordingly,it analyzed the regulations under the formulation established by the supreme court in sandin conner,d that a liberty interest arises where the state regulations impose freedom from restraint which,while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the due process clause of its own force,nonetheless impose an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.id.at.
in determining that the substance abuse regulation imposes an atypical and significant hardship,the court considered the effect of the restraint on the length of prison confinement the extent to which the prisoners confinement is altered from routine prison conditions and the duration of the restraint.bazzetta,d at citing jones baker,cir gilman,concurring.it acknowledged that the regulations do not affect the length of confinement but found that they create an unusually harsh and punitive environment for the prisoners restricted.id.at.further,it found significant that the restriction on visitation is permanent a lthough the regulations provide for the possibility of review after two years,there are many instances where no such review occurs,or where reinstatement of privileges after two years is denied.id.
recognizing a liberty interest in visitation that had been infringed by the permanent visitation ban,the court then asked whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.id.at citing hewitt helms,d.it found many procedural problems with the implementation of the permanent visitation that there are no written criteria to guide the director of the mdoc decision whether to impose the ban,resulting in inconsistent enforcement,id.at prisoners are not entitled to a hearing on the imposition of the permanent ban or an opportunity to challenge the ban based on unusual or extenuating circumstances,id.at,and there are no ascertainable criteria for the restoration of visiting privileges,without any apparent uniform standard being applied,id.at.the court thus determined that t he inconsistency and uncertainty of enforcement,the absence of any criteria for reinstatement,and the failure to provide any opportunity to be heard are all procedural deprivations of constitutional dimension.id.at.
on april,a panel of this court affirmed the district court judgment for the plaintiffs.bazzetta mcginnis,cir.the district court subsequently issued an order of compliance on may,directing mdoc to comply with the terms of the court judgment and enjoining the department from enforcing the regulations or any rule,policy,or procedure which bans,restricts,prevents or limits visitation based on prior or future misconducts for controlled substance violations.ja.in response to the district court order,mdoc lifted the regulations on visitation privileges on all inmates subject to the permanent ban.ja.
mdoc filed and the supreme court granted a petition for certiorari.the court limited its review,however,to whether the regulations violate the substantive due process mandate of the fourteenth amendment,or the first or eighth amendments overton,at.on the merits,the court reversed,ruling that the regulations did not facially infringe the prisoners first amendment rights of intimate association or violate their fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights.id.at.in so holding,the court stated that it was not implying that any right to intimate association is altogether terminated by incarceration but it noted that w e must accord substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators,who bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system and for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.id.at.see also id.at.withdrawing visitation privileges is a proper and even necessary management technique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate behavior,especially for prisoners who have few other privileges to lose.the court also held that the withdrawal of visitation privileges did not fall below the standards mandated by the eighth amendment.id.at.
the overton court did not grant certiorari on the issue of whether the regulations violated the prisoners procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.in the context of its eighth amendment discussion,however,the court noted that the withdrawal of visitation privileges for a limited period as a regular means of effecting prison discipline is not a dramatic departure from accepted standards for conditions of confinement.sandin conner,d.id.the court admonished that i f the withdrawal of all visitation privileges were permanent or for a much longer period,or if it were applied in an arbitrary manner to a particular inmate,the case would present different considerations.id.at.it concluded,however,that a n individual claim based on indefinite withdrawal of visitation or denial of procedural safeguards would not support a ruling that the entire regulation is invalid.id.
on august,mdoc moved for peremptory reversal of the district court order of compliance and dismissal of the case.a panel of this court denied the motion so that the district court could consider the validity of the order in the first instance.bazzetta mcginnis,cir.a separate panel of this court remanded the case to the district court for further consideration in light of the supreme court opinion.bazzetta mcginnis.cir.this panel specifically noted that the supreme court preserved any argument that an individual claim based on indefinite withdrawal of visitation or denial of procedural safeguards would pass muster under the first and eighth amendments id.internal quotations omitted.
meanwhile,mdoc reinstated the regulation permitting permanent visitation restrictions for two major misconduct substance abuse violations,with a few minor revisions.ja.mdoc voluntarily chose not to reinstate the restrictions on individual prisoners that were removed due to the may,order of compliance.id.
on october,mdoc moved for summary judgment in the district court on the plaintiffs procedural due process claims.ja.the plaintiffs countered with a motion to enforce compliance.ja.on december,the district court denied mdoc motion for summary judgment,granted the plaintiffs motion to enforce compliance and confirmed mdoc obligation to present a proposal to cure the procedural due process violations arising from the imposition of the substance abuse regulation.ja.the district court acknowledged that mdoc had revised the regulation but found that it failed to correct the significant procedural problems associated with the implementation of the permanent ban on visitation.id.further,the district court rejected mdoc mootness claim,holding that i t is well settled that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.id.at quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d internal quotations omitted.
despite the district court december,order,mdoc continued to issue permanent bans on visitation to inmates committing two major misconduct substance abuse violations.on february,upon further motions,the district court issued a supplemental order confirming its december,ruling and denying mdoc motion for an evidentiary hearing.ja.the court,however,certified the question of whether its order was fully consistent with the supreme court decision in overton for interlocutory appeal,in accordance with b.id.at.
on february,mdoc petitioned for permission to appeal,representing that the district court had certified the question for review as whether prisoners have a liberty interest in visitation.a panel of this court denied the petition as unnecessary,holding that mdoc,in reality,was seeking to appeal the district court order refusing to dissolve the injunctive relief previously ordered by the court namely,the may,order of compliance pursuant to its finding that the plaintiffs procedural due process rights were violated.ja.thus,the panel treated the petition as a notice of appeal pursuant to a.id.we now entertain that appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review for procedural due process claims 
the fourteenth amendment protects an individual from deprivation of life,liberty or property,without due process of law.t hose who seek to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.wilkinson austin,d.accordingly,a procedural due process analysis addresses two questions.t he first asks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the state,the second examines whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.kentucky dep t of corr.thompson,d citations omitted.
in evaluating a claimed liberty interest by prison inmates,courts are mindful that imprisonment necessarily carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights.hudson palmer,d.the curtailment of certain rights is necessary,as a practical matter,to accommodate a myriad of institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities,chief among which is internal security.id.at.internal citations omitted.accordingly,not every action taken for a punitive reason encroaches upon a liberty interest under the due process clause sandin,at.
prisoners,however,retain a residuum of constitutionally protected liberty,thompson,at.marshall,dissenting see meachum fano,d our cases hold that a convicted felon does not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of his conviction and confinement in prison,that emanates from two discrete sources state law can establish a protectible liberty interest,or the constitution can create a liberty interest when a condition or restraint is so egregious as to implicate the due process clause itself.see austin.at.
here,mdoc argues that the supreme court decision in overton implicitly held that the substance abuse regulation neither creates a protectible liberty interest nor implicates the guarantees of the due process clause itself.mdoc claims that because the overton court foreclosed finding a liberty interest on the face of the regulation,when it determined that it did not constitute a dramatic departure from acceptable standards for conditions of confinement,overton,at,the district court lacks authority to continue to enjoin its implementation of the substance abuse regulation,absent additional procedural safeguards.accordingly,mdoc argues,the district court erred in refusing to dissolve its may,order of compliance.
the plaintiffs counter that the supreme court did not grant certiorari on the procedural due process issue and,thus,could not have overruled the holding of the district court that the substance abuse regulation established a liberty interest in visitation.in fact,the plaintiffs argue,the overton court expressly preserved their right to assert an as applied challenge to the regulation,such as the one sustained by the district court in this case.moreover,they contend that even if the supreme court decision foreclosed finding a liberty interest arising from the substance abuse regulation,the prisoners liberty interest in visitation is implicit in the due process clause.
we review a district court denial of a request to dissolve an injunction for abuse of discretion.see pinette capitol square review advisory,cir,aff,d.however,a district court improper application of governing law constitutes an abuse of discretion.see united states colahan,cir see also mascio pub.employees ret.of ohio,cir noting that a district court decisions on injunctive relief are seldom disturbed unless it relied on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applied governing law,or used an erroneous legal standard.
