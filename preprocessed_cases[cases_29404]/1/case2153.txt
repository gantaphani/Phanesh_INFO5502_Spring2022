lotresia terry applied for disability insurance benefits,asserting that she can not work because she suffers from depression,fibromyalgia,hypertension,pelvic floor disorder,hematuria,and severe back pain following spinal fusion surgery.after her claim was administratively denied,an administrative law judge alj reviewed her claim and concluded that terry impairments did not render her disabled.the social security appeals council denied her request for review and the district court held that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.terry appeals.because the alj relied on an unsigned medical report that should have been excluded from the record,failed to consider all of terry impairments,and erroneously found her not credible,we remand the case to the agency.
background 
terry,who was years old at the time of the alj decision,was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in and depression in.despite these impairments,she continued to work as a certified nurse assistant until the fall of,when an mri of her spine revealed degenerative disc disease.in early,terry had spinal fusion surgery to address her chronic back pain.on february,she was discharged from occupational therapy as independent in all so long as she wore a back brace and a sock aide,used a walker,and received assistance from her husband.during the spring of,she received ct scans of her spine,which showed that she was recovering from surgery normally and that her spine fusion was stable.terry was also diagnosed with pelvic floor disorder,hematuria blood in her urine,and urgency of urination although initially her urologist recommended that she pursue intense and aggressive treatment of her pelvic floor musculature,by may,a physician assistant had noted that these conditions were improving and that this was her fifth and final visit to the doctor.
in june,terry applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income,claiming an onset date of november.as part of the application process,a state agency doctor reviewed her medical records in august and concluded that she could perform light work.several months later,another state agency physician,daniel jankins,examined terry and observed that,although she reported needing a walker,she had intact reflexes,no swelling,and excellent muscle tone in her legs.jankins noted that he had somewhat of a difficult time explaining why she needs the walker and recommended an orthopedic evaluation.jankins also observed that terry reported significant pain associated with fibromyalgia and back surgery,and noted her positive straight leg raising test and limited range of motion in her spine and hips.finally,jankins reported that,although in terry had been prescribed zoloft to treat her depression,she had stopped taking the drug after one month.
on march,terry treating physician,benjamin tobin,completed a residual functional capacity rfc evaluation focusing on her fibromyalgia.tobin opined that she could not walk more than one city block,lift ten pounds or more,or sit or stand for more than five minutes without changing position.he also reported that she could sit for two hours and walk for two hours during an workday so long as she had the option of shifting positions,keeping her legs elevated while sitting,and taking unscheduled breaks.tobin concluded that terry would likely miss work more than four times a month because her illnesses produced good days and bad days.he reported that,in addition to fibromyalgia,terry had been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease,hypertension,chronic sinusitis,restless leg syndrome,depression,and pain.treatment notes submitted by tobin show that terry was prescribed zoloft off and on beginning in and was consistently prescribed paxil,another drug used to treat depression as well as anxiety,throughout,and.
in february,terry had another ct scan that was positive for a possible nonunion at disc.her treating surgeon,shekar kurpad,met with her in may to discuss the scan and her continuing back pain.kurpad recommended waiting three months and,if her pain had not abated,considering a second spinal fusion surgery at that point.when terry returned to kurpad in august,showed that she had healed extremely well from the surgery,but kurpad could not tell whether the showed a second nonunion.he again recommended waiting six months to see if her pain decreased before scheduling a second surgery.
in december,terry was examined by an orthopedist,sean tracy,at the request of the state agency.tracy concluded that she had no orthopedic issues and could lift and carry less than ten pounds,stand and walk less than two hours in an workday,and sit less than six hours in an workday.because terry told him that her treating physician had recommended a second back surgery,tracy instructed her to avoid heavy bending,lifting,pulling,or twisting until she could see her doctor again.
that same month terry also underwent a psychological evaluation at the request of the state agency.phillip ruppert opined that,although terry reported suffering from depression and taking zoloft,he believed that she might have been exaggerating the degree of impairment she experienced.ruppert noted that she was able to understand,remember,and carry out simple instructions,and her capacity to maintain concentration and pace was between fair and good.he concluded that terry suffered from depression,not otherwise specified.
the record also contains an unsigned,undated rfc form from the state agency which concluded that terry could perform work at the sedentary level.the rfc form states that terry could occasionally lift ten pounds,frequently lift less than ten pounds,stand or walk at least two hours in an workday,and sit for six hours in an workday.
at a hearing before an alj,terry testified that she lived with her aunt,who performed most daily tasks for her because her pain prevented her from doing household chores.she explained that,because of her fibromyalgia and back pain,she experienced burning and throbbing pain all over.on most days,she reported a pain level of ten out of ten.she also described her symptoms of depression,explaining that she cried frequently,avoided people,and only left the house when she had a doctor appointment.
a vocational expert ve,allen searles,also testified.the alj asked searles to assume that terry was limited to sedentary,unskilled work and would have to stand for one or two minutes every half hour.searles opined that,given those limitations,she would not be able to perform her past work as a certified nurse assistant or home health care aide but would be able to work as a surveillance system monitor jobs in wisconsin,an order clerk jobs,or a callout operator performing credit checks for mortgage companies jobs.when the alj asked him whether someone who was off pace five percent of the time could perform these jobs,searles replied yes,but cautioned that someone who was off pace ten percent of the time or who was absent more than two days per month would not be able to find work.the alj then,apparently as an intended joke,asked searle,and i suppose if she arrived at work in a body bag that would be good either when searle replied,no,the alj continued,yeah,we call these the dead claimant rfcs.the alj also asked terry counsel,what my job here,you know,write checks 
after considering all the evidence,the alj concluded that terry was not disabled.in so finding,the alj applied the analysis described in a i v.he found that although terry had previously worked as a certified nurse assistant,she had not engaged in substantial gainful employment since the alleged onset of her disability.the alj next found that her fibromyalgia,depression,and changes to her spine constituted severe impairments,but that those impairments did not qualify as any listed impairment.the alj chose not to credit terry testimony regarding the disabling effects of her pain and depression because her reports were inconsistent and uncorroborated by the medical record.he also reasoned that tobin assessment of her limitations relied heavily on her subjective reports and was contradicted by the state agency reports.relying heavily on the unsigned state agency
