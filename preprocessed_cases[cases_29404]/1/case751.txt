we consider two questions arising from a labor dispute adjudicated before a panel of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board whether an adjudication by a panel of the nlrb is permitted under section b of the national labor relations act,et the act,where a third member of the panel was disqualified because his term had expired and the total membership of the nlrb was only two members and whether it was an abuse of discretion for a regional director of the nlrb to overrule an employer objections to a union election without holding a hearing or interviewing witnesses.
background 
the following facts are not in dispute.see generally snell island snf llc,nlrb,at.the nlrb is the administrative agency of the united states responsible for overseeing elections and adjudicating certain types of labor disputes.it consists of five members,each of whom is appointed by the president,with the advice and consent of the senate,for a term of five years.see a providing further that t he president shall designate one member to serve as chairman of the board.in the ordinary course,the nlrb hears and decides cases by panels of three members in accordance with section b of the act,which provides that the nlrb 
is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.
at the beginning of december,the nlrb consisted of four liebman,peter schaumber,peter kirsanow,and dennis terms were staggered.one seat was vacant,and the terms of kirsanow and walsh were set to expire on december.anticipating that no replacement appointments were forthcoming,and that it would lose its quorum,the board delegated all of its powers to a panel consisting of liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow,effective december.in reaching this decision,which the board memorialized in a december,minute of board action,the board relied on the plain language of the act and also 
relied on the march,opinion issued by the office of legal counsel of the department of justice olc in response to the board may,request for olc opinion whether the board may issue decisions during periods when three or more of the five seats on the board are vacant.olc opinion concluded that if the board delegated all of its powers to a group of three members,that group could continue to issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two members remained.
olc opinion stands for the proposition that the board has the authority to issue decisions and orders,but that it is within the board discretion whether or not to exercise that authority.
addendum to minutes of board action,at see also edward whelan,iii,quorum requirements memorandum opinion for the solicitor,national labor relations board,available at last visited june,on file with clerk of court olc opinion.when kirsanow term expired on december,the panel continued to operate in the normal course with a quorum consisting of liebman and schaumber.as of the filing of this opinion,liebman and schaumber remain the only two members of the board.
petitioner snell island snf llc operates a nursing home and care facility in petersburg,florida,called shore acres.petitioner hgop,llc,provides services to the shore acres facility and other nursing homes,and has its principal place of business in brooklyn,new york.see snell island snf llc,nlrb,at.petitioners are joint employers of the employees of shore acres.
on december,at a representative election held under the auspices of the nlrb,see,employees at shore acres elected united food and commercial workers union,local the union,as their exclusive representative.petitioners promptly filed with the nlrb thirteen objections to the election.a regional director of the nlrb reviewed the objections and recommended in january that they be overruled in their entirety.petitioners filed exceptions to the regional director recommendation and on march,a panel of the of liebman and the exceptions and issued an unpublished decision and certification of representative.footnote to that decision explained the number and selection of the panel members 
effective midnight december,members liebman,schaumber,kirsanow,and walsh delegated to members liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow,as a group,all of the board powers in anticipation of the expiration of the terms of members kirsanow and walsh on december.pursuant to this delegation,members liebman and schaumber constitute a quorum of the group.as a quorum,they have the authority to issue decisions and orders in unfair labor practice and representation cases.see b of the act.
following the march decision and certification,petitioners refused to recognize and bargain with the union on may,the union filed an unfair labor practice claim with the nlrb,which was referred to the regional director and ultimately adjudicated by the same panel of the board.on july,the panel issued a decision and order concluding that petitioners had engaged in unfair labor practices by refusing to negotiate with the union and ordering petitioners to meet with the union.see snell island snf llc,nlrb,at.the july decision and order contained a footnote substantially similar to footnote in the march decision and order but indicating that president bush had,in the interim,designated schaumber as chairman.
this appeal followed.before this court,petitioners argue principally that the july and march decisions and orders were not issued by a properly constituted panel of the nlrb because only two board members participated in the adjudication.in the alternative,petitioners contend that the nlrb abused its discretion with respect to two of petitioners thirteen objections to the union election,which objections petitioners argue should not have been overruled without interviewing witnesses or conducting an evidentiary hearing.the nlrb has filed a for enforcement of its july decision and order.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the nlrb pursuant to section f of the act.see f any person aggrieved by a final order of the board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any united states court of appeals in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business.as we have previously explained,to obtain judicial review of a union certification by the board,an employer must refuse to bargain,prompting an unfair labor practice final order that we may review.see nlrb arthur sarnow candy,cir.accordingly,we consider in this appeal both the march decision and order certifying a union election,and the july decision and order finding an unfair labor practice.see d whenever an order of the board is based in whole or in part upon facts certified following an investigation of a union election and there is a petition for the enforcement or review of such order,such certification and the record of such investigation shall be included in the transcript of the entire record and thereupon the decree of the court enforcing,modifying,or setting aside in whole or in part of the order of the board shall be made and entered upon the pleadings,testimony,and proceedings set forth in such transcript.
ii.quorum requirement 
petitioners contend that the nlrb issued its march and july decisions and orders without statutory authority because only two board members participated in those adjudications.according to petitioners,section b of the act requires that a panel of the board consist of at least three members.petitioners acknowledge that once a panel is duly constituted,the panel may continue if one member should become unavailable so long as there remains a quorum of two members.however,petitioners argue that the nlrb never effectively constituted a panel in this case because t here never was any intent that th e group consisting of liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow would actually issue decisions and orders.petitioners br.at.instead,because kirsanow term was set to expire in three days,the board knew he would not be around to exercise the powers being delegated.id.therefore,petitioners conclude that the december,delegation of all powers to the panel of liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow was an acknowledged sham.id.emphasis added.
standard of review 
petitioners argue that our review of the nlrb power or jurisdiction is plenary and de novo.petitioners br.at citing railroad yardmasters of america harris.we note that the cited passage of railroad yardmasters does not discuss a standard of review at all instead,it discusses whether a question regarding an agency power or jurisdiction that was not raised in an administrative proceeding was waived in a court proceeding,at.in any event,railroad yardmasters was decided before the supreme court landmark decision in chevron,natural res.def.council,d,which established a process for reviewing statutes that govern federal agencies.our court has recently explained the chevron standard of review as follows 
at step one,we consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.to ascertain congress intent,we begin with the statutory text because if its language is unambiguous,no further inquiry is necessary.only if we determine that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue will we turn to canons of construction and,if that is unsuccessful,to legislative history to see if those interpretative clues permit us to identify congress clear intent.
if,despite these efforts,we still can not conclude that congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue,we will proceed to chevron step two,which instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers,so long as it is reasonable.

b.other circuits 
ours is not the only court to consider the question of the nlrb quorum requirement.the united states court of appeals for the first circuit recently confronted the same question in northeastern land,nlrb,cir,and concluded that t he board delegation of its institutional power to a panel that ultimately consisted of a quorum because of a vacancy was lawful under the plain text of section b,id.at.after reviewing the text of section b of the act,the first circuit reasoned that 
first,section b allowed the board to delegate all of its powers to a group.second,the statute states that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.the vacancy,which left the quorum remaining,may not,under the terms of section b,impair the right of the quorum to exercise all powers of the board.
id.at quoting b second alteration in original.the first circuit also acknowledged that the olc opinion recommended the same result,and posited that any other general rule would impose an undue burden on the administrative process.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.finally,the first circuit recognized that courts have upheld analogous approaches by other administrative agencies,including the securities and exchange commission and the national mediation board,seeking to continue to operate when confronting vacancies.id.at collecting cases.
after the instant case was argued,two other courts of appeals issued relevant decisions.in new process steel,nlrb,cir,the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit concluded that a panel of the same panel that adjudicated the instant case had authority to hear the labor dispute,id.at.in the seventh circuit view,the plain meaning of section b of the act supports the nlrb delegation procedure 
t he vacancy of one member of a three member panel does not impede the right of the remaining two members to execute the full delegated powers of the nlrb.as the nlrb delegated its full powers to a group of three board members,the two remaining board members can proceed as a quorum despite the subsequent vacancy.
having concluded that the panel had jurisdiction under the plain meaning of the act,the seventh circuit nonetheless commented on its legislative history.see id.at when the plain meaning of a statute is unambiguous,we need not consider a statute legislative history or analogous cases in order to interpret it.however,we also take time to note that the legislative history behind b does not support new process reading of the statute.citation omitted.specifically,the court discussed the history of the amendments of,which expanded the nlrb membership from three to five.see id.at citing,inter alia,at there is no field in which time is more important,yet the board is from to months behind in its docket the expansion of the board from three to seven members which this bill proposes,would permit it to operate in panels of three,thereby increasing by percent its ability to dispose of cases expeditiously in the final stage,reprinted in nlrb,legislative history of the labor management relations act,at,hereinafter leg.hist.in the seventh circuit view,t he purpose of the revisions was to allow the nlrb to hear more cases by creating panels of the entire board.new process steel,at emphasis added accord hosp.nlrb,cir section b of the nlra authorizes the board to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.congress added this provision to the nlra to enable the board to handle an increasing caseload more efficiently.citation omitted.in light of the legislative history of the amendments,the seventh circuit concluded that a court interpreting the statute to restrict the nlrb from acting when its membership falls below a certain level would hinder the efficient panel operation that congress intended to create.new process steel,at.
on the same day that the seventh circuit decided new process steel,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reached a different conclusion in laurel baye healthcare of lake lanier,nlrb.relying principally on the at all times requirement for board quorum,see b a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.emphasis added,the circuit concluded that a board may delegate its powers to a group,and this delegee group may act with two members so long as the board quorum requirement is,at all times,satisfied.laurel baye healthcare,at.in the circuit view,whenever the board loses jurisdiction because of a loss of quorum,so too do any panels of the board lose jurisdiction,regardless of whether the panels retain a quorum.
the circuit considered and rejected the nlrb argument that the except that clause was an exception to the at all times requirement.see b t hree members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.emphases added.in the circuit view,congress use of differing object nouns quorum of the board versus quorum of any group within the two quorum provisions indicates clearly that each quorum provision is independent from the other.laurel baye healthcare,at.accordingly,the circuit concluded that t he delegee group quorum provision does not eliminate the board quorum requirement,id.at,nor does it permit the panel to circumvent the statutory board quorum requirement,id.at.
the circuit did not discuss the legislative history of the amendments,but instead included a discussion of agency law meaning law,not the law of administrative agencies,that court to the delegation of full powers from a board to a committee or subgroup of a board.according to the circuit,an agent delegated authority terminates when the powers belonging to the entity that bestowed the authority are suspended.id.at citing the restatement third of agency when a principal that is not an individual ceases to exist or commences a process that will lead to cessation of its existence or when its powers are suspended,the agent actual authority terminates except as provided by law.because the delegee committee does not act on its own behalf,but on that of the board,where a board loses its authority,so do its committees.laurel baye healthcare,at.
to summarize,one of our sister seventh upheld a decision by the nlrb panel based on the plain meaning of section b of the act,noting that its interpretation comports with the legislative history of relevant amendments to the act,without discussing principles of agency law.new process steel,at.another of our sister overturned a decision by the same panel based on the plain language of section b of the act,noting that its interpretation comports with applicable principles of agency law,but without discussing the applicable legislative history.see laurel baye healthcare,at.a third sister first concluded that the plain text of the act authorized the decisions by the same panel,without discussing either the legislative history of the statute or relevant principles of agency law.northeastern land,at.
the question regarding the jurisdiction of the nlrb panel is one ultimately to be resolved by the supreme court.in the meantime,we must make a determination in the present case.
c.the nlrb panel was duly constituted in the first instance 
we first consider petitioner argument that the nlrb panel was not duly constituted in the first instance because the delegation to a panel plenipotentiary was a sham,petitioners br.at,and begin our analysis with the statute itself,as our sister circuits have done.section b of the act provides that the nlrb 
is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.
here,we agree with the first circuit that,in light of the text of the statute,which expressly authorizes the nlrb to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise,the delegation to a panel plenipotentiary was within the nlrb authority.see northeastern land,at s ection b allowed the board to delegate all of its powers to a group.that the nlrb knew that the membership of the panel would soon be reduced from three to that board membership would also decrease to no bearing on the fact that the panel was lawfully constituted in the first instance.
petitioners argue that northeastern land services is unpersuasive because the first circuit did not discuss in that decision the relevance of,which sets the requirements for service on a panel of a federal court of appeals.see letter of charles roberts,iii,counsel for snell island,april,at.as petitioners note,the supreme court has interpreted to require the inclusion of at least three article iii judges in the first instance,nguyen united states,d,as a prerequisite to any valid decision by a quorum,see d.we agree with petitioners that,like a panel of a federal court of appeals,a panel of the nlrb must be duly constituted in the first instance,nguyen,at,before the action of a quorum of the panel is valid.in the instant case,we agree with the first circuit that the panel of the nlrb that took effect on december,was duly constituted.see northeastern land,at.
d.the nlrb panel retained jurisdiction when the board lost its quorum 
the more difficult question is whether the nlrb panel lost its authority once the nlrb as a whole lost its quorum.as required under chevron,we consider first whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.state office of children family,at quoting chevron,at.on this point,two of our sister circuits disagree over the plain meaning of section b of the act.compare new process steel,at as the nlrb delegated its full powers to a group of three board members,the two remaining board members can proceed as a quorum despite the subsequent vacancy.with laurel baye healthcare,at reading the two quorum provisions harmoniously,the result is clear a board may delegate its powers to a group,and this delegee group may act with two members so long as the board quorum requirement is,at all times,satisfied.at the very least,this split suggests that the statute is ambiguous regarding the enduring or residual powers of an nlrb panel once the board has lost a quorum.
in our view,nothing in the statute itself explains what happens to a duly constituted panel of the nlrb when the board itself loses its quorum.accordingly,since the statute is silent on the precise question,we turn to canons of construction and,if that is unsuccessful,to legislative history to see if those interpretative clues permit us to identify congress clear intent.state office of children family,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the canons of statutory construction do not shed any light on congress intent in the circumstances presented in the instant case.the circuit,relying on a cardinal principle of interpretation that no provision is rendered inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant,laurel baye healthcare,at internal quotation marks omitted,held that the board quorum requirement must be satisfied at all times,id.quoting b.we agree with this portion of the circuit analysis.see filler hanvit bank,cir citing with approval babbitt sweet home chapter of cmtys.for a great,d,for the proposition that courts should avoid interpretations of statutes that render statutory language surplusage.however,the application of this cardinal principle of interpretation does not answer the precise question presented here once the board has lost its quorum,what happens to a panel that was duly constituted before the board lost its quorum to answer this question,the circuit relied on basic tenets of agency and corporation law.laurel baye healthcare,at citing,inter alia,restatement third of agency.in the view of the circuit,a n agent delegated authority is deemed to cease upon the resignation or termination of the delegating authority,so that i f the board has no authority,it follows that the panel has none,id.at.
our court precedents,however,require us to turn to legislative history instead of considering related fields of the circuit did in consulting agency and corporation the event that ordinary canons of statutory interpretation are unhelpful.see state office of children family,at.our survey of the legislative history of the act,which created the nlrb panel system,reveals that the broad animating purpose of the legislation was to equalize the balance of power between employers and employees in response to the widespread feeling that the unions had gotten too much power during the roosevelt years.lawrence friedman,american law in the century.among other things,the amendments outlawed closed shops and secondary boycotts,permitted employers to sue unions for breach of contract,the words of senator robert taft of ohio,the chairman of the senate committee of labor and public welfare entirely rewr ote the wagner act.cong.rec,reprinted in nlrb,leg.hist.
in light of the sweeping nature of the amendments and their focus on the balance of power in dealings with organized labor,it is surprising that the reforms to the structure of the nlrb received relatively little attention in the legislative history.senator taft explained in his floor remarks that the purpose of increasing the nlrb membership was to enable the board to accomplish twice as much in the way of the number of hearings held.cong.rec,reprinted in nlrb,leg.hist.this was particularly important because the board was behind in its work,and the amendments would impose a considerably greater volume of work upon the board.id 
in light of senator taft remarks,we have previously observed that section b of the nlra authorizes the board to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.congress added this provision to the nlra to enable the board to handle an increasing caseload more efficiently,at citation omitted.in hospital,we also examined a report by the senate committee on labor and public welfare,which concluded that t here is no field in which time is more important,yet the board is from to months behind in its docket the expansion of the board would permit it to operate in panels of three,thereby increasing by percent its ability to dispose of cases expeditiously in the final stage,at,reprinted in nlrb,leg.hist,see also new process steel,at considering the senate report and concluding that congress primary concern was increasing the efficiency of the board the purpose of the revisions was to allow the nlrb to hear more cases by creating panels of the entire board.
in addition to the legislative history described in hospital,the nlrb argues that prior to the amendments of,the board consisted of three members,two of whom were required for a quorum.see resp t br.see also.a,stat,there is hereby created a board which shall be composed of three members id.b a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board,and two members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum.as the nlrb notes,pursuant to that quorum provision,the original board,during its years of administering federal labor policy,issued hundreds of decisions with only two of its three seats filled.resp t br.specifically,
from to,the original board issued decisions during three discrete periods when it had only two seated members.first,from august through october,the board issued decisions.second,from august to november,a board issued decisions.third,from august to september,a board issued three decisions.
resp t br.at citations omitted.
in our view it is significant,in light of the established history of operating with only two members,that congress continued to allow only two board members a quorum of an nlrb panel to issue labor decisions.while increasing the size of the board from three members to five members,congress left undisturbed the quorum requirement for panels of the board.moreover,as the nlrb observes,the senate version of the bill would have expanded the board to seven members,four of whom would be a quorum.however,that same bill authorized the larger board to delegate its powers to any group of three or more members,two of whom would be a quorum.resp t br.quoting,b,reprinted in nlrb,leg.hist.see ante describing the house and senate versions of the amendments.
however,while this history seems to support the board reading of the act,it does not definitively answer the precise question at issue in the instant,in the name of efficiency,a panel of the board may continue to operate once the board itself loses its quorum.the only reference to this precise question comes from the floor remarks of senator joseph of wyoming,in which he opposed overriding president truman veto of the act.
observe that the board is given complete and plenary power to delegate any or all of its power to any group of three and then any two members of that group of three can speak for the board.so we have a i invite the attention of lawyers in this body to not only authorizes the board to delegate its powers,but authorizes the board to delegate its powers,and all of them,to less than a quorum of the board.this we do in the name of reducing government in washington.this we do in the name of returning control of the economic life of the people of the united states to the people of the united states and we undertake a program of delegated powers which,so far as i know,has never been suggested before in the history of this government.
cong.rec,june,emphasis added,reprinted in nlrb,leg.hist.however,senator did not raise this objection in his earlier floor statements concerning section on may and may,see nlrb,leg.hist,and none of the other senator to senator pointed criticism of the panel quorum requirement in the debate that followed prior to a vote to override the president veto on the same day.
we are reluctant to draw much significance from a lone remark by a single senator opposing a bill,made after the act initially passed and only just before the senate voted to override president truman veto.see schwegmann calvert distillers.jackson,concurring arguing in favor of limiting legislative history to committee reports because to select casual statements from floor debates,not always distinguished for candor or accuracy,as a basis for making up our minds what law congress intended to enact is to substitute ourselves for the congress in one of its important functions.without more,we are unable to conclude that delegation to less than a quorum of the board was an intended or unintended consequence of the amendments.
in short,we draw two conclusions about the quorum requirement in section b of the act from this discussion of the legislative history of the amendments.first,congress restructured the nlrb to enable it to resolve more disputes,not fewer.as a result,we adhere to our prior observation that one of the purposes of the amendments was to increase the nlrb efficiency.see,at see also new process steel,at to the extent that the legislative history points either way it establishes that created a board that functioned as an adjudicative body that was allowed to operate in panels in order to work more efficiently.second,the legislative history of the amendments lacks any clear statement of intent regarding the jurisdiction of a plenipotentiary panel where the board loses its precise question that we face in this case.where the legislative history touches on the precise question,in senator floor remarks,congressional intent is unclear.if we can not conclude that congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue,we will proceed to chevron step two,which instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers,so long as it is reasonable.state office of children family,at emphases added internal quotation marks omitted see also cohen jp morgan chase,cir observing that,when a statute is ambiguous,a court look s to structure,purpose,and history to determine whether these construction devices
