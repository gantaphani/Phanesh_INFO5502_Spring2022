domingo cueto estrada a mexican citizen,applied for cancellation of removal under a,but an immigration judge ij found him statutorily ineligible for such relief because he is not a lawful permanent resident.the ij conclusion rested on the fact that cueto estrada was at one time considered a lawful permanent resident under the special agricultural worker program,but the immigration and naturalization service ins rescinded his status in because it believed cueto estrada obtained that status by fraud.cueto estrada vigorously disputes this,and he also claims that the rescission order is invalid because he was never properly served with notice of the agency action.
as his case comes to us,cueto estrada has traveled two paths seeking a forum for his challenge to the validity of the rescission order.cueto estrada asked the ij to examine the validity of the order in the removal proceedings the ij refused to do so because he thought matter of,bia,prohibited him from reviewing rescission orders.the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed this decision,and cueto estrada filed a petition for review in this court.while his removal proceedings were underway,cueto estrada asked the citizenship and immigration service in to reopen the rescission order the agency declined to do so because it thought cueto estrada request was untimely.cueto estrada challenged this decision by filing a complaint in the district court that asserted violations of the administrative procedure act and his rights,but the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.cueto estrada filed an appeal.
we ordered the appeal and the petition for review consolidated,and our job now is to sort out which forum,if any,should have exercised jurisdiction over cueto estrada challenge to the ins rescission of his status.we conclude that cueto estrada challenge to the sufficiency of the notice he received before the agency rescinded his status was reviewable in his removal proceedings.only prohibits the ij and the bia from reviewing a decision to rescind status when an alien has been properly notified according to the requirements of.because cueto estrada claims he never received notice of the ins intent to rescind his status,does not apply and the agency should have considered whether the rescission order was invalid because cueto estrada did not receive proper notice.by contrast,the complaint filed in the district court is the equivalent of a challenge to an order of removal within the meaning of a,and that subsection permits judicial review only via a petition for review in the court of appeals.accordingly,while we affirm the district court decision to dismiss cueto estrada complaint for lack of jurisdiction,we grant cueto estrada petition for review and remand his case to the bia so it can determine what effect cueto estrada arguments against the rescission order have on his request for cancellation of removal.
background 
domingo cueto estrada,a native of mexico,entered the united states illegally in.thanks to the special agriculture worker saw program,cueto estrada was granted status in.but the government soon suspected that cueto estrada received his status by fraudulent means.domingo luna,who helped cueto estrada prepare his saw application,was convicted of filing false statements on other saw applications in violation of b a ii.the government believed cueto estrada likewise purchased fraudulent employment documents from luna to support his saw application.
in immigration authorities initiated proceedings that led to the rescission of cueto estrada status as a legal permanent resident.the ins sent cueto estrada notice of its intent to rescind his status the notice was sent via certified mail to cueto estrada address.had cueto estrada responded to the notice,he would have been entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge to contest the rescission.see.but the immigration agency never heard from cueto estrada,and in the ins rescinded his status without a hearing as permitted by.
cueto estrada claims he never received the notice and says he first learned that he had lost his status in when the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against him although he applied for cancellation of removal under a,his claim hinged on his ability to show that he was a lawful permanent resident if he is not a lawful permanent resident,cueto estrada admits he would be statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under b.to make the required showing,cueto estrada argued that the rescission of his status was invalid because he did not receive proper notice of the ins intent to rescind.had he been given proper notice,cueto estrada claimed he would have shown he did not obtain his status through fraud.
the ij rejected this argument by relying on,in which the bia concluded that immigration courts may not review a decision to rescind status made by the ins the ij thought that prohibited him from either revisiting the merits of the ins decision to rescind cueto estrada status or considering whether the rescission order was invalid because the ins did not comply with its regulatory obligation to provide adequate notice of the agency intent to institute rescission proceedings.accordingly,since cueto estrada was no longer a lawful permanent resident,he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under a.the ij ordered cueto estrada removed.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision in,and cueto estrada filed a petition for review in this court.
in early,while these removal proceedings were underway,cueto estrada asked the citizenship and immigration service uscis to reconsider its decision to rescind his status,arguing that the rescission was improper because he never received notice of the ins intent to rescind.the uscis denied his request in april,treating his motion as untimely since it had been filed years after the decision was made,well outside the period for filing reconsideration requests under a i.at the time of the uscis decision,the ij had not yet ordered cueto estrada removed,and the uscis observed that any relief cueto estrada sought may be raised with the ij during your removal proceeding.cueto estrada filed a petition for review of the uscis decision with this court in,but we dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.accordingly,cueto estrada challenged the uscis order by filing a complaint with the district court.although he claimed that the uscis refusal to revisit its rescission order violated the administrative procedure act apa and his rights,the district court treated cueto estrada complaint as a challenge to a removal order and dismissed his case for lack of jurisdiction.cueto estrada appealed this dismissal,and we consolidated his appeal with his petition for review.
ii.discussion 
we start with cueto estrada petition for review.when the bia adopts and affirms the ij decision,as it did in this case,we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia.khan filip,cir.although the jurisdictional bar of a b ordinarily prohibits us from reviewing the immigration agency decision on a claim,the immigration agency conclusion that it could not hear estrada challenge to the validity of the rescission order constitutes a question of law that a d permits us to review.
our analysis begins with matter of,bia,the decision the ij thought precluded any review of cueto estrada attacks on the ins rescission order.in the alien was served with notice of the agency intent to revoke his status.the alien disputed the allegations in the notice and requested a hearing,but immigration officials never scheduled one and rescinded the alien status as if he had never responded.when the alien was placed in removal proceedings,the ij concluded that the rescission of the alien status had been improper because the alien had not been properly served with the notice to rescind.this analysis was apparently flawed as the government argued on appeal to the bia,the alien had conceded that he had been properly served.id.at.on appeal the bia held that the ij lacked jurisdiction to reconsider the ins rescission order,but it nonetheless ordered the removal proceedi
