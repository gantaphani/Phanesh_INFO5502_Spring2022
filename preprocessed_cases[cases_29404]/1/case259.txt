prabakaran rasiah is an ethnically tamil sri lankan citizen.he seeks review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an order by an immigration judge ij that denied his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.rasiah sought this relief alleging that he had suffered persecution at the hands of the sri lankan army because of his tamil ethnicity.the background events and proceedings can be briefly summarized.
rasiah sought to enter the united states on may,in san juan,puerto rico,using a fraudulent visa.federal authorities began removal proceedings,and rasiah conceded removability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.rasiah had an interview with an asylum officer on may,and was granted a hearing before an ij.the hearing before the ij occurred on august,and rasiah was represented by counsel.
rasiah was the only witness.he testified that he is an ethnically tamil sri lankan and to a number of incidents of past persecution he and family members allegedly suffered at the hands of the sri lankan army or others associated with the government that soldiers beat him and shot his brother and sister that he had left his job after soldiers inquired into his support for the tamil tigers,a rebel group engaged in a armed conflict with the sri lankan government that he was kidnapped,beaten and burned by three men dressed as civilians and that soldiers shot an alleged relative of his named kandasamy gowrivalan.
rasiah submitted a variety of documents on the current conditions in sri lanka,including a united nations report and articles from newspapers and online sources.consistent with state department country reports on sri lanka,the materials confirmed that tamils were sometimes threatened,abused and worse on account of their ethnic status or suspected ties to the tamil tigers.after the hearing,rasiah submitted a memorandum of law reiterating his past persecution claims and claiming,for the first time,asylum eligibility based on a pattern or practice of persecution against tamils.
the ij issued an oral decision on october,that denied rasiah application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij found rasiah testimony of past persecution of himself and his family not credible,saying she did not believe him the reasons she gave can be summarized as follows 
that he had failed to provide corroboration for his stories,such as his claims that his brother and sister were shot 
that several other sri lankan asylum seekers claimed gowrivalan was a relative and had presented death certificates like the one rasiah presented in support 
that his claim he would be persecuted in sri lanka was undercut by his ability to get a passport from the sri lankan government and his experiencing no difficulties when traveling to or from sri lanka in the past and 
that there were inconsistencies in his testimony,including about the facts of the alleged kidnapping and his job.
the ij also found that rasiah had not met his burden on future persecution.
rasiah appealed to the bia where he challenged the ij adverse credibility finding as to his past persecution argued that he had proved a pattern or practice of persecution of tamils that the ij had ignored and for the first time argued that he would be persecuted in sri lanka as a failed asylum seeker.the bia upheld the finding that rasiah accounts of past persecution were incredible,addressed rasiah pattern or practice claim by quoting the ij conclusion that simply by being a tamil rasiah was not entitled to a blank check in order to receive asylum,and held that his claim that he would be persecuted as a failed asylum seeker was never presented to the ij and so was forfeited.
rasiah sought review in this court on march,and then on april,filed a motion to reopen the administrative proceedings,claiming that the persecution of tamils had increased in sri lanka and submitting additional documentary evidence of conditions in sri lanka.he also argued that his pattern or practice claim turned not on his credibility,but rather on his tamil ethnicity and objective evidence of the treatment of tamils.the bia denied the motion to reopen,observing that the new information did not ameliorate the factual bases of the adverse credibility finding.
rasiah petitioned to review this denial of the motion to reopen,which we consolidated with his earlier petition contesting the bia decision on the merits.in this court,rasiah does not challenge the ij factual finding that his testimony about past persecution was incredible.his main argument is that the bia erred in failing to analyze separately his pattern or practice claim and in failing to remand that issue to the ij for development.he also argues that the bia should have decoded his claim that he would be subject to persecution as a failed asylum seeker.
review of the ij or bia determinations is under the substantial evidence standard,ratnasingam holder,cir,which asks whether any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,budiono mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but,as already noted,rasiah does not dispute the finding that his testimony was incredible and his main objection is to bia alleged failure to decide on the merits his pattern or practice claim.however,the more cryptic than the permissibly resolve rasiah claim.
claims based on past persecution,reasonable fear of future persecution or both ordinarily focus on past incidents or future danger involving the asylum seeker or his family,which must be severe enough to constitute persecution a fairly high standard,nelson ins,cir the applicant must also show that the persecution that occurred,or is threatened,was on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,a a b.a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.b.
an applicant can often reinforce his claim of individualized harm or danger by showing that persecution of similarly situated persons has occurred.see kotasz ins,cir.thus,a history of violence toward tamils could help show that violence directed against rasiah or his family was based on their ethnicity rather than random crime or disorder or that the source was the government or its indifference.such a showing could also make more credible and rational the fear of the asylum seeker that past incidents would be repeated.
in fact,there is evidence,reflected in both case law and state department country reports,that ethnic tamils in sri lanka have been subject to incidents of violence in the past attributed to the government or its indifference as described by the state department report,t he government has been engaged in a year armed conflict with the tamil tigers,which the report describes as a terrorist organization controlling a shrinking area in the north of the country.as this conflict escalated,the government respect for human rights declined,and tamils made up the overwhelming majority of victims of human rights violations.
the report described frequent harassment of young and tamil men by security forces and paramilitary groups especially in the north and east among the more serious violations from noted in the report were approximately civilian casualties,more than disappearances and the detention of several thousand individuals although the majority were released within hours.so clearly many in suffered substantial hardships.
the difficulty for rasiah is that simply because civil strife causes substantial hardships for an ethnic minority,that does not automatically entitle all members of that minority to asylum.ratnasingam,at kho keisler,cir see also krishnapillai,at.the governing regulations and the case law do in some extreme cases allow relief for asylum seekers solely based on their membership in a protected group under the pattern or practice rubric,b ii,b kho,at however,the standard is demanding and in substance requires a showing of regular and widespread persecution creating a reasonable likelihood of persecution of all persons in the group,see krishnapillai,at kotasz,at.
attempts by tamils to meet this standard have been regularly rejected.this circuit has recently sustained bia findings that treatment of tamils in sri lanka does not rise to the level necessary to establish a pattern or practice claim that standing alone permits relief.balachandran holder,cir ratnasingam,at.other circuits are in accord.krishnapillai,at vakeesan,at,wl,at paramanathan att y,wl,at cir,per curiam.
the record in this case neither compels a contrary finding nor supports rasiah assertion that his claim was ignored.rasiah himself raised his pattern or practice claim only after his hearing before the ij,but the ij dealt with it exactly as one might expect 
even though the country reports and background information provided by the respondent clearly depicted that sri lanka is a country in turmoil,that there are abuses from the government,there are abuses from the army,there are abuses from the tigers,the respondent,by the fact that he is a tamil,by the fact he is from sri lanka,that does not give him a blank check in order to receive asylum in the united states.
the bia cited this portion of the ij decision in a footnote,effectively adopting the ij treatment,which was itself adequate in light of the nature of the claim and the case law.
the ij explicit references to the country reports and other background information and its discussion of conditions in sri lanka indicate that the ij and,in turn,the bia considered but rejected rasiah pattern or practice claim,see malek mukasey,cir,and rasiah presented no evidence to distinguish his purported pattern or practice claim from those rejected in balachandran and ratnasingam.the treatment of tamils,however deplorable,is not of a reach that entitles every tamil in sri lanka to asylum based on ethnicity alone.
what rasiah needed was evidence that he himself had been persecuted or targeted for persecution.with that foundation,he might well have benefitted in ways described above from a showing based on country reports or other generalized evidence that tamils were sometimes persecuted because of their political activities or even their ethnicity alone.but because the ij disbelieved broadly rasiah claims of personal or family he does not contest that finding in this has no past persecution or threats of future persecution of him or family members that might gain weight or color from the treatment of others.
an adverse credibility finding by itself would not automatically doom a claim for asylum.for example,an applicant might be disbelieved as to past episodes of persecution while his own or independent evidence might show that he faced threats of future example,direct threats from government established both his genuine belief and an objective likelihood that he would be persecuted.paul gonzales,cir.but rasiah made no such independent showing the only evidence of harm or threats to him or his family that he offered was the evidence that the ij disbelieved and there was no evidence of a pattern or practice of persecution of tamils beyond that our case law already has rejected as insufficient.
the bia also did not err in denying rasiah motion to reopen the proceedings.motions to reopen are disfavored and are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.lemus gonzales,cir.rasiah provided no new evidence as to why he should be believed,see,and did not show that country conditions had worsened dramatically,see ratnasingam,at.what he offered was far from the necessary showing of new evidence that establishes a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief.chikkeur mukasey,cir.
finally,as already noted,rasiah contends he is entitled to asylum because he is part of the particular social group of failed asylum seekers.the bia held this claim barred because rasiah failed to raise it before the ij.he points to nothing that shows he did raise it earlier,so the bia was on firm ground.kechichian mukasey,cir.
the petition for review is denied.
in an effort to avoid remanding this case to the bia,the majority constructs reasoning not present in,and indeed directly contradicted by,the bia decision.as i shall explain,the bia did not consider and reject rasiah claim of pattern or practice persecution on the merits.instead,on initial appeal and again on the motion to reopen,the bia declined to address rasiah pattern or practice claim in view of the ij adverse credibility finding as to rasiah personal accounts of past persecution.the bia committed a legal error by concluding that the adverse credibility finding as to past persecution doomed rasiah pattern or practice claim.therefore,i respectfully dissent.this case must be remanded to the bia so that rasiah properly presented pattern or practice claim may be heard in the first instance 
in our review of the bia decision,we can not invent grounds for affirmance and ascribe them to the agency.instead,we must judge the action of an administrative agency based only on reasoning provided by the agency,and not based on grounds constructed by the reviewing court.el moraghy ashcroft,cir quotation marks and citation omitted remanding where ij failed to state conclusions on several important issues see also halo gonzales,cir a reviewing court must judge the propriety of administrative action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency,and that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in this case,the majority affirms not on grounds provided by the bia,but on grounds constructed by the majority.
the majority asserts that the bia addressed rasiah pattern or practice claim by quoting the ij conclusion that simply by being a tamil rasiah was not entitled to a blank check in order to receive asylum.the majority then proceeds to affirm this purported reasoning by the bia,concluding that t he treatment of tamils,however deplorable,is not of a reach that entitles every tamil in sri lanka to asylum based on ethnicity alone.however,the record makes clear that the bia did not,as the majority suggests,consider the submitted evidence of country conditions and conclude that rasiah failed to establish systematic persecution of tamils in sri lanka.see b iii balachandran,at.instead,the bia expressly deemed it unnecessary to address rasiah pattern or practice claim in light of the ij prior adverse credibility finding as to rasiah accounts of past persecution.
proving a fear of future persecution generally requires individualized evidence that the applicant will be singled out for persecution upon return to his home country.kho,at.the analysis of a pattern or practice claim,however,is different.under the governing regulations,an asylum applicant need not demonstrate that he will be singled out individually for future persecution if the applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,and his or her own inclusion in,and identification with,such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is reasonable.b iii.
as the majority recognizes,evidence of prevailing country conditions may be relevant to either an individualized persecution claim or a pattern or practice claim.for example,evidence of country conditions may provide context and corroboration for the asylum applicant personal accounts of past persecution,thereby bolstering an individualized showing of persecution.see el moraghy,at.alternatively,evidence of prevailing country conditions may establish a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated to the applicant,making it unnecessary for the applicant to demonstrate that he will be singled out individually for persecution.
in this case,the bia decision only reference to rasiah pattern or practice claim appears in a footnote in which the bia expressly deemed it unnecessary to address the claim.the bia concluded 
inasmuch as the respondent can not meet his burden of proof without providing credible testimony as a result of the amendments created by the real id act,
