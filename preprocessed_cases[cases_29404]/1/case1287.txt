the national labor relations board certified a unit consisting of all maintenance employees at an production facility operated by nestle dreyer grand ice cream.dreyer contends that the board applied a legal standard that violated the national labor relations act the nlra and otherwise represented an abuse of discretion and under the proper legal standard as well as the incorrect legal standard upon which the board relied,production employees must be included in the unit.because the board did not violate the nlra or abuse its discretion in certifying the unit,we deny dreyer petition for review and grant the board for enforcement of its order.
at a production facility in bakersfield,california dreyer manufactures products cartons,cones,bars,and other frozen novelties.known as the bakersfield operations center the boc,the facility contains a factory with production lines,a palletizing area and distribution center,warehouses for dry goods and frozen goods,and a machine shop for making and repairing parts for the production lines.it also houses a research and development center.
at the time relevant to this litigation,the boc employed about maintenance employees and production employees.most production employees work on the production lines,operating the manufacturing equipment,stacking the product on pallets,and storing it for distribution.others work in,where they order materials and mix ingredients for the lines.production employees generally work on a specific production line,and they do not work in the machine shop or the research and development center.
the majority of maintenance employees work on the production lines,where they are assigned to multiple production lines or the adjacent palletizing areas.they perform routine maintenance and repairs on the manufacturing equipment.the rest of the maintenance employees perform a variety of tasks throughout the boc.process technicians,who work in,assist with the mixing equipment and troubleshoot problems as they arise.the utilities group maintains the boc refrigeration systems,as well as its electrical,heating,plumbing,and ventilation systems.other maintenance employees work as control technicians,in facilities maintenance,or in the machine shop.
on the production lines and in,maintenance and production employees sometimes work together.while production workers are trained to solve minor or routine technical problems for example,simple packaging jams that can be fixed by removing the jammed material their technical training is limited,and maintenance workers perform most repairs and routine maintenance.when production employees encounter technical problems they can not solve,they call for the assistance of a maintenance employee.the maintenance employee diagnoses the problem and performs the repair,relying on input from the production worker.every third shift,production workers disassemble the equipment for cleaning while maintenance workers stand by to replace broken parts or address problems that may occur during reassembly and.
maintenance and production employees have similar working conditions.they receive the same employment benefits,annual performance evaluations,and they use the same parking lots,time clocks,break rooms,and lockers.they must also follow the same workplace policies,including wearing similar uniforms.
but the two groups are distinguished in several significant respects.maintenance workers are generally better paid,receiving an hour,compared with for production workers.this reflects the fact that maintenance employees have significantly more training,particularly in mechanics and electronics.maintenance employees rarely do the work of production employees,and they work on a different schedule.whereas maintenance employees work four shifts each week,production employees work five shifts,which results in different overtime,holiday,and sick pay.furthermore,the two groups are organized into separate departments with different immediate supervisors.maintenance employees are part of the technical operations team production employees are on either the manufacturing team or the pre manufacturing team.finally,the boc shuts down annually for two to four weeks for a complete rebuild of the production lines.all maintenance employees are required to work during this period,whereas only a few production employees work if they volunteer or are selected to participate.
near the end of,dreyer put in place a pilot program,limited to one production line,intended to partially integrate the roles of production and maintenance employees.the purpose of the program was to increase production employees ability to perform routine maintenance cleaning,inspecting,lubricating,thereby allowing maintenance employees to focus less on breakdowns and more on preventive maintenance.the program was put on hold sometime in and was restarted in early.
late in,the international union of operating engineers local,afl cio filed a petition with the board,seeking to represent the boc maintenance employees.dreyer objected to the proposed unit,arguing that it should also include production employees.the board regional director the rd approved the unit over dreyer objections,and the board denied dreyer request for review.after maintenance employees voted in favor of joining the union,dreyer refused to bargain and the union filed an charge with the board 
the board granted summary judgment to the union,and dreyer sought review in this court.we placed the case in abeyance pending the supreme court decision in nlrb noel canning,d,which ultimately held that the appointments of some members of the board were unconstitutional.on the board motion,we vacated its order and remanded.
on remand,the board again found that dreyer had committed an unfair labor practice,and dreyer again petitioned this court for review.the board for enforcement.
the nlra requires the board to determine the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining.b.in making this determination,the board exercises the widest possible discretion.sandvik rock tools,nlrb,cir.the board may approve any appropriate unit it need not identify and select the single most appropriate unit.nlrb enter.leasing,cir quoting am.hosp.ass nlrb,d.therefore,to resist the board determination that a unit is appropriate,an employer can not merely demonstrate that a different unit is also appropriate,or even more appropriate.sandvik,at.rather,a n employer challenging the board unit determination has the burden to prove that the bargaining unit selected is utterly inappropriate.enter.leasing,at quoting sandvik,at see also arcadian shores,nlrb,cir.
but despite granting broad discretion,the nlra prohibits the board from blindly deferring to a union proposed unit.nlrb lundy packing,cir.rather,the nlra states that i n determining whether a unit is appropriate the extent to which the employees have organized shall not be controlling.c.this means that the happenstance of a union organizing efforts may not be the dominant factor in the board decision to approve the unit.see lundy,at.because a union will ordinarily propose a unit controlled by organized employees,the board violates the statute if it presumes the appropriateness of a proposed unit.see id.at.nevertheless,the board may consider the extent of organization as one relevant factor,which may even be the determinative factor in a close case.overnite transp.nlrb,cir.
to guide its discretion,and to avoid giving controlling weight to the extent of organization,the board has traditionally asked whether employees in the requested unit shar e a sufficient community of interest to be included in the same unit.overnite transp.the test incorporates several factors 
similarity in the scale and manner of determining the earnings similarity in employment benefits,hours of work,and other terms and conditions of employment similarity in the kind of work performed similarity in the qualifications,skills and training of the employees frequency of contact or interchange among the employees geographic proximity continuity or integration of production processes common supervision and determination of policy relationship to the administrative organization of the employer history of collective bargaining desires of the affected employees and extent of union organization.
enter.leasing,at quoting lundy,at.the test ensures not only that the employees in the unit share common interests,but also that these interests are distinct from those of excluded employees.see newton wellesley.
in specialty healthcare rehabilitation center of mobile,the board set out to clarify this longstanding analysis.the board explained that the analysis proceeds in two steps.in step one,the board examines the unit if that unit is an appropriate unit,the board proceeds no further.id.at.in essence,this is the traditional test outlined above.see id.at examining the factors to determine that the included employees share a community of interest and are unlike all the other employees the employer would include in the unit.once the board determines in step one that the members of the proposed unit share a community of interest and the unit is thus appropriate the burden then shifts to the employer to show that the approved unit is inappropriate.id.at.
in step two,the employer is required to demonstrate that a proposed unit consisting of employees readily identifiable as a group who share a community of interest is nevertheless not an appropriate unit because the smallest appropriate unit contains additional employees.id.the employer required showing is necessarily heightened because the board need not select the most appropriate unit,the employer must do more than show that its preferred unit is also appropriate.id.at.
the board acknowledged in specialty healthcare that it and the courts of appeals had over time used different words to describe this heightened showing,and it concluded that the use of slightly varying verbal formulations did not serve the statutory purpose of the nlra.id.at.accordingly,to describe the employer required showing when asking the board to include additional employees in the unit,the board settled on a phrase accepted by the circuit an overwhelming community of interest.id.at quoting blue man vegas,llc nlrb.
to summarize the specialty healthcare framework in step one,the board performs a analysis to determine whether the proposed unit is appropriate if the unit is found appropriate,in step two the employer must demonstrate that the excluded employees it wishes to include share an overwhelming community of interest with the included employees.id.emphasis added.
we hold that the board acted within its broad discretion in certifying the union unit.after a thorough analysis of the facts,the rd applied the traditional factors to determine not only that the maintenance employees share a community of interest amongst themselves,but also that maintenance employees form a group distinct from production employees.by doing so,the rd did not allow the extent of organization to control his decision.
in applying the specialty healthcare framework,the rd began by determining that the maintenance employees are readily identifiable as a separate group from production employees.maintenance employees are in their own department,and are in different job classifications,have different skills,and perform different functions from production employees.id.the rd focused in particular on the very different skills of the two employee groups and on the fact that maintenance employees have much more technical knowledge than production employees.id.specifically,maintenance employees are required to have one year experience in computerized maintenance management,two years experience in troubleshooting pneumatics,hydraulics,and electrical and manufacturing,and five to seven years experience in industrial high speed maintenance.id.none of these requirements apply to production employees.id.and whereas m aintenance mechanics spend about of their time performing skilled maintenance work,production employees lack the appropriate skill for such work and make only minor adjustment s or repair s.
having distinguished maintenance and production employees,the rd next determined that t he maintenance employees share a sufficient community of interest amongst themselves for purposes of collective bargaining.applying the traditional factors,he determined that the maintenance employees share similar wages,similar hours,common supervision,and common functions.
throughout this analysis,the rd continued to note how maintenance employees are distinct from production employees.he found that t he greater skill of the maintenance employees is reflected by the fact that the maintenance employees are significantly higher paid than the production employees and that there is virtually no temporary interchange between maintenance and production employees.moreover,any overlap in wages of the two groups is limited to one of five classes of maintenance employees and is ultimately insignificant.the two groups work different shifts,the rd found,and as a result,o vertime is calculated differently for maintenance employees than production employees,maintenance employees tend to work more overtime than production employees,and maintenance employees receive more hours of sick pay than production employees.id.the two groups essential functions also differ the maintenance employees are primarily in charge of maintaining the employer machinery,and the production employees are primarily in charge of producing the ice cream.and while many maintenance employees come into contact with production employees on the production lines,some maintenance employees who do not work on the lines have more limited or very little contact with production employees.
moving on to step two of the specialty healthcare analysis,the rd found that dreyer could not meet its burden to show that the production and maintenance employees share an overwhelming community of interest.he rejected several of dreyer arguments.first,he found distinguishable prior board cases approving joint units of production and maintenance employees.citing buckhorn,tdk ferrites.second,he found that the unit is not arbitrary or fractured because the union sought to represent all classifications of the employer maintenance employees.id.third,he found the bargaining history at the facility inconclusive.id.and finally,the rd gave little weight to dreyer argument that its pilot program for increasing the integration of the production and maintenance employees work renders the unit inappropriate.the success of the program remained speculative,he found,and even assuming its success,the program would not close the significant gap in skill between the two groups.id.
by properly applying the factors before shifting the burden to dreyer,the rd appropriately exercised his discretion and did not permit the extent of organization to control.fedex freight,nlrb,wl,at cir,published holding that the use of an overwhelming community of interest test at the second step of the board analysis does not violate section c kindred nursing ctrs,llc nlrb,cir enforcing the board order in specialty healthcare blue man,at as long as the board applies the overwhelming standard only after the proposed unit has been shown to be prima facie appropriate,the board does not run afoul of the statutory injunction that the extent of the union organization not be given controlling weight.
this conclusion is supported by the fact that the approved unit tracks dreyer own departmental lines and is consistent with prior board unit determinations.see,ore ida foods,finding that maintenance employees shared a community of interest distinct from production workers because of differences in skill and compensation,despite extensive contact with,and,at times the assistance of,the production employees.and it is of no consequence that a unit including production employees may also be appropriate.see rd noting that factors dreyer points to might show that a combined unit is an appropriate unit.dreyer burden is to show that the approved unit is utterly inappropriate.enter.leasing,at.that it can not do,as we explain in the next section.
dreyer offers several objections,focusing its attack on specialty healthcare rather than on the board decision in this
