this case arises from an appeal of a decision by the occupational safety and health review commission regarding a drowning accident at a work site in beavercreek,ohio.that decision reversed in part and affirmed in part the decision of the administrative law judge in this matter,the petitioner,claims that the judgment of the review commission was arbitrary,capricious and an abuse of discretion.the review commission found that had violated two sections of the occupational safety and health act.first,the commission found that violated b in failing to instruct employees in the recognition and avoidance of the hazards associated with entering a basin filled with accumulated water.second,the commission found that had knowledge of the failure of its employee to use personal protective equipment in violation of a,and unpreventable supervisory misconduct defense failed.in essence,the review commission found that made some efforts to insure safety but that its enforcement of safety rules was not sufficiently aggressive and its safety instructions not clear and definite.
in april of,danis industries and shook,entered into a joint venture for the expansion of the beavercreek wastewater treatment plant in ohio.as part of the expansion work,constructed two identical equalization basins to provide added capacity for storage of sewage following storm surges.the basins are above ground and round,uncovered,concrete basins.they have a diameter of approximately two hundred feet,and they are about twenty feet high.the floors of the basins slope toward the center at about one half inch per foot.at the center of the basins is a drain pipe,inches in diameter.the pipe drops straight down six feet before reaching an elbow joint,where it thereafter proceeds horizontally,underground,to the pump station.
during the construction of the basins,covered the drain pipes with plywood covers less than one.wooden boards were secured underneath each of the two plugs.installed the plugs to prevent falling injuries while the basins were still under construction.the basins were completed in the fall of,but the pump station was not yet completed.to prevent water from draining from the basins to the station,left the plugs in place through the winter.the company also caulked around the plugs to prevent leakage.
when the pump station was finished in april of,the basins still needed more work,including placing brackets on the walls for supporting aeration pipes.rainwater and snowmelt from the winter had accumulated in the basins however,to between twelve and thirty inches deep,and the basins needed to be drained.to drain them,a laborer wearing waders,life vest,harness and lifeline entered the water and drilled three holes in each plywood plug.the water began to drain,but the basins did not empty completely.
about two weeks after drilled the holes,the pipefitters on the project finished their work on the pump station and began working in basin.the pipefitters foreman was james wagner,and he had a crew of two men,one of whom was his son.there were still several inches of water in the bottom of basin,so the crew did as much work around the dry upper edges of the sloped floor as possible.the work did not involve going in the water at all.because they could go no further in basin until the remainder of the water was gone,foreman wagner made a decision to begin working on basin on april.while the two crew members worked on assembling tools and cleaning the wall castings,foreman wagner,wearing waders,walked into the accumulated water in basin.the water was more than inches deep at the drain.the foreman wanted to see why the pipe was not draining.his crew watched him pull a piece of plastic sheeting away from the plug.next,foreman wagner used a long metal piece of equipment to slide over the plug,thumping the bar on the plug.the plug dislodged,and foreman wagner was sucked down the drain and drowned.
within an hour and a half of the accident,an occupational safety and health administration safety specialist was at the construction site to make observations and conduct interviews.on the basis of the information she gathered,the secretary of labor issued a serious citation to.she alleged serious violations of section a of the occupational safety and health act for failing to provide a workplace free of recognized hazards by exposing employees who entered the accumulated water in the basin to a potential engulfment hazard b for failing to instruct employees in the recognition and avoidance of hazards associated with entering a basin filled with accumulated water and a for failing to require employees entering the water in the basin to wear appropriate personal protective equipment such as safety harnesses and lifelines.the administrative law judge vacated the first citation,and that holding was not appealed.the judge also vacated the citation for failing to instruct in violation of section b.the judge found the citation was appropriate for section a,and he rejected affirmative defense that foreman wagner engaged in unpreventable supervisory misconduct.the review commission found violations for both sections.

the first issue is whether the review commission abused its discretion when it found that violated section b,by failing to instruct employees who entered the basins in the recognition and avoidance of hazards associated with engulfment or being sucked into the pipe as the water was drained from it.the administrative law judge vacated the violation,because he found that although foreman wagner may not have appreciated the danger in working around the plug,satisfied its obligations by generally pointing out an engulfment hazard and by providing a general rule for the use of personal protective equipment.
the materials provided to employees do not satisfy the regulation,the secretary argues,as none of them addressed the use of safety equipment while in a situation like the one at issue,nor did they fully address working in water.those in charge at certainly understood the danger,at minimum,because the standing water had been in the basins all winter.the orientation and other safety materials should have specifically addressed the dangers presented by the basins and the plugs at their drain pipes.
argues that it did fulfill its obligations in warning its employees of the engulfment danger and need for personal protective equipment.had a comprehensive safety program including a written safety program,a safety program,an employee safety guide,written programs dealing specifically with perso
