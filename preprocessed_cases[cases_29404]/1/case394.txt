petitioner emmanuel jean,a native and citizen of haiti,appeals from a final order of removal of the board of immigration appeals bia,which denied his petitions for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.an immigration judge ij found that jean was not credible,and that he had not met his burden of establishing past persecution or a fear of future persecution.the ij also found that even if jean had established past persecution,circumstances in haiti had changed fundamentally such that jean no longer had a fear of persecution there.in a per curiam order,the bia affirmed and adopted the ij ruling.we affirm the bia and deny the petition.
on or about october,jean entered the united states as a visitor.he was authorized to remain in the united states until april.jean did not depart by that date,and thereafter his presence in the united states was unauthorized.on october,jean filed an application requesting political asylum and withholding of removal based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group.jean also requested protection under the cat.
in support of his application,jean offered documentary and testimonial evidence that he had experienced persecution in haiti on account of his political opinion.the facts as presented by jean were as follows.jean claimed that he was known in haiti to oppose aristide and his government.he claimed that as a result,he was harassed and threatened by aristide supporters.the first such incident occurred in,after aristide first came to power.aristide supporters demonstrating in the streets stopped jean car and asked why he displayed no symbol of support for aristide.they threatened to burn his car with him inside unless he kissed a picture of aristide,which he did do.in addition,jean testified that numerous times in,members of political feces at his home.
a coup in displaced aristide,and jean reported that he experienced no further persecution until aristide returned to power in.at that point,jean claimed,members of lavalas,in addition to members of les group of radical aristide again began harassing him.this harassment continued until jean final departure from haiti in.jean testified that during this time,he and his wife received repeated threatening phone calls.in addition,jean alleged that members of les chim√®res would visit his store and home and demand money from him.in,one of jean stores was looted,and jean suspected lavalas.he claimed that although he reported the incident to the police,they failed to investigate it.jean also stated that in,his store and home were burned down by people he believed to be supporters of aristide.jean testified that he left haiti for the united states in october of because the haitian government had issued a warrant directing him to appear in court.he reported that a friend had told him that people who receive these warrants are often killed.after jean left haiti,members of lavalas apparently went to his brother store and asked for jean.when jean father told the men that jean was not there and refused to provide further information,the men shot jean father in the leg.
jean also offered evidence that he had a fear of persecution based on his membership in a particular social family.he claimed that lavalas wished to kill him because of his prior association with his wife brother and cousin,both of whom were killed by members of lavalas because of their opposition to the party.
between and,jean traveled to the united states several times.at no time during these visits did he apply for asylum.each time,he voluntarily returned to haiti.jean testified that during those prior visits to the united states he felt he could go back to his country at any time because he did have any problem with the government.
in a decision issued june,the ij denied jean applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,but granted jean the privilege of voluntary departure until august.in her opinion,the ij stated that she found the petitioner and his testified in support of his credible.in particular,she found that jean testimony was materially inconsistent with his written asylum claim and was contradicted by certain aspects of his supporting documents.the ij also found it incredible that jean and his wife would have voluntarily returned to haiti several times after having received threats from members of lavalas.
the ij went on to note that even if jean had been credible,he still would have failed to establish a fear of persecution in haiti.in making this determination,the ij considered only those events that purportedly took place after jean last voluntary return to haiti.she found that these phone calls,solicitation of money by aristide supporters,and the burning down of jean home and not amount to persecution.further,she found that even if jean had shown past persecution,circumstances in haiti had fundamentally changed such that he no longer had a fear of persecution there.specifically,the forced ouster of president aristide,the posting of international troops to haiti and the installation of a new,government cumulatively constitute a fundamental change in circumstances in haiti.
in a per curiam order issued on october,the bia affirmed without opinion and adopted the ij ruling.the bia also extended the time within which jean was permitted to depart the united states voluntarily to december.
jean makes several claims on appeal.first,he argues that the ij wrongly found him not credible.second,he asserts that the ij wrongly failed to consider periodic persecution and the persecution of jean family in ruling on his asylum claim.third,jean argues that the bia failure to reassess country conditions at the time of his appeal robbed him of a reasoned administrative decision.finally,he claims that the bia issuance of an affirmance without opinion was procedural error.we consider only jean challenges to the ij credibility finding and the bia summary affirmance procedure.because we find that the ij credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence,we do not reach jean other challenges to the ij asylum determination.
normally,we review the bia decision.romilus ashcroft,cir.however,when the bia adopts the ij opinion,we review the opinion of the ij as if it were the bia.id.when the bia does not render its own opinion,and either defers to or adopts the opinion of the ij,a court of appeals must then review the decision of the ij.quoting albathani ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also e ii.

here,substantial evidence supports the ij finding that jean and his wife were not credible.jean offered inconsistent testimony about many of the incidents that form the basis of his claim.in an affidavit accompanying his application for asylum,jean stated that his friend informed him that his store had been burned down by men wearing masks.however,in his testimony before the ij,jean first testified that his friend had not described the appearance of the attackers.when questioned by the ij about whether his friend had been able to see the attackers faces,jean stated that because it was dark,his friend had been able to observe only the hair and clothing of the attackers.when the ij specifically asked whether the men had been wearing masks,jean initially said he did know.he then dodged the question why his testimony differed from his affidavit,and subsequently changed his testimony to conform to his affidavit.similarly,on cross examination jean embellished his des
