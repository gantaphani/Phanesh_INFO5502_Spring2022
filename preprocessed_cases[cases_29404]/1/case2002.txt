wilson air center,llc appeals from the final decision of the federal aviation administration.wilson filed a complaint with the administration alleging that the county airport authority differing treatment of wilson and wilson competitor,amr combs,incorporated violated its obligations under federal law prohibiting unjust economic discrimination,a,as well as prohibiting the creation of exclusive rights,e.the administration rejected wilson claims we affirm.
background 
memphis international airport is a,airport owned and operated by the county airport authority,which serves as fedex principal hub for its cargo operations.amr and wilson function as the airport operators,commonly referred to as fbo,which are small plane gas and repair stations which service private,nonscheduled aircraft.kemmons wilson,faa,cir.
the airport development has been financed partly by federal funds pursuant to the airport improvement program as authorized by the airport and airway improvement act of.see,et.as a recipient of funds under the program,the authority must give assurances that it will not engage in unjust discrimination,a,and will not grant any aeronautical service provider an exclusive right to use the airport,e.wilson,believing that the authority breached these assurances,filed a complaint with the administration pursuant to part,alleging that the authority had violated its federal obligations.the facts underlying this complaint are developed as follows.
lease agreements with amr 
before wilson began its operation,amr was the airport only operator.amr had several preexisting leasehold agreements with the authority,which were consolidated into a new lease agreement in december.the lease,which covered the area located in the central part of the south complex,granted amr an option to extend the lease term through if it invested over a million dollars in capital improvements on the property.in,amr supplemented a preexisting lease agreement,which concerned its right to occupy the administration old control tower,by adding a parcel described as the general aviation building.
amr also held preexisting leasehold agreements with the authority covering parcels in the north complex.in,amr entered into a consolidated and restated lease agreement for parcels of land located at airport north complex.after amr exercised an option to increase the duration of the lease,the lease term was extended to january.
in,after making the requisite capital improvements,amr requested an extension of its lease term on the south complex parcel.amr also requested that the authority extend the lease terms on its other properties to coincide with the expiration date of its south complex lease.the authority granted this request.by,when wilson began its own operation,with certain parcels removed from amr lease in the meantime,amr total acreage under its various leases was approximately acres.
in,amr indicated its intent to expand its operation by requesting that the authority extend its north complex lease beyond its termination date.the authority declined this request,explaining that the extension would interfere with fedex planned expansion.thereafter,on june,amr indicated its desire to terminate the north complex lease in favor of a lease of the south complex,where it would relocate its entire operation and build a new executive terminal building along with additional hangar space to accommodate all tenants currently at the north facility.from through,amr and the authority negotiated the terms of this,amr surrender of its north complex leaseholds and its relocation to the south complex.
in february,the authority and amr entered into a consolidated and restated lease agreement.this lease,which is the source of wilson complaints,provided for amr incremental abandonment of its north complex holdings to be completed by the end of six years before amr lease of these parcels terminated.after securing amr release from the north complex,the authority,on march,entered into a lease agreement with fedex for these same parcels.
on may,the authority and amr entered into a restated lease agreement for the south complex,which was to expire on june.under the lease,amr agreed to expend a minimum of in capital investments to construct a minimum of two new square foot hangars and to rehabilitate the general aviation building over a period of seven years beginning june,with a completion date of june.
the lease maintained the lease rental rates for the south complex until original expiration date of the lease.the lease also maintained the rental rate for the general aviation building that was established in the lease covering that building.the authority,however,agreed to abate amr rent for the general aviation building for a one year period,in exchange for amr rehabilitation of the aging building.this rehabilitation included the removal of asbestos and lead and the updating of the building plumbing,electrical and hvac systems.a separate agreement provided the rental rate for the acres of taxiway that was conveyed to amr by the south complex lease 
additionally,the lease granted amr options to lease three parcels of land adjacent to the south complex.amr was required to pay option fees for these parcels and could originally exercise its option at any time during the lease term.in response to wilson complaints,however,the authority and amr entered into an amended agreement that provided for an incremental development schedule that amr was required to meet in order to retain the parcels.
prior lease agreements with wilson 
in,wilson negotiated a lease with the authority allowing it to begin operating as the airport second operator.wilson began its operation,however,only after a litigious battle with the authority.indeed,after the authority declined wilson application to begin its own operation to compete with amr,wilson filed a complaint with the administration alleging that the authority had created an exclusive right in favor of amr in violation of federal law.the administration concluded that the authority refusal was based upon its spatial restrictions and that any available space was earmarked for other uses.therefore,the administration dismissed wilson complaint.
wilson timely appealed to this court.we found that the administration perfunctory adjudication based upon only cryptic evidence constrained our ability to determine whether the administration decision was supported by substantial evidence.see kemmons wilson,at.thus,we vacated the administration decision and remanded the case for an administrative hearing.id.at.on remand,the administration determined that the authority refusal to lease land to wilson in order for it to open a operation was not motivated by nefarious intent.to comply with federal law,however,the administration ordered that the authority negotiate with wilson for the opening of a second operation.
in july,as a result of these negotiations,the authority allowed wilson to begin its own operation by granting it a lease of approximately twelve acres of undeveloped land for twelve cents per square foot.additionally,the lease contained an option to lease an additional two and a half acres,which wilson exercised.in december,wilson leased,under a separate agreement,an additional parcel at twelve cents a square foot,thereby increasing its leasehold to just over sixteen acres.
wilson continually sought to expand its operation at the airport from through.specifically,wilson expressed interest in leasing several pieces of airport property including a plot of land referred to as hurricane creek that was under a lease agreement with fedex,a plot of land on which the northwest airlink building was located,and the option parcels that,unknown to wilson,the authority had leased to amr one week before its inquiry.the authority entered into negotiations with wilson regarding the hurricane creek and northwest airlink parcels.the negotiations included wilson proposals that the authority lease wilson the northwest airlink building until june,that the authority demolish certain buildings on the northwest plot and that the authority,at its own expense,construct a ramp for wilson exclusive use across the hurricane creek parcel to provide access to the airfield.
for its part,with regard to the northwest airlink property,the authority agreed to relocate fedex at its own expense,demolish the buildings on the northwest plot,and consider abating the rent for the northwest airlink building for one year in exchange for capital improvements.the authority also noted that it would charge eighteen cents per square foot for unimproved ground rent and twenty cents per square foot for improved ground rent through the fifth year of any new lease term,at which time,the rent would be based upon the land appraisal value.in response to wilson proposal for the hurricane creek parcel,the authority noted that it would not install the ramp as requested,but it would consider its other proposals once wilson had provided the authority with its master plan for development of the property.
procedural background 
on august,unhappy with the authority response to its effort to expand its operation,wilson filed a complaint under part,alleging that the authority treatment of wilson as compared to its treatment of amr constituted unjust economic discrimination in violation of a,and created exclusive rights in violation of e.
the director of the administration office of airport safety and standards after evaluating wilson complaint and the parties pleadings,concluded that the authority did not violate its federal obligations and dismissed the complaint.wilson appealed to the administration,which affirmed the factual findings and legal conclusions in the director decision.this timely appeal followed.on appeal,wilson raises several arguments,which will be addressed in turn.
ii.standard of review 
when reviewing an order of the federal aviation administration,we apply the standards of review as articulated in the federal aviation act,c,and by default,the administrative procedure act.under the federal aviation act,the administration findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.c findings of fact by the administrator,if supported by substantial evidence,are conclusive.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.singer garvey,cir.we must consider the record in its entirety,including the body of evidence opposed to the agency view.loral def.nlrb,cir quoting am.textile mfrs.inst.donovan,d,when reviewing the record for substantial evidence.even if two different conclusions can be drawn from the evidence,we may still find that the agency factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.id.substantial evidence review gives the agency the benefit of the doubt,since it requires not the degree of evidence which satisfies the court that the requisite fact exists,but merely the degree which could satisfy a reasonable factfinder.allentown mack sales,nlrb,d.
given the act silence regarding the appropriate standard for reviewing the administration nonfactual findings,we must look to the administrative procedure act to supply the appropriate standard of review.penobscot air,faa,cir.thus,we review de novo questions of law,see,but we must give some deference to the agency because it is charged with administering the statute.am.nuclear,dep of labor,cir.
this court reviews an agency other findings and conclusions to determine whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a penobscot,at with respect to other agency action,findings,and conclusions,the administrative procedure act requires the reviewing court to hold them unlawful and set them aside if they are found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.internal quotation marks omitted.generally,we consider an agency action arbitrary and capricious when the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.henry ford health shalala,cir quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
iii.analysis 
evidentiary hearing 
on appeal,wilson argues that the administration abused its discretion by failing to provide it with an evidentiary hearing,as he argues the statute requires.before addressing the merits of this claim,however,we must address the administration argument that wilson has waived its right to argue this issue on appeal by not presenting it to the agency for review.
the administrative waiver doctrine,commonly referred to as issue exhaustion,provides that it is inappropriate for courts reviewing agency decisions to consider arguments not raised before the administrative agency involved.coalition for gov t procurement fed.prison,cir.administrative issue exhaustion is typically required by statute.sims apfel,d initially,we note that requirements of administrative issue exhaustion are largely creatures of statute.the statute at issue in this case requires that an objection be made before the agency or that there exists a reasonable ground for not having made the objection in order to obtain review of that objection.d.section d provides 
d requirement for prior reviewing an order under this section,the court may consider an objection to an order of the secretary,under secretary,or administrator only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by the secretary,under secretary,or administrator or if there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection in the proceeding.
our review of the record convinces us that wilson has waived the argument that the administration abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing.as the administration notes,wilson expressly stated that it was not asking that the administration conduct a full evidentiary hearing.in its motion for limited discovery,wilson noted to be clear,wilson is not requesting at this stage a evidentiary hearing.again in its motion for limited discovery,wilson noted that it is not requesting a hearing at this time.wilson is simply requesting that the director exercise the faa discretionary powers in order to permit leave for wilson to conduct limited discovery wilson has not argued that there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection,d,nor does our independent consideration of the issue supply one.
given the foregoing,we refuse to allow wilson to bypass the statutory requirement of administrative issue exhaustion by raising this issue for the first time in this appeal.see sims,at.furthermore,we find wilson due process claims that are predicated upon the argument that the administration erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing similarly unexhausted,thereby foreclosing our ability to review those claims 
failure to conduct a site visit,allow a surreply,grant limited discovery and further investigate 
wilson also argues that the administration erred in failing to further investigate its complaint by limiting its review to the pleadings by refusing to grant its motion for limited discovery by refusing to conduct a site visit and by striking its surreply from the record.relatedly,wilson argues that the administration failure to conduct an investigation and permit discovery constituted a denial of its due process rights.we find these arguments unpersuasive.
first,we address wilson argument that the administration erred in refusing to conduct a site visit.as the administration notes,wilson never explicitly requested a site visit,but rather simply offered to provide one.because wilson never explicitly objected to the administration failure to conduct a site visit,this argument is unexhausted and has been waived.
second,we address wilson argument that the administration erred in striking its surreply from the record.on november,wilson filed a motion for leave to file a surreply.the administration,citing,denied the motion,noting that part proceedings provide only for an appeal and a reply.thus,the administration concluded that the record was complete without wilson surreply.while acknowledging that the right to file a surreply is permissive,wilson argues that the administration used its discretionary powers to abdicate its search for the truth.specifically,wilson argues that the surreply was necessary to correct a misstatement that the administration made concerning wilson failure to file a master plan for the northwest airlink building.we find wilson argument unpersuasive.as the administration notes,wilson does not argue that these materials contain new evidence or were unavailable to it to file with its administrative appeal,and under these circumstances we conclude that the administration did not abuse its discretion in striking the surreply.
third,we address wilson argument that the administration erred in failing to conduct further investigation and permit limited discovery.on september,wilson filed a motion for limited discovery.the director denied this motion reasoning that part proceedings contemplate an expedited process,which does not provide for discovery during the investigation stages of a complaint.see.we find no error in this ruling,nor do we find that the administration improperly investigated wilson complaint.
the regulations require the administration to conduct further investigation of a complaint when the pleadings set forth a reasonable basis for doing so.wilson argues that its complaint set forth a reasonable basis for investigation and as such the complaint necessitated further investigation.we agree with this statement,but we believe that wilson complaint was further investigated as articulated in the regulations and therefore,we reject the factual basis for this argument.
the regulations provide the administration with considerable discretion in choosing how best to fulfill its investigatory duties under the process as delineated in part,it is clear that the administration has the discretion to determine its own need for further investigation and what that investigation should entail.even wilson apparently recognizes the administration discretion in conducting investigations as it notes in its appellate brief that the procedure is permissive and not mandatory.
wilson argument rests on its misreading of the regulations at issue.wilson contends that t he regulatory language concerning further investigation based on the pleadings can not reasonably be interpreted to mean only a pleadings review.we find this argument contrary to the plain language of the regulation.see henry ford health,at we read statutes and regulations with an eye to their straightforward and commonsense meanings.as quoted above,the plain language of the regulation indicates that further investigation may entail only a review of the pleadings,but that requirement may also involve more,if the administration determines it is necessary.b the investigation may include one or more of the following,at the sole discretion of the faa emphasis added.the administration apparently determined more documentation was unnecessary and we can not,from our review of the record,conclude that this was an abuse of discretion.
further,we note that the administration clearly understood its authority to request supplemental information in the event that it determined that this information was necessary for resolution of the complaint moreover,the administration indicated that it was not reluctant to request additional,needed information the administration apparently felt that it could decide the case without any additional materials,and we find no basis to conclude otherwise.
finally,to the extent that wilson argues that its due process rights were violated by the administration alleged failure to conduct further investigation and permit distinct from its failure to hold an evidentiary hearing,which as discussed we believe is not properly before this find that this argument lacks merit.to implicate the protections of the due process clause,there must be a deprivation of a property interest.bd.of regents roth,d.wilson argues that it has a property interest as a beneficiary of the restrictive covenant in the airport deed prohibiting the creation of exclusive rights.even assuming that wilson has alleged a sufficient property interest so as to trigger the due process protections,we hold that the administration actions did not violate the due process clause.
the balancing test that we apply to determine how much process is due under these circumstances is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.mathews eldridge,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we consider the following three interests 
first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.
id.at.we find that the balance of these interests weighs in favor of the administration.
the first private interest at in favor of the administration.as the first circuit described in penobscot,wilson essentially benefits from the covenant as any member of the public benefits from the requirement of access to the airport.wilson stands to earn a certain amount of profits if the requirement is enforced,while members of the public as consumers,would benefit from purchasing airport services at lower prices from more efficient companies.penobscot,at.
likewise,we find that the second and third risk of an erroneous deprivation and the administrative burden of additional in favor of the administration.the administration,while limiting its review of the complaint to the pleadings,conducted an extensive review of the voluminous record and produced a thorough and opinion.in so doing,contrary to wilson argument,the administration followed the statutory procedures and federal regulations for review of a complaint brought pursuant to part.although under the relevant statutory and regulatory framework the administration had the authority to require more procedural process in investigating and resolving this complaint,this authority was at the administration discretion to exercise.see.requiring the administration to do more than it has done in this case would not only constrain the administration discretion in resolving complaints brought pursuant to part,but it would also force the administration to procedurally in claims that might be assessed just as accurately without,requiring more procedural process.penobscot,at.thus,under these facts,we hold that there was no violation of the due process clause.
unjust economic discrimination 
finally,wilson argues that the authority engaged in prohibited economic discrimination.an airport receiving funds under the airport improvement program can not engage in unjust discrimination,a,
wilson argues that the authority unjustly discriminated against it in violation of a,by not offering wilson the same rental rates,incentives and abatements that amr received under the lease for general aviation building and south complex.also,wilson argues that the authority engaged in economic discrimination in favor of amr by allowing amr to acquire the option parcels to its exclusion.wilson argues that these collectively hampered its ability to compete with amr operation,resulting in unjust discrimination.
wilson raises a number of arguments alleging that the authority lease with amr constituted economic discrimination against wilson and in favor of amr.first,wilson argues that amr lease constituted a new leasing agreement and that the rates should have risen to reflect wilson rates.second,wilson argues that the authority charged amr less than the appraisal value for the taxiway.third,wilson argues that the rental rate that the authority charged amr for the general aviation building per square foot as compared to the rental rate it offered to lease the northwest airlink building for per square foot demonstrates that the authority engaged in unjust economic discri
