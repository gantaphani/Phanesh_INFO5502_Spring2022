andrew chmielinski,the chief probation officer of the milford,massachusetts,district court,was fired by the commissioner of probation after a hearing on charges he had abused his office.that termination was upheld on administrative appeal to the chief justice for administration and management cjam of the commonwealth of massachusetts trial court and then to the trial court advisory committee on personnel standards.
chmielinski filed a civil rights action in federal district court alleging that his procedural due process rights had been violated.the district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.we affirm the dismissal,although our take on the case is different.we focus on whether the initial hearing,which did not involve full trial rights,violated due process guarantees and conclude it did not.
because this appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.rucker lee holding,cir.
chmielinski started working as a temporary probation officer for the commonwealth of massachusetts trial court in.he became a permanent probation officer in and worked in the dorchester district court until.in,he was promoted to be the chief probation officer in the milford district court and continued in that role until his discharge on february.
proceedings 
on april,chmielinski learned that his supervisors had complaints regarding his work performance,but he did not become aware of the specific nature of the complaints.the same day,he received a letter from defendant anthony sicuso,the deputy counsel of the office of the commissioner of probation,stating that allegations of misconduct had been made against chmielinski at a meeting between chmielinski and sicuso on may,sicuso reiterated that allegations had been made,but refused to provide any specifics to chmielinski or his counsel.
on may,sicuso provided chmielinski with a letter stating that he had been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave effective immediately.this letter still did not describe what the allegations were,but it informed chmielinski that while the allegations had not been proved,sicuso believed they were plausible.the letter also set out directives with which chmielinski was ordered to comply on penalty of further disciplinary action,including that he not appear at the premises of the milford district court,not contact any employees or former employees of the milford district court,and that he r efrain from all conflict,behavior and from any behavior which creates the appearance of conflict,of intimidation or retaliation.from the prohibitions in this letter,chmielinski received some warning of the nature and sources of the claims against him.
during may and june,a representative of the trial of probation investigated the allegations of misconduct against chmielinski,which led to a report drafted by regional supervisor elizabeth slaney,at sicuso direction.this report contained embedded hearsay.the complaint alleges the investigation was improper.
after the report was completed,the trial of probation,by letter dated september,charged chmielinski with multiple acts of misconduct that chmielinski had shoplifted on september,that he improperly obtained a blue light permit and mounted the light in his personal vehicle that he made improper disclosures of court records that activities undertaken by chmielinski relating to a speeding ticket of his brother created the appearance of impropriety that he carried a firearm while on duty approximately four years earlier and that he was involved in improper interactions with other employees.
a hearing on the allegations was conducted on january,and january,four months after the charges were made.defendant john,the commissioner of probation,presided over the hearing.at this hearing,chmielinski and his counsel presented evidence on chmielinski own behalf and had the opportunity to question the evidence against him.the complaint alleges this was the only hearing which took place before his termination,and his only opportunity to present evidence on his behalf or to question,other than through oral argument or written argument,the evidence,conclusions or findings against him 
on february,issued his decision on the charges made against chmielinski.while he found in favor of chmielinski on some of the charges,he found against him on others,and ordered chmielinski be terminated effective immediately.
chmielinski appeals 
on march,chmielinski appealed decision to the cjam pursuant to massachusetts state law and the trial court human resources policy.see.laws ch,xxviii t he chief justice for administration and management shall review all appointments and dismissals governed by applicable personnel standards for noncompliance with such standards and shall rescind any such appointment or dismissal that does not comply with said standards.policies and procedures manual of the human resources department of the administrative office of the trial court hereinafter trial court policies and procedures disciplinary process for complaints against probation officers.
in his written appeal,chmielinski alleged that the decision was arbitrary and capricious,and that the process violated his rights.he asserted that the failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on appeal was itself a violation of his rights.as to his termination hearing,he argued that his rights were violated on multiple grounds there was no discovery witnesses were not sworn witnesses were not sequestered various categories of evidence were improperly admitted sicuso letter prohibiting contact with any coworkers resulted in preventing chmielinski from conducting an investigation and preparing a defense leading questions were asked of witnesses certain of his evidence was ignored by the result of his hearing was predetermined lunched with counsel for the trial of the commissioner on one of the hearing days,which was indicative of bias and,issued his decision only one day after chmielinski counsel received a copy of the transcript of the hearing preventing counsel from making a written submission after the hearing.on august,the cjam denied the appeal and upheld the termination decision.
chmielinski then exercised his statutory right to appeal further the termination decision to the trial court advisory committee on personnel standards.laws ch,if an employee has served three full years in an applicable position,he shall have the right to appear personally before the committee before said committee reaches its decision as to whether or not to affirm his removal.oral argument was held before the advisory committee on november,at which chmielinski presented again his allegations of procedural inadequacies.
the advisory committee affirmed chmielinski termination and informed the cjam by letter dated november.chmielinski,through his counsel,was made aware of the advisory committee affirmance by a letter dated november.
federal lawsuit 
on july,chmielinski brought suit under in federal district court against the office of the commissioner of probation,the trial court,and and sicuso in their individual capacities,alleging that chmielinski termination violated his right to procedural due process.he sought compensatory and punitive damages from the individual defendants and reinstatement to his former position plus compensatory and punitive damages from the commonwealth defendants.
the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the suit be dismissed because chmielinski,even on the most favorable reading of the complaint,had received constitutionally adequate process the district court accepted and adopted the magistrate recommendation granting the defendants motion to dismiss.
chmielinski appeals the district court dismissal of his damages claims against the individual defendants,sicuso and he does not appeal the dismissal of his claims against the commonwealth agencies.our review of the district court granting of the motion to dismiss is de novo.margo caribe,cir.in order to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must allege a plausible entitlement to relief.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d internal quotation marks omitted.
jurisdiction and immunity 
the defendants made a jurisdictional argument,which was correctly rejected by the district court.the defendants jurisdictional argument was that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the trial court termination decision was a decision of a massachusetts court and thus is reviewable only by the massachusetts supreme judicial court.
in terminating chmielinski employment,the trial court was acting as an employer,not as a judicial body.chmielinski was an employee of the trial court,not a litigant,and at no time was his employment an issue in an action pending before the trial court.the trial court decision to terminate chmielinski was the result of an administrative proceeding held in its capacity as an employer,and was not the final judgment of a state court in a judicial proceeding.court of appeals feldman,d.therefore,the doctrine,which bars lower federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state courts,does not apply to the state court decision.see rooker fidelity trust.
defendants argument that jurisdiction was inappropriate because the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies in the sense of pursuing a further appeal in the state court system has no merit.the supreme court has made clear that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to filing an action under.patsy bd.of regents,d see also borges col√≥n,cir citing municipality of comerio,cir 
due process 
it is agreed that state law gave chmielinski,a employee of the probation office with certain statutory protections,a protected property interest in his continued employment.see bd.of regents roth,d.he could not be discharged without due process,including a hearing before his termination.see cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.
inapplicability of the doctrine 
the doctrine exists to protect states from needlessly defending the adequacy of state law process when the alleged due process violation results from a deviation from that process.see hudson palmer,d holding that when alleged due process violations stem from random and unauthorized conduct,review is limited solely to the adequacy of the remedies parratt taylor,d,overruled on other grounds by daniels williams,d.in instances of random and unauthorized conduct by state officials,additional safeguards would have little value in preventing an erroneous deprivation of the protected property interest.mard town of amherst,cir.thus,w hen a deprivation of a property interest is occasioned by random and unauthorized conduct by state officials,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that the due process inquiry is limited to the issue of the adequacy of postdeprivation remedies provided by the state.baker,cir quoting lowe scott,cir alteration in original.
before invoking the doctrine,however,courts must give a hard look at allegations that conduct is random and unauthorized.see zinermon burch,d finding that conduct could not be said to be unauthorized when state had delegated broad discretion to state officials,at zinermon requires that courts scrutinize carefully the assertion that state officials conduct is random and unauthorized quoting lowe,at.
chmielinski allegations all concern his january termination hearing,a hearing that was conducted in accordance with a statutory and regulatory scheme.massachusetts general laws,chapter,section grants the commissioner of probation executive control and supervision over the probation service,under the approval and direction of the cjam.the trial court has promulgated regulations pursuant to that statute which allow the commissioner of probation to initiate and impose discipline including discharge on probation officers,trial court policies and procedures,and require that an informal hearing be held before discipline be imposed,id.b.neither the statute nor the regulations set out any procedural requirements,providing only that the hearing be informal.thus,the hearing that chmielinski received can not be characterized as a deviation from the state law it was not random and unauthorized.
adequacy of the termination hearing 
instead,this case is governed by the initial question of whether the termination hearing violated due process.see,molina,cir fagundo,cir mard,at,at.the supreme court made clear in loudermill that when an employee is entitled to some process after termination,the purpose of the termination hearing is solely to serve as an initial check against mistaken,a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.at.it need not be elaborate as long as an employee receives oral or written notice of the charges against him,an explanation of the employer evidence,and an opportunity to present his side of the story.id.
chmielinski does not contest that he received adequate notice here or that he was given an explanation of the employer case.he was first made aware that there were allegations against him a full nine months before the hearing,and he was given the specific details of the allegations four months before the hearing took place.see,at finding less than three weeks notice of hearing sufficient,cir finding months notice sufficient,at,finding notice of hearing given only six days before hearing sufficient when employee had understood nature of allegations against her for the prior three months.chmielinski was aware that the hearing concerned discipline,as he had been suspended,and he appeared at the hearing with counsel and presented evidence on his own behalf.see,at finding that far more than the minimum elements of due process were met when plaintiff was accompanied by counsel at hearing,testified,and had opportunity to present evidence.
rather,chmielinski allegations of procedural due process all concern the adequacy of the hearing he was provided.the standard the defendant must meet here is not high the constitution requires only some pretermination opportunity to respond.loudermill,at.
most of chmielinski allegations are a call to transpose the procedural protections of a court of law into his termination hearing his desire for discovery,his request that the witnesses be sworn and sequestered,and his assertion of various improprieties in the admission and consideration of evidence.these are easily dismissed.the termination hearing is not a court of law,and the same level of process is not required the constitution requires only that chmielinski was provided notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond,a requirement that was clearly met on the facts of this case.t he constitution requires only an initial check against erroneous decisions,not that the state follow best practices,at.
chmielinski argues he had no meaningful opportunity to respond because he was not provided discovery.so long as he had adequate notice,the state was not required to give him discovery.his real claim is that his employer deprived him of the opportunity to do his own investigation to bolster his defense.he argues the letter he received from sicuso ordering him to stay away from the milford district court and to refrain from contacting court employees precluded his attorney from contacting people.
there are several responses.the first is that each of the allegations involved chmielinski own conduct,known to him.from this he could testify and assemble a defense.second,nothing on the face of the letter prevented chmielinski counsel from contacting witnesses.if chmielinski had some doubt about the scope of the prohibition,he should have,but did not,seek clarification before the hearing.
regardless,chmielinski makes an argument that he was unable to respond meaningfully to the charges against him,citing language from a massachusetts supreme judicial court opinion,in re tobin,there is authority for the proposition that an administrative agency must grant discovery to a party in a contested case regardless of whether th
