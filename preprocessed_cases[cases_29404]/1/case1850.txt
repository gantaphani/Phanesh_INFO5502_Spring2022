plaintiffs geoffrey fieger,nancy fisher,and fieger,fieger,kenney and johnson,collectively,plaintiffs appeal the dismissal with prejudice of their action challenging an ongoing grand jury investigation into plaintiffs alleged violation of federal campaign finance laws,challenging the district court decision that the statutory language of the federal election campaign act the act,legislative history,and case law together indicate that the act permits the attorney general to conduct independent investigations into suspected criminal violations of campaign contribution laws without a referral from the federal election commission plaintiffs are not entitled to have a court compel the fec to apply the alleged terms of the act pursuant to apa and plaintiffs are not entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel fec action in the instant case.
background 
geoffrey fieger is a licensed attorney in the state of michigan and president of the law firm fieger,fieger,kenney johnson,pc ffkj.nancy fisher is ffkj office manager.on february,plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants alberto gonzales,united states attorney general,and michael toner,chairman of the federal election commission fec.in count i,plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants acted contrary to the plain language of the act,which they assert bars the attorney general and subordinate agencies from conducting an investigation of alleged violations of the act until the fec has investigated the matter itself and referred the matter to the attorney general by an affirmative vote of four of its members.in count ii,they maintained that the fec failure to comply with the requirements of the act violated the administrative procedure act apa.in count iii,plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus from the district court compelling the fec to perform what plaintiffs assert are its statutorily defined duties pursuant to the act.
the district court held that the plaintiffs could not maintain their causes of action under either the apa,or the federal mandamus statute,a,because they could not show that the fec failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.norton utah wilderness alliance,d emphasis in original.during oral argument,the plaintiffs conceded that they could not maintain either of these two claims.therefore,we need not consider counts ii and iii on appeal.
the federal election campaign act of,as amended,imposes extensive requirements for comprehensive public disclosure of all contributions and expenditures in connection with federal election campaigns.for example,the act places dollar limits on individual campaign contributions,and forbids contributions in the name of another.
the act establishes the federal election commission with six voting members,no more than three of whom may be affiliated with the same political party.a.the fec is empowered to administer,enforce,and interpret the act.b.the fec has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of the act.id.in exercising its civil enforcement power,the fec may issue subpoenas,administer oaths,render advisory opinions regarding compliance with the act,and litigate civil actions through its general counsel.a.
the act specifies that the power of the commission to initiate civil actions shall be the exclusive civil remedy for the enforcement provisions of the act.e.when the fec decides,through an affirmative vote of at least four of its members,that an individual has violated or is about to violate the act,it must notify that person of the factual basis for the alleged violation and conduct an investigation.a.if the fec finds probable cause for the suspected violations,it must attempt,for a period of at least days,to correct or prevent such violation by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion,and to enter into a conciliation agreement with any person involved.a a i.an affirmative vote of at least four members is required to enter into a conciliation agreement,and any agreement reached amounts to a complete bar to any further action by the commission,including the bringing of a civil proceeding.id.
if four or more of the members affirmatively vote that there has been or is about to be a knowing and willful violation of the act criminal provisions,the fec may refer the violation to the attorney general without regard to the act conciliation provisions.a c.the attorney general is then required to report to the commission any action taken regarding the apparent violation at regular intervals until a final disposition of the matter has been reached.c.
in,the fec and the department of justice jointly formulated a memorandum of understanding,which was published in the federal register shortly after its adoption.see.the memorandum provides,in pertinent part 
the department recognizes the federal election commission exclusive jurisdiction in civil matters brought to the commission attention involving violations of the federal election campaign act 
for the most beneficial and effective enforcement of the federal election campaign act those knowing and wilful violations which are significant and substantial and which may be described as aggravated in the intent in which they were committed,or in the monetary amount involved should be referred by the commission to the department for criminal prosecution review 
where the commission discovers or learns of a probable significant and substantial violation,it will endeavor to expeditiously investigate and find whether clear and compelling evidence exists to determine probable cause to believe the violation was knowing and wilful.if the determination of probable cause is made,the commission shall refer the case to the department promptly.
where information comes to the attention of the department indicating a probable violation of title,the department will apprise the commission of such information at the earliest opportunity.
where the department determines that evidence of a probable violation of title amounts to a significant and substantial knowing and wilful violation,the department will continue its investigation to prosecution when appropriate and necessary to its prosecutorial duties and functions,and will endeavor to make available to the commission evidence developed during the course of its investigation subject to restricting law 
where the department determines that evidence of a probable violation of title does not amount to a significant and substantial knowing and wilful violation the department will refer the matter to the commission as promptly as possible for its consideration of the wide range of appropriate remedies available to the commission.
on august,upon plaintiffs motion for declaratory judgment,defendant gonzales motion to dismiss,defendant toner motion for summary judgment,and the plaintiff motion for limited discovery,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint with prejudice.
in doing so,the district court reviewed the act plain language,its legislative history,and prior cases,concluding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a declaratory judgment because the act does not grant the fec exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the criminal provisions of the act.further,the court concluded,the act does not limit,in any way,the attorney general plenary power to enforce the criminal provisions of the act.the district court also concluded that the fec was not subject to review under the apa because courts are limited under the apa to reviewing only those claims of agency action or inaction that are discrete and legally required,and the act does not specify any discrete action the fec is required to take in any particular time frame.see norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d.finally,the district court found that mandamus relief was unavailing,due to the ongoing nature of the grand jury investigation and the discretion accorded to government officials in deciding whether and when to undertake prosecution.the court concluded that the two exceptions to the mandamus rule did not apply.

a.the act does not preclude the attorney general from independently prosecuting violations of federal campaign finance law without a referral from the fec 
the district court correctly concluded that the act neither grants the fec exclusive jurisdiction to enforce criminal provisions of the act nor limits,in any way,the attorney general plenary power to enforce the criminal provisions of the act.plaintiffs insistence that the act does not allow the attorney general to independently prosecute violations of the act without a referral from the fec is without basis or merit.the nature of the criminal investigation procedure established under the act may be conclusively resolved through three independent bases the plain language of the act,the act legislative history and case law from our sister circuits.
the plain language of the act 
the plain language of the act readily resolves the central dispute on appeal a reading of the act does not result in ambiguity or lead to an unreasonable result.chrysler comm r,cir explaining that legislative intent should be divined first and foremost from the plain language of the statute,and if the text is clear,judicial inquiry is complete.
to begin,it is that congress has vested in the attorney general the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the united states government.united states nixon,d citing.accordingly,courts have long recognized that criminal prosecution is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the attorney general.united states palumbo,cir quoting united states dynamics,cir.congress may delegate these prosecutorial functions to another executive agency or office,see case bowles,but to graft such an exception upon the criminal law require s a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will.united states morgan.
turning to the pertinent provisions of the act,we find absent from the statutory text such a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will.id.the relevant provisions of the act read as follows 
the commission shall administer,seek to obtain compliance with,and formulate policy with respect to,this act the commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions.
except as provided in section a of the title,the power of the commission to initiate civil actions under subsection a of this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for the enforcement of the provisions of this act.
while both of these provisions reference the civil enforcement powers of the commission,they are silent with respect to criminal jurisdiction.the fact that congress chose to vest exclusive civil jurisdiction in the commission,while including no such analogous provision regarding criminal jurisdiction,suggests that congress did not intend to attenuate the traditional criminal enforcement powers of the attorney general.
plaintiffs hinge their argument on sections of the act setting forth the referral mechanism by which the fec,upon an affirmative vote,may refer cases to the attorney general for criminal investigation.this procedure is codified in a c which states 
if the commission by an affirmative vote of of its members,determines that there is probable cause to believe that a knowing and willful violation of this act has occurred or is about to occur,it may refer such apparent violation to the attorney general of the united states without regard to any limitations set forth in paragraph a.
in interpreting this referral mechanism,the district court determined that nothing in the language addresses,much less restricts,the authority of the attorney general or a grand jury to investigate activities that might constitute criminal violations of the act.we agree.by its plain terms,this provision concerns only the scope of the fec authority.admittedly,the fec decision to make such a referral imposes upon the attorney general corollary duties of regular monthly reports to the agency until the final disposition of the matter.c.nonetheless,the act contains no explicit language suggesting that this referral process is the sole avenue through which the attorney general may initiate criminal prosecutions.absent a clear and unambiguous expression to situate referrals as the exclusive origin of criminal investigation by the attorney general,this court should not and will not read such a meaning into the statute.
legislative history 
while not a necessary inquiry due to the unambiguous plain language of the act,the legislative history of the act also supports the court decision to affirm the district court decision.see chrysler comm r,at stating that o nly when our reading of a statute results in ambiguity or leads to an unreasonable result,may we look to the legislative history.during the congressional debates prior to the amendment of the act in,congress explicitly considered language that would have mandated approval from the fec prior to the ag undertaking any prosecutorial acts.the original senate bill contained a clause stating 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the commission shall be the primary civil and criminal enforcement agency for violations of provisions of this act any violation of any such provision shall be prosecuted by the attorney general or department of justice personnel only after consultation with,and with the consent of,the commission.
a,d,at sess emphasis added.
in conference,however,this language was excised,and the conference report specifically indicates that t he primary jurisdiction of the fec to enforce the provisions of the act is not intended to interfere with the activities of the attorney general or the department of justice personnel in performing their duties,at sess conf.these changes reflect that congress expressly decided against granting exclusive criminal jurisdiction to the fec.
statements on the congressional floor by drafters of the amendments buttress this conclusion.nlrb fruit vegetable packers warehousemen,d cautioning against relying upon the views of a bill legislative opponents when interpreting a statute and instead looking to the sponsors.for example,senator howard cannon,a primary sponsor of the act,stated that with the creation of the fec and its powers,the department of justice would not be deprived of any of its power to initiate civil or criminal actions in response to referrals by the commission or complaints from other sources.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of cannon.likewise,supporters of the bill in the house expressed similar sentiments.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of hays we allow the fec to go to court independently on civil matters but all criminal matters must still be handled by the justice department.
the amendments to the act also evince congressional intent to retain the attorney general independent prosecutorial powers.a house committee report stated that the amendments would channel to the fec complaints other than complaints directly to the attorney general and seeking the institution of a criminal proceedings,at.similarly,senator cannon expressed his belief that the amendments would grant exclusive civil enforcement
