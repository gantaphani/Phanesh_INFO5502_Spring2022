petitioner albert lloyd higgins petitions for review of a february,decision issued by the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board denying his requests for cancellation of removal under a and a waiver of inadmissibility under h.in order to resolve this appeal,we must determine whether a conviction for witness tampering under connecticut general statutes cgs constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice within the meaning of a s,a definitional section of the immigration and nationality act ina listing the various aggravated felon ies that may disqualify a petitioner from various forms of relief.for the reasons explained herein,we conclude that a conviction under cgs constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice,and we therefore dismiss the petition for review.
background 
albert lloyd higgins higgins or petitioner,a native and citizen of jamaica,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in april.on may,higgins was convicted,following a jury trial,of one count of tampering with a witness in violation of cgs.the conviction stemmed from allegations that higgins sexually assaulted a minor and later instructed her that,if she talked to the police,she should tell them that nothing ever happened.see state higgins.the jury acquitted higgins of the underlying charges,but found him guilty of witness tampering,for which crime higgins was sentenced principally to five years incarceration,execution suspended after one year.id.higgins appealed his conviction,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial because the guilty verdict on the witness tampering charge was inconsistent with the judgment of acquittal on the charges.id.the appellate court of connecticut affirmed higgins conviction in a published decision dated january.id.
in november,higgins applied for admission,and was admitted,to the united states at miami international airport as a returning lawful permanent resident.on march,the department of homeland security served higgins with a notice to appear nta in immigration proceedings,charging him with removability under a a i i as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.on may,higgins submitted a written pleading denying the allegation concerning his criminal conviction and denying he was removable as charged.he also indicated his intent to seek termination of his immigration proceedings,cancellation of removal,adjustment of status and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.in hearings held before an immigration judge ij on june,and september,higgins conceded that his conviction constituted a crime involving moral turpitude,but argued that it did not constitute an aggravated felony.he also indicated his intent to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under h of the ina,u.h.
on september,the ij denied higgins applications for relief and ordered him removed to jamaica.employing the analytical framework set forth by the bia in its precedential decision in re espinoza gonzalez,bia en banc,the ij concluded that higgins conviction under cgs constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice,an aggravated felony rendering higgins ineligible for cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility.higgins appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision on february.like the ij,the bia applied the reasoning of espinoza gonzalez and concluded that a conviction under cgs meets the definition of an offense relating to obstruction of justice.on march,higgins filed a timely petition for review in this court,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
in his petition,higgins argues that his conviction for violating cgs does not constitute an offense relating to obstruction of justice within the meaning of a s,and that he did not in fact obstruct justice as that term is defined under federal law.the attorney general counters that this court should defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of an offense relating to obstruction of justice as set forth in espinoza gonzalez higgins conviction for witness tampering under cgs constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice and higgins may not use this appeal to collaterally attack his conviction.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
under the real id act of,div.b,stat,we lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain drug and aggravated felony offense s.a c.we retain jurisdiction,however,to review the legal question of whether a conviction underlying an order of removal,or the denial of relief from an order of removal,constitutes an aggravated felony.see a d oouch dep t of homeland,cir.the inquiry determines our jurisdiction if the conviction is an aggravated felony,we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction if not,we may exercise jurisdiction and review the petition.oouch,at.accordingly,the jurisdictional issue merges with the merits,and we are therefore required to consider higgins substantive argument that his connecticut conviction is not an aggravated felony under the ina.see mugalli ashcroft,cir.
under the circumstances of this case,it is that we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia as the final agency determination.see mufied mukasey,cir when the bia adopts the decision of the ij and supplements the ij decision or emphasizes particular aspects of it,we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia as the final agency determination.we defer to the factual findings of the bia and the ij if they are supported by substantial evidence,and we review de novo legal conclusions and the application of legal principles to undisputed facts.id.at.
ii.applicable law the ina definition of aggravated felony and our categorical approach 
a conviction for an aggravated felony renders higgins ineligible for both cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility.see a h.the ina defines the term aggravated felony to include,as relevant here,an offense relating to obstruction of justice,perjury or subornation of perjury,or bribery of a witness,for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a s.in this case,there is no question that higgins was convicted of an offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.see united states pacheco,cir construing the phrase for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year to refer to the actual sentence imposed rather than the authorized minimum term.accordingly,if a conviction for witness tampering under cgs constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice,we must dismiss higgins petition.
in order to determine whether a conviction under cgs relat es to obstruction of justice,we apply a categorical approach that looks to the elements of the penal statute rather than the particulars of the alien conduct.oouch,at see also taylor united states,d dickson ashcroft,cir.under this analysis,w e must ask whether every set of facts violating a statute satisfies the criteria for removability,keeping in mind that only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.abimbola ashcroft,cir internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
iii.deference to the bia decision in in re espinoza gonzalez 
the meaning of the phrase relating to obstruction of justice presents a question of first impression in this circuit.the bia,however,has issued a precedential opinion analyzing its meaning.in espinoza gonzalez,the bia considered whether the federal crime of misprision of a constitutes an offense relating to obstruction under section a s of the ina.at.the bia looked to the chapter of the federal criminal code entitled obstruction of justice to guide its interpretation of the phrase,which is not specifically defined in the united states code.id.at.the bia reasoned that,i n general,the obstruction of justice offenses listed in.have as an element interference with the proceedings of a tribunal or require an intent to harm or retaliate against others who cooperate in the process of justice or might otherwise so cooperate.id.at.the bia further reasoned that,by utilizing the term obstruction of justice in the ina,congress intended to limit the types of offenses that potentially could be classified as obstruction of justice offenses for immigration purposes to those analogous to the obstruction of justice offenses listed in the united states code 
congress did not adopt a generic descriptive phrase such as obstructing justice or obstruct justice,but chose instead a term of art utilized in the united states code to designate a specific list of crimes.it employed that term in conjunction with other crimes,perjury and bribery that also are clearly associated with the affirmative obstruction of a proceeding or investigation.we do not believe that every offense that,by its nature,would tend to obstruct justice is an offense that should properly be classified as obstruction of justice.to include all offenses that have a tendency to,or by their nature do,obstruct justice would cast the net too widely.
id.at.further supporting a more narrow interpretation of the phrase,the bia concluded,is the fact that the supreme court has construed the obstruction of justice offenses in a manner that limits their applicability,thereby declining to accord the various offenses the full range of their arguably wide scope.id.at citing united states aguilar,d interpreting,a catchall statute prohibiting influencing or injuring officer or juror generally,to require that the action taken by the accused must be with an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.
guided by these principles and applying the categorical approach,the bia concluded that misprison of a felony does not constitute an offense relating to obstruction of justice because it lacks the critical element of an affirmative and intentional attempt,motivated by a specific intent,to interfere with the process of justice.espinoza gonzalez,at.in other words,the bia concluded that,for a crime to qualify as an offense relating to obstruction of justice,it must include as elements both the actus reus of an active interference with proceedings of a tribunal or investigation,or action or threat of action against those who would cooperate in the process of justice,and the mens rea of a specific intent to interfere with the process of justice.id.at see also renteria morales mukasey,cir.
a threshold question is the appropriate level of deference we should accord the bia interpretation.in general,to the extent that a legal question requires us to construe state or federal criminal laws,we owe no deference to the bia,and our review is de novo.see santos gonzales,cir per curiam mugalli,at w here the bia is interpreting state or federal criminal laws,we must review its decision de novo because the bia is not charged with administration of these laws.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.it is clear,therefore,that we owe no deference to the bia ultimate conclusion that higgins conviction for witness tampering under connecticut law qualifies as an offense relating to obstruction of justice.see mugalli,at deferring to the bia construction of the term attempt as used in the ina,but declining to defer to the bia conclusion that a conviction under a federal criminal statute necessarily constituted an attempt as the bia had defined it.
a more difficult question,however,is whether we owe deference to the bia interpretation of the ina key phrase,relating to obstruction of justice.in general,pursuant to chevron natural resources defense council,d,reviewing courts are required to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers when the intent of congress is unclear and the agency determination is reasonable.sui ins,cir.to determine whether deference is appropriate,we conduct the familiar chevron analysis 
at chevron step one,we consider de novo whether congress has clearly spoken to the question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.to ascertain congress intent,we begin with the statutory text because if its language is unambiguous,no further inquiry is necessary if the statutory language is ambiguous,however,we resort first to canons of statutory construction,and,if the statutory meaning remains ambiguous,to legislative history,to see if these interpretive clues clearly reveal congress intent.
if we determine that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,we proceed to chevron step two,which instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute,so long as it is reasonable.while unpublished bia decisions do not constitute agency interpretations of law warranting chevron deference,where,as in this case,the challenged unpublished decision relies on a binding published decision,chevron deference will extend to that earlier decision reasonable resolution of statutory ambiguity.

there is a circuit split on the question of whether deference is owed to the bia reasoning in espinoza gonzalez.on the one hand,the fifth and ninth circuits have both concluded that deference is warranted.in alwan ashcroft,cir,the fifth circuit held that a conviction for contempt of court in violation of constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice.id.at.in so holding,the fifth circuit concluded that it was obliged to accord chevron deference to the bia and therefore reviewed its decision only to determine whether it represented a permissible construction of the language of the ina.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,in renteria morales mukasey,cir,the ninth circuit concluded that b ecause a is part of the ina,we must defer to the bia articulation of the generic federal definition if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue before the agency and the bia interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.determining that the ina does not define the phrase offense relating to obstruction of justice,the ninth circuit deferred to the bia decision in espinoza gonzalez and,employing the bia reasoning in that case,concluded that a conviction for failure to appear under is categorically an offense relating to obstruction of justice under section a s id.at.
the third circuit,however,has declined to defer to the bia reasoning.in denis att y of,cir,the third circuit considered whether petitioner conviction for tampering with physical evidence in violation of new york penal law nypl constitutes a crime relating to obstruction of justice.id.at.in answering this question in the affirmative,the third circuit reasoned that interpreting the phrase relating to obstruction of justice does not present an obscure ambiguity or a matter committed to agency discretion,but rather requires courts to construe two discrete phrases relating to and obstruction of justice both of which are capable of definition.id.at.with respect to the latter,the third circuit concluded that courts can easily determine the types of conduct congress intended the phrase to encompass by referring to the obstruction of justice offenses listed under title of the united states code.id.indeed,the third circuit reasoned that construction of the criminal provisions in title is a task outside the bia special competence and congressional delegation,while it is very much a part of this court competence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.further,the third circuit noted that it had previously discussed the meaning of the phrase relating to in section a of title,of the ina,observing that the phrase is to be read expansively and must not be strictly confined to its narrowest meaning.id.quoting drakes zimski,cir.accordingly,the third circuit concluded that it owed no deference to the bia reasoning and proceeded to review the issue de novo.having done so,the third circuit arrived at a far broader interpretation of the phrase relating to obstruction of justice than the one formulated by the bia,concluding that it would be appropriate to survey the i
