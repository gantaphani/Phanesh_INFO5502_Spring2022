opinion of the court 
helen mining petitions this court to review the united states department of labor benefits review board decision that affirmed an award of disability benefits under the black lung benefits act,to miner john obush.helen mining asserts that obush claim is and that the award is not supported by substantial evidence.we will deny the petition for review.
john obush worked in the mines for years,retiring in at age.helen mining employed obush from to.he worked last as a shuttle car operator.on july,before retiring,obush filed a claim for black lung benefits.in support of claim,phillip turco opined that obush had coal worker pneumoconiosis from exposure to coal dust during his employment in the mines that resulted in permanent disability.on may,however,administrative law judge gerald tierney denied the claim,pursuant to a l,discrediting turco medical opinion and relying upon two doctors with qualifications superior to turco who attributed obush pulmonary impairment to smoking.obush did not contest this decision.
obush filed a subsequent claim for black lung benefits on january,five doctors examined obush his medical records in connection with this claim.three doctors opined that obush had a severe respiratory impairment causing total disability arising from exposure to coal dust of the remaining two doctors,one opined that he could neither find nor rule out that obush severe respiratory impairment was due to his exposure to coal dust.the last doctor opined that there was no evidence of either clinical pneumoconiosis or legal pneumoconiosis 
helen mining conceded that obush has a totally disabling respiratory impairment and that his condition changed since the denial of his prior claim,but asserted his claim was based upon the prior denial of benefits.alj thomas burke issued a decision on may.he determined that the claim was not,holding that the statute of limitations does not apply to claims subsequent to the initial claim.he then concluded that,although the did not evince pneumoconiosis,the weight of medical opinion evidence supported a determination of legal pneumoconiosis.alj burke awarded benefits.
although the board affirmed the award of benefits,it concluded that the claim was not for reasons different from those of alj burke.the board held that the statute of limitations applies to all claims initial and subsequent,but concluded that turco finding of pneumoconiosis,which was the basis of obush claim,was legally insufficient to trigger the statute of limitations as to the present case because alj tierney discredited turco finding and denied the claim.
helen mining now petitions this court to review the decision of the benefits review board,arguing that the claim was and,in the alternative,that substantial evidence does not support an award of benefits.we will deny the petition.
we first address the statute of limitations,which reads as follows 
any claim for benefits by a miner under this section shall be filed within three years after whichever of the following occurs later a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.
f emphasis added.the implementing regulation states the following 
a a claim for benefits filed under this part by,or on behalf of,a miner shall be filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis which has been communicated to the miner or a person responsible for the care of the miner,or within three years after the date of enactment of the black lung benefits reform act of,whichever is later.there is no time limit on the filing of a claim by the survivor of a miner.
emphasis added.at issue is whether the phrase a medical determination of medical disability due to pneumoconiosis a phrase that is not defined in either the statute or the regulation mandates a conclusion that obush claim is.
the board,relying upon the reasoning of three courts of appeals,held that a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis predating a prior,final denial of benefits is deemed a misdiagnosis and thus,can not trigger the statute of limitations for filing a subsequent claim.helen mining,ben.bd.june,see arch of kentucky,director,officer of workers compensation programs,cir consolidated coal williams,cir wyoming fuel director,office of workers compensation programs,cir.upon this basis,the board decided that obush claim was not.we are persuaded by the analyses of these courts of appeals and agree with the board conclusion that the statute of limitations does not bar obush claim.
though the issue is one of first impression,we have already addressed a related issue with respect to black lung benefit claims,and so we begin there.in labelle processing swarrow,the employer asserted based upon the denial of the miner initial claim that res judicata barred an award of benefits on the subsequent claim.cir.noting that a subsequent claim must be grounded in evidence of a material change in the miner condition,we held that new facts,events occurring after the events giving rise to the earlier claim may give rise to a new claim,which is not precluded by the earlier judgment.id.at.we then concluded that 
although it is true that swarrow is now precluded from collaterally attacking the prior denial of benefits,swarrow may file a new claim,asserting that he is now eligible for benefits because he has become totally disabled due to coal miner pneumoconiosis and that his disability occurred subsequent to the prior adjudication.
id.by the same reasoning,because we are required to respect the factual findings and legal conclusions in earlier adjudicated claims,we must accept an alj conclusion that a medical opinion offered in support of that claim is discredited.on this basis,we regard such a medical opinion as a misdiagnosis.see arch of kentucky,at.
helen mining argues that construing section in a manner that is consistent with arch of kentucky is contrary to the plain language of the statute and contravenes congressional intent.quoting united states kubrick,helen mining states that i t goes without saying that statutes of limitations often make it impossible to enforce what were otherwise perfectly valid claims,d.however,as acknowledged in kubrick,statutes of limitations must be given effect in a manner that is consistent with legislative intent.id.
the courts have repeatedly recognized that the remedial nature of the statute requires a liberal construction of the black lung entitlement program to ensure widespread benefits to miners and their dependents.keating director,office of workers compensation programs,cir.consequently,the act must be applied in a manner which assures compensation to every miner who suffers from any of the several lung impairments covered by the black lung benefits act.pavesi director,office of workers compensation programs,cir.as the court of appeals for the sixth circuit has stated,the act must be read to include the largest numbers of miners as benefit recipients.peabody coal hill,cir.
moreover,with regard to the implementing regulations,states that f or purposes of this definition,pneumoconiosis is recognized as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.helen mining cites a decision of the court of appeals for the district of columbia for the proposition that pneumoconiosis can not be properly characterized as latent and progressive.see national mining association department of labor.however,helen mining misreads the decision.see midland coal director,office of workers compensation programs,cir moreover,this regulation provides solid support for reading the statute of limitations in an expansive manner to ensure that any miner who has been afflicted with the disease,including its progressive form,is given every opportunity to prove he is entitled to benefits.
finally,a restrictive interpretation of the statute of limitations,as suggested by helen mining,would be in tension with the regulation that enables miners to file subsequent claims.see d the very fact that successive claims are permitted on evidence of material changes to the health of a mine
