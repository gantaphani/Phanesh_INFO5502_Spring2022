this appeal stems from the interior board of land appeals ibla or board determination that the west virginia highlands conservancy wvhc was not eligible for attorneys fees after prosecuting an administrative appeal to the ibla.in the administrative appeal wvhc had challenged a decision of the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm that rejected a citizen complaint filed by wvhc with the agency.the appeal resulted in an ibla remand order directing osm to perform certain regulatory duties,including an investigation into whether it was required to reassert regulatory jurisdiction over a particular surface mining reclamation site pursuant to the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra,et.after the ibla denied wvhc petition for attorneys fees in connection with the appeal,wvhc sought review of the denial in district court.the district court granted summary judgment to wvhc,holding that wvhc was eligible for an award of fees under smcra provision.we affirm.
a person adversely affected by a surface mining operation may file a citizen complaint with osm when he believes a smcra violation is occurring at the mining site.h.if osm has reason to believe there is a violation,the agency issues to the appropriate state regulatory authority what is known as a notice.id.a b ii b.if ten days pass and the state fails to take appropriate action to cause the violation to be corrected or to show good cause for such failure,osm conducts its own inspection.a b ii b.
on may,wvhc filed a citizen complaint with osm alleging that a reclaimed larosa fuel company larosa surface mining site,which had been authorized by a west virginia permit,was violating effluent standards for acid mine drainage.iron levels were too high and ph levels too low,according to wvhc.osm filed a notice with the state regulatory authority,the west virginia department of environmental protection dep.the dep declined to take any action to investigate or remedy the alleged smcra violation.in a letter to osm,the dep explained that it no longer had regulatory jurisdiction over the larosa site as of october,the state agency had terminated jurisdiction over the site when it released the performance bond covering reclamation work,which had been completed.the dep further reported to osm that the release of the bond was not based on fraud,collusion,or misrepresentation of a material fact.highlands conservancy,may,hereinafter wvhc see also d.accordingly,the dep declined to reassert jurisdiction over the larosa site or to otherwise take any action with respect to the violations alleged in wvhc citizen complaint.
osm rejected the dep explanation,concluding that the state agency had failed to take appropriate action.according to osm the s tate decision to release larosa performance bond does not affect the state responsibility to take enforcement action against larosa for its continued failure to meet applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards.wvhc,at.osm,relying on the decision of an administrative law judge alj in an unrelated larosa case,concluded that osm regulatory jurisdiction over a mining site did not terminate upon the state release of a reclamation bond.see id.osm therefore undertook its own investigation of the allegations in wvhc citizen complaint.
osm inspected the larosa site on november.smcra implementing regulations establish effluent limitations for acid mine drainage,including maximum allowable daily levels and average monthly levels for ph and iron.a.osm sampled ph and iron levels at four locations at the larosa site.the samples showed ph levels within the effluent limitations required by the regulations.but one of the three iron samples showed milligrams per liter of iron,which is above the average monthly limitation of milligrams per liter even though it is within the maximum daily limit of milligrams per liter.a wvhc,at.osm declined to take any further action on the citizen complaint,however.wvhc,at.in its decision issued may,osm explained that 
the requested actions raise significant issues with respect to the agency implementation of the clean water act osm is deferring action at this time on these issues to allow an opportunity for policy review and outreach.the outreach concerning enforcement of the clean water act requirements had been initiated with the intent of reaching final agency positions regarding these policies within an period thus,it would be premature for the field office to go forward in the manner that you have requested until this process has been completed.
wvhc appealed osm decision to the ibla,arguing principally that osm had erred in failing to take additional iron samples in order to calculate monthly average iron levels.id.at.in its opinion the ibla indicated that it was inclined to agree with wvhc that the pendency of a request for programmatic relief does not excuse osm from acting independently on inspection requests.id.at.the board,however,concentrated on a different issue the question of whether osm had jurisdiction over the larosa site.id.after osm may,decision to take no further action on wvhc citizen complaint,but before wvhc appeal of that decision to the ibla,the board reversed the alj determination in the unrelated larosa case that osm regulatory jurisdiction continued despite the full release of a performance bond by a state regulatory authority.id.at citing larosa fuel,osm.in reversing the alj in larosa fuel,the ibla held that the state is granted exclusive jurisdiction upon approval of a state regulatory program to determine when reclamation under the initial regulatory program has been completed.id.at.according to the ibla,west virginia written finding in a bond release that a mining operation complied with all state rules and regulations terminates both the state jurisdiction and osm oversight jurisdiction regardless of whether osm agrees with the finding.id.the ibla noted one exception to this rule osm must exercise jurisdiction if it finds that the written determination was based on fraud,collusion,or misrepresentation of a material fact.id.at quoting larosa fuel,at see also d.
the ibla larosa fuel decision prompted the board to raise,on its own initiative,the question of osm jurisdiction to entertain wvhc citizen complaint.the board explained that osm would lack jurisdiction to take further action if reclamation requirements at the larosa site had been successfully completed,the state had fully released the performance bond,and there was no basis for osm to reassert jurisdiction.wvhc,at.the board concluded,however,that the record before it was not sufficient to establish that jurisdiction had terminated.id.specifically,the board noted that osm had not addressed the west virginia dep failure to include,in its response to the notice,a copy of any written determination by the agency that the larosa operation had successfully completed the applicable reclamation requirements for the site.furthermore,osm had failed to ascertain whether the dep had any evidence of water quality to support its claim that there was no significant difference in pre and water qualities.that evaluation would be relevant,the board said,in determining whether the state agency formal termination of jurisdiction was based on a misrepresentation of a material fact,which would require osm to reassert jurisdiction.id.at.the ibla therefore set aside osm decision to take no further action and remanded for the agency to fulfill its obligation to determine whether jurisdiction terminated under d i and whether or not a basis for reasserting jurisdiction has been established under d.id.at.
the ibla remand decision prompted wvhc to file a petition with the board seeking its reasonable costs and expenses,including attorneys fees,from osm pursuant to smcra.see e.under the applicable regulations,fees are available to a participant in a proceeding under smcra who prevails in whole or in part,achieving at least some degree of success on the merits the eligibility requirement,and who makes a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues the entitlement requirement.b see also.highlands conservancy norton,cir herein
