diana del grosso,et petitioners petitioned the surface transportation board board for a declaratory order that state and local regulations of a facility owned by grafton upton railroad company g u were not preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,pub,stat.the board held that state and local regulations were preempted because the facility was part of transportation by rail carrier.a.we affirm the board decision that the facility was operated by a rail carrier.but because the board relied on an erroneous standard in concluding that the activities at the facility were a part of transportation,we vacate and remand.
under the iccta,the board has jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier.id.where the board has such jurisdiction,it is exclusive.whether or not the board is exercising its regulatory authority over the transportation,state and laws governing such transportation are generally preempted.see id.b t he remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.norfolk ry.city of alexandria,cir green mountain vermont,cir city of auburn gov t,cir see also borough of riverdale petition for declaratory order,stb finance docket,wl,at,preemption even where rail construction project outside board regulatory authority.such preemption is not limited to state and local economic regulation of rail transportation.see susquehanna ry.jackson,cir green mountain,at city of auburn,at.but see.coast ry.city of palm beach,cir.
in order for an activity to count as transportation by rail carrier,it has to be both transportation and operated by a rail carrier.cent.bus.lines city of midlothian,cir.transportation is a broad category that includes any property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment connected to movement by rail,as well as various services related to that movement.a b.whether an activity is conducted by a rail carrier is a factual determination based on,inter alia,how much control a rail carrier is exercising over the activity.see,at internal quotation marks,citations omitted.the board routinely grants declaratory orders as to whether particular activities are preempted,but the iccta does not delegate to the board the determination of whether state and local law is preempted.see b.
here,g u is a licensed rail carrier that began operations in.it owns a railroad line that extends from north grafton,massachusetts,to milford,massachusetts.upton is a town located between grafton and milford.in,g u decided to expand its rail yard in upton and develop it into a transloading facility.as a part of that plan,g u undertook to build a wood pellet facility that would receive wood pellets in bulk from hopper railcars and transfer them,after some processing and bagging,onto trucks.g u also entered into a terminal transloading agreement with grafton upton railcare llc gu railcare,a part of dana companies,a group of companies with extensive experience in transloading bulk materials.gu railcare was neither owned nor operated by g gu railcare was to operate the transloading services on behalf of g 
by the fall of,g u finished the wood pellet facility.at the facility,a vacuum hose is attached to hopper railcars carrying wood pellets in bulk and sucks the pellets through a system that removes dust from the pellets.the pellets are then moved to silos for temporary storage.additional dust is then removed from the pellets,and the pellets are conveyed from the silos,placed in bags,and stacked onto pallets,fifty bags to a pallet.the pallets are then and stored until they are loaded into trucks for final delivery to retail stores.
the upton board of selectmen concluded that the activities at the facility were preempted by the iccta,b,and did not seek to regulate them.however,on august,petitioners,who live near the facility,sought a declaratory order from the board that the wood pellet activities were not part of transportation by rail carrier under b and that state and local regulations were therefore not preempted.petitioners complained that the transloading operations caused them harms such as exposure to excess glare,light intrusion,noise,and diminution of property values,and that such harms would be prevented by enforcement of upton zoning,which,for example,restrict a building height and require special permits for manufacturing facilities,which permits could limit noise and storage.see,town of upton zoning by law,table c height restrictions id.table a special permit requirements.the petitioners mounted a attack on the railroad claim of preemption.first,they argued that the wood pellet transloading operations were not transportation under the iccta because they were manufacturing activities.second,they argued that gu railcare was not a rail carrier under the statute.
with respect to the second issue,petitioners requested discovery of documents regarding the construction,financing,operation,management,and ownership of the facility in order to determine the real relationship between g u,gu railcare,and dana companies.on january,the board initiated a declaratory order proceeding but denied the discovery request by petitioners,noting that petitioners had access to g u transloading agreement with gu railcare and its lease agreement for the rail yard,and that g u had also not explained why discovery or additional documents were needed.
on february,petitioners requested reconsideration of the board denial of discovery.petitioners argued mainly that there was new evidence that raises significant questions regarding g u.the evidence was that g u was involved in a separate litigation with the town of grafton,massachusetts,over a proposed propane transloading facility and that evidence as to the relationship between g u and the operator of the other facility could shed light on the relationship between g u and the dana companies.on may,the board denied reconsideration.it concluded that the various agreements already submitted were sufficient to determine the issue of whether the activities were being conducted by a rail carrier,noting that the board is guided on that issue by the terms of the agreements between the railroad and the transloader.it also concluded that the relationship between g u and a third party involving a different transloading facility was not relevant.
on december,the board issued a declaratory order.after concluding that the petitioner had standing to raise the preemption issue,the order declared that the board had exclusive jurisdiction over the transloading activities in g u facility because they constituted transportation by rail carrier.the board concluded that the vacuuming,screening,bagging,and palletizing of the wood pellets were transportation and not manufacturing because,although those activities were not essential to transporting wood pellets by rail,they facilitate d such transportation by making it more efficient.this was so because the activities allowed g u to transport the pellets by hopper cars rather than boxcars.the board also distinguished the activities in question from manufacturing and commercial transactions because they did not change the nature of the product,even though some of the activities,such as bagging,may produce some value to the consumer.the board also determined that gu railcare was acting on behalf of g u in performing the transloading activities,and so a rail carrier was doing the transporting.it finally determined that gu railcare was not a sham set up simply to avoid state and local regulations.
the petitioners sought judicial review.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.under the administrative procedure act apa,we will not set aside the board determinations unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or are unsupported by substantial evidence.see.the apa requires the agency to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,quoting burlington truck lines,united states,see also granite state concrete surfa
