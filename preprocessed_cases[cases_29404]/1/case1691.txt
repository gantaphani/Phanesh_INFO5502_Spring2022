javier otoniel petitioner seeks review of the board of immigration appeal bia dismissal of his appeal from an immigration judge ij order of removal.petitioner challenge to the bia decision is based on a former version of a,under which petitioner claims to have automatically derived citizenship when his mother became a naturalized citizen in.prior to its amendment in,a granted derivative citizenship to a child born outside the united states to alien parents if,before that child eighteenth birthday,he became a legal permanent resident lpr of the united states,his two living parents legal ly separat ed,one but not both of his parents became a naturalized citizen,and that naturalized parent had legal custody of the child we are concerned today with only the last of these conditions we must construe a legal custody requirement to determine whether a child seeking derivative naturalization must have been under the sole as distinguished from joint legal custody of his one naturalized parent.this is a question of first impression in this circuit,and,because we answer it in the affirmative and perceive no merit in any of petitioner other arguments,we deny his petition for review.
facts and proceedings 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.born in mexico in to mexican nationals,petitioner immigrated here with them in.all three became lprs of this country that same year.in,petitioner parents divorced in california.their divorce decree awarded his mother sole physical custody of petitioner,but awarded both his parents joint legal custody.following his parents divorce,petitioner resided exclusively with his mother.by virtue of his parents joint legal custody,however,petitioner father retained visitation rights in,while petitioner was still a minor under the age of,his mother became a naturalized citizen of the united states.his father never did.
petitioner tenure in the united states has not been without legal mishaps.in,he was convicted in a texas state court of assault causing bodily injury to a family member.in,a texas court again convicted him of assault crimes,this time of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and assault resulting in a bodily injury,repeat offender.these latter convictions led not only to a sentence of ten years imprisonment,but also to the initiation of removal proceedings by the department of homeland security dhs in august.
in those immigration proceedings,dhs asserted two bases for petitioner removal he had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude and not arising out of a single scheme of criminal and he had been convicted of an aggravated felony petitioner admitted his convictions but defended against removal by arguing that the ij lacked jurisdiction to order petitioner removed because he is a citizen.his citizenship,petitioner insisted,flowed from his meeting the requirements for derivative citizenship under the version of a,which automatically granted derivative citizenship to specified classes of children born outside of the united states to alien parents before the ij,petitioner contended that he satisfied a requirements because,at the time of his mother naturalization,he was under the age of,under her legal custody,and residing in the united states as a lpr.
petitioner appears to have recognized a possible problem with his claim to derivative citizenship,however.as noted earlier,his parents divorce decree had granted them joint legal custody it did not grant his mother sole legal custody.thus,when petitioner mother was naturalized in,his father was a legal custodian as well,sharing some parental rights with his.
in the initiation of petitioner removal proceedings at a time when he was years mother sought to eliminate this problem by having his legal custody status changed retroactively.at her request,and without any objection from petitioner father,a california court issued a nunc pro tunc amended divorce decree amended decree which purported to award petitioner mother sole legal custody retroactively effective to february.in support of his mother request for the amended decree,her lawyer filed a declaration candidly stating that t he purpose for seeking the order was to satisfy requirements of the department of immigration and naturalization in regards to petitioner.in other words,petitioner mother expressly sought the amended decree for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome of her major son removal proceeding.
faced with the amended decree,the ij concluded that petitioner met the requirements for derivative citizenship under a.reasoning that dhs had not carried its burden of proving that petitioner was an alien,the ij terminated the removal proceedings.
dhs appealed the ij decision to the bia,which,in october,reversed in favor of dhs.the bia interpreted a as requiring that a lpr with two living parents,only one of whom is a naturalized citizen,does not automatically derive citizenship from his naturalized parent unless that parent had sole legal custody over the lpr prior to his eighteenth birthday.because petitioner mother had not been his sole legal custodial parent before his eighteenth birthday,the bia sustained dhs appeal.in so doing,the bia refused to credit the retroactive effect of the california court amended decree for purposes of removal.
the bia viewed the amended decree as nothing more than a legal fiction created for the express purpose of manipulating federal immigration and naturalization law.to allow courts to circumvent the clear language of the naturalization requirements is contrary to public policy and decades of supreme court jurisprudence requiring strict compliance with statutory requirements to obtain citizenship.the bia remanded the case to the ij with instructions to order petitioner removed,and the ij did so on remand.
petitioner appealed the ij removal order to the bia,arguing that by ignoring the amended decree,the bia overstepped its legal authority violated the full faith and credit and violated the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.in march,the bia rejected each of these arguments for the reasons stated in its october decision petitioner then filed the instant petition for review 
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
as a general rule,we have jurisdiction to review the bia removal orders congress created an exception,however,that deprives us of jurisdiction to review removal orders issued against aliens convicted of,inter alia,an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude congress has curtailed this jurisdiction strip,though,by making clear that we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review filed by a criminal alien all four of petitioner claims fall within one or the other of these two categories three of his arguments are and the fourth is constitutional we thus have jurisdiction to review each of them,even if it turns out that petitioner is indeed an alien.
citizenship status under a 
standard of review 
we review each of petitioner claims de novo.under the plain words of b a,we are empowered to decide a putative citizen nationality claim if we find from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about his nationality is presented.we agree with the parties that this case presents no material fact issues,so our review of the three legal arguments and one constitutional argument that comprise petitioner claim to citizenship is de novo 
that our review is de novo does not,however,answer whether we must defer to the bia interpretation of a.usually,the bia reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous provision of the ina which,in general,it administers is entitled to chevron deference but chevron deference will apply here only if congress has delegated authority to the bia to clarify a statutory ambiguity if congress has not done so,then we are not required to defer to the bia interpretation.
there is disagreement among the circuits as to whether the bia interpretation of a is entitled to chevron deference.the ninth circuit insists that it is not,reasoning that congress has delegated responsibility for deciding nationality claims to the federal courts that circuit makes the point that b a and b expressly provide that the federal courts shall decide a nationality claim presented in a petition for review.the second circuit appears to be unconvinced.it recently accorded chevron deference to the bia interpretation of a,albeit without ever questioning whether such deference was warranted 
we have not weighed in on this precise issue,and neither party has briefed it.in nehme ins,however,we addressed a very similar issue and held that the bia interpretation of a is not entitled to chevron deference nehme was decided in the context of determining whether we had jurisdiction to review a removal order issued against a criminal alien as we stated there,the question whether we have jurisdiction in a particular case is subject to plenary review.in other words,we interpret statutes that operate to deprive us of jurisdiction de novo,without regard to an administrative agencies preferred interpretation of the statute 
nehme holding,however,does not control our interpretation of a.after all,our inquiry today is not jurisdictional it was after we decided nehme that congress amended the judicial review provisions of the ina to clarify that we retain jurisdiction over constitutional and legal claims made by a criminal alien in a petition for review at the time that we decided nehme,the ina merely deprived us of jurisdiction to entertain petitions for review filed by specific of criminal aliens.the question whether the petitioner in nehme was in fact an alien went straight to our jurisdiction if he was,we did not have jurisdiction if he was not,we did.here,in contrast,a d grants us jurisdiction to hear petitioner legal and constitutional claims,regardless of whether he is an alien.nehme holding that we must interpret a de novo to determine our jurisdiction is thus not controlling.
for today purposes,however,the question of chevron applicability is beside the point as we agree with the bia interpretation of a,our conclusion in this case would be the same whether we were to interpret the statute de novo or,instead,within chevron framework.if we were operating under chevron,we would defer to the bia interpretation of a as reasonable and when we interpret the statute de novo,we reach the same conclusion as did the bia.as we thus would affirm the bia interpretation as the appropriate one under either standard of review,we need not determine whether the bia interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.
claim to citizenship 
there are two sources of citizenship,and two only birth and naturalization.as petitioner was not born in the united states,naturalization is his sole source for a claim of citizenship.naturalization is available only as provided by acts of congress and,even then,only in strict compliance with the terms of such acts petitioner has the burden of proving that he qualifies for naturalization,and he must do so in the face of the supreme court mandate that we resolve all doubts in favor of the united states and against those seeking citizenship 
in his claim to derivative naturalization,petitioner contends that he automatically became a citizen in when his mother was naturalized.his argument tracks the version of a that was in effect in.it granted derivative citizenship to 
child ren born outside of the united states to alien parents upon fulfillment of,inter alia,the following conditions 
the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents and if 
s uch naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
s uch child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the custodial parent naturalization 
none dispute that petitioner satisfies all but one of these conditions he was born outside of the united states to alien parents his parents divorce which occurred while he was under the age of qualifies as a legal separation his mother was naturalized while he was under the age of and at the time of his mother naturalization,petitioner was residing in the united states as a lpr.thus,petitioner status as a derivatively naturalized citizen turns entirely on a fifth condition,whether,before he reached the age of,his parents joint custody regime satisfied a requirement that the naturalized parent be the parent having legal custody.
this case,then,is one of federal statutory interpretation.we must construe the one of a express conditions that requires the parent having legal custody of the child to have been naturalized and determine whether this condition requires that parent to have had sole,as opposed to joint,legal custody.this issue is one of first impression,not only in this circuit but also,it appears,in all of the federal circuits in the end,we hold that only sole legal custody satisfies a.two factors lead us to this conclusion the text of a and its relation to the overall scheme of the ina and a purpose,as demonstrated by its legislative history.as petitioner can not meet his burden of proving that he was in the sole legal custody of his naturalized mother prior to his eighteenth birthday,he can not obtain derivative citizenship.we must,therefore,deny his petition for review.
obtaining derivative citizenship under a 
we start with the statute text.as earlier explained,a grants derivative citizenship to a child born outside of the united states to alien parents only if,inter alia,the parent having legal custody of the child has been naturalized.to determine whether these words require sole legal custody,we must construe the entire phrase.
petitioner would have us frame the issue more narrowly,restricting our interpretation to but two words of this phrase,legal custody.indeed,petitioner core reading legal custody to require sole legal custody would be to amend a have more force if legal custody were indeed the only words that we must construe.but the words legal custody do not stand alone in a rather,they immediately follow,and must be read in pari materia with,the whole descriptive phrase,which begins with and includes the parent having.stated another way,the parent having legal custody can not be parsed to consider,in a vacuum,just the parent or legal custody.the who is the parent but,being singular,more must be known,whether the parent in question is the one with legal custody.the words the parent are thus modified by the words having legal custody.only together do these words describe who must have the legal custody of a child if that child is to derive citizenship.
as noted,congress chose to identify which progenitor must have legal custody by using the singular form of parent a child derives citizenship under a only if the parent having legal custody of the child was himself or herself naturalized congress use of the singular form is telling.it leaves no room to dispute that,when only one of two legally separated parents is a naturalized citizen,that parent is the one who must have legal custody.had congress meant that a requirements could be met when two legally separated parents shared joint legal custody of a child and only one of those two parents was naturalized,it could have used more inclusive language to signify as much.for example,congress could easily have specified the parent or parents having legal custody of the child.
not surprisingly,congress has used just such more inclusive language in other parts of the ina where the term legal custody is employed.for example,b c defines child as used in specified portions of the ina to include,among others,a child legitimated under the law of the child residence or domicile,if such legitimation takes place before the child reaches the age of eighteen years and the child is in the legal custody of the legitimating parent or parents at the time of such legitimation.and,in b e i,congress defined child to include a child adopted while under the age of sixteen years if the child has been in the legal custody of,and has resided with,the adopting parent or parents for at least two years.finally,c,which also defines child but for other portions of the ina,requires that the child be in the legal custody of the legitimating or adopting parent or parents.
by their plain language,these three ina provisions are expressly satisfied either if one of two parents has sole legal custody or if the two parents share joint legal custody.congress use of parent or parents in these provisions contrasts sharply with its exclusive use of the singular form of parent in a.we can not ignore this distinction between different provisions in the same statute without violating a canon of statutory construction we must read the statute as a whole,so as to give effect to each of its provisions without rendering any language superfluous were we to read a use of the parent singular as also permitting joint legal custody,we would effectively read the words or parents out of b and c definitions of child.this we may will.given congress use of parent or parents in b and c,we are confident that,had congress intended a to be satisfied by either sole or joint legal custody,it would have used the same words or at least very similar ones.that it did not do so confirms to us that joint legal custody does not meet a requirements.only sole legal custody will suffice.
as demonstrated by its legislative history,a purpose bolsters our conclusion that the statute requires sole legal custody.congress enacted the provision to ensure that only those alien children whose real interests were located in america with their custodial parent singular,and not abroad,should be automatically naturalized.this provision was adopted to promote marital and family harmony and prevent the child from being separated from an alien parent who has a legal right to custody.in other words,congress meant for a to protect the rights of both parents for as long as each one of them has legal rights over the child.this is why,when we were asked in nehme to determine whether an informal separation of a married couple satisfied a legal separation requirement,we answered in the negative 
it makes sense that when the child parents are still married,the child does not automatically acquire a new citizenship upon the naturalization of only one parent w e think congress clearly intended that the naturalization of only one parent would result in the automatic naturalization of an alien child only when there has been a formal,judicial alteration of the marital relationship 
after all,only when there has been a formal alteration of the marital relationship could the federal courts be confident that the,parent truly has no rights over the child 
other circuits have also interpreted a as serving the purpose of protecting parental rights.the ninth circuit,for example,views a as a measure meant to prevent the naturalizing parent from usurping the parental rights of the alien parent.and,in dicta,the seventh circuit reasoned that a protects parents rights by limit ing automatic changes in citizenship to situations in which the other parent has been removed from the by death or by legal separation.a legally separated parent with joint legal as petitioner not been removed from the picture to such a degree that he has no legal rights over his child.thus,the naturalization of such a parent should not lead to an automatic change in his child citizenship.that kind of change could seriously interfere with the parent rights,and thereby undermine a purpose.
in addition,interpreting a as amenable to being satisfied by a decree of joint legal custody would lead to an absurd result not recognizing derivative citizenship when an alien child parents are married and only one parent is naturalized while recognizing derivative citizenship when an alien child parents are legally separated,continue to share legal custody and thus legal rights over the child,and only one parent is naturalized.inasmuch as,in each example,both parents share rights over the child,we can conceive of no petitioner has furnished us congress would grant derivative citizenship to the child of the legally separated parents but not to the child of the married parents.we decline petitioner invitation to read a in a way that reaches such an incongruous result.we hold instead that a requirement that the parent having legal custody of the child be a naturalized citizen of the united states is satisfied only when but one of two living and legally separated parents is a naturalized citizen and that parent is vested with the sole legal custody of the child.
whether,prior to his eighteenth birthday,was in the sole legal custody of his mother 
petitioner concedes that the divorce decree granted his parents joint legal custody.this decree is the only evidence in the record relevant to his custodial status prior to his eighteenth birthday.in the absence of evidence contradicting the divorce decree,we must conclude that petitioner did not derive citizenship ipso facto at the time of his mother subsequent naturalization in.
petitioner nevertheless advances three arguments to support his derivative citizenship claim.first,he contends that he automatically derived citizenship under a when his mother was naturalized because,even if we disregard the original divorce decree plain language and meaning under california law,he was,for purposes of federal immigration law,effectively in the sole legal custody of his mother prior to his eighteenth birthday.second,petitioner insists that under the full faith and credit act we must apply the amended decree to his naturalization claim under a.he notes that the amended decree retroactively grants his mother sole legal custody as of the date of the original judgment of divorce,which was rendered before his eighteenth birthday.finally,petitioner contends that our failure to recognize his derivative naturalization would violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.
whether was effectively in the sole legal custody of his mother prior to his eighteenth birthday 
on a purely theoretical level,petitioner first argument has some not enough to carry the day.interpretation of a is a matter of federal law and,because of the overarching constitutional interest in uniformity of federal immigration and naturalization laws we have previously reject ed the contention that the law of any one state should govern the determination under a whether an alien child parents were legally separated.especially given nehme firm rejection of the contention that the meaning of the term legal separation in a is controlled by any given state domestic relations law,we are satisfied that neither may a child legal custody status be controlled by any one state law.it is true,at least in theory,that a lpr child seeking derivative citizenship under a might prove that,despite a state explicit grant of joint legal custody to his parents,he must be regarded as being or having been in the sole legal custody of his naturalized parent as a matter of federal law in this case,however,petitioner has failed to prove that,for federal naturalization purposes,he should be regarded as having effectively been in the sole legal custody of his mother at the time of her naturalization.in fact,he has offered us no evidence to that effect he merely asserts as much conclusionally in his brief.such a bald assertion is not sufficient to meet his burden of proving his claim to citizenship neither is it enough to create an issue of material fact that would require a hearing before a district court 
b.the effect of the amended decree 
likewise without merit is petitioner second contention,that,at the time of his mother naturalization,he met a sole legal custody requirement because the amended decree expressly and retroactively grants her sole legal custody as of the date of her divorce.petitioner insists that we are bound by the full faith and credit to recognize california amended decree as having such retroactive effect.we disagree.
our refusal to credit the amended decree for purposes of federal immigration law does not even implicate the full faith and credit act.for purposes of a,petitioner custody status prior to his eighteenth birthday is determined by federal law it is not dependent on the law of any particular state.true,his custody status u
