opinion of the court 
petitioner alvin bobb,a lawful permanent resident,pleaded guilty to forging a check in the amount of,in violation of a,and was sentenced to four months imprisonment.an immigration judge ij determined at bobb bail hearing that his conviction was not an aggravated felony for purposes of removal,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.at a subsequent removal hearing,however,a different ij determined that the crime was an aggravated felony,which the bia affirmed.that decision has dire consequences for bobb efforts to remain in the united states,as it renders him removable and precludes him from seeking discretionary relief from removal in the form of a readjustment of status.
our task is to determine whether bobb conviction was an aggravated felony.in so doing,we must survey the interrelationship between two statutory provisions set forth under a subsection m i,which states that an aggravated felony is an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeds and subsection r,which states that an offense relating to forgery for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year is an aggravated felony.bobb contends that the bia erred in holding he committed an aggravated felony because subsection r,which specifically references the crime of forgery and all related offenses,is the exclusively applicable aggravated felony provision for all forgery offenses.in the alternative,bobb argues that his offense was a hybrid offense under our recent opinion in nugent ashcroft,cir,and that the government accordingly should have been required to establish all the criteria specified by both subsections.under either theory,bobb conviction would not constitute an aggravated felony because subsection r includes a requirement that the alien have served a term of imprisonment of greater than one year.
this appeal asks us to decide which aggravated felony definition applies to bobb related to forgery provision of subsection r,the broad fraud provision of subsection m i,or both.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the bia did not err in determining that bobb underlying criminal conviction was an aggravated felony under subsection m i,and that bobb conviction was not a hybrid offense under nugent.accordingly,we will deny bobb petition for review.
bobb is a native and citizen of trinidad and tobago who entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on september.on december,bobb forged a united states treasury check in the amount of.he was subsequently charged with forging endorsements on treasury checks,in violation of a.bobb pleaded guilty and was sentenced by the district court on october,to a term of imprisonment of four months.
on december,the ins issued bobb a notice to appear,charging that he was subject to removal from the united states for committing an aggravated felony as defined under section a m i of the immigration and nationality act ina.a m i.on june,the ins lodged an additional deportation charge against bobb alleging a separate ground for removability that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after his admission,and for which a sentence of one year or more imprisonment could be imposed.see a a i.bobb has conceded this second charge,see app,but disputes the first charge that his conviction was an aggravated felony under subsection m i.
at bobb initial bond hearing,an ij concluded that bobb offense was not an aggravated felony and that he therefore qualified for bond.the ij,noting that congress had to have been aware when it enacted subsection r that forgery is always fraud,determined that including all forgery offenses in subsection m i would render subsection r surplusage unless congress manifested a clear intention to have the general fraud provision govern over the specific forgery section.as a result,the ij granted bobb bond in the amount of,a decision which the bia affirmed over the government appeal.
following his release on bond,bobb sought to terminate his removal proceedings in order to apply for a readjustment of status.as a lawful permanent resident married to a united states citizen,bobb is eligible to petition bice for a discretionary readjustment of status unless,inter alia,it is determined that he has committed an aggravated felony.see h.the government countered bobb motion by moving to pretermit bobb application.
a second ij conducted removability proceedings and considered the motions.the ij noted that the prior determination at the bond hearing that bobb conviction was not an aggravated felony was not controlling in the removability proceedings.see d formerly d the ij held that bobb conviction satisfied subsection m i,and that the ins was not obligated to charge bobb under subsection r.citing the legislative history of subsection r,the ij explained that accepting bobb interpretation would lead to the absurd result that the addition of subsection r to section a had decreased the number of crimes that could be considered aggravated felonies,despite congressional intent to the contrary.app.see,at cong.rec.accordingly,the ij concluded that subsections m i and r were separate and distinct statutes 
the fraud section of the ina deals with offenses involving fraud or deceit where the loss to the victim s is greater than.the forgery section is actually not a section limited to forgery offenses a subset of fraud,but instead includes a variety of organized crime relating to immigration,and further requires one year imprisonment.one section,ina a m i was enacted to deport individuals engaging in deceptive conduct causing great loss of money,and the other section,ina a r,was enacted to deport those whose crimes were serious enough to merit one year of imprisonment.
app.the decision finding that bobb underlying offense was an aggravated felony resolved both pending motions,and it barred bobb from receiving a discretionary readjustment of status on january,the bia affirmed without opinion.app.
on june,bobb filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court.while that petition remained pending,congress passed the real id act of,stat.pursuant to the terms of that act,we convert bobb habeas petition into a petition for review.see bonhometre gonzales,cir.
we have jurisdiction over bobb petition for review under a.under the real id act,our jurisdiction extends to questions of law raised upon a petition for review,including petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions.a d.popal gonzales,cir.we exercise de novo review over the bia conclusion that bobb criminal conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.ki se lee ashcroft,cir 
at the outset,it is helpful to identify the parties competing arguments.bobb contends that we should read subsection m i to encompass all fraud or deceit not otherwise specified in section a.thus,since subsection r specifically covers forgery,the government should not be permitted to charge bobb as being removable under subsection m i.in contrast,the government argues that subsection r is not merely a subset of subsection m i.according to the government,not all offenses involve fraud,and congress intent in enacting subsection r was,in part,to capture those offenses that do not involve fraud and deceit.as a result,the government argues that the bia correctly concluded that bobb was convicted of an offense that involved fraud and deceit.
our task is twofold first,we must determine whether congress intended that convictions constitute aggravated felonies only under subsection r and second,whether,in the alternative,bobb offense is a hybrid offense that requires the government to meet all the requirements of both subsections m i and r in order to remove bobb.
we begin by examining whether congress intended subsection r to be the sole avenue for a conviction to constitute an aggravated felony.relying on the principle of statutory construction that a specific statutory provision controls a general provision,bobb argues that his conviction can only constitute an aggravated felony under subsection r,not subsection m i.this argument,however,is misplaced.the government had the discretion to charge bobb with an aggravated felony under either or both subsections for three primary reasons.first,the broad language used by congress in both subsections precludes a finding that subsection r removed all forgery convictions from the ambit of subsection m i.second,the legislative history is clear that congress intent in enacting subsection r was to increase the number of aggravated felonies,not to provide a loophole through which an offense that would otherwise have constituted an aggravated felony would escape that classification.finally,a conclusion that the ins can not bring removal proceedings under both subsections has no analogue in the criminal context,in which courts have recognized prosecutorial discretion to bring charges when particular statutes overlap.we will examine each of these points in turn.
bobb,heeding the familiar canon of statutory construction that a specific statutory provision controls a general provision when the two provisions cover the same factual context,contends that subsection r trumps subsection m i and is the exclusive avenue to bring removability proceedings for convictions.bobb asserts that subsection r would be superfluous if aliens chargeable under subsection r were always also chargeable under subsection m i.
although bobb argument is somewhat inviting,it ultimately fails because subsections m i and r were both drafted broadly by congress.on previous occasions,we have had the opportunity to interpret the scope of both subsections.in valansi ashcroft,cir,we determined that congress intended subsection m i to have a broad scope because that provision refers to an offense that involves fraud or deceit and which results in losses greater than.id.at.as a result,we held that subsection m i covers all offenses that have as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive.id.at.see ki se lee,at cir subsection m i has a general gamut of state and federal crimes involving fraud and deceit causing losses over.
we considered the scope of subsection r in drakes zimski,cir.there,the petitioner was convicted in delaware of forgery,which had as an essential element an intent to deceive.the petitioner argued that his conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony because congress intended the federal definition of forgery to extend only to crimes involving an intent to defraud.we noted that the term forgery under federal law was ambiguous,and that there was a split among the states as to whether forgery necessarily included an intent to defraud.a minority of states,including delaware,had held that forgery could also be premised on an intent to deceive.id.relying upon the conflicting interpretations among the different states,we rejected the petitioner argument and held that congress intended to define forgery in its broadest sense by using the language relating to forgery in subsection r.we concluded that t he delaware forgery statute,while apparently encompassing more conduct than is encompassed by traditional definition of forgery,is related to forgery in a way that several states have made part of their criminal codes.id.at.for this reason,we determined that it was appropriate for the bia to read the broad minority definition into subsection r rather than the narrow traditional definition.id.
the broad construction we have given to subsections m i and r rebuts bobb argument that all forgery convictions are necessarily governed by subsection r rather than subsection m i.perhaps if subsection r had been drafted example,if it had used the language forgery offense instead of related to forgery then bobb argument would have merit.at their core,all common law forgery offenses contain as an element an intent to defraud or deceive we are not dealing here,however,with a straightforward forgery offense because congress drafted subsection r more expansively,including offenses related to forgery.the term relate means to show or establish a logical or causal connection between.webster third new international dictionary unabridged.subsection r thus encompasses conduct beyond the traditional definition of forgery,and includes criminal conduct that is causally connected to forgery,but may lack as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive.
the government provides in its brief a good example of an offense related to forgery that does not have as an element an intent to defraud or deceive b.section b criminalizes the knowing exchange of stolen or forged treasury instruments 
b whoever,with knowledge that such treasury check or bond or security of the united states is stolen or bears a falsely made or forged endorsement or signature buys,sells,exchanges,receives,delivers,retains,or conceals any such treasury check or bond or security of the united states shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
b.a conviction under subsection b contains two essential elements that the defendant buy,sell,or exchange a stolen or forged endorsement,with knowledge that the instrument has been stolen or forged.see united states clemmons,cir upholding the defendant conviction under subsection b where there was evidence that the defendant knew the bonds were stolen and attempted to sell the bonds to a government informant.conspicuously absent from this definition is any element containing an intent to defraud or deceive.yet,there can be no doubt that selling a forged check to a middleman would constitute an offense related to forgery but for the forged endorsement,there would be no criminal offense.in fact,we have explained that the purpose of section b was to close a loophole in the law which did not permit the government to prosecute a defendant who sold or transferred forged or stolen instruments to another party without representing that the instruments were genuine.see united states williams,cir stating that section b sets forth that the defendant must have knowledge that the instrument is forged but gives no indication that he must represent it is genuine.we agree with the government that congress choice of the word related to was intended to capture certain criminal conduct,such as that defined by b,which does not contain any intent to deceive or defraud see drakes,at referencing congress intent to define forgery in the broadest sense because it used the phrase related to in subsection r see also valansi,at referencing congress intent to broaden the scope of subsection m i by using the term involves.
despite the broad construction we have given subsections m i and r,bobb argues that our decision in ki se lee ashcroft,cir,compels the conclusion that bobb can only be charged as removable under subsection r.in lee,the petitioners were convicted of filing false income tax returns causing a tax delinquency in an amount greater than.the ins brought removability proceedings under subsection m i,since the amount at issue was greater than.we held that the ins was precluded from removing the petitioners under subsection m i because a different provision,subsection m ii,which applied specifically to tax evasion offenses in which the revenue loss to the government exceeded,identified the only removable tax offense.we set forth three reasons for our conclusion.first,we noted that our interpretation was the only way to avoid surplusage because there was no scenario whereby tax evasion did not involve fraud or deceit.thus,subsection m i did not exist simply as a section for certain tax fraud crimes not covered by m ii.second,we determined that congress acted purposefully by singling out tax evasion within the same subsection as the fraud provision in an overall statute with numerous subsections.id.at where congress includes particular language in one section of the statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.citation omitted.we focused on the fact that subsections m i and m ii were interrelated and closely positioned,they were adopted at the same time and appeared within the same subsection within a statute that contained separate subsections specifying aggravated felonies.id.in that context,congress choice to list the crime of tax evasion as a separate subsection led to our conclusion that tax evasion was the only removable aggravated felony.id.at.finally,we stated that the history and structure of the criminal tax laws supported the interpretation that congress intended to single out tax evasion as the only tax crime that could be a removable offense.id.we concluded that in enacting subsection m ii,congress intended to specify tax evasion as the only deportable tax offense it follows that it did not intend subsection m i to cover tax offenses.id.
this case,however,is different from lee primarily because,as demonstrated above,there exist offenses related to forgery which do not contain as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive.unlike subsection m ii,subsection r does not define offenses that would otherwise fall entirely within m i the language of subsection r is much broader than that of subsection m ii,and unlike r,m ii was listed in the same subsection as m i,the general fraud aggravated felony.the fact that there are numerous federal and state statutes related to forgery that do not have as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive shows that subsection r is not a subset of subsection m i.while there are offenses that fall under subsection r but not subsection m i,section a offenses are not among them.section a offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under either subsection m i or subsection r because of the broad manner in which congress drafted both subsections as such,subsection r is not the sole avenue to charge bobb with removability for his conviction under section a.
the legislative history of subsection r also supports the ij determination.subsection r was enacted in order to increase the number of aggravated felonies that could be charged as removable offenses.subsection r was added to section a as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,e,stat.the house report submitted in connection with that legislation confirms congress intent to add several crimes to the definition of aggravated felony 
one of the steps the committee recommends to accomplish the goal of strengthening the government ability to efficiently deport aliens who are convicted of serious crimes is to add several crimes to the definition of aggravated felony.aliens who commit aggravated felonies can be deported from the united states when they complete their incarceration.many of the crimes added to this list are those often committed by persons involved in organized immigration crime.the crimes added to this definition include certain gambling offenses crimes involving transportation of person s for the purpose of prostitution alien smuggling counterfeiting,forging,or trafficking in immigration and other documents and trafficking in stolen vehicles.
in adding crimes to the list,effort was made to ensure that the overall reach of the definition would be consistent with the sentencing guidelines established by the united states sentencing commission.with only certain limited exceptions,the committee attempted to ensure that all of the crimes defined as aggravated felonies carry a base offense level of at least.these minimums have been selected to ensure that only the most serious crimes,or the more serious convictions of lesser crimes,render the alien deportable.
the broad language used in subsection r,combined with the legislative history,confirms that congress did not intend to hamstring the ins ability to bring enforcement proceedings,but rather to increase the number of removable offenses.a different interpretation simply makes no sense.congress is presumed to have understood that forgery offenses historically have had as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive,and thus that they fell under subsection m i.but there was a gap in the existing language of subsection m i,because it did not cover the sale of forged or stolen documents to middlemen and other offenses that are related to forgery,but which do not contain as an essential element an intent to defraud or deceive.as the ij correctly noted in his opinion,it simply would make no sense to remove the immigration consequences from offenses that previously were considered aggravated felonies.app.in this respect,congress choice to use the phrase related to was deliberate because it evidenced an intent to categorize as aggravated felonies crimes which previously were not covered by section a.see app.one section,ina a m i,was enacted to deport individuals engaging in deceptive conduct causing great loss of money,and the other section,ina a r was enacted to deport those whose crimes were serious enough to merit one year of imprisonment.
an additional reason for finding that the ins could proceed under either subsection m i or r is that bobb because he may be removed solely under subsection r he therefore can not be removed under subsection m i has no analogue in criminal law.it is not uncommon that federal criminal statutes partially overlap,permitting prosecutors to bring criminal charges under either one section or the other.as the supreme court recognized,there are sometimes partial redundancies in federal criminal statutes both as to the conduct they proscribe and the individuals they reach.united states batchelder,d.in batchelder,the court rejected the argument that a defendant convicted under one overlapping statute could be imprisoned to no more than the maximum term specified under another overlapping statute id.at.in so doing,the court determined that each statute,in conjunction with its own sentencing provision,operates independently of the other.id.the court explained that it was not enough to show that the two statutes produced differing results when applied to the same factual situation r ather,the legislative intent to repeal one of the statutes must be manifest in the positive repugnancy between the provisions.id.at.citations omitted.the court found that the differing penalty provisions were fully capable of coexisting because they apply to convictions under different statutes.id.applying the longstanding principle that when an act violates more than one criminal statute,the government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants,the court upheld the defendant conviction and sentence.id.at.see berra united states.upholding the defendant felony conviction when misdemeanor tax evasion statute would have proscribed identical conduct and imposed a lesser penalty,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in sansone united states,d.
similarly,this court recognized in united states williams,cir,the possibility that a defendant could be prosecuted for the same conduct under either a or b.in williams,we noted that section was enacted to close several loopholes that had existed for prosecutions.under existing law,the government could not prosecute a defendant for forgery offenses involving united states treasury instruments.in addition,there was no avenue prior to the enactment of section b to prosecute a defendant if a properly endorsed check is stolen and then cashed or if the thief sells the check without endorsing it.id.at.the defendant argued that section a was superfluous because many offenses chargeable under section a could also be charged under section b.we rejected that argument,noting that no matter how is read there will be redundancies within its subsections.see id.for example,under any conceivable reading of a thief who steals a treasury check and then endorses it and,representing it as genuine,cashes it with an innocent merchant,can be prosecuted under either subsection a or subsection b for the transaction.despite these partial redundancies,we concluded that the subsections were distinct and covered separate conduct 
t here are differences between the subsections though undoubtedly their provisions overlap.thus,b deals with validly endorsed or unendorsed instruments and section a does not.on the other hand the latter but not the former section mentions attempts.in any event if the subsections are to be mutually exclusive,though we see no reason why they should be,congress will have to rewrite them as we can not 
t he principle novelties in were in subsection b,which closed the loophole in section in favor of the thief who stole an endorsed check or sold the check without enclosing it,and in subsection c which deals with penalties.thus in subsection b congress added a provision without a comparable antecedent in section.but at the same time it enacted section a which traversed ground already covered by section.in the circumstances it is not surprising that there is duplication.indeed,itself partially repeats provisions from section.
id.similar considerations in the present case support a conclusion that congress did not intend that bobb could only be charged as removable under subsection r.
the cases cited by bobb for the proposition that the specific statutory provision trumps the general provision all dealt with statutes that were coextensive with one another,or where congressional intent was clear that a specific provision trumped a general one.for example,the supreme court held in busic united states,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in united states gonzales,d,that the defendant could not be sentenced under the statutory enhancement provision in c providing an enhanced penalty for using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence where the predicate offense of assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon contained its own specific statutory enhancement.the court determined that the more specific enhancement provision in the predicate offense trumped the general enhancement provision in section c when both enhancement provisions covered the same conduct.thus,the government was precluded from proceeding under section c.
similarly,in united states laporta,cir,the defendants set fire to a government vehicle provided by a confidential informant in an effort to obtain insurance proceeds.the defendants were charged,inter alia,under h with using an explosive device to commit a felony.the defendants argued that the charge should be dismissed because their conduct was covered solely by section f,which prohibits the destruction of government property.the second circuit agreed,determining that the specific statute relating to the destruction of government property necessarily controlled the broader statute because otherwise section f would have no practical effect.according to the court,a contrary interpretation would render section f superfluous because the government would always have the ability to charge under the general offense,and would do so in most cases do so because it contained more stringent penalties.id.at.
the distinction between the decisions in batchelder and williams and the decisions in busic and laporta is this the government is required to proceed under a specific statute only if proceeding under a general statute would render the specific statute superfluous.a statute is rendered superfluous only if a general statute can cover every possible circumstance covered by the specific.see,lee,at.under those circumstances,the general statute must give way to the specific.in this case,subsections m i and r are not coextensive.the government was entitled to charge bobb as removable under either subsection because not all conduct covered by subsection r is covered by subsection m i.
for these reasons,we conclude that the ij did not err in finding that the government was entitled to charge bobb as removable under subsection m i.
apart from whether the government is entitled to charge bobb under subsection m i remains an equally important question whether the provision it meet the requirements of both subsections m i and r to remove bobb from the united states as an aggravated felon.the answer to this question depends upon whether bobb underlying conviction qualifies as a hybrid offense as set forth in our recent opinion in nugent ashcroft,cir.
the alien in nugent was convicted in pennsylvania of the crime of theft by deception for depositing a bad check in the amount of,and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six to months.the bia ordered nugent removed under a g,which defines as an aggravated felony a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.nugent argued that his conviction for theft by deception was not a theft offense,but rather was a fraud offense covered by subsection m i.as in the present case,the distinction was important for nugent he was not removable under subsection m i because his offense involved a loss to the victim of less than.if subsection g applied,however,he was removable because he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year.
in addressing nugent arguments,we first had to determine the scope of subsection g.we concluded that a theft offense under subsection g could be defined as a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent.id.at.we found that,given this broad definition,nugent bad check transaction was a theft offense.we held,however,that this did not end our inquiry 
the sole question for decision is whether within the purview of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,section,nugent conviction for passing a bad check represents an offense involving fraud or deceit under a m i,notwithstanding that it also constitutes a theft offense under a g.if we decide that nugent conviction is an offense that involves fraud or deceit as well as a theft offense,then to qualify as an aggravated felony under the ina it must meet the requirements of section a m i,loss to the victim of more than,in addition to section a g,term of imprisonment of at least one year.
id.at.after further analysis,we determined that nugent theft by deception offense also fell within the purview of subsection m i because it required the commonwealth to prove fraud and deceit.id.at.
we employed principles of logic to reach the conclusion that the ins was required to prove the elements of both subsection g and subsection m i.the terms employed to define the covered offenses were key to our determination.subsection g is limited to theft offenses,while subsection m i applies more broadly to an offense that involves fraud or deceit.id.at.we found this distinction significant,concluding that subsection m i clearly applies to those theft offenses under subsection g that are anchored on fraud or deceit 
t he logicians teach us that a term such as an offense as contained in section a m or a theft offense as in section a g,is said to have both a quality and a quantity.here we are concerned with quantity.the quantity of a proposition is universal or particular according to whether the proposition refers to all members of a class or to some members of the class designated by its subject term.in the case of m we have a term representing all members of a class an offense.
when a term contains no restrictions as in m an offense,logicians refer to it as distributed,and the proposition of which it is the subject as universal and is a class.in the universe of offenses set forth in section a,however,the term theft offense is predicated on some,but not all,of the distributed term an offense in m,and is therefore considered as undistributed and is a subclass.the proposition of which it is the subject is denoted as a particular.see ruggero aldisert,logic for lawyers a guide to clear legal thinking ed irving copi,introduction to logic ed.expressed in less technical phrasing all theft offenses are offenses,but not all offenses are theft offenses.
we are taught that conclusions in all reasoning,including legal reasoning,deductive or inductive analogy,derive their validity from the axiom known as the dictum de omni et nullo,which states what is true of the universal or class is true of the particular or subclass.the axiom may also be stated as if every member of a class has or does not have a certain property,and if certain individuals are included in that class,then these individuals have or do not have a certain property.
id.at underlined emphasis added.
with this background in mind,we set forth the following syllogisms to govern the analysis 
depriving another of property by fraud or deceit is an offense m.universal 
the offense of theft by deception deprives another of property by theft g.particular 
therefore,the offense of theft by deception is an offense under m and g.
the offense of theft by deception is an offense under m and g.
a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,is an offense of theft by deception.
therefore,a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,is an offense under m and g.
id.at.applying this framework,we held that pennsylvania theft by deception statute,which qualified under subsection g as a particular theft offense,also came within the universal or class nature of an offense bottomed on fraud or deceit under subsection m i.following the maxim that what is true of the universal or class is true for the particular or subclass,we concluded that the ins had to meet the requirements of subsection m i.id.at because the particular pennsylvania statute is designed entirely on concepts of fraud or deceit it is precisely the particular type of theft contemplated in the universal class of offenses set forth in the fraud or deceit subsection m i.we therefore apply the axiom what is true of the universal or class is true for the particular or subclass in a g.see also id.at rendell,concurring o nly where an offense is a i submit theft by deception the aggravated felony classifications contain two distinct,clearly applicable tests,should we conclude that both must be fulfilled in order for the offense to qualify as an aggravated felony.
the clearest reading of nugent is that it is restricted to classificational schemes in which one classification is entirely a subset of another.under such circumstances,we infer a legislative intent to require proof of all the elements of the universal classification.the logical reasoning on which nugent rests,however,can not support a similar result for separate universal classifications which intersect,but which have separate and independent elements.in that situation,which we have in this case,satisfaction of the separate criteria of either universal classification will suffice to establish the predicate defined by the classification.
for example,if we were bound in this case by the proposition that all forgeries are frauds,in order to establish aggravated felony status based upon a predicate forgery conviction the particular,the government would have to satisfy all the elements of the fraud conviction the universal.here,unlike in nugent where we noted that the term theft offense defined a class that was entirely a subset of the larger class offense,the class offense related to forgery is not entirely a subset of the class offense involving fraud.rather,an offense related to forgery is an independent,universal class that intersects with the offense involving fraud class.congress made the intentional decision in subsection r,as it did with fourteen different offenses set forth in section a,to use the broader term offense.see id.at.thus,nugent s holding that the universal must be proven if it subsumes the subclass is inapplicable to this case.bobb underlying conviction is not a hybrid offense,and the government was entitled to charge him as removable solely under subsection m i.
our only remaining question is whether the offense of conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under subsection m i.bobb was convicted under a of passing,uttering,and publishing a united states treasury check in the amount of which contained a forged endorsement.that statute provides as follows 
a whoever,with intent to defraud 
passes,utters,or publishes,or attempts to pass,utter,or publish,any treasury check or bond or security of the united states bearing a falsely made or forged endorsement or signature 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
a.the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements to obtain a conviction under section a that the defendant passed or attempted to pass a united states treasury check that the check bore a forged or falsely made endorsement that the defendant passed the check with intent to defraud and that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully.united states rosario,cir.section a explicitly contains as an element an intent to defraud,which qualifies bobb conviction as a removable offense under subsection m i.moreover,bobb pleaded guilty to an indictment which confirms that the amount of loss was greater than therefore,bobb conviction satisfied the essential requirements for removability under subsection m i.
for these reasons,we conclude that the bia did not err in holding that bobb was removable,and we will accordingly deny his petition for review.
congress intentionally used broad language when it drafted subsections m i and r,which precludes a finding that subsection r is the sole vehicle for removing bobb for an offense committed under a.the legislative history supports the conclusion that congress intended to increase the number of crimes which constitute aggravated felonies,not to provide a loophole through which an offense that could have previously constituted an aggravated felony may no longer be charged as such.in addition,bobb argument that he is removable only under subsection r has no analogue in the criminal law context.finally,bobb offense is not a hybrid offense as set forth in nugent.
as a result,we agree with the bia that bobb committed an aggravated felony and will accordingly deny bobb petition for review.
alvin bobb entered the united states as a legal permanent resident in on the petition of his mother,who is a united states citizen.his wife is a united states citizen.his two son and an also both united states citizens.he has been convicted of one crime forging a united states treasury check.he was sentenced to,and has served,four months in prison for that crime.he concedes that he is removable under ina a a i for having committed a crime of moral turpitude,but contests the secretary determination that his crime qualifies as an aggravated felony.the consequences of such a designation are harsh immediate deportation,ineligibility for discretionary relief from removal,a on reentry,and no judicial review.see b,a a ii a c.
i agree with the majority that not all offenses relating to forgery are offenses involving fraud or deceit and therefore subsection r is not a subclass of subsection m i.op.at.i also agree with the majority that,in most circumstances,the government is required to proceed under a specific statute only if proceeding under a general statute would render the specific statute superfluous.op.at.this rule is rooted in the reality that there are often partial redundancies in federal criminal statutes both as to the conduct they proscribe and the individuals they reach,and prosecutors are entrusted with the discretion to choose which statute to apply.united states batchelder,d see also id.whether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury are decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor discretion.
in batchelder,to reuse the majority example,the supreme court rejected the argument that a defendant convicted under one overlapping statute could be imprisoned for more than the maximum term specified in another overlapping statute.id.at.the court determined that each statute,in conjunction with its own sentencing provision,operated independently of one another,and that both could be applied to the same factual situation unless the legislative intent to repeal one of the statutes is manifest in the positive repugnancy between the provisions.id.at.
my difficulty with the majority approach is that a is not a criminal statute and subsections r and m i do not operate independently of one another,nor do they have their own sentencing provision s.see id.indeed,subsections r and m i do not independently proscribe any type of simply define what constitutes an aggravated felony.many cases support the notion that prosecutors can choose between applicable criminal and civil statutes,but my research has not uncovered any case permitting administrative agencies to choose between two definitions within th
