this case arises out of student transfers from one rural texas school district to another.before and after the transfers,both districts had a majority of racial minority students the united states and hearne isd,the plaintiff district,contend that the transfers impermissibly impeded desegregation and violated a desegregation decree against the texas education agency.the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and enjoined the transfer only of white students even though large numbers of black and hispanic students have also continued to transfer out of hearne.after carefully reviewing the record,we hold that the court had no basis for sanctioning the transferee district,mumford,a to the original court order.further,there is no legal or factual basis for the court finding of a reduction in desegregation caused by the transfers.because the plaintiffs are entitled to no relief under the desegregation decree,we reverse the judgment and vacate the district court injunction.
background 
in,the united states brought suit in the eastern district of texas against various texas school districts,the governing county boards of education of each such district and their respective officials,and the texas education agency tea to achieve meaningful school desegregation.each of the school districts named as a defendant in the original suit was either an district or an district that had taken no steps to comply with the supreme court desegregation precedent.the district court,judge william wayne justice presiding,found that the named school districts were responsible for creating and maintaining dual school systems and that systemically,the vestiges of racially segregated public education had not been eliminated.accordingly,judge justice entered order,a desegregation decree applicable to the named school districts and the tea,which directs funding to the state public schools.united states texas.the order contains two parts,the first directed at desegregating the named school districts and the second directed at correcting systemic segregation.specifically,with respect to transfers,the order enjoined tea and any person acting in concert with tea 
from permitting,approving or supporting by any means the transfer of students within the state of texas which will reduce or impede desegregation or which will reinforce,renew or encourage the continuation of acts and practices resulting in discriminatory treatment of students on the ground of race,color,or national origin 
id.at.the order was later modified by the district court,united states texas,and subsequently by the fifth circuit,united states texas,cir,but the text of the transfer provision remained largely the same.
during the years that have elapsed since the original entry of order,there have been eight decisions in which our circuit has addressed questions regarding the validity and applicability of order and during this same period,the racial composition of public schools in texas has changed drastically.today,texas public school districts continue to expend considerable resources complying with tea directives pursuant to the order,yet the state has not moved to terminate it.because of the order dwindling relevance,only three disputes have arisen under it in the last ten years,and the case was administratively closed for three years before this matter was filed.judge justice,the judge presiding over the original dispute in,has remained in charge of the case throughout,even though he is now on senior status.
the most recent litigation under order has involved small rural school districts fighting over student population in contests rooted more in resource allocation than racial injustice texas has a liberal transfer policy wherein funding from tea follows the student across district lines.see.in this case,hearne seeks to prevent flight from its schools and retain funding in the district.at trial,hearne administrators testified that they were concerned about all student transfers,correctly valuing students of all races equally.by intervening into the case underlying order,however,hearne can only legally complain about the transfer of white students the district consequently argues that their voluntary departure has reduced desegregation in hearne schools.
hearne sued tea,mumford independent school district,which received many hearne transfers,and mumford superintendent bienski.the united states,as plaintiff to the original order litigation,joined the case.the district court conducted a bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs,enjoining mumford from accepting any more white of students who have been attending mumford schools for many prohibiting tea from funding mumford for those transfers.this court stayed the district court remedy pending tea and mumford appeal 
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
mumford first asserts that the district court should not have exercised jurisdiction over this dispute through a reopening of the tea litigation and order.mumford argues that because hearne is subject to a prior,separate desegregation order that originated in a different court,the court here erred in asserting jurisdiction.we disagree.the fact that hearne was itself the defendant in another desegregation case years ago and remains subject to a consent decree arising from that suit has no bearing on the state compliance with order.accordingly,subject matter jurisdiction is proper.
mumford also challenges the district court reopening of an administratively closed case and its allowance of hearne motion to intervene to enforce order.because a district court may reopen an administratively closed case sua sponte,mire full spectrum lending,cir,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court timing and decision to reopen the case.likewise,the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting hearne to intervene,as hearne challenged tea action under order,which is a decree.see trans chem.china nat.mach.import exp,cir explaining that permissive intervention is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
finally,mumford contests the district court exercise of jurisdiction against it,a to the original suit,as an entity acting in concert with tea to violate order.see.d confining district courts to injunctive relief against parties or those in active concert or participation with them.because the court judgment must be reversed on other grounds,we need not decide whether the district court erred in construing the scope of its rule authority on the facts presented,and assume arguendo mumford acted in concert with tea 
order,as occasionally modified prohibits the state from permitting or supporting in any way 
student transfers,between school districts,when the cumulative effect,in either the sending or receiving school or school district,will be to reduce or impede desegregation.
united states texas,cir.one guideline for enforcing this proscription instructs tea not to approve transfers whose effect will change the majority or minority percentage of the school population by more than one percent in either the home or the receiving district or the home or the receiving school.under the order,the white student population is measured against the minority population,including black and all other minority students.
neither hearne nor mumford was an original defendant school district subject to order during the past decade,more or less,hearne has lost student population of all races via transfers,dropouts,and changes of residence.while hearne enrollment declined from nearly in to under in,mumford grew from a district of just students in to over four hundred in.mumford expanded largely by receiving transfers,mostly from hearne,and mostly of hispanic and black students.notwithstanding the districts changing populations,both districts have remained.
when analyzing this case,the district court stated repeatedly that the critical issue is whether tea funding to mumford of white transfer students from hearne violated order because such transfers cumulative effect reduced or impeded desegregation in hearne.we can not fully endorse this characterization.the order itself required the court to consider the racial balance of both hearne and mumford as well as all the transfers and the resulting student body populations,taking into account hispanic as well as black and white students.contrary to the order,however,the court skewed its analysis toward the complaining district alone and arbitrarily excluded hispanics,the racial group that has grown considerably in both hearne and mumford just as it has grown all over texas.moreover,the court focus seems to have been misplaced on racial balancing for its own sake rather than on effectuating the more tailored remedies required in recent years by the supreme court and this court.the court should have been more mindful of goodrich,where this court recited applicable supreme court cases and held that since there is no reason why order must be interpreted to extend the district court remedial jurisdiction beyond limits articulated by the supreme court,prudence and deference to the high court strongly counsel enforcement of the order consistent with rather than in the teeth of its pronouncements.united states texas goodrich,cir.
wisely,however,the court declined to equate a violation of the one percent guideline with a violation of order.goodrich disapproved,albeit in the context of school boundary changes rather than student transfers,prophylactic percentage tests that have little or no connection to the remedial facts underlying order.even as to student transfers,within the order itself,a guideline is a guideline,not an inflexible command 
bearing in mind these initial observations,we analyze separately the appellate points of tea and mumford.
the district court enjoined tea from funding all white transfers from hearne to mumford,even if those students had attended mumford for their entire school careers.in doing so,the court disregarded that tea had previously sanctioned mumford for its order reporting violations by refusing to fund any new transfers.for reasons originating in the adoption of automated reporting devices,tea made a policy decision to recognize two levels of transfers.all students who had already transferred as of the school year were considered baseline students.students who had transferred for the school year were considered grandfathered students.tea has continued to fund baseline and grandfathered students,as well as siblings of baseline transfers,finding a disruption in funding to be contrary to desirable educational policy.the district court rejected tea balancing approach and ordered tea to cease all funding for any white the baseline and grandfathered hearne to mumford.
because injunctive relief must not transcend the scope of the violation,a court enforcing order against an original party thereto must find that transfers reduce desegregation or reinforce the existence of a dual system before enjoining such transfers.lee eufaula city bd.of,cir.in measuring the cumulative effect of a student transfer program on desegregation,the court must do so from a qualitative viewpoint,without blind deference to an objective mathematical formula.id.at see also davis bd.of sch.comm rs,cir explaining that school desegregation can first be measured quantitatively,using percentages as a rough rule of thumb,but ultimately must be measured qualitatively,judging whether schools are still identifiable as schools.if,after performing both quantitative and qualitative analysis,the court finds that there is a violation of a desegregation decree,it must fashion appropriately tailored equitable relief.in this case,the district court quantitative and qualitative findings were clearly erroneous,and the district court abused its discretion in fashioning such a broad remedy.
the first step of a transfer analysis looks at the quantitative effect of the transfers on both school districts.previous cases explain what this analysis entails.see,lee lee county bd.of,cir eufaula,at.although this court has refused to sanction the use of strict quantitative or percentage analysis in measuring the effect of a transfer program on desegregation,it has noted that the range of deviation may be significant in measuring qualitative segregative effect.eufaula,at.specifically,a transfer program which has the effect of increasing the black student population in a particular school from to may be more suspect than a corresponding increase from to.id.another test comes from the sixth circuit whether the foreseeable and actual result of a transfer policy is to increase the racial identifiability of schools.id.at quoting naacp lansing bd.of,cir.
most important for present purposes,small changes in the racial composition of a district through transfers can not justify mandatory interdistrict desegregation remedies.see lee county,at.in lee county,the white transfers out of a particular school caused the racial composition of the school to change from percent black to percent black.this increment of change in the racial composition of a school seems unlikely to alter significantly general perceptions of a school racial identity or the behavior of persons who rely on such factors in determining whether or not to send their children to a particular school.id 
contrary to the district court finding,the numbers in this case do not prove that the transfers from hearne to mumford reduced desegregation or caused hearne to transform into a school.of equal significance,the district court ignored the impact that transfers of all races has had on mumford.
following the district court emphasis,we focus on hearne first.at their highest percentage in,percent of students attending hearne were.the lowest percentage of students was percent in the district court exhaustive discussion of mathematical calculations,percentages and percentage points is rendered moot by this simple comparison,as this court has already explained that a change,because of transfers,in percentage of black students from fifty percent to sixty percent would be less suspect.eufaula,at.
the district court also erred because it examined only the impact of the transfers on the percentage of black and white students in hearne,ignoring the substantial and growing portion of hispanic students.a central purpose of desegregation decrees was to prevent,to the extent practicable and not attributable to demographic changes,the continued existence of schools.see,swann bd.of,d tasby black coal.to maximize,cir discussing concern over predominantly black schools in a school district where fifty percent of the students were black and percent were hispanic see also ross houston indep.sch,cir i n seeking reduction in the number of schools,the district court could not ignore diminished white enrollment in the district and substantial immigration of hispanic students.hearne is,however,nowhere close to becoming a school,as the largest percentage of black students since has been percent.
furthermore,even by grouping blacks and hispanics together as one minority group,the change in population at hearne would not be so significant as to imply a return to segregation.in the years and,when the attendance of white students reached its lowest thirteen the resident population of white students was percent and percent,respectively these differences are simply not enough to mark a return to segregation as a result of state action through the transfer funding.see lee county,at finding it unreasonable to conclude that this small number of transfers effectively perpetuated the segregative effect of earlier actions.also noteworthy is that tea can not be held liable for a decline in hearne white student population caused by a decline in white residency within the district.
accordingly,to the extent that the district court relied on a quantitative analysis to show that white transfers from hearne to mumford were transforming the district into a predominantly district when it would not otherwise be so,its findings are clearly erroneous.to be sure,hearne enrollment has declined for several reasons,including transfers out of the district.but mumford acceptance of transfer students of all races has produced no segregative effect in hearne.
the district court findings also fell short by failing to consider the impact of transfers on mumford racial
