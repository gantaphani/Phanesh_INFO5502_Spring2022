is an inmate at the alger maximum correctional facility,which is located in munising,michigan,and which contains six housing for the general inmate population and three for inmates committed to administrative segregation.on september,prison officials placed in administrative segregation because r eports have been received from prisoners and staff that is using his position as a ranking member of the moori s h science temple of america to direct and influence his follo wers to strong arm other prisoners,col l ect debts,approve prisoner assaults and is involved in the approval and planning of a major serious assault on staff and a takeover of the housing unit facility here at alger.based upon these reports,prisoner is considered to be a threat to the safety and security of this facility.emphasis omitted.requested a hearing,an investigation and access to all relevant witnesses and documents,claiming that prison officials premised their decision to segregate him on false and religiously biased information.
after conducting a hearing on the matter,a prison official upheld placement in administrative segregation.the hearings division denied his request for a rehearing,after which he filed an internal grievance challenging his confinement in administrative segregation.in january,prison officials denied the grievance because had clearly demonstrated that he was a serious threat to the physical safety of.he filed additional internal grievances in and related to his administrative segregation,alleging that several prison officials used their authority and influence to subject him to continued and indefinite confinement in administrative segregation and denied him periodic reviews for release from segregation.prison officials rejected each grievance.
in december,filed this action against several prison officials,challenging his placement and continued confinement in administrative segregation on several federal constitutional grounds.after granting leave to proceed in forma pauperis,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see e b ii c.
in challenging the district court rejection of his claim at the pleading stage,focuses on the long term indefinite nature of his placement in administrative segregation and the absence of hearings during it.in one sense,he faces a steep climb.the due process clause does not protect every administrative slight that occurs behind prison walls.it requires process only when a life,liberty,or property interest is at stake.const.amend.xiv.and when it comes to the principal objection to confinement in a prison cell,the deprivation of liberty,the state already has given the procedural protections to which he is entitled a trial in compliance with the due process and other constitutional guarantees applicable to crime and punishment.
but in another sense,has a point.even after a proper conviction and sentence,an inmate still retains a liberty interest,guarded by due process,with respect to prison discipline that rises to the level of an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate.sandin conner,d.but in relation to what to implicate a cognizable liberty interest in the prison setting,sandin tells us,the discipline must be unusual and substantial in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.see also wilkinson austin,d discussing the difficulty of locating the appropriate baseline from which to measure what is atypical and significant in any particular prison system.
the question here is whether allegedly indefinite confinement in administrative segregation,three years and running as of the time of the complaint,amounts to an atypical and significant hardship on him in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.sandin,at.relying on sixth circuit precedent,the district court held that placement in administrative segregation is never atypical and significant and that the length of the placement does not affect the inquiry.op.at.we disagree.
two supreme court cases cast considerable light on the answer to this question.sandin addressed whether an inmate placement in disciplinary segregation for days presented the type of atypical,significant deprivation that implicated a protected liberty interest.at.it did not,the court held,for three reasons the inmate disciplinary segregation,with insignificant exceptions,mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and protective custody the inmate segregated confinement did not exceed similar,but totally discretionary,confinement in either duration or degree of restriction and the inmate segregation did not inevitably affect the duration of his sentence.id.at emphasis added.
austin addressed whether inmates assignment to a prison with highly restrictive conditions implicates a liberty interest.at.in holding that it did,the court noted the significant differences between the conditions of confinement at the prison and most solitary confinement facilities,then offered two other explanations for its decision first is the duration.unlike the placement in sandin,placement at the prison is indefinite and,after an initial review,is reviewed just annually.second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole consideration.id.at.while any of these conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to create a liberty interest,the court concluded,taken together they impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context.id.
in deciding whether changes to an inmate conditions of confinement implicate a cognizable liberty interest,both sandin and austin considered the nature of the confinement and its duration in relation to prison norms and to the terms of the individual sentence.in sandin,a placement in disciplinary segregation did not suffice to implicate a protected liberty interest in austin,an indefinite placement in a prison facility with highly restrictive conditions together with other features of the transfer sufficed to implicate such an interest,id.at.
consistent with these decisions,most if not all of our sister circuits have considered the nature of the confinement and its duration in determining whether it imposes an atypical and significant hardship.see,iqbal hasty,cir noting that r elevant factors in determining whether a liberty interest is implicated include both the conditions of segregation and its duration and holding that s egregation of longer than days is sufficiently atypical to require procedural due process protection under sandin skinner cunningham,st cir holding that a liberty interest was not implicated because,among other reasons,the duration of the plaintiff segregation was not excessive stephens cottey,cir,in determining whether prison conditions meet this sandin standard,courts place a premium on the duration of the deprivation serrano francis,cir noting that a relevant factor is the duration of the condition shoats horn,cir noting that a relevant factor is the amount of time the prisoner was placed into disciplinary segregation and stating that we have no difficulty concluding that eight years in administrative custody is atypical and significant in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life hatch district of columbia,remanding case and noting that,even if the conditions the inmate faced were no more restrictive than ordinary conditions of administrative segregation,the district court should determine whether its weeks was atypical compared to the length of administrative segregation routinely imposed on similarly situated prisoners perkins kansas dep t of,cir remanding case for district court to consider both the duration and
