alena denton applied for disability benefits for the period between april and march,claiming that she could not work because of fibromyalgia,hypothyroidism,and depression.according to denton treating physician,denton could not work because she could lift and carry less than ten pounds and could not reach overhead.the administrative law judge alj agreed with these physical concluded that even with these limitations there were still more than positions within her capacity.on appeal denton contends the alj reached this conclusion only by improperly ignoring the symptoms of her depression and other evidence suggesting disability.the alj did,however,assess all this evidence,and his conclusion was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
denton,years old at the alleged onset of disability,worked as a hand packager when pain from lifting began to affect her.in august she began to experience right elbow pain,especially when lifting bags at work.her family doctor diagnosed right medial epicondylitis also known as golfer elbow,told her to lift no more than pounds,and placed her on light duty at work.yet a month later,she continued to report elbow pain.the family doctor told her to stop working temporarily and attend physical therapy.the next month the doctor released denton to light duty at work for shifts,with a lifting restriction.
her pain continued,though,so her doctor referred denton to an orthopedist.the orthopedist also diagnosed right medial epicondylitis,prescribed naproxen and a steroid shot,and gave denton an elbow brace.he told denton to avoid repeatedly using her right arm and to lift no more than five pounds.although denton pain improved after the injection,she continued to have forearm pain,which prompted the orthopedist to order two further tests,an electromyogram emg and magnetic resonance imaging mri.these revealed possible carpal tunnel syndrome and mild degenerative changes.
by april,the date that denton claims her disability started,denton had stopped working altogether,citing the unavailability of work.because the orthopedist believed that neither the emg nor the mri could fully explain denton continued pain,he referred denton to ruth craddock,a rheumatologist,for a second opinion.
denton first visited craddock in june.at that time craddock noted tenderness in denton forearms and in several other areas.craddock observed,though,that denton had full range of motion and full grip strength.craddock concluded that denton originally sustained an overuse injury that had developed into fibromyalgia in addition,after observing an abnormal thyroid function,craddock theorized that if denton were developing hypothyroidism,it would help explain her musculoskeletal pain.
craddock repeated these findings about fibromyalgia a month later and advised her that she could nonetheless seek work.specifically craddock told denton that she could seek retraining along the lines of office work or something that would not result in such repetitive motion to the right upper extremity.when denton continued to report tenderness in august,craddock prescribed lexapro to relieve the pain,but did not alter the conclusion that denton could perform office work.
denton told craddock that she was not working or using her arms because of pain,and asked craddock to list denton limitations on her disability insurance claim.craddock wrote in october that denton was fatigued,but nonetheless had an unlimited ability to sit,and could stand and walk.denton could lift and carry ten pounds and push and pull five pounds,but only with her left hand.she could not lift,carry,push,or pull with her right hand.craddock also said that denton could not tolerate temperature extremes,wet or humid conditions,vibration,odors,fumes,or particles.she also could not work around heavy machinery because her medicine made her dizzy.finally craddock again speculated to denton that hypothyroidism might be a significant cause of her symptoms but did not prescribe medication for her thyroid.
to treat her continuing pain,in october her family physician prescribed physical therapy and a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit.examination by craddock three months later continued to reveal some tenderness,though denton was far less tender the following month.four months later,in june,denton gynecologist prescribed synthroid for denton potentially worsening hypothyroidism.
after applying for disability benefits,denton was directed to see jerry boyd for a consultive psychological evaluation in july,to whom she reported that she had been depressed for the past year.boyd found normal memory and intellectual functioning,and no evidence of hallucinations,delusions,psychosis,or paranoia.he concluded that she had a depressive disorder,but that it was in partial remission because of her lexapro regimen.he also assigned a global assessment of functionality gaf score of.a review of boyd evaluation by another state agency psychologist concluded that denton did not have a severe mental impairment.
in september,two months later,denton visited craddock again.the doctor adjusted denton medication based on her reported overwhelming fatigue and muscle tenderness.craddock opined during this visit that denton fatigue and pain precluded her from working overtime,but again she did not exclude all work.
in january,without visiting craddock,denton requested that she complete a fibromyalgia worksheet.on that form,craddock confirmed that denton suffered from fatigue,sleep disturbance,and morning stiffness,and noted that denton suffered from pain at a number of tender points.in her handwritten notes,craddock added that denton remains disabled,unable to do her job this time.a residual functional capacity report that craddock completed the same day concluded,without citing any clinical tests,that denton was unable to perform a sedentary job as defined by social security regulations.craddock also noted that denton would require more than one hour of break time during an work shift and that denton could be expected to miss about three days of work each month.
denton next visited craddock in march and then again in august.at the march visit,craddock adjusted denton pain medication because she continued to report pain and fatigue.by august craddock summarized denton past ability to work i have stated on multiple occasions that denton should probably be able to return to work in some capacity,and though she could not return to her previous work,she should be able to perform fairly sedentary activity.
denton claims that she was disabled from april,through march.in a order,the alj detailed the decision to deny disability benefits.the alj found that denton had severe impairments,namely fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism but not depression.in determining denton residual functional capacity rfc,the alj relied primarily on the october evaluation by craddock,finding that denton could not lift,carry,push,or pull more than five pounds but could sit,stand and walk.the alj also determined that denton could only occasionally reach with her right arm,frequently reach with her left arm,but never reach overhead with either arm.finally,the alj also adopted craddock opinion about denton environmental constraints and restrictions around unprotected heights and hazardous machinery.
based on these limitations,the alj agreed with denton that she could not return to her previous work as a hand packager.but consistent with the vocational expert testimony and craddock opinions during all of denton office visits from to august though contrary to the form craddock completed in january without seeing denton,the alj concluded that denton could engage in some but not all sedentary work.the alj specifically identified sedentary work as a surveillance system monitor or circuit board that more than of these positions exist in illinois.accordingly,the alj concluded that denton was not disabled for the period of april,to march.
the appeals council denied review.on judicial review,the magistrate judge recommended that the alj decision be affirmed,and the district court adopted the report,affirming the commissioner decisi
