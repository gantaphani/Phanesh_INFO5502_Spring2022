opinion of the court 
in this appeal,although conocophillips bayway refinery is the real party in interest,we are asked to decide between different interpretations of agency regulations the one announced by the secretary of labor,the other by the occupational safety and health review commission.both entities are part and parcel of the department of labor.in this appeal,because two factions within the same government agency disagree with each other over the application of a standard,we are thrust into resolving what is essentially an internal dispute.we do so here,and hold that the secretary interpretation comports with the standard we established in secretary of labor trinity industries,cir 
the secretary of labor secretary petitioned this court to challenge the determination of the occupational safety and health review commission commission that nine asbestos violations by conocophillips bayway refinery conoco were not serious rather than serious under.the secretary originally cited conoco for nine serious violations of the asbestos in construction standard,under the occupational safety and health act act.the administrative law judge alj affirmed all of the violations and upheld the classification of the violations as serious.the commission thereafter reduced the classification of the nine violations to,in part because the secretary failed to present evidence of possible employee exposure to asbestos.
we conclude that the commission misapplied this court precedent in secretary of labor trinity industries,cir.we will therefore vacate the order of the commission,and remand to the commission with the direction that the citations be affirmed as serious and that the penalty for the violations be reconsidered.
pursuant to the act,the secretary shall promulgate occupational safety and health standards.the occupational safety and health administration osha,an agency within the department of labor,helps the secretary promulgate these standards.osha regulates asbestos exposure at construction standard and industry standard,and has determined that asbestos is a harmful substance.occupational exposure to asbestos,tremolite,anthophyllite,and actinolite,june,to be codified at pt occupational exposure to asbestos,to be codified at pt.
the construction standard standard,the regulation at issue in this case,prescribes certain protective requirements based on the measurable concentration of asbestos fibers to which employees are or may be exposed,and contains a second set of specific requirements that apply regardless of the level of exposure.
the standard sets a permissible exposure limit pel of fiber per cubic centimeter of air,and imposes certain assessment and monitoring requirements to ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of this limit c.this pel represents the lowest exposure level that can be reliably measured.the standard recognizes a significant risk even under a pel of,and in order to reduce that risk to the extent practicable,the standard has taken an approach of adding certain protective provisions based on the kind of operations being regulated.see also id.acknowledging that the level leaves a remaining significant risk.additionally,measured levels of exposure often fail to define risk,and with regard to removal work the type of work at issue in this case,highly variable amounts of asbestos are generated.id.therefore,the standard requires such employees to be protected in order to assure each asbestos worker is exposed to the lowest feasible level.id.the mandated work practices are important because they assure that each asbestos worker is exposed to the lowest feasible level.id.the operations for which mandatory work practices are required would otherwise result in employee exposure that is significant.id.
the standard classifies asbestos work activities into four classes,of which only class i and class ii are relevant in this appeal.
class i asbestos work refers to activities involving the removal of tsi thermal system insulation,surfacing acm asbestos containing material and pacm presumed asbestos containing material.b.
class ii asbestos work consists of the removal of acm which is neither tsi nor surfacing material for example,wallboard,floor tile and sheeting and construction mastics.id.
the work at issue in this case falls into class ii.protective requirements for class ii work include the establishment of a regulated area e the use of respirators h in the absence of a negative exposure assessment,the use of protective clothing i and training of employees k iv c.
all employers with workplaces covered by the standard must conduct an initial exposure assessment before or at the beginning of an operation to ascertain expected exposures of asbestos.f.for class i asbestos work,until the employer conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that job will not be exposed in excess of the pels,the employer shall presume that employees are exposed in excess of the limit.id.f ii.
violations of osha standards are characterized as willful,repeated,serious,or not serious referred to by the commission as.see.a violation is serious if 
t here is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists,or from one or more practices,means,methods,operations,or processes which have been adopted or are in use,in such place of employment unless the employer did not,and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence,know of the presence of the violation.
id.k.serious and not serious violations are both subject to civil penalties of up to.a penalty is mandatory for serious violations.id.b,c.
conoco operates a refinery in linden,new jersey.in september,conoco determined that an underground pipeline installed in the early was leaking gasoline and needed to be partially replaced.the gas line,in diameter,was housed inside a protective pipe the sleeve,which was coated with a substance the mastic.conoco did not initially test the mastic to determine whether it contained asbestos.conoco also failed to perform an initial exposure assessment before removing a portion of the sleeve and cutting into the mastic.three conoco mechanics worked with the pipe without taking all of the precautions mandated by.one conoco mechanic used a hammer and chisel for about thirty minutes to chip an approximately band of mastic from around the circumference of the sleeve.a second mechanic then cut through the sleeve where the mastic had been removed with a torch for another thirty minutes.a third conoco mechanic held the sleeve in a sling while it was torched.these activities were performed without using wet methods to control exposures and without establishing a regulated area.the mechanics did not use or wear specialized equipment or clothing.
on september,conoco began an investigation into potential employee exposures resulting from the work performed on the underground pipe.conoco established an investigation team consisting of two union representatives and two conoco management employees.the team decided to conduct a mock test on an intact portion of the pipe sleeve to determine whether exposure to airborne asbestos fibers could have occurred.the test attempted to replicate the work that the employees working on the sleeve had conducted.the investigation report stated that the mock testing results showed no detectible levels of airborne asbestos in the breathing zone samples.the secretary disputed the validity of this testing before the alj,but the alj determined that the mock testing was not invalid.however,the alj also determined that there is no reason to conclude that no asbestos was released during the cited work and that there was no exposure to asbestos fibers.rather,the alj found it more likely than not that asbestos fibers were released during the cited work and that exposure to asbestos occurred.id.the alj did determine,based in part on the testing and the low levels of fibers detected,that the likelihood of injury was low.id.
after osha conducted an inspection of the refinery,the secretary,on march,cited conoco for the following violations
