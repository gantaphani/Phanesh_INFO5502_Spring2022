this case stems from a claim that the city of lynn,massachusetts,and an agency working under its direction,failed to responsibly handle funds distributed to the commonwealth of massachusetts by the federal government for use in employment training and rehabilitation programs,and that the massachusetts state government failed to monitor lynn use of those funds according to procedures specified by the federal department of labor dol.dol has ordered the state to repay some of the funds,and the state objects.because we find that the dol has the better of the arguments,we affirm the decision of the administrative review board the board and deny the commonwealth petition for review.
under the now defunct job training partnership act jtpa,et repealed,dol made funds available to the states for job training and rehabilitation programs the jtpa stated purpose during the period pertinent to this case was to prepare youth and adults facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services that will result in increased employment and earnings.the statute created a number of programs under its various titles.this case deals with the disbursement of funds under titles ii and iii of the statute.
the board characterized the programs under title ii as designed to benefit disadvantaged youth and adults and those under title iii as providing employment training assistance for dislocated workers.under both titles the act called upon dol to distribute funds to the state governors or their proxies in participating states.in massachusetts,it was the department of employment and training det that administered the title ii funds at the state level,while the corporation for business,work,and learning cbwl and its predecessor agency,the industrial services program isp,administered the title iii funds.det and in turn parceled out the money for use in geographically distinct service delivery areas sdas in order to do so,they would designate a grant recipient generally a local government,see,as well as an administrative entity that would take responsibility for implementing the various jtpa programs.this case involves the service delivery area for lynn lynn sda and the efforts of dol to recover funds from massachusetts that are untraceable and may have been substantively misspent.
programs for the lynn sda were administered by an entity called northshore employment training northshore.in,northshore received its first warning from det the commonwealth had been reviewing northshore financial records,and had identified relatively minor problems.the state directed northshore to develop a plan to ensure better reporting.over the course of the next two years,however,northshore financial accounting did not improve,and massachusetts progressively increased its oversight of northshore and eventually decertified it.at all stages,dol,through its boston office,appears to have been apprised of northshore increasingly apparent financial mismanagement,and to have been involved in cooperative efforts with massachusetts to monitor the program,contain the damage,and get the lynn sda back on track.despite the best efforts of the federal,state,and local authorities,however,northshore inched towards complete failure.in the summer of,det accused northshore of financial mismanagement and took over partial control of some of the lynn programs.in october of that year,lynn sda was formally designated as a high risk grantee for its failure to comply with the various corrective plans imposed by the commonwealth agencies in charge of monitoring northshore.in april,det described northshore financial system as not operational or coherent and decertified northshore as a jtpa funding recipient,and in june,northshore closed its doors and the greater lowell regional employment board took over its employment service responsibilities.subsequently,massachusetts began proceedings to collect from the city of lynn that it considered misspent because lynn had not maintained adequate records.lynn made efforts to avoid repayment.
during and after this period of decline,massachusetts authorities received public plaudits from the boston office of the dol for their efforts to manage the lynn sda crisis and to recover wasted funds from lynn,tempered by reminders that as the immediate recipient of the jtpa funds massachusetts was ultimately individually responsible to the dol for any funds not recovered from lynn.in,dol office of the inspector general received its own audit,performed under contract by deloitte and touche,llp,cpas,of the lynn program.the audit noted that massachusetts had made a determination against lynn that disallowed to lynn in jtpa title ii funds and in title iii funds.later that year,dol began administrative proceedings seeking a declaration that massachusetts had misspent federal funds from to by distributing the same to the local agency when massachusetts had not guaranteed that lynn was complying or capable of complying with the federal accounting requirements.in may the grant officer responsible for prosecuting the case made a formal determination charging the commonwealth with just over million in misspent funds.the commonwealth appealed to an administrative law judge alj,who directed the grant officer to permit the state to show evidence on certain points that could reduce its liability.the grant officer did so but arrived again at her initial conclusion,and the commonwealth appealed to the alj for a second time.the alj then reversed roughly million of the original million in charges to the state,finding that the commonwealth had adequately documented this portion of the expenditures and that these funds had been spent responsibly.the grant officer appealed to the administrative review board,dol final and authoritative adjudicative body.the board remanded to the alj,requiring greater clarity with respect to certain points on remand,after making the required findings,the alj abandoned his former disposition and affirmed the grant officer original position that the state owed the full million.massachusetts once again appealed the alj disposition to the board,which affirmed in all respects.
the board basic theory was that massachusetts had violated its obligation to ensure that the regional agencies that received its funds often referred to in the bureaucratic argot as subrecipients maintained financial records capable of demonstrating how those funds were spent.as an initial matter,massachusetts had failed to compel the lynn sda to conduct the annual audit required by the single audit act,saa,and implementing regulations.this failure,on the board interpretation,opened up the possibility of repayment liability,and the state was then given an opportunity to demonstrate that the lynn sda had in fact spent its federal funds for purposes.as a practical matter,the grant officer and various reviewing entities were looking for rigorously collected and properly thorough source documentation consisting of receipts,invoices,cancelled checks,and the like.where massachusetts was able to produce such documentation,the grant officer dropped claims of misspending,but where the state could not produce the documentation,the board charged it for the funds.
in lieu of some of the missing source documentation,the commonwealth submitted a detailed accounting,called a reconstructed trial balance rtb,in which the state own auditor attempted to reconstruct northshore finances throughout the period at issue.in the board words,the rtb represented an accounting consultant reconstruction of the lynn sda records,which was undertaken in an effort to produce an auditable set of financial records.the state also submitted statements by its own agents that they had themselves consistently reviewed northshore source documents with respect to certain aspects of the program.in the commonwealth view,the post hoc accounting and state agent testimony constituted substitute evidence of northshore essentially proper management of its financial affairs,and it argued that in light of this uncontradicted evidence the board should have found that the funds were properly spent.
the state thus contended that the requirements of the jtpa and regulations are not substantive obligations,but are instead simply one way of enforcing the underlying requirement that a state take sufficient care to direct its jtpa funds towards activities.the state position was that it had provided satisfactory substitute assurances of good financial management and should not have been penalized for failing to abide by the particular requirements of the relevant provisions.
the board in fact adopted roughly this legal position,but rejected the state specific claims because the evidence the state provided was not sufficient to convince the board that the funds were properly spent.the board crucially noted that the rtb was not itself based on source documentation,but was in essence nothing more than an accountant speculation as to what probably happened to the funds disbursed by northshore.it likewise found insufficient the state agents testimony that they had themselves reviewed source documentation at northshore.massachusetts now petitions for review of the board decision.
in its petition,massachusetts raises three questions,asking whether the board acted within its authority in determining that as a legal matter massachusetts could have violated the terms of the jtpa on the facts alleged by the grant officer whether the board decision to disallow the expenses and seek repayment was not supported by substantial evidence because the board chose not to accept as sufficient the evidence proffered by the state and whether the board abused its discretion when it decided not to forgive the state its obligation to repay.
the jtpa requires a state to comply with a host of rules in order to qualify for funding.the rules relevant to this case fall into two broad categories.on one side of the line,the jtpa imposes limitations on the uses to which federal funds may be put.these substantive regulations govern expenses incurred by regional agencies in providing employment training services.among other requirements,the regulations prescribe that an agency spending jtpa funds can only incur costs that are necessary and reasonable to the proper and efficient administration of the program.a a.the agency must also classify its expenditures according to the categories prescribed by statute and the statute and regulations prescribe maximum expenditures for certain example,the regulations specify that depending on the program administrative costs can amount to no more than fifteen or twenty percent of total expenditures.
in order to ensure compliance with these and other substantive limitations on expenditures,the statute and regulations place a heavy emphasis on financial management and accountability,and the other category of relevant regulations is the set of rules specifying the state and agency responsibilities to account for their use of funds.these oversight provisions specify the mechanisms through which states and their jtpa subrecipients must demonstrate to dol that they are fulfilling their obligations under the substantive provisions of the act.among them is the requirement that e ach state shall establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure the proper disbursal of,and accounting for,federal funds paid to the recipient under subchapters ii and iii of this chapter,a.the statute goes on to specify that s uch procedures shall ensure that all financial transactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each state.id.
massachusetts maintains that it and the lynn sda were largely in compliance with all relevant substantive provisions of the act and regulations throughout the relevant time periods.the state contends that the roughly million at stake in these proceedings except for a few small sums it has conceded were misused was spent to procure job training services as directed by the jtpa,and that dol is wrong to try to recoup the money.massachusetts ran into trouble,however,when it came time to demonstrate to the agency that the funds were appropriately spent.the usual method for demonstrating substantive compliance is through the completion of an independent audit.such an audit is required by the saa,as implemented at part and made applicable to jtpa programs by b.
an saa audit would have reviewed the substate agency financial records,examined receipts,invoices,and cancelled checks,and made a determination as to the degree of the agency compliance with the applicable regulations.where such an audit indicated that funds had been misspent,the right response would generally be twofold the imposition of financial sanctions on the state to the degree of the misexpenditure,and the proposal of remedial measures designed to prevent future misspending.here,however,no such audit was conducted.neither the statute nor the regulations specify precisely what ought to happen where an audit is never undertaken,but through its adjudication processes the board has developed a rule for determining what a fair reimbursement is under these circumstances.
section e in the code of federal regulations specifies that,where a determination under the jtpa is entrusted to a grant officer in the first instance,the grant officer bears the burden of producing evidence to support a determination against a party.thereafter,the regulation says,the party seeking to overturn the grant officer determination has the burden of persuasion.in this case,the board determined that the grant officer made a prima facie case that funds were misspent under d by offering evidence that an saa audit was not carried out.the state burden in response was to demonstrate that it either met the specific requirements imposed by the jtpa,that it had actually carried out an that it had compensated for any deficiencies through other means.
as a technical matter,under this system the dol charges the state with misspending simply because it has failed to properly put in place the appropriate accounting safeguards the failure to conduct an audit constitutes a violation of the jtpa in itself.dol then limits the amount of the charged repayment to the amount which the state can not demonstrate was spent in compliance with the substantive regulations.in order to demonstrate that compliance,the state must show source documentation,and where it does,it earns the right to avoid repaying the funds to the dol.the practical effect of this system is that the state is responsible for repaying to dol any funds it can not prove were spent in compliance with the substantive regulations.in the words of the board,lynn was obligated not only to implement and maintain fiscal controls that ensured that northshore funds were expended in compliance with all pertinent jtpa requirements,but also to maintain adequate records to demonstrate that such expenditures complied with the act.emphasis in original.
although massachusetts attempted to prove substantive compliance with the jtpa in lieu of presenting a clean audit,the board concluded that the evidence it presented was not sufficiently detailed,reliable,and extensive to meet its burden.our review of the final determination of the board under the jtpa is deferential.we are bound by the board findings of fact so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.a.while the statute grants us authority to review the legal determinations of the board,see,as a general matter we defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of a statute that it administers.gioioso sons,occupational safety health review comm n,cir citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d strickland comm r,me.dep t of human,cir.we similarly defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its own regulations so long as those regulations and the interpretation are themselves reasonable given the statute,and will respect an agency interpretation of its own regulation as long as the interpretation meshes sensibly with the regulation language and purpose.id.citing martin occupational safety health review comm n,d.
