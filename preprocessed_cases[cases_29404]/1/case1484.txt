consolidation coal company consolidation petitions for review of a final decision issued by the benefits review board board of the department of labor dol affirming an award of black lung benefits by an administrative law judge alj to billy williams under the federal coal mine health safety act of act,et.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the board decision and deny the petition.
billy williams was a coal miner for at least thirty years.in,williams began his employment as a mechanic and welder in one of consolidation preparation plants.in his last position,he performed the same duties at one of consolidation outside coal mine shops from to,at which point he retired due to shortness of breath.
on july,williams filed his first claim for black lung benefits before the dol.while the claim was pending,jerome lebovitz examined williams on september,and sent a letter dated november,with attached reports to williams counsel.lebovitz letter stated his view that williams was permanently and totally disabled secondary to the entity of coal worker pneumoconiosis.despite receiving the letter,neither williams nor his counsel sent it to the dol.
at the dol request,andrzej jaworski examined williams on october.jaworski ultimately concluded that williams respiratory impairments would not prevent him from performing his position as a shop mechanic.thereafter,on january,the dol denied williams claim for benefits.
on june,williams filed a second claim for black lung benefits.in connection with this claim,five physicians examined williams.first,prasad devabhaktuni took of williams lungs on july,and diagnosed williams with hypertension,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to smoking,and coal worker pneumoconiosis secondary to occupational dust exposure.during his deposition,devabhaktuni testified that williams chronic obstructive pulmonary disease resulted primarily from his smoking habits,but that his coal mine dust exposure could have contributed to the impairment.in addition,devabhaktuni stated that he diagnosed coal worker pneumoconiosis based on the and williams occupational history.
second,joseph renn,iii examined williams on october,and determined that williams suffered from chronic bronchitis with obstruction secondary to cigarette smoking.renn also concluded that coal mine dust exposure did not contribute to williams chronic bronchitis,and that williams did not have pneumoconiosis.finally,renn opined that williams would be able to perform his last position as a shop mechanic.
third,john parker performed pulmonary function studies on williams,and reviewed the reports prepared by devabhaktuni and renn.in reviewing williams,parker concluded that they did not establish pneumoconiosis.nevertheless,parker cited several studies in support of his view that people with coal mine dust exposure may have airflow obstruction with a normal radiograph.based on these studies,parker opined that people with pneumoconiosis could exhibit small opacities of the type,and that it was unusual for an elderly patient such as williams to have rounded changes of that nature.for these reasons,parker concluded that williams lungs likely contained some macules of pneumoconiosis.
parker further determined that williams suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease resulting from a combination of tobacco smoke inhalation as well as work place dust exposure.parker admitted that it was impossible to apportion the cause of williams airflow obstruction between exposure to cigarette smoking or coal mine dust.however,parker declined to rule out coal dust exposure as a cause of williams airflow obstruction using renn approach,which examined the expiratory flow rate,because,in parker view,the expiratory flow rate was an unreliable indicator subject to daily variance.parker thus concluded that williams lung injury definitely arose,at least in part,from coal dust exposure because he was a coal miner and because his chest radiograph was not normal.ultimately,parker opined that williams breathing impairment would prevent him from returning to his last position as a shop mechanic.
fourth,david rosenberg reviewed the medical reports prepared by jaworski,lebovitz,devabhaktuni,and renn,as well as readings performed by other physicians of an taken on october.as an initial matter,rosenberg determined that the did not establish pneumoconiosis.although rosenberg noted some moderate obstruction in williams airways,he opined that this condition was due to tobacco smoke,and not coal mine dust exposure.finally,because williams maximum voluntary ventilation mvv appeared normal,rosenberg concluded that williams could return to his previous coal mining position.
fifth,robert cohen reviewed the medical reports prepared by devabhaktuni,renn,parker,and rosenberg,and conducted his own,physical exam,and pulmonary function tests on july.cohen concluded that williams suffered from coal worker pneumoconiosis based on the following considerations williams significant occupational exposure to coal mine dust for years williams symptoms of chronic lung disease,which included progressively worsening shortness of breath and cough and wheezing and sputum production pulmonary function studies indicating moderate obstruction with diffusion impairment arterial blood gases showing mild hypoxemia and a chest indicating a positive reading for opacities consistent with classical pneumoconiosis at a profusion of.cohen opined that even setting aside the evidence,he would still conclude that williams demonstrated clinical and physiological signs of pneumoconiosis.
cohen asserted that renn,rosenberg,and jaworksi incorrectly concluded that coal mine dust exposure failed to contribute to williams obstructive lung disease.in citing several academic studies,cohen argued that coal mine dust can cause significant airflow obstruction.specifically,cohen argued that these studies established a correlation between coal mine dust exposure and substantial decreases in lung function,forced vital capacity,forced expiratory volume in one second,forced expiratory flow,and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity.ultimately,cohen concluded that williams lung impairments would prevent him from performing his previous job as a shop mechanic 
on september,the alj held a hearing on williams second claim for black lung benefits.although the parties raised a host of evidentiary issues,the alj expressed its intention to admit the exhibits in their entirety,note the objections,and permit motions to strike.williams subsequently presented testimony in support of his claim.immediately after the close of williams case,consolidation moved for summary judgment,asserting that williams second claim was barred by the time limitation triggered by lebovitz report under.the alj provisionally denied the motion with leave to renew the motion in submissions.
the alj then addressed williams outstanding motion to compel with respect to fourteen interrogatories served prior to the hearing.upon representation from counsel that consolidation had disclosed all of the records relevant to the experts diagnoses,williams withdrew the motion to compel with respect to interrogatories one through four which sought all,medical reports,and records relevant to williams case.
with respect to the remaining interrogatories,consolidation argued that they were irrelevant and overly burdensome.in rejecting consolidation objection to williams interrogatory five,which sought the number of referrals consolidation had made to renn,the alj opined that it was relevant to show bias and a number of referrals.after williams agreed to limit the interrogatory to referrals from consolidation to its counsel,and to a time period of to,the alj granted the motion to compel.
with respect to interrogatory six,which sought the number of cases in which renn had found pneumoconiosis,the alj and consolidation became engaged in an increasingly heated exchange.ultimately,in granting the motion to compel with respect to interrogatory six,the alj specifically stated t his is discovery.i not making any findings.
as the alj addressed interrogatories seven through fourteen,which addressed issues of bias for renn and rosenberg,consolidation again asserted that the information sought was irrelevant to bias.in granting the motion to compel with respect to these interrogatories,the alj stressed that the discovery requests were reasonable.
following the hearing,the alj issued a formal order dated december,explaining its reasons for compelling discovery.in that order,the alj stated that b ased on many years of involvement in expert testimony as an examiner,cross examiner,and administrative law judge,i am convinced that doctors are no less biased by money and by longstanding relations with patients,law firms and the law firms clients than is anyone else.after noting that renn testified frequently on behalf of coal mine companies for black lung specifically,in cases involving consolidation alj determined that the probative value of the discovery relating to possible bias outweighed the burden of compliance.the alj reserved decision on williams motion to exclude the reports of renn and rosenberg.
after the board denied consolidation interlocutory appeal of the alj december,order,the alj issued a second discovery order dated march,directing consolidation to release information responsive to interrogatories five through fourteen.on april,an en banc panel of the board denied consolidation request for reconsideration.consolidation nevertheless refused to comply with the discovery orders and did not disclose any of the requested information.
on april,the alj denied consolidation renewed motion for summary judgment concerning the timeliness of williams second claim for black lung benefits,and set a briefing schedule regarding the benefits determination.after considering the parties briefs,the alj issued its decision granting williams black lung benefits on june.in its opinion,the alj resolved several preliminary matters that are relevant to the present petition for review.specifically,the alj granted williams motion to strike lebovitz report denied consolidation request to reassign the case to another judge denied consolidation third motion for dismissal based on the statute of limitations and declined to strike the reports of renn and rosenberg as a discovery sanction for consolidation noncompliance with the alj december,and march,orders.the alj then expressed its intent to treat the reports proffered by renn and rosenberg as if consolidation had complied with discovery and as if its responses to that discovery had demonstrated significant bias by both witnesses toward employers as a class and its law firm clients as a class.
with respect to its merits determination,the alj credited the opinions of parker and cohen over the opinions of renn and rosenberg.in so doing,the alj made the following findings of fact parker had credentials that were superior to those of renn and rosenberg the opinions of cohen and parker were more reasoned and persuasive than the opinions of renn and rosenberg renn and rosenberg did not exhibit a contemporary knowledge of medical research and renn and rosenberg misunderstood the aspects of williams work.
on august,the board affirmed the alj disposition of the matter in its entirety.consolidation has petitioned for review of the board decision,asserting that williams second claim for benefits was untimely the alj was biased against consolidation and coal mine companies in general the alj abused its discretion in making certain discovery and evidentiary rulings and the alj improperly credited the opinions of cohen and parker in awarding benefits to williams.
we apply de novo review to the legal conclusions made by the board and the alj.consolidation coal held,cir.in addition,we engage in an independent review of the record to determine whether substantial evidence exists to support the alj findings of fact.island creek coal compton,cir.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.milburn colliery hicks,cir quoting consol.edison nlrb.specifically,it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
consolidation first contends that williams black lung claim,which was filed more than three years after he received lebovitz diagnosis of totally disabling coal worker pneumoconiosis,was untimely.section of title provides that any claim for benefits shall be filed within three years after whichever of the following occurs later a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis or march.f.the implementing regulation,further explains that the statute of limitations is triggered when the miner receives a medical determination of total disability arising from pneumoconiosis 
a claim for benefits filed under this part by,or on behalf of,a miner shall be filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis which has been communicated to the miner or a person responsible for the care of the miner,or within three years after the date of enactment of the black lung benefits reform act of,whichever is later.
the facts of this appeal present an unusual situation in which williams received lebovitz diagnosis in,but failed to submit that diagnosis prior to the dol ultimate denial of his first claim for black lung benefits in.thereafter,williams filed his second claim for benefits in years after he learned of lebovitz diagnosis.thus,we must determine,as a threshold matter,whether williams receipt of lebovitz report triggered the statute of limitations for his second claim.
this issue of first impression causes us to consider our en banc decision in lisa lee mines director,office of workers compensation programs,cir,which discussed the appropriate standard applied to a miner subsequent claim for black lung benefits in light of a prior denial of benefits.in lisa lee mines,we recognized the finality considerations that attach to a prior denial of black lung benefits.id.at holding that a prior denial of benefits is final in a legal sense.specifically,the legal conclusion attendant with a prior,that the miner was not eligible for benefits at the time of that be accepted as correct and is as to criticism by the respondent as by the claimant.id.this rule of finality,we reasoned,is responsive to the general difficulty in accurately diagnosing pneumoconiosis 
accepting the correctness of a final judgment is more than legalistic tunnel vision it is a the only to discern a concrete form in the mists of the past.the ease we might feel at this final judgment ought not tempt us to overestimate our retrospective perspicacity most black lung claims involve a mixed bag of test results and wildly divergent medical opinions.the final decision of the alj or brb or claims examiner on the spot is the best evidence of the truth at the time.
because a prior denial is both final and correct,lisa lee mines rejected the test articulated by the seventh circuit in sahara coal director,office of workers compensation programs,cir,which required the miner to show that he did not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it,or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application.id.at.in so doing,we reasoned that sahara coal improperly permit ted in fact demand ed a plenary review of the evidence behind the first claim by forcing the miner to affirmatively prove that each of the alj adverse determinations underlying the prior denial was correct.lisa lee mines,at.to accommodate the finality considerations that attach to a prior denial,we instead adopted a standard that presumed that the factual determinations underlying a prior denial are correct and simply required the miner to disprove the continuing validity of at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him in showing a material change in conditions.id.
although lisa lee mines primarily addressed the appropriate test applied to subsequent claims,the principles of finality expressed within the decision clearly bear on this appeal.in light of lisa lee mines,we must accept the dol denial of williams first claim in as final and correct,regardless of whether the dol reviewed lebovitz diagnosis in adjudicating the claim.for this reason,the dol legal determination that williams was not totally disabled due to coal worker pneumoconiosis as of january,necessarily refuted lebovitz diagnosis that williams had contracted the disease by that point.moreover,because we must treat lebovitz diagnosis,for legal purposes,as a misdiagnosis in light of the denial of williams first claim,we must similarly conclude that the mis diagnosis had no effect on the statute of limitations for his second claim.see wyoming fuel director,office of workers comp.programs,cir a final finding by an office of workers compensation program adjudicator that the claimant is not totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis repudiates any earlier medical determination to the contrary and renders prior medical advice to the contrary ineffective to trigger the running of the statute of limitations.emphasis added.
our conclusion is consistent with the act view of pneumoconiosis,its treatment of subsequent claims,and its remedial purpose.first,the act explicitly recognizes that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease c.based on this understanding of pneumoconiosis,we have acknowledged that nothing bars or should bar claimants from filing claims seriatim,and the regulations recognize that many will.lisa lee mines,at.see also id.the health of a human being is not susceptible to adjudication.citing treatise id.at pneumoconiosis is a progressive disease,and no rational system of law or of medicine could stand on the proposition that it can or must be measured only once.although consolidation relies on certain dicta expressed in the sixth circuit decision in tennessee consolidated coal kirk,cir,which suggests that misdiagnoses can trigger the statute of limitations for subsequent claims the progressive nature of the disease dictates that a claimant must be free to reapply for benefits if his first filing was premature.sharondale ross,cir.we see no reason why a miner who has been denied benefits because he presented legally insufficient medical evidence must be forever barred from bringing a new claim even if he later develops pneumoconiosis.see wyoming fuel,at a claimant should not be barred from bringing a duplicate claim when his or her first claim was premature because the claimant conditions had not yet progressed to the point where the claimant met the act definition of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.internal citations omitted.
second,the act treatment of subsequent claims reveals the inherent unfairness in running the statute of limitations based on lebovitz diagnosis.in balancing the act view of pneumoconiosis as a latent and progressive disease with the need for administrative repose,the duplicate claims regulation,d,directs that subsequent claims shall be denied based on the earlier denial unless the miner demonstrates a material change in conditions.under lisa lee mines construction of d,the miner must prove,under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition after the prior denial,at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.lisa lee mines,at thus,only new evidence following the denial of the previous claim,rather than evidence predating the denial,can sustain a subsequent claim.also wyoming fuel,at in considering whether a claimant established a material change,the alj can consider only new evidence which relates to the conditions at the time of the second claim.labelle processing swarrow,cir if the miner earlier exposure to coal dust caused his present disability and pneumoconiosis was merely latent at the time of his initial application for benefits but has since become manifest,the miner would be entitled to prove that the disease has progressed to the point of total disability since the filing of his original claim.sharondale,at t he claimant can not prevail on a duplicate claim unless he shows a material change in his condition thus,the critical evidence in assessing whether to reopen the claim is the evidence accruing since the previous denial.
in light of the standard articulated in lisa lee mines,we note that lebovitz diagnosis,which related solely to williams condition in,could not have sustained a subsequent claim that his condition had materially worsened since the initial denial of benefits in.it would be illogical and inequitable to hold that a diagnosis that could not sustain a subsequent claim could nevertheless trigger the statute of limitations for such a claim.
third,the act remedial nature instructs us to interpret its provisions favorably toward miners.see labelle,at c ourts should liberally construe remedial legislation,such as the act,so as to include the largest number of claimants within its entitlement provisions.keeping the remedial purpose in mind,we recognize that a rule holding that misdiagnoses could ultimately bar claims for benefits will create a substantial chilling effect discouraging miners from seeking early examinations and second opinions.see peabody coal.at if a miner knows that a misdiagnosis will ultimately mean that he can never again seek benefits should he eventually contract this progressive disease,he will be less likely to be proactive in seeking medical advice during the early stages.the health consequences stemming from this chilling effect would be undoubtedly dire.moreover,we are cognizant of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing pneumoconiosis.thus,the rule we fashion today simply seeks to reconcile the mixed bag of test results and wildly divergent medical opinions usually attendant with black lung claims with the act remedial purpose of awarding benefits to deserving miners.lisa lee mines,at.
we therefore hold that a medical determination later deemed to be a misdiagnosis of pneumoconiosis by virtue of a superseding denial of benefits can not trigger the statute of limitations for subsequent claims.applying this rule to the facts of this appeal,we find that lebovitz diagnosis did not trigger the statute of limitations for williams second claim.moreover,having no further objections from consolidation,we presume that williams second claim was otherwise timely.c setting forth a rebuttable presumption that the miner claim was timely.accordingly,we conclude that williams second claim was timely.
having disposed of the timeliness issue,we turn to consolidation assertion that the board improperly affirmed the alj decision declining to recuse itself from the case.specifically,consolidation argues that the alj comments at the hearing and within the discovery order demonstrated its bias against coal mine companies.we find no merit in these contentions.
the supreme court has explained that bias in judicial refers to a favorable or unfavorable disposition or opinion that is somehow wrongful or inappropriate either because it is undeserved,rests upon knowledge that the subject ought not to possess,or is excessive in degree liteky united states,d.in this context,the court set forth the standard for finding judicial bias 
o pinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings,or of prior proceedings,do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.thus,judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of,or even hostile to,counsel,the parties,or their cases,ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.they may do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source and they will do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.
here,the challenged remarks followed consolidation objection to williams interrogatory six,which sought the number of cases in which renn had diagnosed pneumoconiosis.the ensuing colloquy between consolidation counsel and the alj proceeded as follows 
counsel judge,that impossible for me to determine without doing sic back through every client.
judge campbell well then,you going to have to d
