relator richard yuhasz brought a qui tam action against brush wellman,brush,claiming that brush violated the false claims act fca,et,and wrongfully terminated him in retaliation for his allegations of wrongdoing.after the united states declined to intervene,brush moved to dismiss the case pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the district court granted the motion.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
relator yuhasz was employed as a laboratory manager for brush at brush bronze alloy manufacturing facility in lorain,ohio,between september and january.at this facility,brush produces super alloys,spinodal alloys,and other specialty alloys that are supplied to the united states both directly and through intermediaries,including distributors,for use in aerospace and military aviation.some of the alloys,supplied under requirements of and pursuant to contracts with the united states,are subjected to further processing and manufacturing before being delivered to the united states.
yuhasz was hired to design and establish,and then operate as manager,a testing laboratory for its lorain facility.the laboratory was established to conduct chemical,mechanical,and physical testing of brush alloys.at the laboratory,yuhasz established the specifications for the laboratory equipment and both conducted and supervised testing procedures.
in order to claim or receive payments under government contracts,brush must submit certifications of compliance with technical specifications stating,representing,and warranting that the alloys were in strict conformity with specifications and that brush was,thereby,legally entitled to claim and receive payment.these certifications include certification pursuant to aerospace materials specifications,certification as to compliance with qqc specifications a government standard,and certification pursuant to the specifications of the american society for testing and materials.
on april,yuhasz filed this qui tam action,alleging that brush violated the fca by making false certifications by itself or through intermediaries and that brush wrongfully terminated him in retaliation for his allegations of improper conduct.after investigating yuhasz allegations,the united states declined to intervene on july.on september,brush moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted brush motion to dismiss on december.on january,yuhasz filed his notice of appeal.
a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure is reviewed de novo.goad mitchell,cir.pursuant to rule b,an action may be dismissed if the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.when considering a motion to dismiss,all allegations in the complaint are treated as true,and the dismissal of the complaint is deemed proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claims that would entitle it to relief.id.citing kostrzewa city of troy,cir see also conley gibson,d.
according to the fca 
any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person.
the purpose of the fca is to encourage any individual knowing of government fraud to bring that information forward.united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir mckenzie i quoting,reprinted in see also united states ex rel.dick long island lighting,cir t he purpose of the qui tam provisions of the false claims act is to encourage private individuals who are aware of fraud being perpetrated against the government to bring such information forward.quoting,at.if,as in this case,the government does not assert its statutory right to take over the case,the relator can recover between and thirty percent of any monies recovered from a settlement or judgment,in addition to reasonable expenses and attorneys fees and costs.d.
yuhasz claims that brush,by itself or through intermediaries,submitted fraudulent certifications and claims for payment to the united states and received payment from the united states for alloys not meeting government specifications,in violation of the fca.specifically,yuhasz alleges that brush 
had actual knowledge acted in deliberate disregard or ignorance of the truth or falsity of i alloy product that was due to defects such as cracks ii false and fraudulent certifications of compliance with technical specifications iii improper traceability and identifiability controls with respect to lots of alloy bar stock iv beryllium contamination in alloys,rendering such alloys v brush failure to perform requisite tests on the alloys,such as the mercurious nitrate testing and,vi the fact that requisite internal controls were not in place,rendering alloy products untraceable and unidentifiable.
the district court granted brush motion to dismiss,concluding that since the complaint did not state a specific false claim submitted to the government,yuhasz did not allege a fca claim with sufficient particularity as required under rule b.yuhasz brush wellman,d.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,in any complaint averring fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.the heightened pleading standard set forth in rule b applies to complaints brought under the fca.c omplaints brought under the fca must fulfill the requirements of rule b defendants accused of defrauding the federal government have the same protections as defendants sued for fraud in other contexts.california,cir see also united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir gold,cir cooper united states ex rel.blue cross blue shield of florida,cir.the requirement that fraud be plead with particularity need not be relaxed in fca cases in order to protect the public because the government ability to intervene on the basis of information brought to its attention vindicates the public interest.the sixth circuit interprets rule b as requiring plaintiffs to allege the time,place,and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which he or she relied the fraudulent scheme the fraudulent intent of the defendants and the injury resulting from the fraud.coffey foamex,cir quotation omitted.
the district court correctly found that yuhasz had failed to allege an fca claim with sufficient particularity as required by rule b.yuhasz complaint is short on specifics.for example,the complaint notes only that certain testing that was outsourced according to a particular eab number did not to any heat number for alloy bar stock and that certain alloys of brush may have been mismarked.emphasis added.however,the complaint contains no particularized allegations of wrongdoing.the failure to identify specific parties,contracts,or fraudulent acts requires dismissal.see united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir failure to allege with any specificity actual improper claims were submitted to the government is indeed fatal ex rel.walsh eastman kodak,d,relator first amended complaint,in essence,sets out a methodology by which the vendors might have produced false invoices,which in turn could have led to false claims.without citing a single false claim arising from an allegedly false invoice,relator has not met even a rule b test.united states ex rel.butler magellan health,d,plaintiff does plead a fraudulent scheme of conduct which may well be prohibited by law.however,plaintiff pleads no specific occurrences of a false claim t he absence of specific allegations of fraudulent false claims is determinative.
yuhasz concedes that he is unable to identify a specific claim submitted directly to the united states by a prime contractor who incorporated brush metal alloys into the finished product sold to the government,but argues that he is entitled to a relaxed standard of pleading due to the length and complexity of brush fraud.yuhasz notes that the complaint alleges fraudulent acts occurring over a period exceeding two years,and affecting virtually every alloy manufactured by brush during that period.as the district court observed,however,a plaintiff should not be able to avoid the specificity requirements of rule b by relying upon the complexity of the edifice which he created.united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,aff,cir.moreover,none of the cases upon which yuhasz principally relies,united states ex rel.roby boeing,united states united technologies,no,wl march,and united states ex rel.pogue american healthcorp,supports his position.
in roby,the plaintiff alleged that defendant the boeing corporation boeing and its supplier violated the fca by manufacturing and selling defective transmission gears to the united states via boeing d chinook army helicopters.at.boeing filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that because of the breadth of the accusation against it,defendant can only speculate as to which of the gears in service today are alleged to be nonconforming.id.at.the district court denied boeing motion and noted that the complaint alleged that boeing acted with the knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth with respect to every d helicopter it delivered to the united states.id.emphasis added.
yuhasz argues that the facts of the instant case are strikingly similar to those before the court in roby.this is not correct.in the instant case,yuhasz asserts in its brief only that virtually every certification was fraudulent and that virtually every alloy certified by brush during the time specified in the complaint was.emphasis added.the language of the complaint itself is even less specific,stating only that certain testing that was outsourced according to a particular eab number did not to any heat number for alloy bar stock,that certain alloys may have been mismarked,that yuhasz,upon accessing the original certifications,often discovered that the requisite mercurious nitrate testing had not been performed,that approximately of the product,and particularly smaller diameter product,failed to meet the requisite tensile strength,that drums were often not labeled,and that many of the certifications of compliance indicated the wrong alloy.emphasis added.furthermore,in roby the plaintiff identified the specific contract at issue the d helicopter contract and stated when,where,and how false statements were made to the government on forms presented to the government.at.in the instant case,yuhasz provides no such information.roby thus is easily distinguishable.
in united technologies,the government alleged that pratt and whitney pratt,a division of defendant united technologies corporation utc,fraudulently submitted a contract bid that knowingly overstated the prices to be charged by pratt subcontractors.wl at.the government further alleged that each bill,invoice,and price later presented by pratt to the government reflected these inflations.id.pratt filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the government failed to specify which of its invoices were false claims.id.at.the district court denied pratt motion,noting that the complaint alleged that all of the invoices,bills,and prices submitted by pratt to the air force were based on that initial inflation,and as a result utc should be able to identify the invoices,bills,and prices at issue.id.at emphasis in original.in the instant case,however,not only has yuhasz not identified any invoices submitted by brush to the government based on the alleged fraud,the indefinite nature of his allegations does not provide brush with any way of identifying those invoices.moreover,in united technologies the plaintiff identified the document presented to the government that contained the false information pratt best and final offer and identified both the parties and the specific contract that was entered into based upon that false information a contract between the government and united technologies to provide the air force with jet engines.id.at.that level of specificity is completely absent here.
finally,in pogue,the plaintiff alleged that defendants west paces medical center west paces,diabetes treatment centers of america dtca,and a group of atlanta physicians engaged in a scheme to defraud the government of medicare and medicaid funds.at.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the complaint failed to specify when,where,or how plaintiff contends that west paces learned of this alleged fraud,or the identity of,or position held by,the person or persons who had such knowledge,and whose knowledge should be attributed to west paces.id.at.the district court denied defendants motion and stated that a lthough no specific dates or west paces employees are identified,the complaint alleges that the hospital participated in a systematic,fraudulent scheme,spanning the course of twelve years thus,reference to a time frame and to west paces generally is sufficient.id.at.yuhasz argues that in this case,as in pogue,the court should not require the specific dates on which the invoices were submitted.however,yuhasz fails to recognize that in pogue the lack of specificity with regard to the invoices was balanced against the fact that the plaintiff identified the specific parties and contracts at issue between west paces and dtca and between dtca and the atlanta physicians.here,the only party that yuhasz identifies is brush.
in his briefs to this court,yuhasz also argues that he should not be required to plead the specifics of information within brush control.by failing to state specifically that brush control is exclusive,the position taken by yuhasz on appeal differs from that taken in the complaint,which stated 
with respect to the alloy products produced or processed by brush for the requirements of the government pursuant to government contracts,brush is in a position of superior knowledge,and possessed exclusive control over the means of access to information,as to the specific nature of such requirements or contracts.
emphasis added.in its response to brush motion to dismiss,yuhasz also claimed that an exception exists when certain information is within the exclusive possession of the defendant.emphasis added.the district court rejected this argument,explaining that yuhasz is not entitled to a relaxed standard because the information he seeks is not exclusively in the possession of brush.yuhasz,d at.
although yuhasz now argues that he should not be required to plead information over which brush has constructive control,nowhere in his briefs to this court does he state that brush control is exclusive.thus,yuhasz apparently has now conceded that third parties possess information concerning the specific contracts at issue and the claims submitted for payment.as the district court correctly determined,c ourts have held that rule b may be relaxed where information is only within the opposing party knowledge.michaels.ameritrust,cir emphasis added.furthermore,although yuhasz argues that he can not obtain the information demanded by the trial court absent discovery,there is no general right to discovery upon filing of the complaint.the very purpose of.b is to enable defendants to challenge the legal sufficiency of complaints without subjecting themselves to discovery.rutman wine gallo winery,cir.for all of these reasons,dismissal of yuhasz fca claim is appropriate.
the fca protects employees who pursue,investigate,or otherwise contribute to an action exposing fraud against the government.section h of the fca states 
any employee who is discharged,demoted,suspended,threatened,harassed,or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms or conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section,including investigation for,initiation of,testimony for,or assistance in an action file
