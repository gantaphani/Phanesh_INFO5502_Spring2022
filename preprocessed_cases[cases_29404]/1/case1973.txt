federal statutory law and constitutional law offer private citizens two avenues to recover damages for constitutional torts committed by employees of the federal government.a plaintiff may sue the employee directly for the constitutional violation under bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d.and a plaintiff may sue the government under the federal tort claims act ftca,on the condition that the judgment in an ftca action shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant,by reason of the same subject matter,against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
in this case,ronnie harris attempted to use both avenues.the district court dismissed harris bivens claims on grounds.and after a bench trial,the district court rejected harris ftca claims on the merits.because a reasonable factfinder could fairly conclude that harris has failed to show that the individual defendants assaulted or maliciously prosecuted him under ohio law,we affirm the district court rejection of harris ftca claims.and because that adjudication on the merits of harris ftca claims bars further adjudication of harris bivens claims against the individual defendants,we also affirm the court dismissal of the bivens claims.
ronnie harris,an ohio resident,is a former olympic and professional boxer,regarded as one of the best middleweights that the state has ever produced.his boxing career included a gold medal at the olympics and victories over sugar ray seales and future world champion alan minter.
on january,harris arrived at cleveland hopkins airport on continental airlines flight from fort lauderdale,florida,where he had traveled to watch his daughter compete in a tennis tournament.he wore a jogging suit and tennis shoes and carried a briefcase but wore no overcoat.
several federal agents in plain harrison,henry,raphael caprez and james working at the airport on january,and one of their primary duties was to scan the airport for suspicious persons and activity.because the drug enforcement agency dea has designated fort lauderdale as a source city for drug trafficking,caprez and monitored the passengers of flight as they exited the aircraft.
upon leaving the plane,harris walked rapidly to the baggage claim area and immediately went outside the airport to look for his uncle,who was picking him up.noticed harris because he wore a jogging suit yet carried a briefcase because he was not carrying an overcoat despite the cold temperature and because he walked rapidly through the airport while looking of which,a law enforcement veteran,associated with a drug courier profile.and eventually caprez followed harris to the baggage claim area.
approached harris outside the airport and,after identifying himself,asked to speak to him.harris declined to speak with,and the two men walked away from each other.during this brief encounter,caprez made eye contact with harris but did not approach him or overhear the conversation.harris remained outside the terminal and caprez returned to the airport.harris then returned to the airport without his briefcase which he had left with his uncle,who had now arrived,walked by the american airlines baggage claim carousel and glanced at a green piece of luggage.upon observing this,called for a dog to sniff the bag.
at this point,harrison joined caprez and began to observe harris actions.harris retrieved his bag and,having guessed that caprez was a dea agent,approached him and said something like i do appreciate you and your monkeys following me and if you keep it up i rip your head off.ja.harrison,who overheard the comment,walked up to harris from behind,tapped his shoulder and asked whether he had just threatened a police officer.harris asked harrison who she was she responded that she was a police officer,ja,and harris pushed her in the chest,prompting harrison to arrest him.
as the officers led harris to the nearby dea task force office,they could feel him resisting and trying to get loose.ja.once inside the office,they handcuffed him to a chair.entered the room and sought basic identification information from harris.harris generally was not cooperative during questioning.gilchrist also entered the room with a dog.the dog growled a few times during the few minutes that he was in the room,and harris feared that the dog might start biting him,ja.harris also apparently bladed his body a reference to assuming a sideways,aggressive fight stance toward the officers,told the officers that he was fast and told harrison that she did not know what he could have done to her.ja.after harris disclosed where he had left his briefcase,recovered it and discovered no contraband.the officers then took harris to the police station,where they charged him with aggravated disorderly conduct,resisting arrest and assault on a police officer.an ohio grand jury indicted harris on the assault charge on march.and a jury later found him not guilty of that charge.
on the basis of these incidents,harris filed a bivens lawsuit against the individual task force officers on january.the officers moved to dismiss the lawsuit on grounds of defective process,a motion that the district court granted without prejudice on october.harris appealed that dismissal to the sixth circuit,and we affirmed on march.see harris city of cleveland.cir.
on march,over a year after the district court dismissed the complaint but less than a year after this court affirmance,harris filed a new complaint against the individual federal defendants under the federal tort claims act and bivens.harris invoked the district court jurisdiction under a,noting that he had filed an ftca claim with the dea on may,and that,because the agency had failed to act on the claim within six months,the claim was presumed denied.
on may,the united states filed a notice of substitution under,which allows it to replace individual defendants with itself in defending ftca claims.the individual defendants then filed motions to dismiss the bivens claims for untimeliness because they were filed over two years after the incidents,insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction.harris responded that the ohio savings statute,ohio,gave him one year from the date of the sixth circuit decision to file the lawsuit.
on october,the district court substituted the united states as the sole defendant for the ftca claims,and dismissed the bivens claims against all four individual defendants because they had been filed over one year after the district court dismissal decision.on december,harris filed a second amended complaint,this time solely against the united states,which asserted claims of assault,malicious prosecution,false arrest,false imprisonment,battery and abuse of process,all under the ftca.after a bench trial,the district court ruled in favor of the united states on harris ftca claims.
on appeal,harris first argues that the district court mistakenly rejected his ftca claims on the merits.the ftca waives,with certain limitations,the federal government governmental immunity to suit in tort and permits suits on tort claims to be brought against the united states,sess.under the ftca,the united states is generally liable for the acts of its employees in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,which means that it is liable for the payment of money damages according to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,typically state law and actually ohio law in this instance.before invoking the ftca remedy,a claimant must present the claim to the federal agency whose activities gave rise to the injuries and allow the agency the opportunity to settle the claim.if the agency denies the claim or takes no action as the united states did here,the claimant may bring suit in federal district court as harris did here.see a.ftca lawsuits are tried in federal district court without a jury.see.
in addressing the dismissal of harris ftca claims,the district court factual findings shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.a anderson bessemer city,d hogan united states,cir noting that fact findings and credibility determinations in this setting are entitled to great deference.
harris argues that the four federal agents maliciously charged him with assault,resisting arrest and aggravated disorderly conduct.we disagree.
like the english common law that preceded it,ohio law has long recognized the right to recover in tort for the misuse of civil and criminal actions.see,pope pollock,ohio.to prove a claim under ohio law,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the government officials instituted or continued criminal proceedings with malice,that they lacked probable cause and that the proceedings were then terminated in favor of the accused.see trussell motors,ohio.
much like federal constitutional law,ohio defines probable cause as a reasonable ground of suspicion,supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged,rogers barbera,ohio,not as the quantum of evidence necessary to convict a criminal defendant,see,deoma shaker heights,ohio app d.because t here is no requirement that the defendant to a charge must have evidence that will ensure a conviction,not every failed criminal prosecution will sustain a subsequent suit,see,huber,ohio.an indictment,moreover,is prima facie evidence of probable cause and a plaintiff must bring forward substantial evidence to rebut this,carlton davisson,ohio app d,for example,by showing that the return of the indictment resulted from perjured testimony or that the grand jury proceedings were otherwise significantly irregular,deoma,at.
under ohio law,malice is the state of mind under which a person intentionally does a wrongful act without a reasonable lawful excuse and with the intent to inflict injury or under circumstances that the law will imply an evil intent.criss springfield township,ohio.for purposes of malicious prosecution,the term means an improper purpose,or any purpose other than the legitimate interest of bringing an offender to justice.id.malice may be inferred from the absence of probable cause in appropriate circumstances,garza clarion hotel,ohio app d,because the want of probable cause is the real gist of the action,melanowski judy,ohio.
harris has failed to satisfy these requirements.as an initial matter,the district court,in its role as a factfinder in this bench trial,declined to infer malice from the officers actions in this case and specifically noted that there is no evidence that the proceedings were instituted with malice,ja finding that is fatal to harris claims that he was maliciously prosecuted.see,williams cambridge bd.of,cir rejecting plaintiff claim when plaintiff failed to allege any facts that demonstrate d defendant acted with malice toward him in commencing the prosecution coker summit county sheriff dep t,cir.rejecting ohio claim because the complaint failed to set forth any facts in support of a showing of malice.
but even if we were to ignore the district court factual findings on this score and even if we were to consider harris invitation to presume malice under these circumstances,harris has not established another key element of ohio lack of probable any of the three counts with which he was charged.
first,a reasonable factfinder could fairly conclude that the officers had probable cause to charge harris with criminal assault under ohio revised code a,which proscribes knowingly caus ing or attempt ing to cause physical harm to another.ohio a see also ohio b.state prosecutors brought the assault charge against harris in state court only after obtaining an indictment,which establishes prima facie evidence of probable cause,carlton,at,that harris has not tried to rebut by showing that the grand jury proceedings or any other aspect of the indictment were irregular.and cases interpreting ohio law in analogous circumstances confirm that the officers had probable cause to believe that harris knowingly attempted to cause physical harm by pushing officer harrison.see,palshook jarrett,d,stillwell city of xenia,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,noting that evidence existed to support a criminal assault charge under ohio law when plaintiff intended to and did strike the officer in the chest with both hands matlock ohio dep t of liquor control,ohio misc d,holding that plaintiff did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her arrest for assault under was unlawful or that her prosecution,was malicious when she grabbed the officer from behind,the officer pushed her away,and she then grabbed the officer shirt hopkins city of westland,cir,holding,in a case,that probable cause existed where plaintiff shoved police officer in the chest.
in attempting to escape the reach of these cases,harris principally relies on the observation that officer harrison did not fear for her own safety during the encounter and on a trio of millennium,d,smith john deere,ohio app d,and state weber,no,wl,ohio app.lexis ohio,that deal with the standard for proving the civil tort of assault under ohio law.but these cases and officer harrison frame of mind do not advance a malicious prosecution claim for criminal assault,where the relevant mental state is the assaulter,not the victim.also unavailing is harris reliance on as state weber,no,wl,ohio app.lexis ohio,state kelly,no,wl,ohio app.lexis ohio,and in re mark,nos,wl,ohio app.lexis ohio,that pertain to harris culpability and the standard required to prove criminal assault in a criminal trial,not the standard required to establish probable cause to arrest an individual for criminal assault.see lyons city of xenia,cir recognizing that,i n ascertaining whether a constitutional violation occurred,the only question is whether the officer had probable whether the evidence would be sufficient to support a conviction.the officers,in short,had probable cause to arrest harris and to charge him with criminal assault.
second,the officers had probable cause to charge harris with resisting arrest under of the ohio revised code,which proscribes recklessly or by force,resist ing or interfer ing with a lawful arrest of the person or another.ohio.as we have already held that the officers lawfully arrested harris,the sole question is whether the officers had probable cause to believe that he recklessly resisted or interfered with that arrest.a reasonable factfinder could conclude that harris uncooperative attitude,attempts to resist and try to get loose,unwillingness to accompany the officers to the dea office and confrontational and threatening statements and this requirement,despite the lack of an actual struggle.ja see hansen westerville city sch,bd.of,wl at.lexis,at cir,holding that plaintiff had failed to show officers lacked probable cause to arrest and prosecute him for resisting arrest under ohio law,when he pulled his arm away from the officer,told him to get your paws off me,and struggled with the arresting officers see also palshook,d at.making harris contrary position more tenuous,ohio appellate courts have upheld jury verdicts convicting criminal defendants of resisting arrest in circumstances not far different from these.see state keegan,ohio app d,holding that physical activity which prevents or delays an arrest,including going limp,is enough to sustain a conviction for resisting arrest under ohio law state thomas,wl,ohio app.lexis ohio,raising one fists and backing away is sufficient state rose,ohio app d,moving arm for twenty or thirty seconds to avoid handcuffing is sufficient state williams,ohio app d,state bird,no.ca,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,noting,in the course of holding that defendant unwillingness to be handcuffed amounted to resisting arrest,that passive,indirect or circuitous impediments to the exercise of the official duties of a police officer can be sufficient.that such factual circumstances have supported a conviction for resisting arrest under ohio law necessarily establishes that the officers had probable cause to charge harris with resisting arrest.
lastly,the officers had probable cause to charge harris with disorderly conduct.under ohio law,a person engages in disorderly conduct if he recklessly cause s inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm to another by,among other things,e ngaging in fighting,in threatening harm to persons or property,or by i nsulting,taunting,or challenging another,under circumstances in which that conduct is likely to provoke a violent response.ohio a see also ohio e making it aggravated disorderly conduct to violate the section in the presence of any law enforcement officer.a factfinder could reasonably conclude that harris,by threatening the officers with physical violence and by making threatening gestures,provided them with the necessary probable cause to charge him with disorderly conduct,see,fields johnson,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,coarse,threatening and grossly abusive language establishes probable cause to charge individual with disorderly conduct under,not the least because similar actions have in the past sustained convictions under,see,state shumaker,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,loud and abusive language may suffice to sustain a conviction under.
we recognize and can certainly understand our dissenting colleague view that the unfortunate facts of this case indicate that the agents wrongly suspected harris of acting as a drug courier.yet we can not agree with our colleague statement that no evidence of physical activity which prevents or delays arrest is present in the instant case.infra at.the district court found that the officers,as they attempted to place harris under arrest,could feel him resisting and trying to get loose.ja.under ohio precedent,those actions are sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to charge harris with resisting arrest.see thomas,wl,ohio app.lexis rose,at bird,ohio app.lexis,at.
harris next argues that the four federal agents committed assault and battery during the course of his detention at the airport.we again disagree because a reasonable factfinder could conclude otherwise.
like other states,ohio provides causes of action for assault and battery.the state defines assault as the willful threat or attempt to harm or touch another offensively,where that threat or attempt reasonably places the other in fear of such contact.stokes meimaris,ohio app d,vandiver morgan adhesive,ohio app d.proof of physical injury is not required.id.the state defines battery as an intentional uninvited contact with another.see snyder turk,ohio app d,love city of port clinton,ohio.
the totality of the circumstances does not support harris argument that the agents committed assault or battery.the only physical contact was the,and handcuffing,all of which agents may lawfully do when arresting an individual.leichtman wlw jacor communications,ohio app d.the district court also found that harris had failed to demonstrate his own reasonable apprehension of fear.finally,the district court rejected harris assertions that the interaction with the dog in the dea task force office amounted to an assault or battery because the district court did not believe harris testimony regarding these events.
harris aptly notes that the district court incorrectly described his burden of proof as beyond a reasonable doubt at one point,but also admits that the court mentioned the correct proof burden as a preponderance of the evidence two times in the very same section.ja matlock,at.on this record,the district court single reference to a beyond a reasonable doubt standard was harmless.
harris next argues that the district court erred in dismissing his bivens claims as untimely.under the landmark supreme court decision of that name,private citizens may recover money damages for any injuries they have suffered as a result of a federal agents violation of the constitution.at.in addressing the timeliness of a federal constitutional damages action,the settled practice has been to adopt a local time limitation as federal law if it is not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so.wilson garcia,d.that practice applies both to actions because congress did not establish a statute of limitations or a body of tolling rules applicable to actions brought in federal court under,bd.of regents of the of the state of new york tomanio,d and to bivens actions because the federal constitution does not list,any more than the statute does,the timeliness rules that govern implied damages actions.see mcsurely hutchison,cir see also sanchez united states,cir industrial constructors united states bureau of reclamation,cir van strum lawn,cir bieneman city of chicago,cir chin bowen,cir.not only the length of the limitations period,but also closely related questions of tolling and application,thus are governed by state law.garcia,at.johnson ry.express agency,d hardin straub,d.
among the tolling provisions interrelated with the statute of limitations,we have held,is the ohio savings statute.see harris canton,cir.the statute provides 
in any action that is commenced,if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits,the plaintiff may commence a new action within one year after the plaintiff failure otherwise than upon the merits or within the period of the original applicable statute of limitations,whichever occurs later.
ohio.the savings statute applies where an action is timely commenced and is then dismissed without prejudice after the applicable statute of limitations has run.lewis connor,ohio,int l periodical distribs.bizmart,ohio,chadwick barba lou,ohio.a plaintiff failure under generally occurs when an appellate court affirms a district court dismissal of a case otherwise than upon the merits.see clones kohli,ca,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.june,ins.schiappa,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,savings provision commences to run only on date of appellate court dismissal order because t o hold otherwise would be to force appellants to risk losing the benefit of the savings statute in order to appeal the trial court decision mcdermott lynch,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.may,greene hawkins,no.ca,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,labarbera batsch,ohio app d,rev on other grounds,ohio,colello bates,ohio app,burnett new york cent,d t he limitation provision is tolled until the state court order dismissing the state action becomes final by the running of the time during which an appeal may be taken or the entry of a final judgment on appeal.
in accordance with these precedents,harris adequately preserved his claim.harris filed his original claims within the ohio period.see ohio.when the district court dismissed those claims without prejudice,harris unsuccessfully appealed that decision.and harris refiled his claims within one year of the sixth circuit affirmance of the district court dismissal of his claims without prejudice.that timeline and ohio tolling principles establish that harris bivens claims fall within the savings statute compass.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,the district court held that the savings statute began to run once the district court dismissed harris action without prejudice,not when the sixth circuit affirmed that decision.but this view rests upon a mistaken reading of gruber kopf builders,ohio app d.in gruber,the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his first complaint on april,but the trial court continued adjudicating the case,ultimately granting summary judgment to each defendant.see id.at.the plaintiff then appealed this decision,and the ohio court of appeals dismissed the appeal because the trial court did not have jurisdiction after the april,voluntary dismissal.id.when the plaintiff filed a new complaint more than one year after he voluntarily dismissed his first complaint,both the trial court and the ohio court of appeals held that a voluntary dismissal constitutes a failure otherwise than upon the merits within the purview of the statute,id.at,and distinguished prior ohio law stating that the limitation period is tolled during the pendency of an appeal because none of the cases involved a plaintiff voluntary dismissal,id.at.by contrast,when an involuntary dismissal is at issue,ohio case law indicates that an action fails on the date of the appellate decision,if any,from the dismissal.stine kansas city terminal ry.
the individual defendants seek to defend the district court decision on a second this reading of ohio law conflicts with federal policy and accordingly should not be followed.in making this argument,the defendants point to lewellen morley,cir,where the court chose not to invoke an illinois state law permitting the time to be extended indefinitely by unsuccessful attempts to serve defendants who live outside illinois because the rule was at odds with federal rule of civil procedure rule m requirement that the plaintiff obtain service within days absent good cause.id.attempting to follow suit,the individual defendants argue that here,too,the extension permitted by the savings statute allows a plaintiff to circumvent the requirements of rule.but,in this instance,no similar direct conflict between ohio law and federal policy exists.rule governs service of process after a complaint has been filed and before dismissal,see.m,not what happens after a dismissal for lack of process.the appropriate touchstone for the latter inquiry is state law,not federal law,and accordingly this alternative ground for upholding the district court decision must be rejected.
even though the district court incorrectly dismissed harris bivens claims,we do not reinstate them because they are barred by the court adjudication of his ftca claims.the ftca judgment bar provides that 
the judgment in an action under section b of this title the ftca shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant,by reason of the same subject matter,against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
see generally united states gilman.the tort claims act does not touch the liability of the employees except in one respect by it makes the judgment against the united states a complete bar to any action by the claimant against the employee.benbow wolf,cir the congress has the apparent intention that the individual be not pursued if the united states be liable.no statutory bar,by contrast,prohibits suits against the government following a suit against or settlement with the employee in that scenario,customary rules of preclusion and the terms of the settlement govern whether an additional lawsuit may be filed.see branch united states,cir looking to local law to determine the effect,as to a successor ftca action against the united states,of a release provided by a government employee friday united states,cir i t is significant that the ftca provides with particularity that a release of the united states releases the employee.the obvious inference from this specific provision is that a release of the tort feasor employee does not release the tort feasor employer,the united states,at least where rights against the united states are reserved.united states first sec.bank of utah,cir congress with meticulous care provided that recovery of a judgment against the government shall constitute a bar to any action against the employee whose negligence gave rise to the claim,but for reasons satisfactory to itself,it failed to provide,directly or indirectly,that a satisfaction of a claim against an employee should bar an action against the government.
courts,including the sixth circuit,have consistently read to bar a bivens claim against a government employee arising out of the same actions,transactions,or occurrences as an ftca claim.serra pichardo,cir see also arevalo woods,cir andrews gee,armstrong vogel.against this backdrop,harris does not dispute that the district court entered a judgment on the merits of his ftca claims and that those claims aris e out of the same actions,transactions,or occurrences as his bivens claims.and he does not dispute that applies to bivens claims as well as ftca claims even though the congress that enacted this statute in had no way of knowing that it would cover the bivens claim announced in.
harris argues instead that the judgment bar does not apply where plaintiff has from the outset alleged his bivens claims and sought a jury trial in the same lawsuit alleging ftca causes of action,where the bivens claims have been erroneously dismissed,and where the later bench trial of plaintiff common law tort causes of action results in a judgment in defendant favor.harris reply br.at.we disagree.
in accordance with the consistent application of the judgment bar over the fifty years since its enactment,we have held that the provision applies even when the claims were tried together in the same suit and the judgments were entered simultaneously.serra,at see also clifton miller,wl,at.lexis,at cir rodriguez handy,cir arevalo,at the moment judgment was entered against the government,then by virtue of section,woods was no longer answerable to arevalo for damages.aetna cas.sur.united states,cir a judgment against the united states would automatically bar the entry of any contemporaneous or subsequent judgment against the government employees.gilman united states,cir t he moment judgment was entered against the government,then by virtue of the employee was no longer primarily answerable to the was not answerable at all.footnote omitted united states lushbough,cir the district court,having awarded a judgment in favor of plaintiff in his action against the united states,could not in the face of the explicit provisions of order judgment against the government employee in favor of the plaintiff in the same action.popal united states,wl at,dist.lexis,at,having elected to proceed against both the government and the individuals and having received judgment against the government on the issue of liability,the plaintiffs can not now choose to continue their action against the individual defendants and elect at some later time between the ftca and bivens claims.satterwhite bocelato,entering judgment only against the united states and not against the federal employee because of hopper united states,holding that,because a judgment was awarded the plaintiffs against the united states,no judgment will be announced against the government employee prechtl united states.
by making t he judgment in an ftca claim the bar to a future bivens claim,the statute also fails to draw a distinction between a decision for or against the government.nothing in the common interpretation of the word judgment suggests that a judgment in favor of the united states may be treated differently from a judgment against the united states.see black law dictionary ed defining judgment as a court final determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in a case.and indeed courts have generally accordance with the plain terms of the ftca operates as a bar even when a judgment is adverse to the claimant.see estate of trentadue ex rel.aguilar united states,cir t he judgment bar in precludes plaintiffs from bringing a bivens claim regarding the same subject matter regardless of whether the final ftca judgment is rendered in favor of a plaintiff or the government.farmer perrill,cir it is wholly irrelevant that prior tenth circuit case law addressed an ftca judgment against the united states while farmer case involves an ftca judgment in favor of the united states.section makes no distinction between favorable and unfavorable simply refers to the judgment in an action under section b.hoosier bancorp of,rasmussen,cir there is no indication that congress intended section to apply only to favorable ftca judgments.freeze united states,d,t he court judgment on plaintiff ftca claim prevents plaintiff from asserting an action against the defendant based on a constitutional claim.hallock bonner,cir distinguishing between ftca actions dismissed on grounds,as opposed to merits grounds,but implicitly accepting that reaches both judgments adverse to and in favor of the government,cert.granted,d leaman ohio of mental retardation developmental disabilities,cir en banc noting,while interpreting an analogous ohio provision,that,under,one who pursues his statutory remedies against the united states to the point of an adverse judgment or a judgment for only a small part of the amount himself from any recovery against federal employees.
one court of appeals decision,it is true,has distinguished between favorable and unfavorable merits judgments in applying,concluding that an ftca judgment in favor of the government did not bar a contemporaneous bivens action arising from the same events.see kreines united states,cir compare gasho united states,cir noting that the holding in kreines was narrowly confined to its facts and rejecting plaintiffs argument that congress intended to permit a claimant to have a second chance after losing his ftca action.in doing so,kreines reasoned that t he text is ambiguous on the question of whether an ftca judgment favorable to the government bars a contemporaneous bivens judgment.at.but the word judgment does not have the ambiguity that the ninth circuit ascribed to it.the statute refers to t he judgment in an action under section b of this title it says nothing about who prevailed in the judgment a statutory fact that engenders certainty rather than uncertainty that the bar applies to all judgments,whether for or against the government.
nor is there any background principle regarding judgment bars that supports applying the bar only when one party,as opposed to another,prevailed in the first judgment.calling the word judgment ambiguous,at any rate,hardly leads to the conclusion that the ninth circuit embraced.why is it that a judgment bar should apply only where the government loses when the government loses the initial case,one could argue that a judgment bar is not necessary to prohibit dual recoveries because the law of remedies already would sharply curtail the risk of a double recovery and already would sap the plaintiff incentive to pursue another claim.in other words,it makes just as much sense to apply the bar when the government wins the initial case.better under these circumstances,we submit,to follow the language of where it leads us,which is to the conclusion that the identity of the victor in an ftca claim does not delimit the reach of a bar that applies to all judgment s.
nor does the supreme court decision in carlson green,d,support a contrary interpretation.in carlson,the court refused to condition the availability of a bivens claim on the federal government waiver of sovereign immunity through the ftca.see id.at.holding that plaintiffs,i n the absence of a contrary expression from congress,shall have an action under ftca against the united states as well as a bivens action against the individual officials alleged to have infringed their constitutional rights.nothing about our decision,however,conflicts with this principle.although c onstitutional rights may not be extinguished by any statute,state or federal,this truism does not mean that suits or potential suits for alleged violations of such rights may not be compromised or waived.leaman,at en banc.nothing in carlson prohibits the federal government from conditioning its waiver of sovereign immunity on a plaintiff willingness not to pursue a constitutional is precisely what the terms of do and which explains why we rejected a similar argument in serra.see serra,at reasoning that the instant case,unlike carlson,deals with the effect of a ftca judgment on a plaintiff power to continue to pursue a bivens remedy,not with the availability of a bivens remedy even though plaintiff allegations also could have supported a suit against the united states under the ftca see also arevalo,at unlike carlson,in the case now before us the plaintiff arevalo sued both the united states under the ftca and the individual federal officer under bivens.sanchez rowe,t he holding in carlson does not alter the plain meaning of because carlson did not deal with the effect of a ftca judgment on a plaintiff power to continue to pursue a bivens remedy.
neither does the statutory history of advance harris position.the predecessor statute read as follows 
a subject to the provisions of this title,the united states district court for the district wherein the plaintiff is resident or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred,including the united states district courts for the territories and possessions of the united states,sitting without a jury,shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear,determine,and render judgment on any claim against the united states,for money only,accruing on and after january,on account of damage to or loss of property or on account of personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant for such damage,loss,injury,or death in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.subject to the provisions of this title,the united states shall be liable in respect of such claims to the same claimants,in the same manner,and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,except that the united states shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment,or for punitive damages.costs shall be allowed in all courts to the successful claimant to the same extent as if the united states were a private litigant,except that such costs shall not include attorneys fees.
b the judgment in such an action shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant,by reason of the same subject matter,against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
legislative reorganization act of,stat,emphasis added.relying on this earlier version of the statute,harris argues that the judgment previously referred to was the liability of the united states and that,by retaining the phrase the judgment instead of using any judgment or a judgment,congress did not change this meaning when it altered the statute.but the text of the predecessor statute is at best unclear.in using the phrase the judgment in such an action,congress could just have easily meant all judgments as it could have meant those judgments in which the united states shall be liable.
nor,lastly,do we believe that this holding works an injustice on harris or other plaintiffs like him.the equitable punch of harris argument comes from the fear that the district court erroneously dismissed his bivens claims and that he has therefore never had his day in court on those claims.but the fact of the matter is that,even if the district court had not mistakenly barred harris bivens claims on timeliness grounds,the outcome would have been no different fifty years of largely consistent case law would have precluded the district court from entering a judgment favorable to harris on his bivens claims upon entry of the merits judgment on his ftca claim arising out of the same actions,transactions,or occurrences.of course,a plaintiff still may bring a bivens claim and pursue it to judgment.see carlson,at.but having chosen to bring an ftca claim as well,the statute provides that a judgment in that action constitute s a complete bar to any action by the claimant against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.see engle mecke,cir a decision to sue the government affects the availability of a bivens action against the federal officer.although the plaintiff may elect initially to bring his action against either defendant,a judgment against the united states under the ftca constitutes a complete bar to any action by the claimant.ting united states,cir the ftca imposes an election of remedies.while a plaintiff may maintain both a ftca and a bivens action,recovery against the united states bars recovery against the employee.leaman,at en banc noting that the federal tort claims act offers claimants a better deal than they would have without it because it does not force any claimant to accept the government statutory offer but afford s claimants a superior mechanism for vindicating their rights.
for these reasons,we affirm.
i concur in the majority opinion except with respect to its discussion and resolution of harris claim that he was maliciously prosecuted for resisting arrest,contained in part iia.the district court determination that probable cause existed to charge harris with resisting arrest was supported only by the court subjective conclusi
