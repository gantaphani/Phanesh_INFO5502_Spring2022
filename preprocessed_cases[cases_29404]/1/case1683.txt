in march,danell gomez had a surgical catheterization to treat a blockage in an artery leading to her left arm.when the procedure was complete,the surgeon used a medical device known as an to close the hole he had made in gomez femoral artery to access the blockage.the deposits a small plug of collagen on the outside of the artery wall at the puncture site.the collagen plug quickly causes a clot that stops the bleeding.the includes an anchor intended to keep any of the collagen from traveling to the inside of the artery,where it can cause a clot in the bloodstream.gomez alleges that the worked improperly in her case,allowing collagen to travel to the inside of her artery and cause a large blockage that had to be surgically removed.she attributes her subsequent nine surgeries and persistent leg pain and weakness to the defective.
gomez sued the manufacturer of the under the louisiana product liability act,seeking actual and punitive damages.gomez husband joined in the suit seeking loss of consortium damages.the district judge granted summary judgment as to gomez design and marketing claims on the basis of federal preemption.the parties tried the manufacturing defect claim to a jury.at the close of the evidence,the district judge granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.gomez appealed.
we affirm the preemption determination,reverse the rule order,and remand to the district court.the reasons are explained below.
factual and procedural background 
in,danell gomez,then years old,saw her doctor complaining about numbness and tingling in her left arm and hand.tr.at.an arteriogram indicated a blockage in the right subclavian artery in gomez chest.her doctor referred her to christopher white,an interventional as one who performs procedures such as angioplasties and stents at the ochsner clinic in new orleans.tr.at.
white performed surgery to relieve the blockage and repair the artery.white followed a standard procedure and accessed the subclavian artery through the right femoral artery in the groin area,where the blood vessels are close to the skin.white inserted a catheter through the opening he made in the femoral artery,passed the catheter to the subclavian artery,and inserted a balloon to open the blockage.the balloon did not have the desired effect,requiring insertion of a stent,which was successful.white then withdrew the catheter and other equipment through the femoral artery,leaving an opening that had to be treated to stop the bleeding.
the evidence at trial described two common approaches to closing such an opening.one approach is to use manual compression,applying pressure to the puncture area until a clot forms and the bleeding stops.this approach can be uncomfortable for the patient because of the pressure and because the patient must stay still for a long to eight avoid disrupting the clot.complications such as prolonged bleeding and pseudoaneurysms can result.the other approach is to use one of the devices,such as the.the operates by placing a small plug of collagen on the outside of the artery wall to close the puncture site.other devices operate with a stitch or glue applied to the site.white and the ochsner clinic had been involved in clinical studies leading to the fda approval of the and white preferred it to other devices and to manual compression.white testified that the use of closure devices like the make the postoperation procedure easier,faster,and less expensive for both the doctor and patient.because both closure devices and manual compression have approximately the same rate of the complications are approach is not inherently more or less safe than the other.
the consists of a guidewire,a carrier tube,a bypass tube,a bovine collagen plug,and a biodegradable polymer anchor.the specifications require that when the device is packaged for shipping,the anchor must be in a vertical position within the bypass tube,neither extending beyond the end of the tube nor inserted deeply within it.the bypass tube protects the anchor from damage during shipping and during surgery.when the doctor inserts the into the patient,the anchor must pass through a silicon hemostasis valve,which prevents the patient blood from flowing back through the artery opening during the surgery.when the is inserted into a patient,the bypass the open the hemostasis valve,the anchor is inserted into the artery,and the collagen plug is deposited on the outside of the artery wall.
during a surgery such as the one performed on gomez,the surgeon enters the femoral artery through a catheter.when the doctor has completed the procedure and is ready to remove the catheter and close the entry wound using an,the surgeon first inserts the guidewire through the catheter that is already inside the patient femoral artery.the catheter is then removed.the surgeon then inserts the device,using the bypass tube to push through and open the hemostasis valve before the anchor is released from the bypass tube.the anchor is supposed to swivel ninety degrees once it is out of the bypass tube,allowing the surgeon to pull the anchor flat,or flush,against the inner wall of the artery.the surgeon can not see the anchor,but relies on the tension felt when the suture is pulled and the anchor is drawn perpendicular to,and flush against,the interior artery wall.the surgeon then tamps the collagen plug attached to the suture on the outer artery wall,causing rapid clotting at the puncture site.the anchor prevents the collagen from getting into the inner portion of the artery,the patient bloodstream.if collagen enters the bloodstream,the intended benefit of the instead cause severe harm.several medical witnesses testified that if collagen is introduced into a patient bloodstream,significant complications can result.white,gomez treating doctor,described possible complications as including death,heart attack,stroke,bleeding,infection,limb loss,and embolization,which he described as the breaking off of bits and pieces of plaque in the artery that can go downstream and cause problems in toes and fingers and cause stroke as well.tr.at.all the witnesses agreed that humans have collagen in their bodies,but only in the outer artery walls,not inside the arteries.
white did not experience any problem in using the on gomez on march.the records show that the bleeding at the access puncture site stopped with no complications.tr.at.after routine postsurgical monitoring showed no problems,white discharged gomez.
less than two days after her surgery,gomez experienced extreme pain in her right leg.she returned to white approximately two weeks later,complaining of pain in the right groin and thigh when she walked.white arranged for an ultrasound,which showed a narrowing of the artery at the point he had entered it for the surgery.white advised either an angioplasty or surgery to correct the narrowing.white testified at trial that he believed scarring from the collagen plug caused a clot on the outer femoral artery wall,which externally compressed and narrowed the artery.tr.at.
gomez did not quickly obtain the treatment white recommended.instead,she decided that she wanted a doctor closer to her home.she consulted diana gilmore,a cardiovascular surgeon,who referred her to anthony morales,an interventional cardiologist.gomez leg pain persisted during this period.on april,morales performed an arteriogram,which indicated a blockage in gomez right femoral artery.tr.at.morales tried but failed to clear the blockage using a catheter.he testified that when he tried moving the catheter through the blockage he felt like he was hitting concrete.he recommended surgery,which gilmore performed on april.
gilmore testified that she found a single embolus,or mass,inside gomez right femoral artery.she emphasized that the mass was not on the outside compressing the artery wall,as white opined,but inside the artery itself,in the area known as the luma.the mass was so large that it was pressing against the inside wall of the artery,known as the intima.tr.at.jerry hudson,a pathologist,examined the mass and determined that it consisted of suture material and collagen.tr.at.hudson tested the mass for the presence of type iv human collagen,which he found,but did not test for the type i bovine collagen used in the.tr.at.
gomez continued to experience pain in her right leg and medical tests revealed diminished blood flow.gomez has seen a number of doctors,including a,who ruled out clotting disease as the cause of gomez problems.to treat the pain associated with clotting in her leg,gomez saw a neurologist,who prescribed several drugs.through may,gomez has undergone nine surgical procedures,including seven catheterizations.gomez has missed significant time at work and will likely need additional medical procedures and drugs to treat pain and weakness in her right leg.
on march,gomez sued the designer and manufacturer in federal court.gomez asserted causes of action under the louisiana product liability act.ann.a c west,for unreasonably dangerous design,failure to warn of the dangers of the,failure to warn the public of the dangers that the posed for individuals with small blood vessels,failure to train medical personnel to use the properly,lack of informed consent,breach of express warranty,redhibition,failure to communicate to the medical community the possibility of complications discovered after the fda approval process ended,failure to train physicians to address complications caused by the,and failure to manufacture the device in accordance with fda specifications.
kensey nash corporation developed the and obtained the approval of the federal food and drug administration through the premarket approval pma procedure under the medical device amendments to the food,drug,and cosmetics act,a.kensey nash corporation licensed the rights to the device to american home products corporation.in,an american home products subsidiary,quinton instrument company,was designated as the device manufacturer.the food and drug administration approved quinton manufacturing and quality procedures on september.in,american home sold the rights to the device to tyco international,which sold and marketed the through its affiliate,the kendall company lp,tyco healthcare group lp kendall.because kendall was the only entity that owned and manufactured the when the device used in gomez procedure was manufactured and sold,the district court dismissed the other defendants.
the district court granted summary judgment in kendall favor as to all gomez claims except manufacturing defect,on the basis that the federal medical device amendments preempted the louisiana product liability statute.the district court initially granted summary judgment to kendall on the manufacturing defect claim,but granted gomez rule motion after submission of documents from the fda demonstrated genuine issues of fact material to determining whether the was made in accordance with the specifications.the district court convened a jury trial for the manufacturing defect claim.at trial,gomez claimed that the was defectively manufactured because the anchor extended past the bypass tube and did not sit fully within the tube as the specifications required.gomez argued,and presented witnesses who testified that,such a positive extension was a defect in the.these witnesses,whose qualifications under rules and of the federal rules of evidence are not challenged,explained that this extension led to an improper position of the anchor inside gomez femoral artery when white used the.because the anchor did not sit flush against the interior artery wall,it did not perform its intended function of preventing the collagen from getting to the inside of the artery.as a result,gomez asserted,collagen did enter her bloodstream and caused the blockage and subsequent circulatory problems in her leg.
gomez relied on circumstantial evidence of defect and causation.the evidence included information that the sent to the ochsner clinic,including the one used in gomez surgery,came from two manufacturing lots.predistribution tests showed a two percent incidence of positive anchor extensions in the lot that supplied most of the sent to the ochsner clinic.gomez also presented evidence that fda reports filed between november and april showed that six of the in the reports came from the same two lots that had supplied the ochsner clinic,and three of those six resulted in occlusions,or blockages,in the patients.
at the close of the evidence,kendall moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a,contending that the evidence was insufficient to show either a defect in the or that it caused the clot in gomez femoral artery.the district court granted the motion.gomez timely appealed.gomez contends that the district court committed error in finding that federal law preempted her claims for defective design,failure to warn,breach of express warranty,negligence in training and consent forms,and redhibition.gomez also challenges the district court grant of kendall motion for judgment as a matter of law on the claim.gomez also appeals from the district court order,entered after final judgment and after she filed her notice of appeal,requiring gomez to pay certain deposition fees.finally,gomez claims that the district court erred in a number of discovery and evidentiary rulings and asks this court to assign the case to a new judge on remand.
we affirm the district court preemption decision,reverse the rule order,remand for additional proceedings,and deny all additional relief as either moot or unwarranted.

this court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo,using the familiar standard.royal ins.of america hartford underwriters ins,cir.discovery and evidentiary rulings are reviewed under a deferential abuse of discretion standard.see freudensprung offshore technical,cir rubinstein adm rs of the tulane educ.fund,cir.this court reviews a district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.piotrowski city of houston,cir citing rutherford harris county,cir.the district court properly grants a motion for judgment as a matter of law only if the facts and inferences point so strongly in favor of one party that reasonable minds could not disagree.id.in ruling on a rule motion based upon the sufficiency of the evidence,we consider all of the just that evidence which supports the in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.info.commc unisys,cir quoting boeing shipman,cir en banc additional citations omitted.in evaluating the rule motion,the district court can not assess the credibility of witnesses or weigh the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
iii.preemption 
the district court held that the medical device amendments of,to the food,drug and cosmetic act preempted gomez claims that despite compliance with fda requirements,the was defectively designed,defectively manufactured,and defectively marketed.the district court dismissed the claims for failure to warn,breach of express warranty,negligence regarding training and consent forms,strict liability,unreasonably dangerous per se,and negligence.this circuit decisions in martin medtronic,cir,and stamps collagen,cir,control this issue.because the was subject to the fda rigorous pma procedure,we agree with the district court that these claims are preempted.
the medical device amendments of classify medical devices into three categories based on the potential risk to the public.a a c medtronic,lohr,d.devices that present no unreasonable risk of illness or injury are designated class i and are subject only to minimal regulation by general controls.lohr,at.citing a a.devices that are potentially more harmful are designated class ii and must comply with a set of regulations coined special controls.lohr,at.citing a b.devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury or which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health are designated class iii.a c.the is a class iii medical device.
before a class iii device may be put on the market,the manufacturer must give the fda reasonable assurance that the device is both safe and effective.d.a manufacturer provides reasonable assurance through the pma process.the pma process requires the manufacturer to submit detailed information regarding the safety and efficacy of their devices,which the fda then reviews,spending an average of hours on each submission.lohr,at.significantly,the fda involvement with the devices continues even after the pma is complete.see,prohibiting the production or labeling of any device in a manner inconsistent with any conditions of approval specified in the approval order a d requiring an applicant to submit a supplemental application setting forth any proposed changes for fda approval before implementing any changes.
congress provided two exceptions to the pma process.first,a grandfather clause permits medical devices marketed before passage of the amendments to remain unless and until the fda initiates and completes the pma process.see lohr,at.citing b a c.second,devices that are substantially equivalent to a preexisting medical device are exempt from the pma process and instead subject to a streamlined approval process.see lohr,at.describing the significant differences between the pma and the substantially similar process under k b b.
the supremacy clause of the constitution prohibits state laws from conflicting with federal law.const.art.vi,cl.a state law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d.in view of the historic importance of federalism in these areas,the states police powers relating to public health and safety are not preempted by federal law unless congress intent to do so is clearly expressed.kemp medtronic,cir citing hillsborough county,automated med,d.when congress enacts a specific preemption provision,that provision determines the preemptive effect of the statute.cipollone,at.
the express preemption provision in the medical device amendments governs the extent to which it preempts state law.it states 
n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement 
which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and 
which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.
a.the fda has promulgated regulations to assist courts in interpreting this section,which states in part as follows 
state or local requirements are preempted only when the food and drug administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act,thereby making any existing divergent state or local requirements applicable to the device different from,or in addition to,the specific food and drug administration requirements.there are other state or local requirements that affect devices that are not preempted by section a of the act because they are not requirements applicable to a device within the meaning of section a of the act.
d see also id.at d listing examples.
this circuit has held that the pma process preempts state tort causes of action to the extent that they relate to safety,effectiveness,or other mda requirements if the claims impose substantive requirements different from or inconsistent with the federal law.martin,at.in martin,this circuit examined its earlier preemption analysis in stamps collagen,cir in light of the supreme court decision in medtronic,lohr,d.both stamps and martin involved class iii medical devices subject to the pma process lohr involved a device that was subject to the k notification process.in martin,the court reaffirmed stamps and held that the pma requirements preempted texas state claims arising from a class iii medical device,including claims of defective design,failure to warn,and inadequate labeling,because those claims related to areas specifically covered in the pma process and sought to impose requirements that were different from and,indeed,conflict with the results of the pma process.martin,at.
this circuit,and all but one of the appellate courts considering the issue,require a district court to look through the general duties imposed by the causes of action and consider the effect a successful lawsuit asserting those causes of action would have and determine whether they threaten the federal pma process requirements.see,horn thoratec,cir same brooks howmedica,cir en banc kemp,at,mitchell collagen,cir papike tambrands,cir but see goodlin medtronic,cir holding that a does not preempt claims involving devices.this court and the other courts of appeals save the eleventh circuit recognize that the fda,through the pma process,has imposed a set of specific regulations on medical devices and their manufacturers that preempt claims relating to the same areas and seeking to impose different requirements.through the decisions made in the pma process,the federal government has weighed the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question,reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or set of cases,and implemented that conclusion via a specific mandate on manufacturers or producers.papike,at quoting lohr,at.that conclusion is entitled to preemptive effect.
because the went through the pma process,the cases discussing medical devices subject to the substantially equivalent process are not helpful.compare martin,at t he fact that the k process did not preempt state causes of action in lohr does not indicate that the pma process can not preempt state tort causes of action.with reeves acromed,cir t he substantial equivalence provision did not preempt reeves unreasonably dangerous per se claim.the test applies to products liability claims against devices such as the.the district court correctly analyzed gomez claims to determine whether the duties enforced by the causes of action she asserted would threaten the federal duties imposed under the pma process.
gomez alleged strict liability defective design and negligent design causes of action under louisiana law.to prevail on her unreasonably dangerous in design claim,gomez had to prove that t here existed an alternative design for the product that was capable of preventing the claimant damage and t he likelihood that the product design would cause the claimant damage and the gravity of that damage outweighed the burden on the manufacturer of adopting such alternative design and the adverse effect,if any,of such alternative design on the utility of the product.an adequate warning about a product shall be considered in evaluating the likelihood of damage when the manufacturer has used reasonable care to provide the adequate warning to users and handlers of the product.ann.west.the fda studied the design through the pma process and approved it.to permit a jury to the design by applying the louisiana statutory standard for unreasonably dangerous design would risk interference with the design standards and criteria.the district court judge correctly found that federal law preempted this challenge to the design of the class iii accord horn,at martin,at papike,at.
gomez also alleged causes of action for failure to warn and failure to train,including a claim that because kendall clinical studies underrepresented women,it failed to give adequate warnings of risks more likely to occur in women as a result of generally smaller blood vessels.see.ann.listing elements of inadequate warning claims.gomez claimed that kendall provided inadequate warnings that kendall should have been required to provide more specific information about the that the consent forms should have required a physician to obtain a patient specific,informed consent to the use of the before its use and that the material kendall supplied to train in the use of the were inadequate.gomez also sought recovery under a theory of redhibition,which is louisiana equivalent to a breach of implied warranty claim.see.ann.west.
the fda approved kendall warnings and instructions for physicians contained in the instructions for use ifu through the pma process.that process required the fda to approve clinical studies and evaluate the results,to specify the labeling requirements,and and approve the label that issued.the fda also approved the patient guide used to provide information and warnings to patients,again through the pma process.kendall training requirements were also subjected to,and approved in,the pma process.to permit a jury to decide gomez claims that the information,warnings,and training material the fda required and approved through the pma process were inadequate under state law would displace the fda exclusive role and expertise in this area and risk imposing inconsistent obligations on kendall.the district judge correctly found that gomez claims that kendall labeling,warning,information,and training were inadequate or incomplete are preempted.accord horn,at martin,at stamps,at mitchell,at papike,at.
gomez argues that it is inappropriate to apply preemption to her warranty claims to the extent she based them on a knowledge theory.gomez argues that even if kendall did not know the potential problems presented for patients like her when the device received fda approval,it later learned more information about those risks but failed to provide that information in updated warnings for patients and physicians.this argument fails to overcome preemption.medical device manufacturers such as kendall have ongoing obligations to report experience with the device to the fda,and the fda has plenary authority to amend the regulations and requirements it imposed relating to the device,up to and including removing it from the market.at the end of the pma process leading to approval,the fda issues conditions of approval requiring the manufacturer to meet ongoing reporting and other obligations.see a d.the record shows that after the fda approved the,kendall submitted a proposed change to the warning label recognizing risk for patients with smaller veins,particularly females,and recommending additional procedures to mitigate this risk.gomez claims related to kendall alleged failure to provide information obtained after the fda approved the risk the same interference with the federal regulatory scheme as her other claims and are preempted.
gomez also claimed that kendall breached express warranties imposed under louisiana law relating to the.the seventh circuit has noted that express warranties,which arise s from the representations of the parties and are made as the basis of the bargain between them may not necessarily interfere with the operation of the pma,and therefore may not be preempted.mitchell,at.both parties agree that the express warranty was part of the ifu,which is itself part of the pma process.this fact does not resolve the issue,however,because a lawsuit that simply parallels or enforces the federal regulatory requirements without threatening or interfering with them is not preempted.see lohr,at.
the louisiana law governing claims of breach of express warranty reads,
a product is unreasonably dangerous when it does not conform to an express warranty made at any time by the manufacturer about the product if the express warranty has induced the claimant or another person or entity to use the product and the claimant damage was proximately caused because the express warranty was untrue.
ann.west.the district court held that the breach of warranty claim was preempted because the warranty is intertwined with the fda standards concerning the device design,testing,intended use,manufacturing methods,performance standards and labeling.at.unlike the alleged breach of express warranty at issue in mitchell,the louisiana statute goes beyond merely enforcing the federal requirements.the last part of the louisiana provision requires proof that the express warranty was untrue.ann.a jury hearing gomez breach of express warranty claim would have to decide whether kendall representations about the were true.because those the label,warnings,and approved by the fda through the pma process,the duties arising under the louisiana breach of warranty statute relate to,and are potentially inconsistent with,the federal regulatory scheme.the claim is preempted.accord baker medtronic,wl,at march,e xpress representations are subject to comprehensive fda regulation.citing martin telectronics pacing,cir.
gomez also alleged several claims,including claims of negligence per se.the district court denied kendall motion for summary judgment that federal law preempted gomez defective manufacturing claim.that statute requires a plaintiff to show that defendant is a manufacturer of the product the product proximately caused the plaintiff damage the damaging characteristic of the product rendered it unreasonably dangerous and the plaintiff damage arose from a reasonably anticipated use of the product.ann.west stahl novartis pharm,cir.gomez claims that kendall deviated from the specifications in manufacturing the used in her surgery survived summary judgment.
the district court properly granted summary judgment on gomez negligence claims that were based on aspects of the design,manufacture,and marketing that complied with the requirements.no negligence claims can be maintained as to devices that complied with the fda requirements because success on those claims requires a showing that the fda requirements themselves were deficient.these claims can not be presented to a jury because,if successful,they would be inconsistent with the federal regulatory requirements.the district judge properly limited gomez negligence claims to a claim that the used in her surgery was defectively manufactured because it did not comply with the specifications.mitchell,at the mitchells negligence claims must be considered preempted to the extent that they allege that collagen was negligent despite its adherence to the standards required by the fda in its pma for this specific product.the district court summary judgment ruling that gomez other state claims were preempted by the mda is affirmed.
to prevail on a manufacturing defect claim under louisiana law,the plaintiff must show that when the product left the manufacturer control,it deviated in a material way from the manufacturer specifications or performance standards for the product or from otherwise identical products manufactured by the same manufacturer.ann.west.at the close of the evidence,the district court granted kendall rule motion on the ground that gomez had failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the used in her surgery was defective,or that the alleged defect caused her injuries.to prevail on appeal,gomez must point to record evidence that could have supported a finding in her favor on defect and causation.in reviewing the record,we must draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all conflicting evidence in favor of gomez and refrain from weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.reeves,at.
a.the evidence of defect 
after gomez surgery,the hospital destroyed as medical waste.gomez had to rely on circumstantial evidence to prove that the used on her was defective.as the district court properly noted,however,the law does not distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence.see,holland united states.noting that circumstantial evidence is intrinsically no different than direct evidence.on a rule motion,the district judge could neither weigh the evidence presented nor make credibility determinations about it.see ellis weasler eng g,cir citing reeves,at.additional citations omitted.after a thorough review of the record,we find that gomez met her standard for defeating the rule motion as it related to defect.
seth bilazarian,an interventional cardiologist,john eidt,a vascular surgeon,and steven jones,a biomechanical engineer,testified about the and how it worked to stop bleeding at a puncture site used to access the bloodstream in a catheterization procedure.all gave testimony that supported an inference that a positive extension of the anchor in relation to the bypass tube violated the fda manufacturing specification,made the device defective,and that the device used on gomez in march contained this defect.
bilazarian testified that he had extensive experience in using.he testified as to why he concluded that in gomez case,the anchor did not perform its intended function of keeping collagen from the inside of the artery.the pathology report showed that the mass removed from gomez right femoral artery contained fragments of suture material and collagen.bilazarian testified that both came from the the suture is used to attach the anchor to the collagen plug and gomez own collagen would not be found inside her blood vessel,but only in the artery wall itself.tr.at.the contents of the mass supported an inference that the anchor did not operate properly.bilazarian testified that the pathology report was consistent with collagen causing a clot to form inside gomez artery,instead of on the outside artery wall.see id.at.bilazarian testified that the medical records showed no evidence of other conditions,such as a clotting disorder,that could explain the clot on the inside of the artery.bilazarian also testified that the medical records showed no evidence of causes for a collagen deposit inside the artery as a separation or dissection of the artery walls when the was than the improper operation of the anchor.
the district court relied on a statement incorrectly attributed to bilazarian in granting kendall rule motion.the district court stated that bilazarian had testified that if he saw an with the anchor extending past the bypass tube,he would simply tap it back into place and use it.the district court found this statement supported his conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of defect to allow the case to go to the jury.the record reveals that bilazarian,along with other witnesses,testified that if he saw such an extension,he would not push the anchor back inside the tube and would discard it.tr.at.
john eidt also testified that he would discard an with a positive anchor extension and explained why 
when you push the bracket through the hemostasis valve,it kind of like going through barroom doors,you kind of have to push them open to get through.
i think there the risk is that as you push the device through this sort of rubber seal,that if the extension,if the anchor is sticking out the end of the device it could malposition,it could cause it to rotate or change its relationship to the device so that when you do pull on it,when you get it in the artery instead of it being aligned the way it supposed to,it misaligned.
jones,the biomechanical engineer,explained that the hemostasis barroom made of silicon,a sticky viscous material harder than the plastic of the anchor.the bypass tube is intended to push through the hemostasis valve,while the anchor remains in the tube protective sheath.jones testified that if the anchor extended past the bypass tube and was the part of the pushing through the hemostasis valve,the anchor could be damaged and mispositioned inside the artery.in its proper position,the anchor is flat against the inner artery wall.if it is damaged when inserted into the artery,it could be positioned at an angle to the artery wall instead of flush against it.when the surgeon uses the tamping tube to tamp the collagen plug,an angled anchor could allow collagen to be tamped down into the artery itself.eidt testified that he could move a anchor back into the bypass tube.he was not asked,and did not testify,that he would do so before using the device on a patient.
kendall argued that gomez presented insufficient evidence that this anchor extending beyond the bypass present in the used in her surgery or that it was a defect.the evidence showed that the specifications called for the anchor to be fully within the bypass tube,no more than inches away from the end of that tube.tr.at.jones testified that an anchor extension is on the list of major defects for the.the evidence at trial showed that the devices supplied to the ochsner clinic came from two lots,and.kendall followed required protocol and tested from each of these lots before releasing them for shipment.the tests showed that in one of the lots,of the devices tested had positive anchor extensions that were nonconforming.jones testified that quality assurance inspections require an entire lot to be discarded if a random test of devices within the lot reveal a defect in out of devices a defect rate of.lot number had two defective within the samples one with an anchor extension of inches and one with an anchor extension of inches.tr.at.lot number also had two within the samples with deviations in the anchor position,but this lot had negative,not positive,anchor extensions.the record showed that the bulk of the devices supplied to the ochsner clinic came from lot number,which had a incidence of positive anchor extensions.tr.at,ex.
the testimony supported an inference that the lot supplying the majority of the devices shipped to the ochsner clinic during the relevant period had a positive anchor extension rate of out of devices,or,well in excess of the fda standards requiring disposal of the entire lot.jones testified that a company releasing a lot with such a high incidence of noncomforming devices is pretty much guaranteed to send out devices that exceed that specification.tr.at.
under kendall procedures,a record of a nonconformance requires quarantine of the discrepant material,review,and disposition by the material review board,and a preventive action response by a designated individual.id.tamara yount,the kendall quality assurance and regulatory affairs directors when kendall released the two lots at issue,corroborated much of jones testimony about the specifications in the two lots that were the source of the sent to the ochsner clinic.yount remembered the two lots with the anchor extensions and testified that these were the only two lots that had such deviations.tr.at.
yount served on the material review board that reviewed the deviations from manufacturing specifications and authorized the release of the devices.a material review board can not authorize release of noncomforming devices unless it determines that the deviation will have no clinical effect.tr.at.in her testimony,yount conceded that the positive anchor extensions were not in compliance with the specifications.tr.at.yount testified that the material review board determined that the positive anchor extensions would have no clinical effect on how the operated.tr.at.yount admitted that the board conducted no regular meetings and did not meet on this issue kept no minutes and performed no tests to determine the potential effects of a positive anchor extension in human surgical procedures.
yount testimony showed that after kendall discovered the anchor extension problem,it determined the likely cause.the employees placing in packages were putting the devices too close to the package sealer bars,which could cause the tubes to be pushed back when the package was sealed.kendall retrained its employees to avoid this problem.yount agreed with gomez witnesses that the purpose of requiring the anchor to be inside the bypass tube is to have the bypass tube push past the hemostasis valve.yount testimony did not show that the material review board specifically considered the effect of having the anchor,rather than the tube,push open the valve.
the jury heard testimony from witnesses,including bilazarian,eidt,and jones,that the anchor could be damaged if it extended beyond the bypass tube and had to push past the hemostasis valve.tr.at.kendall emphasizes that christopher white,gomez treating physician and the only witness who actually observed the used,did not record any indication of a positive anchor extension and had no recollection that he had ever seen one.medical witnesses who had also used testified that a physician might not notice an anchor extension in preparing to use the device at the end of a surgical procedure.tr.at.the fact that white disagreed with some of gomez expert and fact witnesses,however,or that there were inconsistencies in some of the testimony of the witnesses gomez called,does not support granting the rule motion.the evidence could support an inferen
