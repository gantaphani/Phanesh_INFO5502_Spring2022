discussion 
at issue is whether the proposed regulation is within the eeoc authority under the adea,and whether the regulation is valid under the apa.
i.the proposed regulation is within the eeoc exemption authority under section of the adea 
there is a approach to judicial review of an agency regulation.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.step one asks whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the intent of congress is clearly expressed in the statute,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,and such intent must be given effect.id.at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,then the court proceeds to a determination of whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
the precise question in this case is whether the eeoc has the power to issue a regulation exempting from the prohibitions of the adea benefits plans that coordinate retiree health benefits with eligibility for medicare or health benefits programs.section of the adea authorizes the eeoc to establish such reasonable exemptions to and from any or all provisions of the act as it may find necessary and proper in the public interest.the eeoc acknowledges this source of authority in its notice of the proposed rulemaking,stating that a fter an study,the commission believes that the practice of coordinating retiree health benefits with medicare eligibility presents a circumstance that warrants commission exercise of its adea exemption authority p ursuant to its authority under section of the act,the eeoc proposes this notice of proposed rulemaking.at.
section clearly and unambiguously grants to the eeoc the authority to provide,at least,narrow exemptions from the prohibitions of the adea.by definition,the power to grant exemptions provides an agency with authority to permit certain actions at variance with the express provisions of the statute in question.by stating that any or all provisions may be subject to exemptions congress made plain its intent to allow limited practices not otherwise permitted under the statute,so long as they are reasonable and necessary and proper in the public interest.emphasis added because the language of section expressly grants to the eeoc the power to implement such exceptions,there is no question that a limited exemption shown by the agency to be reasonable,necessary,and proper falls within the agency authority under the statute.
aarp argues that the proposed exemption exceeds the eeoc authority under section because it would allow certain employer practices otherwise prohibited by the adea.see appellants br.aarp points to section of the adea,which states that i t shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a.as discussed previously,however,it is clear that congress intended to permit limited exemptions from the adea,including the provision of section.section unambiguously grants reasonable exemption authority to the eeoc,and plainly states that such authority applies to any and all parts of the statute.because section clearly grants such authority to the eeoc,the fact that the proposed regulation would allow certain practices not otherwise permitted under section does not render the regulation invalid.
this is not to say that the eeoc exemption authority is unlimited.as indicated,section limits permissible exemptions to those that are shown to be reasonable and necessary and proper in the public interest.here,the eeoc issued the proposed regulation in response to its finding that retiree health benefits were decreasing.at.rather than maintaining retiree benefits at eligibility levels for all retirees in order to avoid discrimination under the adea,some employers chose to reduce all retiree health benefits to a lower level.id.at.further,in addition to rising health care costs and increased demand for retiree benefits,the eeoc correctly noted that employers are not required to provide any retiree health benefits,or to maintain such plans once they have been established id.at.retiree benefits often face elimination under these constraints,and the eeoc issued the proposed exemption to permit employers to offer retiree benefits to the greatest extent possible.id.at.we recognize with some dismay that the proposed exemption may allow employers to reduce health benefits to retirees over the age of while maintaining greater benefits for younger retirees.under the circumstances,h
