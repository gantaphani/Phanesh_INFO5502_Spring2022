invoking,víctor filed suit in district court alleging that the prison conditions under which he was housed in puerto rico violated his constitutional rights.his case was dismissed by the district court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,as required by the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat.
because we conclude that the appellant was required to first submit his claim to the prison internal grievance process,we affirm the order of the district court dismissing the complaint.
appellant víctor appellant or was incarcerated on february.during his first six months in prison,appellant was transferred among several correctional facilities administered by the puerto rico administration of corrections the aoc.while he was housed in aoc facilities,was the object of numerous threats against his life,both verbal and physical.many of the threats stemmed from the fact that served as a cooperating witness for the government in several criminal cases.
on september,was transferred to the bayamón correctional facility operated by the wackenhut corrections corporation wcc.in october of that year,was severely beaten by a group of inmates.on december,at the same facility,an inmate broke free from his cell and attempted to kill with a crude homemade knife.then,on march,saw one inmate murder another inmate who was attempting to protect.although and his relatives informed the prison staff of his perilous situation,no serious steps were taken to rectify the problem or to ensure safety.
remained at wcc bayamón correctional facility until september,at which time he was transferred to the metropolitan detention center mdc,a federal correctional facility in guaynabo,puerto rico.shortly after his transfer to the federal facility,was seen by a health care professional,who diagnosed him as suffering from stress disorder ptsd.
remained at mdc until november,after which he returned to wcc bayamón correctional facility.at present,he remains in the custody of the aoc.
on may,while still a prisoner at mdc,filed a pro se complaint against the commonwealth of puerto rico and the secretary of the aoc,named in both her official and personal capacity.the complaint was later amended on april,to name numerous additional defendants,including wcc and a slew of prison officials.
the gravamen of the complaint is that the defendants,in violation of constitutional rights,caused him to develop ptsd while incarcerated in facilities administered by the aoc.
all of the defendants filed motions seeking the dismissal of the case on the ground that had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing the complaint,as required by a of the plra.the district court,finding that the administrative remedies had indeed gone unutilized,dismissed the complaint.timely appeal followed.
because he believes the administrative grievance procedure was not available to him at the time he filed his complaint in federal court,seeks reversal of the district court dismissal of his case.the seek affirmance of the district court order on the basis of failure to exhaust.in the alternative,the seek affirmance on the ground that the complaint was.
when presented with a motion to dismiss,the district court must take as true the facts as they appear in the complaint,extending the plaintiff every reasonable inference in his favor.coyne city of somerville,cir citing,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.roeder alpha,cir quoting conley gibson,d.we review the district court resolution of a motion to dismiss de novo.see aldridge cross,cir.
section a of the plra provides that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.as the supreme court recently observed 
beyond doubt,congress enacted a to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits to this purpose,congress afforded corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case.in some instances,corrective action taken in response to an inmate grievance might improve prison administration and satisfy the inmate,thereby obviating the need for litigation.in other instances,the internal review might filter out some frivolous claims.and for cases ultimately brought to court,adjudication could be facilitated by an administrative record that clarifies the contours of the controversy.

in the case at hand,it is undisputed that claim is an action with respect to prison conditions under a.see id.at.at holding that the plra exhaustion requirement extends to all inmate suits about prison life.likewise,there is no dispute here that failed to exhaust the administrative remedies in place at the facility where his injuries occurred.the appellant only challenge on appeal is to the district court determination that those administrative procedures were available to him for purposes of a.
argues that he was in the custody of the federal prison system at the time he filed his claim and that the grievance mechanism for prisoners at facilities administered by the aoc was therefore no longer available to him.in support of this argument,relies on a handful of cases holding that provisions of the plra do not apply to a person who is no longer incarcerated at the time his complaint is filed.see,janes hernández,cir,cert.denied,d greig goord,cir kerr puckett,cir.
also points to article iii of the aoc regulations for the handling of grievances and complaints filed by inmates,which provides,in part,that t his regulation shall apply to the employees of the correction administration of the commonwealth of puerto rico,and,to all the inmates in penal institutions administered by said agency.according to,this language precluded him from submitting an administrative complaint when he filed his lawsuit because,at the time,he was not an inmate in an aoc institution.
neither the cases nor the regulation on which appellant relies are availing.first,the cases cited by do not stand for the proposition that an inmate who is transferred to a new facility need not exhaust the administrative remedies of the first facility before filing suit against it or against any of its employees.indeed,the extant case law supports the opposite conclusion.see rodríguez senkowski,d,t he mere fact that plaintiff has been transferred to another prison facility does not necessarily render the exhaustion requirement moot.see also santiago meinsen,d,requiring exhaustion despite plaintiff transfer to another facility.the cases cited by appellant hold only that certain provisions of the plra will not apply when the plaintiff is no longer a prisoner by virtue of his release.see,greig,at.however,in this case,there is no doubt that was a prisoner subject to the requirements of the plra at the time of his complaint.the plra defines prisoner as any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of,convicted of,sentenced for,or adjudicated delinquent for,violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole,probation,pretrial release,or diversionary program.h.the fact that happened to be a prisoner in various locations,and under the custody of different officials,does not affect his obligation to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit.
as for the aoc regulations,they give no indication that the grievance procedures are not available for purposes of the plra.nothing in the regulations explicitly prevents from filing an administrative complaint while temporarily housed at another facility.at best,argument amounts to a claim that it would be futile for him to resort to the aoc administrative remedies because they could not afford him the relief he seeks in federal court.however,there is no futility exception to the plra exhaustion requirement.massey wheeler,cir see
