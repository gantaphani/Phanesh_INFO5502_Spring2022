in a previous proceeding,the national labor relations board found that respondent jackson hospital corporation,which does business as kentucky river medical center,fired eight employees because of their union support and participation in a lawful strike,in violation of sections a and of the national labor relations act.a.jackson,enforced.lexis.june.the board now seeks to enforce its supplemental decision and order directing jackson hospital to pay specific backpay amounts to four of the eight discriminatees eileen jewell,debbie miller,lois noble,and maxine ritchie.we enforce the board order.
in,before a agreement could be reached between jackson hospital and the united steelworkers,which represented this unit of jackson hospital employees,the employees went on strike.following reports of discrimination in retaliation to the strike,the national labor relations board general counsel issued a complaint alleging that jackson hospital had engaged in unfair labor practices.an administrative law judge held that jackson hospital had unlawfully discharged eight employees because of their union support and participation in the strike.the board affirmed those findings and the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit enforced the order.jackson,enforced.lexis.june.
this dispute concerns the backpay amounts owed to four reinstated employees.after a hearing,an administrative law judge issued a supplemental decision ordering jackson hospital to pay specific backpay amounts.the board then issued its own supplemental decision and order affirming the administrative law judge findings and adopting her proposed order with slight modifications to the backpay awards for maxine ritchie and debra miller 
the board filed its application for enforcement before this court.the facts specific to each employee are discussed,as relevant,below,and the complete facts are recounted at length in jackson hosp.
before proceeding to jackson hospital contentions,we begin with its global argument encompassing all of the employees namely,that the alj improperly ruled that jackson hospital was not entitled to certain personal banking and other records that may or may not have revealed that the discriminatees were hiding income.before the alj,jackson hospital requested,in total,income tax records,documents showing job qualifications,information,and retirement,disability,education,and banking records.the alj enforced the subpoenas against the discriminatees for documents relating to interim earnings,search for work,supplemental education,and union correspondence,but quashed jackson hospital demands for personal banking records and records related to other private financial obligations.in denying jackson hospital request,the alj characterized it as speculative and as part of a fishing expedition.and jackson hospital admits that it has no particular reason to suspect that these employees hid any income,thus it necessarily argues that all employers are entitled to the sort of personal financial information that it was denied in every backpay case otherwise,it asserts,the proceeding is so unfair that its due process rights were violated.
generally,aljs have broad authority over their hearings,and we review decisions to exclude evidence only for abuse of discretion.river cmty.care,nlrb,cir.jackson hospital heavily relies on nlrb overseas motors,cir,which involved an alj who refused to allow an employer to even a discriminatee who had kept no records regarding his as to the source of nearly that he had spent on family trips and living expenses,id.at.but that situation was particularly egregious because the employee estimates of his living expenses were so one point he testified to only spending a month but other records indicated yearly expenses of over.id.
nothing here is so severe,and thus the alj did not violate jackson hospital due process rights when it denied its request for such private financial information.for an employer to show that it is entitled to the kind of private financial information that jackson hospital requests,it must establish some reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is hiding income.see overseas motors,at.jackson hospital was permitted to fully the discriminatees which gave rise to no reasonable suspicion that the employees were hiding income,had ample other evidence to adequately determine their appropriate backpay awards including social security records,and the employees testimony regarding their expenses and efforts went unrebutted.and,at oral argument,jackson hospital counsel admitted that it had no individualized basis to suspect that the employees here were hiding anything,and,instead argued for a blanket rule that employers were always entitled to such personal records in every case.this goes too far,and the alj did not abuse her discretion.
jackson hospital also challenges the enforcement of the board order with respect to each employee,arguing that the record does not include substantial evidence to support the board conclusion that eileen jewell properly mitigated her damages debbie miller backpay award was improper because the board should have considered the income she received from the trucking business she owned lois noble backpay award should have been tolled when she rejected jackson hospital offer of temporary interim employment and jackson hospital should have been given the opportunity to litigate maxine ritchie status as a supervisor via retroactive application of the board decision in oakwood healthcare.
when the board finds that an employer has engaged in an unfair labor practice,section c of the national labor relations act compels it to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay,as will effectuate the act policies.c.the board remedial power is a broad,discretionary one,subject to limited judicial review.fibreboard paper prods.corps.nlrb,d.as a result,we may not disturb the board backpay orders unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the act.overseas motors,at quoting fibreboard,at.thus,the question is whether the board has abused its discretion in fashioning its remedial order.nlrb joyce,cir quotations omitted.

eileen jewell 
jackson hospital argues that the record does not include substantial evidence to support the conclusion that jewell properly mitigated her damages.prior to firing her,jackson hospital employed sixty years a surgical technician.her duties included sterilizing surgical instruments,ensuring that scrubs and other equipment were available for the surgeons,and generally keeping surgical areas clean.as determined by the alj and affirmed by the board,her backpay period began on august,when she was fired,and concluded in the third quarter of,when she retired and began to receive social security benefits.
the alj found that,after being fired,jewell looked for work in the beattyville and lee county areas near her home she did not apply to nearby hospitals because,as
