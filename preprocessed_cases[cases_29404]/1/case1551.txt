rudina demiraj and her son,rediol demiraj,petition for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.the petitioners,who are albanian nationals,are the wife and son of edmond demiraj,a material witness in the united states prosecution of bill bedini.while conceding removability,the petitioners contend that they reasonably fear reprisal from bedini and his associates if they are returned to albania.
while the petitioners have assembled competent record evidence of the risks they may face upon returning to albania,we,like the immigration judge ij and the bia,nevertheless conclude that those concerns do not entitle them to the relief they seek under the immigration and nationality act.we therefore deny the petition for review.
facts procedural history 
rudina demiraj and her minor son,rediol,entered the united states without inspection in october.demiraj timely filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment convention against torture,treaty doc.demiraj named rediol as a derivative beneficiary of her application.in her application,filed on september,and refiled as corrected on november,demiraj asserted that she was entitled to the relief requested because of her and her family political involvement in opposing albania former communist regime and current socialist party and consequent fear of reprisal and torture in albania on december,the immigration and naturalization service issued demiraj and her son a notice to appear,charging her with removability after a hearing before an ij in,demiraj and her son were denied all relief and ordered removed.demiraj appealed to the bia,claiming that the court interpreter was ineffective the bia dismissed the appeal in october.
in february,the bia allowed demiraj to reopen her case based on changed circumstances.after the ij initial disposition of demiraj case,demiraj was shot in albania by bill bedini,an albanian wanted in the united states for human smuggling demiraj had been identified by the united states as a material witness against bedini,but demiraj never actually testified against bedini because bedini fled to albania.after demiraj was deported to albania,bedini kidnaped,beat,and shot demiraj because of his cooperation with the united states efforts to prosecute bedini.after demiraj recovered from the shooting,local police in albania took his statement but intimated that they would not investigate the crime.bedini threatened demiraj again,and he fled to the united states.demiraj was granted withholding of removal in a separate proceeding during the same time period,two of demiraj nieces were also kidnaped by bedini and his associates and trafficked to italy.after escaping,the nieces fled to the united states and were granted asylum.
these new facts,along with evidence of the interfamilial blood feud culture in albania,were presented to the ij following the bia order to reopen demiraj proceedings.the ij credited all of the testimony presented by demiraj but found nevertheless that she was not entitled to any of the relief she sought.the ij therefore ordered demiraj and her son deported to albania.the bia dismissed the appeal in november,adopting and affirming the decision of the ij.demiraj petitioned this court for review,but before we issued a decision,the attorney general moved for voluntary remand to the bia for reconsideration in light of the supreme court intervening decision in gonzales thomas.we granted that motion and remanded.demiraj gonzales,slip op.at cir.june.
on remand,the bia applied thomas but again dismissed the appeal in october.demiraj filed a second petition for review with this court and moved to reconsider before the bia,offering additional evidence that another of demiraj nieces had been granted asylum in the united states after bedini kidnaped her and told her she would pay for the actions of her sisters and her uncle.we stayed proceedings until the bia denied the motion to reconsider in july demiraj also filed a third petition for review of the order denying reconsideration.
demiraj petitions for review of the bia october decision on remand and of its july denial of reconsideration were timely filed.we have jurisdiction under b and d.
ii.standard of review 
the bia interpretation of statutory and regulatory provisions that determine whether a petitioner is statutorily eligible for relief from removal is an issue of law that we review de novo.see ashcroft,cir reviewing statutory eligibility for asylum shaikh holder,cir reviewing statutory eligibility for withholding of removal efe ashcroft,cir reviewing eligibility for protection under the convention against torture.in that de novo review,we afford considerable deference to the bia interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the bia interpretation is incorrect.shaikh,at quoting mikhael ins,cir.
we review the bia underlying findings of fact for substantial evidence,which requires only that the bia decisions be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.shaikh,at citing mikhael,at,and quoting omagah ashcroft,cir see also b b.where,as here,the bia decision depended in large part on the factual findings of the ij,we review the ij findings under this same standard to the extent that they influenced or were relied upon by the bia.see chun ins,cir.
iii.discussion 
demiraj and her son asserted three grounds for relief from removal before the ij and the bia asylum,withholding of removal based on a probability of persecution,and protection under the convention against torture.the ij and the bia ruled that the petitioners were ineligible for any of the three forms of relief.asylum and withholding of removal based on a probability of persecution are closely related,and the bia found the petitioners statutorily ineligible for relief under both for the same reason we therefore address those claims together 
asylum withholding of removal 
the bia found the petitioners ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal because,even crediting all of the petitioners evidence,demiraj and her son could not demonstrate that any persecution they might suffer in albania was on account of their membership in the demiraj family within the meaning of the statute and regulation.an alien who is otherwise subject to removal is eligible for discretionary asylum if the alien demonstrates that she is a refugee as defined under the immigration and nationality act ina.b a see also b.the statute in turn defines refugee in relevant part as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to her home county because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group a a.similarly,an alien may obtain withholding of removal if she proves that her life or freedom would be threatened in th e country to which removal is ordered because of the alien membership in a particular social group b a.the petitioners argue that they would be persecuted in albania by bedini on account of their membership in a particular social group,namely,the demiraj family.the bia,in its order after voluntary remand,agreed with the petitioners that the demiraj family could constitute a particular social group within the meaning of the asylum and withholding of removal statutes,and the government does not dispute that conclusion.
the core of this case instead is the question of whether demiraj evidence showed that she reasonably feared persecution or likely would be persecuted on account of her family membership see thuri ashcroft,cir.the ij and the bia concluded that the evidence did not establish this requisite connection between her family membership and the identified persecution by bedini and his associates.the only dispute between the parties is whether the facts as found by the ij constitute,as a matter of law,proof of persecution on account of demiraj membership in the demiraj family or not.
after considering the record and the case law,the bia explained its conclusion thus 
nexus may be shown where there is a desire by the alleged or feared persecutor to punish membership in the particular social group,and also where there is a desire by the persecutor to overcome what is deemed to be an offensive characteristic identifying the particular social group.the respondents here,demiraj and her son must identify some evidence,direct or circumstantial,that the assailants are motivated,at least in part,by a desire to punish or to overcome the family relationship to demiraj s husband.
here,the individuals involved were seeking revenge against demiraj for his testimony,and seek to harm him by attacking the respondents.we do not ordinarily find that acts motivated solely by criminal intent,personal vendettas,or personal desires for revenge establish the required nexus on this record,although the respondents are members of a particular social group,we do not find they fear persecution on account of this membership.rather,the problems they may face are on account of revenge the assailants are attempting to extract against demiraj.
in re demiraj,nos,slip op.at,internal citations omitted.
the parties disagree about the meaning of on account of.we need not resolve that dispute here because,even assuming that the petitioners definition because of is the correct one,they can not prevail.the crucial finding here is that the record discloses no evidence that demiraj would be targeted for her membership in the demiraj family as such.rather,the evidence strongly suggests that demiraj,her son,and demiraj nieces were targeted because they are people who are important to is,because hurting them would hurt demiraj.no one suggests that distant members of the demiraj family have been systematically targeted as would be the case if,for example,a persecutor sought to terminate a line of dynastic succession.nor does the record suggest that the fact of and demiraj marriage and formal inclusion in the demiraj family matters to bedini that is,demiraj would not be any safer in albania if she divorced demiraj and renounced membership in the family,nor would she be any safer if she were demiraj girlfriend of many years rather than his wife.the record here discloses a quintessentially personal motivation,not one based on a prohibited reason under the ina thus,the record in this case does not compel us to reject the bia determination here.demiraj and her son are not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal.
convention against torture 
the united states implementation of the article provision of the convention against torture entitles an alien to withholding of removal if she can establish that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c see also gonzales,cir to obtain relief under the convention against torture,the alien need not demonstrate all of the elements of a persecution claim instead he must show a likelihood of torture upon return to his homeland.the regulation defines torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
in this case,the ij found demiraj proof of consent or acquiescence by a public official lacking.a state actor only acquiesces in torture if the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,ha s awareness of such activity and thereafter breach es his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.a see also hakim d,wl,at cir,holding that acquiescence is satisfied by a government willful blindness of torturous activity.we have thus held that relief under the convention against torture requires a two part,is it more likely than not that the alien will be tortured upon return to his homeland and second,is there sufficient state action involved in that torture,at footnote omitted.
the bia adopted the ij opinion with respect to the convention against torture and provided no independent analysis of that issue.the ij concluded that demiraj had not demonstrated that she would more likely than not be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the albanian government.the ij found that 
a lthough the police in albania apparently,assuming that demiraj information is correct,are reluctant to get involved with her problems with be d ini and his associates,there is no evidence that the government of albania has a policy of ignoring torture if they are specifically aware of its occurrence at the time it is occurring and also there is no evidence that demiraj and her son would be detained on behalf of the government and subjected to torture with the government acquiescence.
we decline to disturb this finding.we may only reject the finding of fact that demiraj was not likely to be tortured if the evidence presented by the petitioner was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the finding was incorrect.see ins,see also chen gonzales,cir holding that the standard of review under b b essentially codifies the substantial evidence test established by the supreme court in.demiraj only presented evidence that her husband had difficulty convincing the local police to investigate his shooting after the fact.the standard for acquiescence,as the ij finding emphasizes,requires an official to be aware of ongoing torture and likely to refuse to act to intervene and prevent the torture as it is occurring no such evidence was presented here.
the state department country report on albania,which was in evidence before the ij,estimated that to percent of what it termed blood feud homicides were brought to court and nearly all of them ended up at the appellate level.the portion of that report that expressly assesses the country record on torture noted occasional incidents of torture committed by public officials and described most as having been investigated and prosecuted.the ij therefore had sufficient record evidence to conclude that the state was not more likely than not to acquiesce in torture and therefore also to deny relief under that treaty.
iv.conclusion 
we find no error in the bia conclusion that the petitioners are not entitled to asylum,withholding of removal under the ina,or protection under the convention against torture.we therefore must deny the petitions.
dennis,circuit judge,dissenting.
i respectfully dissent.to show persecution on account of a protected ground,a a only requires the alien to prove some nexus between the persecution and one of the five protected grounds.thuri ashcroft,cir quoting ashcroft,cir the evidence presented by demiraj in this case clearly demonstrates a nexus between the persecution she fears and the protected ground of membership in a social group,her membership in the family of demiraj.
bedini,an albanian mobster,has shown himself to be a powerful person capable of brutal violence.bedini previously threatened demiraj for agreeing to aid the united states government in its investigation of his involvement in human smuggling,and,in march,abducted demiraj and his brother.bedini and the other captors beat both men,and bedini then shot demiraj at close range.although demiraj survived,his physician later told him that he was lucky the bullet did not go through his kidney.although demiraj requested help from the police,they refused to take any action against bedini.demiraj then escaped to the united states in april,and was granted withholding of removal.
besides this attack,bedini has targeted other demiraj family members because they are members of demiraj family.in april,several men,one of whom appears to have been bedini,kidnapped two of the demirajs nieces in albania and took them to italy,whe
