title g,a part of the occupational health and safety act of,the osh act or the act,provides that the occupational safety and health review commission the commission or the oshrc shall,in the absence of a contrary rule adopted by the commission,hold its proceedings in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure,id.g.this appeal requires us to decide whether the commission may,by dint of this subsection,exercise jurisdiction to excuse an employer failure to file a timely notice of contest in response to a citation by the occupational safety and health agency osha based on the commission finding that the failure was caused by the employer inadvertence or excusable neglect.b.we hold that it may not.
background 
statutory backgrounda.relevant provisions 
congress enacted the osh act to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions.b.it assigned responsibility for implementing the act to two administrative actors the secretary of labor the secretary and the commission.see martin oshrc,d.the act vests the secretary with powers and charges him or her to set and enforc e workplace health and safety standards.id.at.the secretary exercises power largely through osha,see id.at,which enforces the secretary standards by,inter alia,issuing citations and proposing penalties against employers whom it finds to be in violation of them.see.the commission,by contrast,bears responsibility for adjudicatory functions under the act.id.b.it provides a forum in which employers may contest the merits of osha citations and proposed penalties.see martin,at.
if an osha inspection or investigation reveals that,in osha view,an employer has violated the osh act or an osha rule or regulation,osha must issue a citation to the employer describing the violation and fixing a reasonable time for its abatement.see a.section a of the act requires osha to notify the employer by certified mail of the penalty,if any,proposed to be assessed with respect to the alleged violation.a.an employer may contest a citation or proposed penalty by filing a notice of contest with the secretary within fifteen working days after receiving notice of the citation see id.
provided an employer files a timely notice of contest,the secretary will forward it to the commission.the commission must then afford the employer an opportunity for a hearing and thereafter issue an order,based on findings of fact,affirming,modifying,or vacating the secretary citation or proposed penalty,or directing other appropriate relief.c if a cited employer fails to file a timely notice of contest,however,the secretary citation and proposed penalty shall be deemed a final order of the commission and not subject to review by any court or agency.id.a 
the osh act authorizes the commission to make such rules as are necessary for the orderly transaction of its proceedings.id.g.but u nless the commission has adopted a different rule,its proceedings shall be in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.id.both the secretary and the employer may seek judicial review of an adverse final order of the commission in a federal court of appeals.see id.a,b.but unless otherwise ordered by the court,judicial review of orders that are deemed final under a,because of the employer failure to contest the citation within fifteen working days,consists of no more than the entry of a decree enforcing the order.id.b.
interpretations of the commission jurisdiction 
the commission is no more than a creature of congress,brennan oshrc otinger,cir,and its jurisdiction and substantive powers therefore derive only from an affirmative congressional grant of authority.the commission and the secretary identify three textual bases in the act for commission jurisdiction,but disagree on which are valid.
first,both the commission and the secretary agree that,provided the secretary advises the commission of an employer notice of contest,and the notice unequivocally satisfies the deadline,the commission has jurisdiction under.see c.none of the parties contend that jurisdiction exists on this ground here.
second,both the commission and the secretary assert that the commission may interpret the deadline as the functional equivalent of a statute of limitations.if that is correct,then the commission may have the authority to equitably toll the limitations period under certain circumstances.equitable tolling is a doctrine that permits courts to extend a statute of limitations on a basis to prevent inequity.warren garvin,cir see,irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d equitable tolling appropriate where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period,or has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass johnson nyack,cir equitable tolling appropriate where a party is prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising his rights citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the commission might,for example,decide to toll the period where extenuating circumstances prevented an employer timely delivery of a notice of contest.this equitable power,if it exists,derives from the commission authority to interpret and apply,the statutory provision that confers jurisdiction upon it.some courts have upheld the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling by the commission.see,atl.marine,oshrc,cir per curiam noting that equitable tolling is permitted where the secretary violates his or her own regulations and the employer suffers actual prejudice as a result.because equitable tolling do es not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,irwin,at,which,as we shall see,is the case here,even if the commission has power to equitably toll the period,it could not do so in order to hear le frois case.
finally,the commission alone contends that it can also exercise jurisdiction under g,which provides that except where the commission has adopted a different rule,its proceedings shall be in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure,id.the commission interprets g to authorize it to excuse an employer untimely filing under some circumstances because rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure allows the adjudicator to excuse a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for inter alia mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.jurisdiction predicated on rule b,if it exists,would supplement the preceding two theories because a does not,by its terms,authorize the commission to exercise jurisdiction over inadvertently late filings that are barred by the deadline and not amenable to equitable tolling.see irwin,at.rule b,by contrast,vests the adjudicator with discretion to exercise jurisdiction under these circumstances.
in this case the sole issue is whether the commission may consider a notice of contest where it finds that the employer tardiness was caused by inadvertence or excusable delay,as it held in the present case.russell le frois builder,oshrc docket,wl,osahrc lexis.the answer would be yes under.b,but no under either of the first two theories of jurisdiction.see irwin,at.noting that equitable tolling do es not extend to excusable neglect zipes trans world airlines,d distinguishing jurisdictional requirements from statutes of limitation,which are subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.a decision in this case,then,requires only a determination whether the commission has jurisdiction under.b.
changing interpretations of the commission jurisdiction 
the commission and the secretary views on this issue have changed over time.beginning in,the commission took the position that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under a to consider notices of contest under any circumstances,including in response to motions for relief from final judgment brought under.b.see sec y plessy burton,oshrc docket,osahrc,wl,at,osahrc lexis,at.but the third circuit rejected this interpretation of the act in hass oshrc,cir,wherein it held that the commission could apply rule b to excuse some inadvertent late filings.the commission thereafter overruled plessey burton,and adopted the holding of hass.see sec y branciforte builders,oshrc docket,wl,at,osahrc lexis,at july.the commission has maintained this position ever since.see,sec y northwest conduit,oshrc docket,wl,osahrc lexis.
although the secretary has consistently opposed the commission asserted authority to grant relief under rule b from orders deemed final by operation of a of the osh act,its position on the commission equitable authority to toll the period has changed.for several years,the secretary maintained that the commission lacked all jurisdiction over notices of contest and therefore could not grant relief under.b,as a matter of equity,or otherwise.see,sec y jackson assocs.of nassau,oshrc docket,wl,at,osahrc lexis,at june.more recently,including in the present case,the secretary has agreed with the commission that the deadline established by a should be construed as a statute of limitations,which the commission may equitably toll at times.the secretary continues to contend,however,that the commission may not apply.b to reopen a citation that has been deemed final under a merely because of inadvertence or excusable neglect.see,sec y calhar,oshrc docket,osahrc lexis,at,appellant br.at.
ii.factual background.
in may,osha issued five citations to russell le frois builder,le frois for serious violations of workplace that it discovered during an inspection conducted two months earlier.osha sent notice of the citations to le frois by certified mail proposing a total of in penalties.
a le frois secretary retrieved the notice from the post office but subsequently misplaced it.apparently it slipped behind a seat in her automobile.she did not discover the notice until july,well after the deadline for le frois to file a notice of contest.nonetheless,le frois promptly contacted the commission and filed its notice of contest on july.osha forwarded the notice to the commission and moved before the alj assigned to the matter to dismiss the notice as untimely.
the alj applied rule b but denied relief on the ground that le frois had failed to show excusable neglect.the commission reversed.see russell le frois builder,oshrc docket,wl,osahrc lexis oshrc.it first observed that u nder the commission precedent,relief may be granted in appropriate circumstances under.b,wl,at,osahrc lexis,at.it then concluded that le frois had in fact shown inadvertence or excusable neglect for which relief is appropriate under rule b,wl,at,osahrc lexis,at,and the commission therefore remanded the matter to the alj for further proceedings.
on remand,the secretary maintained the position that the commission lacked jurisdiction to entertain the notice of contest because of the deadline in a.the alj nonetheless vacated the citations,and the commission declined to review the vacatur,making the alj ruling a final,appealable order.see j.the secretary now petitions for review of the commission exercise of jurisdiction under rule b to excuse le frois late notice of contest.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we address at the outset whether this matter presents an article iii case or controversy over which we have appellate jurisdiction.the secretary,appearing by the solicitor of the department of labor,brought and perfected this appeal.apparently because of the relatively modest sum at stake,however,le frois refrained from employing counsel to represent it on appeal.it submitted only a letter from a lay asking us to affirm based upon the decision rendered and the evidentiary record below.consistent with its agency practice,the commission also declined to file a brief or make an appearance.a brief in support of le frois has been submitted,however,by two amici curiae the national federation of independent business and the kitchen cabinet manufacturers association.
under these circumstances,we requested letter briefs from the secretary,the commission,and amici addressing whether le frois absence on appeal divests us of jurisdiction.all of the parties contend that it does not,and upon consideration,we agree.le frois decision not to participate actively affects neither the adverse status of the parties nor the concrete nature of their controversy.le frois stands to lose more than if we reverse conversely,the secretary stands to lose the right to impose that sanction if we affirm.confronted with similar circumstances,other federal courts of appeals have sustained appellate jurisdiction.see,brennan oshrc hanovia lamp,canred precision indus,cir brennan oshrc bill echols trucking,cir see also casco indemn.interlocal risk mgt.trust,cir considering an appeal where only the appellant filed a brief and collecting cases finding this practice appropriate fed.c providing that the sole sanction for an appellee failure to file an appellate brief is that the appellee will not be heard at oral argument except by permission of the court.
ii.standard of review 
we uphold an order of an administrative agency such as the commission unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.a new york state gas sec y of labor,cir.whether the commission may exercise jurisdiction on the basis of.b is a question of law.
iii.analysis 
deference to agency interpretation 
this dispute requires us to resolve a question of statutory interpretation as to which two administrative secretary and the competing views.at the outset we must therefore decide to which of these agents interpretations,if either,we owe deference under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,or skidmore swift.and the nature and extent of that deference.
the supreme court recently held in united states mead,d,that an agency interpretation qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,id.at.emphasis added.otherwise,the court noted,the agency interpretation may merit the more limited deference recognized in skidmore.see,at.for purposes of analysis,then,we must first decide to which administrative secretary or the delegated authority to make rules carrying the force of law.id.at.only then can we decide the nature or extent of that deference.
the delegation of authority under the osh act.in martin oshrc,d,the supreme court deferred to the secretary rather than the commission as to the meaning of osh act regulations.it referred to the commission as a neutral arbiter,id.at.quoting cuyahoga valley ry.united transp.union,d per curiam,that review s the secretary interpretations of its regulations only for consistency with the regulatory language and for reasonableness,id.at.see also donovan oshrc mobil oil,cir noting that congress gave the commission the relatively limited role of administrative adjudication,and its agenda is tied strictly to of the act quoting oshrc,cir.the martin court emphasized that congress delegated to the commission only the type of nonpolicymaking adjudicatory powers typically exercised by a court in the context.martin,at.emphasis in original.
consistent with this allocation of authority,in order to decide where the secretary and enforcement power ends and the commission administrative jurisdiction begins,courts generally defer to the secretary interpretation of the osh act rather the commission.see,martin,cir deferring to the secretary rather than the commission in a dispute over the commission jurisdiction to conduct hearings when an employer notice of contest is made orally rather than in writing sec y of labor barretto granite,cir same donovan,at declining to defer to the commission in determining whether it has jurisdiction to review settlement agreements between cited employers and the secretary.
because congress delegated authority under the osh act to the secretary,we similarly conclude that the secretary not the commission,has authority to interpret the statute with respect to the present question,and we should therefore defer to the views of the secretary rather than the commission.see mead,at.
