facing deportation,petitioner juraluk upatcha,a citizen of thailand,sought a hardship waiver that would allow her to stay in the country despite the fact that her marriage to a united states citizen had ended in divorce.an immigration judge ij denied the request,concluding that upatcha failed to demonstrate that she entered into her marriage in good faith,as required by c b.the board of immigration appeals bia or board,reviewing for clear error only,affirmed.
we hold that the bia applied the wrong standard of review.whether upatcha established that her marriage was entered into in good faith under c b is a mixed question of fact and law,and the ij ultimate conclusion that the credited evidence did not meet the good faith standard is a legal judgment subject to de novo review.accordingly,we grant upatcha petition and remand so that the board may review the ij determination under the proper standard.
while living in thailand,upatcha was introduced by her sister to sergio gonzalez,a naturalized united states citizen living in south carolina.because of the distance between them,upatcha and gonzalez courted primarily through emails and phone calls.but gonzalez also made a trip to thailand to visit upatcha,and during that trip upatcha accepted his marriage proposal.upatcha entered the united states on a fianc√© visa on july,and five days later she married gonzalez.
as a result of her marriage to a united states citizen,upatcha became a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis.see a.after a period of two years,that condition would expire,allowing upatcha to stay in the country permanently,if upatcha and her husband submitted a joint petition swearing that their marriage was legal,remained in effect,and was not entered into for immigration purposes.id.c a.but upatcha could not file that joint petition in because on october,approximately three months after entering the country she initiated divorce proceedings against gonzalez.that divorce,which became final in february,ended upatcha conditional residency and potentially subjected her to removal.
so instead of a joint petition,upatcha filed for a hardship waiver,which allows the secretary of homeland security,at his discretion,to remove the conditional basis of permanent residence status for a noncitizen whose marriage has ended if the noncitizen demonstrates that the marriage was entered into in good faith.see c.the department of homeland security dhs denied upatcha petition,citing discrepancies between the couple divorce decree and the evidence provided by upatcha.as a result,dhs terminated upatcha conditional permanent resident status and charged her with deportability.
upatcha appeared for removal proceedings before an ij,where she conceded the charge of deportability and renewed her petition for a good faith marriage waiver under c b.after conducting an evidentiary hearing during which upatcha,gonzalez,and other witnesses testified,the ij denied upatcha petition.
as the ij recognized,the critical inquiry in determining whether the good faith standard has been met is whether the parties intended to establish a life together at the inception of the marriage.citing laureano,see chhay holder,app x,cir.unpublished same.and in applying that standard,a judge shall consider evidence relating to the amount of commitment by both parties to the marital relationship,including documentation concerning the intermingling of finances,the length of time of cohabitation,and birth certificates of any children.e.considering upatcha testimony,the testimony of other witnesses,and the documentary evidence submitted,the ij concluded that upatcha had failed to meet her burden of establishing a good faith marriage under c b.
the ij began by finding that upatcha testimony was not credible.that credibility determination rested primarily on what the ij deemed to be material inconsistencies between upatcha account of her marriage and information from other sources,including gonzalez testimony.the ij then went on to analyze other relevant evidence,including the brevity of the couple courtship,the fact that the couple married without any family members present,the duration of the couple marriage,and the absence of documentary records showing a joint bank account or other jointly held property.based on the totality of the evidence,the ij held,upatcha could not show that she had entered into her marriage in good faith,and therefore should be removed.
in a decision,the bia dismissed upatcha appeal.after describing the governing statutory framework,the board identified the applicable standard of review whether a marriage was entered into in good faith is a factual question,and therefore the immigration judge decision denying a section c b waiver on the merits is reviewed by this board for clear error.citing d i.as to the ij credibility finding,entitled to a high degree of deference,the bia found no clear error.the board separately reviewed the ij assessment of numerous other factors,including uncontested facts and a relative lack of documentary evidence,and on the record as a whole,found no clear error in the ij determination that upatcha had not satisfied the good faith standard under c b.
upatcha timely petitioned this court for review.
upatcha argues that the board applied the wrong standard of review to the ij ultimate conclusion that her evidence did not meet the good faith standard.that is a question of law over which we have jurisdiction under a d,and which we review de novo.turkson holder,cir.and for the reasons given below,we agree with upatcha while the bia properly reviewed the ij credibility determination for clear error,it should have reviewed de novo the ij ultimate legal judgment that the undisputed facts and credited evidence did not meet the good faith standard of c b.
board review of ij decisions is governed by regulation.prior to,those regulations provided for de novo review of all aspects of ij decisions.see in re.in,however,new regulations established a bifurcated standard of review.under the amended regulations which continue in force today bia review of findings of fact and credibility determinations is limited such ij findings may be reversed for clear error only.d i facts determined by the immigration judge,including findings as to the credibility of testimony,shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.but the board continues to review de novo all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges,including questions of law,discretion and judgment.id.d ii.
in commentary accompanying the amendments,the department of justice emphasized that the new clearly erroneous standard of review would apply only to the specific findings of fact of immigration judges.board of immigration appeals procedural reforms to improve case management,fed.reg,to be codified at pt.on a mixed question of law and fact,on the other hand,while defer ring to the factual findings of the immigration judge unless clearly erroneous,board members would retain their independent judgment and discretion regarding the review of pure questions of law and the application of the standard of law to those facts.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
in turkson,we applied that bifurcated standard of review to an ij holding that a noncitizen likely would face torture in his native country,making him eligible for deferral of removal under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,or cat.at.that holding,we concluded,involved both purely factual determinations and also a legal judgment.id.at.determination of what would likely happen if the alien was removed,we explained,was factual in nature,and thus subject to clearly erroneous review by the board under d i.id.but application of the cat standard for torture to those facts entailed a legal judgment,which the bia was to review de novo under d ii.id.in other words,while the board largely defers to the ij findings of historical facts and the likelihood of a future occurrence,the legal significance of those facts and the ultimate conclusions to wh
