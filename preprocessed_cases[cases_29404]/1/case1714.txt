this appeal raises issues relative to a defendant right to recover attorney fees against the government under the equal access to justice act eaja.intervest corporation intervest manages several properties that receive subsidies from the federal department of housing and urban development hud.on january,hud debarred both intervest and stephen nail,intervest sole shareholder and president.intervest and nail challenged this decision and prevailed after the district court determined that hud debarment decision was arbitrary and capricious.in the case now before the court,intervest seeks an award of attorney fees and costs under the eaja for its successful defense in the debarment case.
this appeal presents two potential questions.the district court dismissed the complaint and denied attorney fees to intervest in this case on the basis that intervest was not the real party in interest.the question thus presented is whether the district court erred in adopting the real party in interest test under the eaja.if we conclude that this was error,and reverse the district court judgment that held for hud,hud presents the second question whether the district court erred in concluding that hud litigating position in that earlier proceeding was not substantially justified because,ipso facto,hud debarment of nail and intervest was arbitrary and capricious.
indeed,we do reverse the district court adoption of the real party in interest test because that test is not consistent with the plain language of the eaja.thus,we are required to decide the second question and we conclude that a finding that hud underlying action was arbitrary and capricious does not,in itself,mean that hud acted without substantial justification.in sum,we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for the district court further consideration of intervest claim for attorney fees.
we begin with some background,including reference to the cases that preceded and underlie the one before us today.intervest is a property management company that manages over sixty properties,several of which are subsidized through hud farmer home administration.intervest is a corporation,meaning that all of the corporation income is passed on to its shareholders for tax purposes.stephen nail is the owner,president,and chief executive officer of intervest.intervest monthly submitted housing assistance payment hap vouchers,which contained a certificate indicating that each unit for which a hud subsidy was requested was in decent,safe,and sanitary condition.
in,the united states sued nail and intervest under the false claims act,alleging that nail and intervest violated their contractual obligations by submitting false claims with regard to these subsidized units.the district court dismissed the case on summary judgment after finding that hud paid the claims fully aware of the condition of the subsidized units at metro manor,and after concluding that the allegedly false certification was not substantively material to the government decision to pay the hap.united states intervest,d.hud took no appeal.
next,on january,hud debarring official debarred nail and intervest for failing to maintain two mississippi properties in decent,safe,and sanitary condition.in reaching the decision on debarment,the debarment official contended that nail and intervest were required to maintain the properties with private funds,if necessary.nail and intervest were to be debarred for a term of three years.
nail and intervest reacted promptly.on march,they filed a lawsuit in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment that they were illegally debarred by hud and seeking an injunction to restore them to good standing with hud.on december,the court granted the summary judgment motion of nail and intervest because it found that there was no requirement that property owners invest private money to maintain properties in compliance with hud regulations.the court determined that hud debarment decision was arbitrary and capricious.hud took no appeal.
this district court ruling prompted the case before us today.on february,intervest filed an application for recovery of fees and costs under the eaja.nail did not join this action because his net worth made him ineligible for an award under the eaja in ruling on intervest application,the district court noted that under the eaja,a lack of substantial justification for the government action creates a presumption that intervest,as the prevailing party,is entitled to attorney fees.in this connection,the district court held that because the court had earlier deemed hud debarment of nail and intervest to be arbitrary and capricious,it must find that the government position was not substantially justified.emphasis added.
the district court,however,then turned to apply the real party in interest test and found that because intervest was nail alter ego,nail was the real party in interest.therefore,because nail was ineligible for an eaja award,the court held that intervest was not entitled to fees and costs under the eaja.intervest appeals this ruling,and hud challenges the district court holding that its position in the underlying litigation was not substantially justified.
thus,we first note that neither party to this appeal is completely satisfied with the district court decision although the district court ultimately dismissed the case,its decision ruled both for and against,respectively,each party on the issues that are now the subject of this appeal.we will first decide the point on which the district court based its dismissal of the complaint in favor of hud,namely that intervest was not entitled to attorney fees because it was not the real party in interest.intervest argues that the district court failed to adhere to the eaja plain wording by requiring intervest to prove that it was a real party in interest.such a requirement,intervest asserts,is inconsistent with both the plain language of the eaja and this court jurisprudence on this issue.
in this respect,hud basic argument is that the real party in interest test is consistent with congress intent in passing the eaja that is,congress intended to subsidize litigation initiated by small businesses and not to award fees to ineligible parties who actually finance and control the litigation.hud also argues that the real party in interest test is not inconsistent with our jurisprudence.
because we conclude that the district court erred in adopting the real party in interest test,and accordingly reverse and remand,we must proceed to the second issue.hud argues that the mere fact that the district court found hud action to be arbitrary and capricious does not mean,ipso facto,that hud litigation position was not substantially justified.hud further argues that precedent requires a more thorough analysis.on the other hand,intervest asks us to affirm the district court ruling on the substantial justification question because the findings of fact underlying that ruling support a conclusion that the decision to debar intervest and nail was in fact not substantially justified.we hold that the district court also erred on the substantial justification question and direct the court to reconsider on remand.
we first address whether the district court erred in adopting the real party in interest test to determine whether intervest was entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs under the eaja.whether the district court erred in adopting the real party in interest doctrine is a question of law subject to de novo review.texas food indus.ass united states dep t of,cir.
a party eligible to receive attorney fees and costs under the eaja is i an individual whose net worth did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed,or ii any owner of an unincorporated business,or any partnership,corporation,association,unit of local government,or organization,the net worth of which did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed,and which had not more than employees at the time the civil action was filed.d b.intervest falls within the eaja definition of party.it is a corporation whose net worth did not exceed and it employed fewer than people at the time the c
