in congress significantly amended the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,et.the amendments,stat,reinforced the principle that children should not be removed unnecessarily from regular education environments,a a,in part by eliminating inappropriate financial incentives for referring children to special education,at,reprinted in.one specific purpose of the amendments was to control government expenditures for students voluntarily placed in private schools by their parents.see id.at.
at issue in this case is whether the parents of katie are entitled to reimbursement from the greenland,new hampshire school district for katie tuition at a private school,the learning skills academy,for part of the fifth grade and all of the sixth grade.katie parents sought tuition reimbursement after having unilaterally removed katie from greenland central school at the end of fourth grade and placed her in private school,without ever before raising with greenland school officials the issue of special education services for katie.the district court,reversing the due process hearing officer,held that katie and her parents were not entitled to such reimbursement.we affirm.
katie,born in march,started first grade at the greenland central school,a public school,in.although katie was a good student,her first grade teacher noticed that she had difficulty focusing on classroom activities and was easily distracted.during the summer after first grade,katie parents,and,took katie to a private psychologist who diagnosed her with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.the psychiatrist suggested several practical steps that katie teachers could take to counteract her adhd,including providing her with a checklist of tasks to complete and seating her in the front of the classroom.
katie second,third,and fourth grade teachers each used techniques similar to those recommended by katie psychiatrist to help katie stay on task.they sat katie in the front of the classroom,provided her with a checklist of items she was to complete,and maintained frequent contact with about katie performance.some of her teachers also employed basic behavior modification techniques to help improve katie concentration,such as providing incentives for katie with stickers.katie teachers frequently used these and similar methods to help other students focus too.
who is herself a special education teacher at a nearby high school,also spent a considerable amount of time helping her daughter with her schoolwork.she spent hours a night helping katie with her homework in second grade and provided hours of assistance each night in the third grade.by the time katie was in fourth grade,her parents had hired a tutor to meet with her twice a week.
katie academic performance during her four years at greenland ranged from average to.in second grade,katie was grouped with students who had good reading skills,although she had some difficulties with math.her second grade teacher viewed katie as a competent learner and katie received a passing grade in all of her subjects katie continued to perform reasonably well in third and fourth grades,earning mostly a and b on her report card.katie third grade teacher viewed her as very bright and a good learner and her fourth grade teacher said her academic performance was between an eight and a nine on a scale.
katie academic marks were consistent with her scores on the california achievement test,a national standardized test that katie took in the second and fourth grades.on both administrations of the test,katie scored in the average to range on all of the tested subjects.she also received an average score on all subparts of the new hampshire end of grade assessment,another standardized test.
throughout her time at greenland,though,katie still occasionally had difficulty maintaining her concentration on discrete tasks.she also had problems making friends and was sometimes teased by her classmates.in katie fourth grade year,became sufficiently concerned about peer harassment that she contacted katie teacher.
at no point during katie time at greenland did her parents or any of her teachers request that she be evaluated for special education services.katie second grade teacher noted that katie did not meet the general profile of a special education student because there was not a gap between her apparent learning ability and her academic performance.similarly,her third grade teacher said that katie difficulties with paying attention were concerns for her physician and that she did not believe that katie required special education services.
in august of,the summer that katie completed fourth grade,katie parents unilaterally removed her from the greenland central school and enrolled her in mont blanc academy.mont blanc academy is a private school that does not focus on special education students and,when katie parents enrolled her there,they were looking for special education.when katie started fifth grade at mont blanc,the school instructed not to help katie with her homework.as a result,katie struggled with some of her classes and failed her first quarter math class,although she passed her other classes.in november,after learned of katie failing math grade,she resumed helping katie with her homework and katie math grade rose to a 
for reasons unspecified in the record,mont blanc academy requested in february of that katie parents withdraw her from the school.one month later,in march of,katie parents enrolled her at the learning skills academy lsa for the remainder of her fifth grade year.lsa is a private school that has only about thirty enrolled students,most of whom either suffer from a learning disability or adhd.tuition for katie spring term at lsa was.
at approximately the same time that katie started at lsa,contacted melanie lovering,the special education coordinator for greenland central school,and requested that katie be evaluated by the psychologist on call with the school,secor.this was the first time that katie parents had notified greenland that katie might need special education services,being a special education teacher and administrator herself,was familiar with the processes associated with identifying children who require special education.katie parents told greenland that their major concerns with katie development were focused on written language,organization and hyperactivity.the school responded by scheduling a disposition of referral meeting to take place about two weeks later,on april.
at the april meeting,three greenland special education teachers,two representatives from lsa,an occupational therapist,secor,lovering,and all met to discuss katie eligibility for special education services at greenland.the group agreed that they did not at that point have sufficient information to determine whether katie should be coded as learning disabled.accordingly,they planned a battery of tests and evaluations that greenland school officials would conduct over the next several weeks to gather more information on katie strengths and weaknesses.these included multiple standardized tests in math and written expression and,at request,various psychological assessments by secor.
on may,the school district held a meeting with to assess the results of katie tests and evaluations and determine whether katie was eligible for special education services at greenland.the school officials in attendance,including secor,lovering,and four others,unanimously determined that even though katie had adhd and an anxiety disorder,those conditions did not adversely affect her educational performance.they also unanimously concluded that katie did not have a learning disability because there was no evidence of a discrepancy between katie ability and her achievement.the officials nonetheless agreed to offer katie a plan to address some of her organizational weaknesses.
in a letter dated may,katie parents informed michelle langa,the assistant superintendent of the greenland school district,that they disagreed with the district decision finding katie ineligible for special education services.the letter informed the district that and had scheduled an appointment with an independent psychiatrist named spitzer,but it did not request any specific further action on the part of greenland.again,at the time katie parents sent this letter in may,katie was already in private school,having been withdrawn from public school in august.
spitzer evaluated katie in may and sent a letter to michelle langa on august,detailing her conclusions.spitzer confirmed katie diagnosis of adhd,but she also concluded that katie suffers from asperger disorder.asperger disorder is a developmental disability on the autism spectrum that is associated with significant misperceptions of otherwise routine elements of daily life.it is a permanent condition that is not treatable with medication.
meanwhile,katie parents decided to katie in lsa for sixth grade,the school year.katie had done well at lsa during the spring semester of her fifth grade year,making significant strides in her academic and emotional development.she no longer relied on her mother to assist her with her homework,developed positive peer relationships,and was a much more confident,happier child.
on september,as katie was starting sixth grade at lsa,greenland school officials met with spitzer to review her conclusion that katie suffered from asperger disorder.although secor,who also attended the meeting,disputed this diagnosis,the team decided to reverse its earlier determination that katie did not qualify for special education services.rather than code katie as autistic,consistent with the diagnosis of asperger disorder,the team agreed to code her as other health impaired.
over the next several months,school officials met several times with and her advocate to develop an individual education plan iep that would provide katie with appropriate special educational services at greenland.throughout this process,katie remained a student at lsa.by,the team of school officials,in conjunction with and her advocate,had developed a working draft of katie initial iep.the draft provided for katie to in greenland public school and have a personal aide who would assist her with social pragmatic skills across a variety of settings and partners and help develop her graphing and discourse skills.
on november,as the final details of katie iep were being worked out,katie parents filed a due process hearing request.the letter requesting the hearing indicated that katie parents appreciated the school efforts in drafting an iep for katie,and explained that they were seeking reimbursement for katie tuition at lsa and were concerned that the time for filing a hearing request would soon expire.although surprised and confused by the due process hearing request,school officials completed the final version of katie iep several weeks later.in addition to providing katie with services at greenland,including her own aide,the plan set forth a curriculum to help katie learn the difference between friendly joking and hurtful teasing,a problem with which children suffering from asperger disorder have particular difficulty.it also included counseling services for katie and services that spitzer had recommended.even after greenland completed the iep,katie remained enrolled at lsa instead of returning to greenland and receiving the services outlined in the iep.
administrative proceedings 
in response to and due process hearing request,the hearing officer held a prehearing conference on january.at that conference,the parents said that,in addition to seeking reimbursement,they were challenging the school district failure to identify katie as eligible for special education services in may of when she was a student at lsa.the parents also indicated that they were dissatisfied with the plan that greenland had developed in the fall of to educate katie at greenland because,despite its reliance on an aide to assist katie,no such aide had been hired.
the hearing officer heard testimony from sixteen witnesses over three days and issued a decision on february.the decision rejected greenland argument that it was not obliged to develop an iep for katie because she was unilaterally placed in a private school by her parents it concluded that greenland had to offer katie an iep pursuant to its child find obligations.the decision also found that greenland had erred when in may it failed to find katie eligible for special education services.reasoning that katie was in effect receiving specialized education throughout her time at greenland,the hearing officer concluded that the team reliance on the lack of an apparent gap between katie ability and her performance was legally deficient.
the hearing officer also concluded that katie would be by returning to greenland.he found that greenland did not have any aide or staff with whom it could place katie if she were to return to the school and that,even if an aide existed,greenland proposed iep would not provide katie with a free appropriate public education fape.based on these conclusions,the hearing officer ordered greenland to reimburse and for katie tuition at lsa for both the second semester of her fifth grade year and the entirety of her sixth grade year.this amounted to.
district court decision 
pursuant to i,the school district challenged in district court the hearing officer decision.the district court reversed the bulk of the hearing officer holdings,concluding that the hearing officer had incorrectly considered the adequacy of the iep offered by greenland and the availability of tuition reimbursement.the district court found that katie was enrolled in private school mont blanc academy before her parents ever raised the question of special education and that fape was not at issue when katie was removed from greenland.on this basis,the district court concluded that the hearing officer had only the statutory authority to consider whether greenland had violated its child find obligation.
the court affirmed the portion of the hearing officer opinion that concluded the school district erred in failing to code katie as a child with a disability in may.construing that portion of the opinion as stemming from the school district child find obligation,the court determined that the hearing officer had the authority to consider the issue.after reviewing the hearing officer decision on the merits,the court affirmed.because the district court denied reimbursement on other grounds,this ruling did not affect the plaintiffs claim for relief.
katie parents appeal the portion of the district court opinion reversing the hearing officer determinations.greenland school district,arguing that the district court incorrectly affirmed the hearing officer determination that katie should have been coded as a child with a disability in may.
our review is de novo,as this case only presents questions of law.manchester sch.dist.crisman,cir.
new hampshire implements idea through its special education law.ann.the state has adopted by reference the federal regulations as to special education for disabled students in private schools.admin.rules,ed.thus,katie rights under new hampshire law are the same as her rights under federal law and no greater.see gary manchester sch,d.
this case turns on the idea amendments.those amendments affect this case in three ways.first,the amendments make clear that while local school systems have child find obligations as to students with disabilities in private schools,they do not have to provide such students with the full complement of services that a student in public school with special needs would receive.see a a a no private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school.second,they establish that complaints about the services a disabled student in private school is receiving after he or she has been identified must be brought through the state administrative complaint system rather than a due process hearing.a,c.finally and most importantly,the amendments limit the circumstances in which parents who have unilaterally placed their child in a private school are entitled to reimbursement for that placement.see a c.
obligation to provide services to disabled private school children and the proper forum for such claims.
the district court vacated the hearing officer evaluation of the iep that greenland offered to katie because it concluded that this issue was not properly before the hearing officer.that ruling was correct.
because katie was enrolled at lsa,a private school,when she filed her due process hearing request,her rights under idea are governed by a.that subsection divides children in private school into two categories children enrolled in private schools by their parents,and children placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies.see id.a a,b.it is undisputed that katie falls in the former category,as she was not placed in or referred to mont blanc or lsa by a public agency.
participating school districts such as greenland owe children who fall within subsection a of a a child find obligation.see a a ii.this obligation requires those districts to locate,identify and evaluate all private school children with disabilities using methods that are comparable to activities undertaken for children with disabilities in public school.b.in the event that a district fails to meet its child find obligations,a child parents can initiate a due process hearing under the procedures outlined in.see id.
importantly,idea also provides that participating districts must provide certain services to disabled children in private school once those children have been identified through the child find process.see id.these services are,not surprisingly,less extensive than the services that a disabled child enrolled in public school is entitled to receive.not only are the services provided to students in these two settings different in scope,but the procedure for review of claims of a denial of services is also different.parents of disabled children voluntarily enrolled in private school can not initiate a due process hearing if they feel their child is not receiving the services required by idea.see id.a.rather,such parents must proceed through an alternative procedure within the state administrative apparatus.see id.c.as the comments to the draft of the regulations explain 
while there may be legitimate issues regarding the provision of services to a particular private school child with disabilities that a local education agency has agreed to serve,due process should not apply,as there is no individual right to these services under the idea.disputes that arise about these services are properly subject to the state complaint procedures.
as the district court recognized,any complaints that katie parents had regarding katie iep in the fall of should have been brought through the state complaint process.the adequacy of the iep was not an appropriate subject for the due process hearing because it had nothing to do with greenland child find obligation.once greenland identified katie as a child with a disability in september,the district had performed every act reviewable by a hearing officer any subsequent obligations it had to provide educational services to katie were matters for the state administrative procedure,which would apply different standards to evaluate the services provided than did the due process hearing officer.see c question in state administrative procedure is whether the district met its obligations under.that decision,moreover,would not be appealable to federal court.see vultaggio bd.of,cir.
tuition reimbursement for students unilaterally placed in private schools 
the substantive question in this case is whether katie parents were eligible for tuition reimbursement and,if so,whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny reimbursement for either katie fifth or sixth grade school year we affirm the district court determination on the ground that katie parents were ineligible for reimbursement.
until,there was some uncertainty about whether the remedy of reimbursement for private school tuition was available when a school district had failed to provide appropriate services to a disabled child in the public school.idea itself only authorized the district court to grant such relief as it determine d is appropriate.e,recodified as amended i b.in burlington dep t of,d,the supreme court held that this clause authorized the equitable remedy of tuition reimbursement.see id.at.it noted that the broad language of the statute vested courts with significant discretion to craft appropriate remedies and that,in cases where it would take a significant amount of time for the school to offer appropriate services,the act promise of a free appropriate public education could justify the remedy of reimbursement for private school tuition.id.at.the court also found that tuition reimbursement was available even in some instances when parents had unilaterally removed their child from public school.id.at.
uncertainty about the circumstances under which tuition reimbursement was available remained even after burlington.before the idea amendments,several circuits had held that reimbursement for private school tuition depended on the parents cooperating with school authorities in determining the proper placement and educational plan for the child.see patricia bd.of,cir listing cases interpreting idea.as one court noted,parents who,because of their failure to cooperate,do not allow a school district a reasonable opportunity to evaluate their disabled child,forfeit their claim for reimbursement for a unilateral private placement.id.at.although few courts precisely defined the level of cooperation necessary,most thought it clear that,at a minimum,the parents had to inform the school district of their concerns about their child special needs and about the plan proposed before removing the child from public school.see berger medina city sch,cir even before the idea was amended to explicitly require such notice,this court held that dissatisfied parents were required to complain to the public school to afford the school a chance to remedy the iep before removing their disabled child from the school.ex rel.voluntown bd.of,cir c ourts have held uniformly that reimbursement is barred where parents unilaterally arrange for private educational services without ever notifying the school board of their dissatisfaction with their child iep.ash lake oswego sch,cir evans district,cir.
the amendments endorsed this line of cases and helped clarify the amount of parental cooperation required by adding a section to idea entitled payment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency.a c see,at,reprinted in.see generally gary,d at.that section begins with a general statement of policy explaining that idea does not require a local education agency to pay for the cost of education,including special education and related services,of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.a c i.this provision,taken by itself,might be considered ambiguous as applied to a situation where,as here,the local education agency was never informed while the child was in public school that the child might require special education services.but this seeming ambiguity disappears when considered in light of the section affirmative requirement that the parents of a child with a disability,who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency can receive reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the child in private school only if a court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.id.a c ii.
these threshold requirements are key to this case tuition reimbursement is only available for children who have previously received special education and related services while in the public school system or perhaps those who at least timely requested such services while the child is in public school.there is no dispute that neither katie parents
