tunbosun olawale william petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia holding that it could not consider his motion to reopen immigration proceedings which was filed after he had been removed from the united states.in reaching this conclusion,the bia relied on d.because we conclude that this regulation conflicts with clear statutory language and is therefore invalid,we grant the petition for review,vacate the order of the bia,and remand for further proceedings.
since,aliens involved in immigration proceedings have been able to file motions to reopen those proceedings before the bia.initially,motions to reopen were creatures solely of regulation.ashcroft,cir until,t here was no statutory provision for reopening of a deportation proceeding,and the authority for such motions derive d solely from regulations promulgated by the attorney general.internal punctuation omitted alteration in original.as part of this regulatory scheme,predecessor to d provided 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.any departure from the united states of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings occurring after the making of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
this regulation largely paralleled a statutory provision,c,which barred the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over immigration orders when the alien had departed the country.
in,congress made major changes to immigration law through the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.among other things,iirira repealed the statutory bar to judicial review of deportation orders when the alien had departed the country and codified and enacted procedures governing the filing of motions to reopen.specifically,in codifying motions to reopen,congress provided an alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section c a originally designated c a.congress then proceeded to detail the required content of a motion to reopen,the deadline for filing the motion,and exceptions from both the numerical limit of one motion and the time period for filing the motion.c a c.
after congress codification of the motion to reopen in iirira,the attorney general repromulgated,in essentially the same form,the regulation imposing the bar to bia review of motions to reopen when an alien has departed the country 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
later redesignated d see.the validity of this regulation and its application to william are at issue in this case.
william is a native and citizen of nigeria who became a permanent legal resident of the united states in.in june,william pled guilty to receipt of a stolen credit card in violation of maryland law.william was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment,with nine months suspended,and three years probation.
on november,the immigration and naturalization service ins charged william with being removable as an aggravated felon for committing an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeds.see a m,a a iii.subsequently,the ins also charged william with being removable as having committed a crime of moral turpitude.see a a i.during subsequent proceedings,an immigration judge found william removable as having been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and found him ineligible for relief.the bia affirmed this decision,and william did not seek further review in this court.william then filed with the bia a motion to reconsider,arguing that he had received limited relief in the form of a reduction of sentence.the bia denied this motion and,again,william did not pursue further review.
on july,william was removed from the united states.shortly thereafter,william filed a petition for a writ of coram nobis in state court seeking to vacate his maryland conviction.the state court granted the writ and vacated william conviction in october.on december,william filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings before the bia in which he asserted that the exceptional circumstances of his case warranted reconsideration of his removal.the bia refused to consider william motion to effectively denying it on procedural that william had already been removed from the united states and,in those circumstances,d bars the filing of a motion to reopen.this petition for review followed.
william argues that d,containing the bar on motions to reopen,is invalid because it conflicts with clear statutory language.where the validity of an agency regulation is called into question,we employ the familiar analysis prescribed by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.accordingly,we first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if congress has so spoken,our inquiry is at an end,for we,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if congress has not addressed the precise question at issue,we must determine whether the agency interpretation of the statute in question,as embodied in its regulation,is reasonable and therefore entitled to deference.id.
the statutory provision in question is c a,which provides that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section william contends that this statute does not differentiate between an alien who is in the united states and one who is abroad and that it permits either to file one motion to reopen proceedings.on the other hand,the government maintains that c a is silent with respect to motions to reopen in that it does not specifically address them.the government therefore reads the statute as leaving a gap which it may fill with a regulation restricting the availability of motions to reopen to those aliens who remain in the united states 
we find that c a unambiguously provides an alien with the right to file one motion to reopen,regardless of whether he is within or without the country.this is so because,in providing that an alien may file,the statute does not distinguish between those aliens abroad and those within the fall within the class denominated by the words an alien.because the statute sweeps broadly in this reference to an alien,it need be no more specific to encompass within its terms those aliens who are abroad.thus,the government view that congress was silent as to the ability of aliens outside the united states to file motions to reopen is foreclosed by the text of the statute the statutory language does speak to the filing of motions to reopen by aliens outside the country it does so because they are a subset of the group alien s which it vests with the right to file these motions.accordingly,the government view of c a simply does not comport with its text and can not be accommodated absent a rewriting of its terms 
the overall structure of reenforces our reading of c a in two ways.first,the fact that congress provided for specific limitations on the right to file a motion to reopen bolsters the conclusion that c a can not be read to except from its terms those aliens who have departed the country.see united states johnson,d when congress provides exceptions in a statute,it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.the proper inference is that congress considered the issue of exceptions and,in the end,limited the statute to the ones set forth.second,and more importantly,in detailing the time limit for a motion to reopen,congress provided that the usual limit does not apply where an alien who is applying for relief from removal as a victim of domestic violence is physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.c c iv iv emphasis added.of course,congress did not include this requirement of physical presence in c a,which deals with motions to reopen in general and which is applicable here.this being the case,we must draw a negative inference from congress exclusion of the physical presence requirement from the statutory section under consideration,hamdan rumsfeld,d,because where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,clay united states,d.moreover,we can go beyond simply drawing an inference regarding congress intent in this case,for a finding that physical presence in the united states is required before any motion to reopen may be filed would render the physical presence requirement expressly written into subsection c c iv iv mere surplusage.see,trw,andrews,d it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal punctuation omitted.in sum,congress knew how to include a requirement of physical presence when it wished to do so,as it did in c c iv iv.that it did not do so in the general provisions of c a leads us to conclude that congress did not make presence in the united states a prerequisite to filing a motion to reopen.
for these reasons,c a clearly and unambiguously grants an alien the right to file one motion to reopen,regardless of whether he is present in the united states when the motion is filed.therefore,our inquiry into congress intent is at an end,for i f the language is plain and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,we need not inquire further.in re coleman,cir internal citation omitted.our sole function is to enforce the statute according to its terms.id.alteration in original 
having set forth the clear meaning of c a,we believe it is evident that d,containing the bar on motions to reopen,conflicts with the statute by restricting the availability of motions to reopen to those aliens who remain in the united states.therefore,we conclude that this regulation lacks authority and is invalid.allen united states,cir w e must overturn a regulation that clearly conflicts with the plain text of the statute.on remand,the bia can not rely on d in refusing to consider william motion to reopen 
based on the foregoing,we grant the petition for review,vacate the order of the bia,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
petition for review granted order vacated 
congress has decreed that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.c a west supp.insofar as this provision sets a numerical limit on motions to reopen,its meaning is too plain to be misunderstood.according to the majority,however,this provision does much more than set a numerical limitation on motions to reopen.it also clearly evidences congress intent to repeal d,the regulation barring aliens subject to removal proceedings from filing a motion to reopen after departing from the united states.
although i appreciate the majority reading of the statute,i am not convinced that we should halt our inquiry at step one of the analysis set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.congress codification of a numerical limitation on motions to reopen does not speak precisely,or even generally,to the question of whether the attorney general departure bar on motions to reopen is a valid exercise of his rulemaking authority under the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.given that a nearly identical provision limiting aliens to one motion to reopen existed before enactment of the iirira,and in the same regulation containing the departure bar now located in d,see c,i can not join the majority conclusion that c a by itself repeals the departure bar in d.unlike my colleagues,i do not see how we can get a clear sense of congressional intent,dynamics land,cline,d,to repeal the departure bar simply because the numerical limitation on motions to reopen now occupies a place in the united states code where previously it only existed in the federal register.one would have expected that much more than an unremarkable numerical limitation would be needed to clearly demonstrate congress intent to strike down a regulation that has been in place for over forty years.
thus,i am unable to join in the majority chevron analysis and therefore undertake my own inquiry under chevron familiar framework.this inquiry leads me to conclude that,although a close question,d remains a valid exercise of the attorney general rulemaking authority under the ina.
today our court becomes the first court to invalidate d.the regulation provides the following 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
when the validity of an agency regulation is at issue,we of course apply chevron.we must first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,id.at,in which case the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,id.at.as part of this inquiry,we may employ traditional tools of statutory construction to ascertain that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,d quoting chevron,at.even for an agency able to claim all the authority possible under chevron,deference to its statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.dynamics land,at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.and where congress has not merely failed to address a precise question but has also made an explicit delegation of rulemaking authority to the agency,the agency regulation is given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.household credit,pfennig,d quoting chevron,at.alteration in original.congress has made such a delegation to the attorney general with respect to the ina.see g west providing that t he attorney general shall establish such regulations,delegate such authority,and perform such other acts as the attorney general determines to be necessary for carrying out the ina.
according to the majority,we need not venture past chevron first step in this case because c a statement that a n alien may file one motion to reopen precisely addresses the question of whether an alien may file his one motion to reopen after departing the united states.this is so,according to my good colleagues,because,in providing that an alien may file,the statute does not distinguish between those aliens abroad and those within the fall within the class denominated by the words an alien.ante at.
as an initial matter,it is clear that c a does not explicitly prohibit or permit motions to reopen made after departure.the provision simply does not speak to that question.and it is hardly surprising that the provision does not distinguish between classes of aliens,for the provision purpose is to limit the number of motions to reopen that an alien may file.although the majority shifts the focus to congress use of the words an alien,i believe the proper point of emphasis in the statute is on the number one,for as demonstrated later,c a reflects congress longstanding concern with limiting the number of motions to reopen an alien may file.see gonzales,cir noting that iirira enacted strict time limits for the filing of motions to reopen and limited aliens to a single filing.
but there are other problems with focusing in on the words an alien in the chevron analysis,not the least of which is that a regulation with nearly identical language that limited aliens to one motion to reopen existed before enactment of the iirira,the attorney general had already ruled that an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings whether before the board or the immigration judge.c.this numerical limitation,which was described as such in the regulation,see c providing limited exceptions to the time and numerical limitations set forth in c,existed alongside the departure bar in d.the majority conclusion that congress intent to repeal d is clearly evidenced by congress enactment of c a alone does not sufficiently account for the realities of the regulatory framework and imputes more meaning to the codified numerical limitation than the words of the statute can bear.
the remainder of c confirms this conclusion.section a c goes on to provide that,with certain exceptions,an alien must file his one motion to reopen within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.c c i.the statutory context of c makes clear that it is just a numerical more,nothing less.see united states morton,d we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.in short,c a in isolation says nothing about the departure bar in d or about whether the statute as a whole should be construed as repealing the departure bar.
it stands to reason that if congress intended to repeal the departure bar,it would have done so by doing more than merely repeating the numerical limitation already contained in the regulations,a limitation that was designed to operate alongside the departure bar to promote finality in deportation proceedings.indeed,at oral argument,william counsel did not go so far as to argue that c a alone rendered d invalid he argued instead that congress intent to repeal the regulation is clear when c a is considered in conjunction with other of the iirira amendments.it is this broader argument that i believe should be the focus of our attention.
although not discussed by william or the american immigration law foundation ailf as amicus curiae in this case,the majority finds additional support for its reading of c a in c c iv iv west supp,which provides that the usual filing period does not apply where an alien who is applying for relief from removal as a victim of domestic violence is physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.c c iv iv.this provision provides little support for the majority chevron conclusion in this case.
first,the exception is not relevant to the question of whether the iirira repealed the regulatory departure bar,for congress did not add the exception to until nearly a decade after enactment of the iirira.the exception was first enacted as part of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of,stat,an act aimed at combating the sex slave trade and preventing violence against women.see id.the original version of the exception did not include current c c iv iv,the physical presence requirement that the majority focuses on here.that provision was added later as part of the violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of,stat.see id.thus,the iirira amendments to the ina relating to motions to as part of a comprehensive reform to the immigration the exception in c c iv iv enacted as part of congressional efforts to snuff out sex slave trade and domestic connected neither in time nor purpose.
second,c c iv iv requirement is not coextensive with the regulatory departure bar.whereas c c iv iv only requires that the alien be physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion,c c iv iv,the regulation provides that any departure from the united states constitutes a withdrawal of a motion to reopen that was filed while the alien was present in the united states,d.the majority understands the exception as proving,by negative implication,that congress does not intend for the regulatory departure bar to apply generally to motions to reopen,but it is equally plausible to understand the exception as carving out a limited exception to the general working of the departure bar.this is because one can reasonably understand c c iv iv to mean that as long as the qualifying alien files a motion to reopen before departing the country,the alien subsequent departure from the united states has no effect on the bia ability to hear the motion,which is a decidedly different result than would obtain under the departure bar.given that the regulatory departure bar and the requirement in the exception are not one in the same,i question the majority conclusion that the regulation renders the statutory language mere surplusage.ante at.
having explained my disagreement with the majority chevron analysis,i now address william broader challenge to the regulation,an argument that draws on other of the iirira amendments.
chevron step one.
william contends that congress has precisely spoken through the iirira to the issue of d validity by making a number of amendments to the ina that undercut any previously existing statutory basis for the regulation.first,congress codified the motion to reopen as a statutory form of relief,specifying both numerical limitations,see c a,and time limits,see id.c c i,detailing the motion contents,see id.c b,and carving out exceptions to the time and numerical limitations,see id.c c ii iv.congress did not,however,codify the departure bar in d.second,congress repealed c,repealed by,div.c,title iii,b,stat,the provision that precluded judicial review of an order of deportation or exclusion after an alien departure from the united states.and third,congress restructured judicial review of final orders of removal under west without reenacting the departure bar to judicial review.according to william,these changes to the ina clearly evidence congressional intent to eliminate any jurisdictional bar to having a motion to reopen heard following departure,thereby rendering d invalid.petitioner br.at.because this argument depends so greatly on the changes wrought by the iirira to the ina,a brief review of the statutory and regulatory landscapes before and after the amendments is necessary.
in,congress amended the immigration statutes and,among other things,gave the circuit courts jurisdiction to review final orders of deportation through a petition for review.see an act to amend the immigration and nationality act,pub,a,stat,codified at c.this judicial review provision barred the circuit courts from reviewing an order of deportation or exclusion if the alien has departed from the united states after the issuance of the order.c.in the same year,the department of justice issued,the predecessor to d.see board of immigration appeals powers and reopening or reconsideration of cases,codified at.section provided the following 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or in behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.any departure from the united states of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings occurring after the making of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
id.as the majority and william note,at this time there was no statutory basis for the motion to reopen.it was entirely a creature of regulation.both the statutory departure bar to judicial review and the regulatory departure bar to bia review remained unchanged until.
in,however,congress,concerned that aliens were filing frivolous motions to reopen as part of dilatory tactics to delay removal or deportation,directed the attorney general to establish numerical and time limits on motions to reopen,where previously only the departure bar had existed.specifically,in the immigration act of the act,congress directed that the attorney general shall issue regulations with respect to the period of time in which motions to reopen and to reconsider may be offered in deportation proceedings,which regulations include a limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions.immigration act of,b,stat.with regard to the time limitation,congress strongly hint ed that a period would be appropriate.stone,d it is clear,then,that as of,congress primary concern was limiting,not expanding,the circumstances under which motions to reopen could be made.
on april,after a lengthy notice and comment period,the attorney general amended and established both numerical and time limits for motions to reopen and motions to reconsider.see executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings,codified at c.the amended regulation provided that a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings whether before the board or the immigration judge and that motion must be filed not later than days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.id.the attorney general retained the departure bar language from the earlier,but moved it to d.see id.d.the regulation also described the contents of the motion to reopen and set out very limited exceptions to the new time and numerical limitations.see id.c.the amended became effective on july.see.at.
on september,congress enacted the iirira.the iirira contained many provisions aimed at protecting the executive discretion from the,that can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation.reno,d.these provisions included a a,which limits judicial review of claims arising from the inspection of aliens arriving in the united states a b,which bars review of denials of discretionary relief authorized by various statutory provisions a c,which bars review of final orders against criminal aliens and b b,which repealed a,the provision entitling an alien to an automatic stay pending the completion of a judicial review of a removal order.the iirira also repealed c,which barred judicial review of deportation orders after an alien departed or was removed from the country.these and other provisions of the iirira streamlined the rules and procedures in the ina so that it would be easier to remove deportable aliens from the united states.
the iirira also,for the first time,codified the motion to reopen,establishing time and numerical limitations on such motions,describing their contents,and carving out limited exceptions to the time and numerical limitations.see c.these provisions virtually mimicked the provisions in,except the iirira did not codify the departure bar contained in d.the iirira became effective on april.see iirira a.
on march,the attorney general promulgated regulations implementing the iirira.see inspection and expedited removal of aliens detention and removal of aliens conduct of removal proceedings asylum procedures.march.although the iirira repealed the departure bar to judicial review,the attorney general retained the departure bar to bia review,only slightly modifying the provision to read as follows 
d departure,deportation,or removal.a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
id.at codified at d.the attorney general specifically addressed the continuing validity of the departure bar to bia review in the notice and comment process.in the commentary,the attorney general explained 
no provision of the new section of the ina supports reversing the long established rule that a motion to reopen or reconsider can not be made in immigration proceedings by or on behalf of a person after that person departure from the united states the department of justice believes that the burdens associated with the adjudication of motions to reopen and reconsider on behalf of deported or departed aliens would greatly outweigh any advantages this system might render.
id.at.in,the former d was redesignated as d.see aliens and nationality homeland security reorganization of regulations.
william argument is an argument by negative implication because congress repealed the departure bar to judicial review,codified the time,numerical,and content limitations on motions to reopen,and carved out limited exceptions to the time and numerical limitations,william contends that congress failure to codify the departure bar clearly shows that it intended that no such bar exist.this line of argument is a familiar one,having roots in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another.see andrus glover constr,d where congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,additional exceptions are not to be implied,in the absence of a contrary legislative intent.
but for this interpretive thrust,there is a parry.see generally karl llewellyn,remarks on the theory of appellate decision and the rules or canons about how statutes are to be construed,vand.landgraf usi film,d as professor llewellyn famously illustrated,many of the traditional canons have equal opposites.it is also well established that when congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change,the congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by congress.commodity futures trading comm schor,d internal quotation marks omitted see also lorillard pons,d congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without relevant change.these countering principles of interpretation highlight the primary defect in william chevron step one argument congress has said nothing explicitly about the propriety of a departure bar like the one in d.william argues that because congress codified every provision of the regulatory framework but the departure bar,that omission must have been intentional,but the obvious response to this argument is that congress is presumed to have known about and approved of the departure bar when it amended the ina without explicitly repealing it.congress often expressly repeals both statutory provisions,see,c the judicial departure bar,and regulations,see,bipartisan campaign reform act of,c,stat,the regulations on coordinated communications are repealed,and it is reasonable to expect that congress will speak with greater clarity in overruling agency interpretations like the departure bar at issue here.either way,the focus in this case inevitably shifts to what congress did not do or say,which is a good sign that the chevron inquiry must progress past step one 
the first circuit recently reached this same conclusion,moving past chevron first step in upholding the validity of b,which bars immigration judges from considering motions to reopen and reconsider made after an alien departure.see,at.the departure bar in b is virtually identical to the departure bar in the regulation at issue here.compare b with d.in,the petitioner,like william does here,argued that congress repeal of c,the departure bar to judicial review,signaled its intent that the attorney general should no longer enforce b,at.the court spent little ink in concluding that deference to the attorney general regulation,if found to be reasonable,was warranted given that there is no statutory language that explicitly addresses the issue.id.indeed,one can infer from the brevity of the court chevron step one analysis that the court felt little pause before proceeding to chevron step two.
although i recognize the appeal of inferring from congress failure to codify the departure bar to bia review that it meant to do away with d,i can not conclude that such an inference amounts to a clear statement of congressional intent under chevron first step.this is not to say that wholesale changes to a statute can not demonstrate congress clear intent to repeal an agency interpretation without mentioning the interpretation by name or number,but in this case congress amendments to the ina did not clearly foreclose the attorney general from exercising his discretion over the bia jurisdiction to hear motions to reopen made after removal.i would therefore find that,under chevron first step,the ina is silent as to whether the attorney general may regulate the bia jurisdiction to hear motions to reopen in the way that d does.
chevron step two.
if the statute is silent i have concluded that it is,and if the agency is empowered by statute to issue regulations to dispel the silence the attorney general is,then we must uphold the agency interpretation if it is reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design.nationsbank of north carolina,variable annuity life ins,d.this deferential standard requires that we give the agency interpretation controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.household credit,at.quoting chevron,at.see also zheng gonzales,cir chevron,of course,stands for the proposition that administrative agencies receive broad deference in interpreting the statutes which they are charged with enforcing.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,d quoting abudu,d.
as noted above,the iirira also repealed c,which provided that a n order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has departed from the united states after the issuance of the order.c.if congressional purpose is thwarted by d,it must be because congress repeal of c,coupled with its failure to codify the departure bar,strongly implied its desire to generally free aliens from having to litigate matters while in the united states,including freeing them from having to litigate motions to reopen before removal.in my view,the repeal of c is as important to william argument as congress failure to codify d,for without the statutory repeal,congress codification of most,but not all,of the regulatory framework regarding motions to reopen would make a less compelling argument for implied repeal of d.in a sense,then,the congressional repeal of c is the glue that holds together william argument.but i do not understand congress repeal of the departure bar to judicial review to telegraph its intentions with respect to motions to reopen.
for one thing,judicial review is not bia review.the repealed c served as a limitation on the power of courts to review final orders of removal after the alien had departed from the country.it seems precarious to conclude that congress statutory maneuvering with respect to the jurisdiction of the courts not only speaks,but speaks definitively,to congress intentions regarding the scope of the bia review.after all,it is the agency that is entrusted with administering the statute,not the courts.
perhaps more importantly,judicial review of an alien petition for review with respect to a final order of removal is not the same as bia review of a motion to reopen.william argument assumes that a petition for review of a final administrative order enjoys status with a motion to reopen,but the history of the motion to reopen indicates that it has been long disfavored under the immigration laws.a petition for review of a final order of removal represents an alien first and only opportunity for judicial review of the merits of the order,whereas a motion to reopen seeks a subsequent opportunity for administrative review.it is no surprise,then,that m otions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored for the same reasons as are petitions for rehearing and motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.doherty,d.there is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.abudu,at.to be sure,another reason for disfavoring motions to they were often used as part of dilatory tactics and permitted endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facies case,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted is no longer in play once the alien has departed or been removed from the country,but the interest in promoting finality in immigration proceedings still remains,and is as strong as ever.
the differences between a petition for judicial review and a motion to the bia to reopen proceedings,in my view,largely explain why congress repealed the departure bar to judicial review and acquiesced to the continued application of the attorney general departure bar to bia review.given that the iirira streamlined the rules and procedures of the ina to make it easier for the bia to deport aliens,congress surely must have understood that the result would be that many more aliens would be removed during the pendency of their judicial proceedings.repealing c ensured that the expedited removal of aliens would not cut off their chance at judicial review of the merits of their removal order.but i can not impute to congress a similar intention to free the motion to reopen from the workings of the departure bar,given the motion disfavored status.see,at concluding that congress repeal of c does not remotely support an argument that congress also intended,implicitly,to allow petitions to reopen a closed administrative proceeding.
having established that congress repeal of the departure bar to judicial review of final removal orders has little or no bearing on the validity of the regulation departure bar to bia review of motions to reopen,i turn to the only remaining question does the departure bar undermine the ina purposes as evidenced by congress codification of the motion to reopen although not without some uncertainty,i conclude that the answer is no.william argument essentially is that we can infer from congress failure to codify the departure bar,in light of its codification of much of the regulatory landscape governing motions to reopen,that the regulation acts contrarily to the statute.this is a hard conclusion to accept given that the current statutory and regulatory framework,which includes the departure bar,operates nearly identically to how the regulation operated before the iirira.before the iirira,an alien could only file one motion to reopen,within days,and before removal from the country.assuming the validity of the regulation,the same is true after the iirira.william argument that the regulation cuts into the statutory framework assumes that congress failure to enact the regulatory bar implies that congress meant to do away with it,but that is the very question to be answered here and,as such,is not a convincing argument 
returning to my earlier discussion of william thrust and the government parry,i believe that the government has the better of the argument.given the ina silence with respect to the departure bar,i understand congress failure to explicitly repeal d as acquiescence to its continued operation.the regulation containing the departure bar,a provision aimed at promoting finality in removal proceedings,has been the longstanding view of the attorney general,a view that we must presume congress understood when it amended the act in.stone,at.this presumption is especially strong here,for the attorney general regulation was fresh when congress enacted the iirira,having been promulgated only a few months before congress passed the iirira.if congress wished to repeal,either explicitly or implicitly,a recently promulgated regulation containing a agency interpretation respecting the agency own jurisdict
