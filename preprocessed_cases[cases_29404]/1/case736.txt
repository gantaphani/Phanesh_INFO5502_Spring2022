background 
airport interview june,
on june,petitioner and her son were detained at john kennedy airport in new york while attempting to enter the country.later that same day,petitioner was interviewed by an immigration inspector.petitioner received the assistance of a mandarin interpreter,through whom she conveyed that she understood that the purpose of this interview was to determine whether she should be temporarily admitted into the united states despite her apparent inadmissibility.in response to the inspector question about whether she had any fears or concerns about being removed from the united states or being sent back to her home country,petitioner stated i am afraid because i had by pass sic surgery on my heart and the government was forcing me not to have any more children.the government wanted me to go to a hospital and have a birth control device implant inside of me.she further stated that she had been kept in detention for two days because she refused to have the birth control operation.in response to the inspector question about whether she would be harmed if returned to her home country,petitioner stated if i am sent back i would die.petitioner then affirmed that she had read the transcript of her statement or had it read to her,that her answers were true and correct to the best of her knowledge,and that this statement wa s a full,true and correct record of her interrogation.
credible fear interview june,
on june,an asylum officer conducted a credible fear interview with petitioner at an immigration and naturalization service ins facility in jamaica,new york,where petitioner had been detained since her airport interview.petitioner was once more provided with a mandarin interpreter.at the start of the interview,the asylum officer read petitioner the following statement 
the purpose of this interview is to determine whether you may be eligible for asylum or protection from removal to a country where you fear persecution or torture.i am going to ask you questions about why you fear returning to your country it is very important that you tell the truth during the interview and that you respond to all of my questions.this may be your only opportunity to give such information.please feel comfortable telling me why you fear harm.law has strict rules to prevent the disclosure of what you tell me today about the reasons why you fear harm.the information you tell me about the reasons for your fear will not be disclosed to your government,except in exceptional circumstances.the statements you make today may be used in deciding your claim and in any future immigration proceedings.it is important that we understand each other.if at any time i make a statement you do not understand,please stop me and tell me you do not understand so that i can explain it to you.
in response to the asylum officer question about whether petitioner or any member of her family had ever been mistreated or threatened by anyone in any country to which she may be returned,petitioner provided the following statement 
after i had my son in,i was forced to have an intrauterine device iud insertion by the family planning officials fpo.i attempted to remove it once to have more children in but was found to have had it removed and it was reinserted.in august,i had to have surgery for my heart problems and the iud was removed.the doctors said that i could not have the iud inserted again because it will interfere with my heart problems.the fpo sic came to the iud in december but when my husband and i protested,they were going to arrest us,so we ran away and hid.if i have the iud inserted again,i may die from complications from my heart medication and i will not be able to have more children.
in response to the inspector question about whether she would be harmed if returned to her home country,petitioner stated the family planning officials will arrest me and have another iud inserted in me if i go back.if this happens,i may die from complications due to my heart condition.on the basis of petitioner statements,petitioner was referred for a full hearing on her claims for asylum and withholding of removal.pending a full hearing,petitioner was transferred to an ins minor and family shelter in pennsylvania,which allowed her to be housed together with her minor son,and petitioner and her son were eventually released on parole from ins custody in september.
asylum application november,and merits hearings february,and june,
on november,petitioner submitted a formal asylum application.in support of her application,petitioner submitted a sworn statement claiming that she had experienced two forced abortions,one in september when she was one month pregnant and one in march when she was three weeks pregnant that,in july,family planning officials forcibly entered her home and took her to the family planning office,where she was detained for three days and subjected to an iud insertion that the july events motivated her to attempt suicide and that,in december,her husband had physically assaulted family planning officials who arranged for her to have an iud inserted against her wishes and,as a result,petitioner and her husband were forced to flee from their marital home to the home of petitioner sister.
on february and june,petitioner appeared before an ij for hearings on her asylum application.at those hearings,petitioner testified that family planning officials had arranged for the termination of her first two pregnancies without informing her how far advanced these pregnancies were.with regard to her reasons for not wanting to use an iud after her heart surgery,she stated that the doctor who had performed the surgery had recommended that she not use an iud after her surgery because of the medication she would have to take.in describing her husband december encounter with local family planning officials,she stated that her husband had fled to his uncle home after the incident,whereas she had gone to her sister home.
both the ij and the government asked petitioner to explain several discrepancies in her testimony and submissions.the ij asked why,if petitioner had not been told at what stage her two pregnancies had been aborted,she was able to provide this information in her asylum application.petitioner,in response,reiterated that she did not know how advanced her pregnancies were and asserted,without explanation,that the statement in her asylum application had not been a lie.when the ij asked this question again at the second hearing,petitioner claimed that she had prepared the asylum application while in detention.
petitioner also testified that family planning officials had followed her husband home after his encounter with them in december.when asked why she had not included this fact in her asylum application,she was unable to provide any explanation.the ij also inquired why she had not discussed her two forced abortions or suicide attempt at the credible fear and airport interviews.petitioner stated that she had not discussed the forced abortions because she was confused and did not know what to say.she stated that she had mentioned suicide at her airport interview when answering a question about what would happen if she were sent back.however,she could not recall whether she had mentioned that she had attempted suicide in the past.finally,the ij asked why the records from petitioner heart surgery did not mention petitioner iud,any problem that it might cause,or that it had to be removed prior to her operation.in response,petitioner stated that the doctor had refused to make this kind of statement.petitioner counsel acknowledged that,in responding to the government questions,petitioner had conceded that she lied about having an iud removed because she wanted to have more children.
decision of the immigration judge june,
three weeks after the end of the merits hearing,on june,the ij issued a written decision denying petitioner applications for relief on the grounds that petitioner had failed adequately to establish that she was subjected to forcible abortions,that she attempted suicide because she was forced to have an iud inserted,or that she had developed very serious medical problems as a result of iud insertions.although the ij declined to find petitioner completely lack ing in credibility,he stated that he had very serious doubts regarding the testimony that petitioner had offered on these matters based on discrepancies between her testimony at the merits hearing and the statements that she had offered in other contexts.specifically,the ij noted that petitioner written statements,submitted in anticipation of the merits hearing,did not mention that family planning officials followed her husband home after the december incident that the transcripts of petitioner airport and credible fear interviews did not mention petitioner forced abortions and suicide attempt and,finally,that petitioner hearing testimony did not reveal that petitioner had protested chinese family planning policies claim she had made in her credible fear interview.the ij also observed that petitioner had been unable to support the questionable aspects of her claims with written documentation and her explanations as to why she had been unable to do so were unconvincing.
board of immigration appeals decision december,
petitioner appealed the ij decision to the bia,contending,inter alia,that the ij adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence and the ij was incorrect to rely on her airport and credible fear interviews in light of petitioner asylum hearing testimony that she had been confused during those earlier interviews and her subsequent sworn statement that she had been nervous and afraid during the interviews.the bia,in a decision issued on december,dismissed petitioner appeal,agreeing with the ij that petitioner had failed to provide a reliable and coherent account of her claim for asylum and,therefore,had failed to meet her burden of proof.the bia concluded that the ij had properly relied upon petitioner failure to mention her two forced abortions and suicide attempt at the airport and credible fear interviews and,further,that the ij had properly found that,while petitioner confusion and nervousness during those interviews was understandable,it did not excuse her failure to mention the entire crux of her claim.the bia also determined that the ij had properly taken account of petitioner failure to provide any objective documentary evidence to remedy the discrepancies and omissions in her submissions.
on appeal,petitioner now challenges,inter alia,the agency adverse credibility finding as well as the agency reliance on her airport and credible fear interviews.
ii.discussion 
reliance on the record of petitioner airport interview 
petitioner contends that the agency erred in relying on the record of her airport interview when assessing her credibility.we disagree.
a n ij is not precluded from relying on an alien testimony in an airport interview as long as the record of that testimony represents a sufficiently accurate record of the alien statements to merit consideration in determining whether the alien is credible.guan gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and,as we have previously held,the record of an airport interview is sufficiently accurate to merit consideration when it provides a verbatim account or transcript of the alien statements was conducted in a manner designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim and contains no indication that the alien was reluctant to reveal information or did not understand english or the translations provided by the interpreter.id.quoting ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.but see guan,at w e do not regard these factors as essential to be assessed in every case,but simply as helpful matters to be considered where appropriate.
in the instant case,petitioner was informed about the purpose of the airport interview and the importance of providing full and accurate testimony,asked about her ability to comprehend the questions posed to her,and given the opportunity to be interviewed in a private area.furthermore,like the statements whose consideration we endorsed in ramsameachire and guan,the record of petitioner airport interview bears hallmarks of accuracy and reliability,as it is typewritten,signed by petitioner,and initialed by her on each page.ramsameachire,at see also guan,at noting that the ins officer read guan a statement concerning her rights under law and exhorting her to provide a full account of any persecution she may have suffered in china,guan was promptly provided with an interpreter and asked to confirm that she could understand the proceedings,and guan signed and initialed the interview transcript after indicating that her answers were true and correct and that her statement is a full,true,and correct record of her interrogation.
here,petitioner airport interview was both conducted in a and careful manner,ramsameachire,at,and appropriately documented by the interviewing authorities,see also guan,at.accordingly,the record of that interview was sufficiently reliable to merit consideration.petitioner subsequent assertions that she was nervous and afraid during this interview do not alter our analysis,for reasons we set forth in ramsameachire and guan.see ramsameachire,at a lthough ramsameachire attempts to reconcile the differences between his airport statements and his later testimony by asserting that he was nervous about speaking to ins officials at the airport,the fact that he stated at the interview that he was comfortable speaking in a private room and that he understood the purpose of the interview undermines any claim that the interview was unduly coercive or that ramsameachire felt that he had no opportunity to explain his situation to the officer.see also guan,at approving of this observation and noting that,while the ij and bia should not overlook complaints of coercion altogether,an alien mere recitation that he was nervous or felt pressured during an airport interview will not automatically prevent the ij or bia from relying on statements in such interviews when making adverse credibility determinations citation omitted.
reliance on the record of petitioner credible fear interview 
petitioner also contends that the agency erred in considering the statements that she made during her credible fear interview.evaluating the merits of this challenge requires us to determine the circumstances under which an ij and the bia may consider the record of a credible fear interview when evaluating an alien credibility.
in ramsameachire,we stated that the bia must closely examine each airport interview before concluding that it represents a sufficiently accurate record of the alien statements,having observed that t he airport interview is an inherently limited forum for the alien to express the fear that will provide the basis for his or her asylum claim.at.as we explained 
the interview takes place immediately after an alien has arrived in the united states,often after weeks of travel,and may be perceived by the alien as coercive or thre
