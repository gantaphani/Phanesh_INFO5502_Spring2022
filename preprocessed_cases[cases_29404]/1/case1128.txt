opinion of the court 
this case originates from the issuance of two citations by the occupational safety and health administration osha to beverly beverly for failure to compensate employees for travel expenses and time spent receiving treatment pursuant to the bloodborne pathogens standard,which requires employers to make treatment available at no cost to employees for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.beverly challenged these citations,arguing that the at no cost provision should be read narrowly and did not include such costs.the alj disagreed and upheld the citations.beverly appealed to the occupational safety and health review commission commission,which reversed,finding that beverly did not have fair notice of the secretary of labor secretary broad interpretation.the secretary timely filed a petition for review.for the reasons that follow,we will grant the petition and vacate the decision of the commission.
in,congress adopted the occupational safety and health act osh act after finding that personal injuries and illnesses arising out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon,and are a hindrance to,interstate commerce in terms of lost production,wage loss,medical expenses,and disability compensation payments.a.the stated purpose for the adoption of the osh act was to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions to preserve our human resources.id.b.under the osh act,the secretary is empowered to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards for employers and to issue citations when employers fail to comply with these standards.id.b,a.violations of these standards are termed willful,repeated,serious,or not serious.id.not serious penalties may be subject to civil fines of up to.id.c.if an employer wishes to contest a citation,it is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.j.a party that disputes the decision of the alj may petition the commission for discretionary review.an aggrieved party may petition the court of appeals for review of the commission final order.id.
in,the secretary promulgated the bloodborne pathogens standard bps,pursuant to a specific congressional directive aimed at combating occupational exposures to the hepatitis b virus,the human immunodeficiency virus and other bloodborne pathogens.departments of labor,health and human services,and education,and related agencies appropriations act,stat.in drafting the bps,the secretary acted under the authority granted by the osh act to 
where appropriate prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available,by the employer or at his cost,to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure.
b.the bps applies to all occupational exposure which might be reasonably anticipated to lead to employee contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials.a,b.such exposure incidents include needlesticks,one of a number of events that involve piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier.id.b.pursuant to subsection f i of the bps,t he employer shall make available the hepatitis b vaccine and vaccination series to all employees who have occupational exposure,and evaluation and to all employees who have had an exposure incident.additionally,under subsection f ii,
t he employer shall ensure that all medical evaluations and procedures including the hepatitis b vaccine and vaccination series and evaluation and,including prophylaxis,are 
a made available at no cost to the employee 
b made available to the employee at a reasonable time and place.
id.f ii.the preamble to the bps explains the impetus for requiring employers to pay for the costs of their employees exposure incidents.it states 
numerous testimony and comment on the proposed rule stated the necessity that hepatitis b vaccination and evaluation and be made available by the employer at no cost to the employee this is consistent with osha policy,as stated in the occupational safety and health act of osh act in addition,some commenters noted that an important factor in successful vaccination programs was providing the vaccination at no cost to the employee.
osha has subsequently issued a series of compliance directives,stating that t he term at no cost to the employee means,among other things,no expense to the employee.see osha compliance directive cpl cpl c cpl in addition,osha director of compliance programs issued an opinion letter on july,osha opinion letter,in which it addressed two specific questions regarding application of the bps m ust the employer either provide or pay for transportation to and from the site where the hepatitis b vaccination will be administered and a re all activities associated with obtaining a hepatitis b vaccination,in fact,work functions and,consequently,is all time associated with receipt of vaccination work time in response to the first question,osha stated that w hile transportation may not need to be provided by the employer,its cost must be covered by the employer.the letter also addressed the second question,explaining that when receiving the vaccine or commuting to have it administered,employees must be considered.it is undisputed that the regulation,its preamble,the compliance directives,and the osha opinion letter were publicly available at all relevant times during the course of this litigation.
beverly owns and operates a nursing home in altoona,pennsylvania.beverly employs approximately people including vicki pacovsky and darryl kosanovich,both of whom work as nurses at the nursing home.on december,pacovsky received a needlestick while at the workplace,and on january,kosanovich also received a needlestick while at work.each sought treatment at the end of his or her respective shift at a designated medical facility,and each returned to the facility for periodic treatment during hours.beverly paid for the cost of the medical evaluations and procedures,but did not reimburse the employees for the hours they spent receiving either the initial or treatments.beverly also did not compensate the employees for travel time or expenses with respect to these treatments.
after each incident,osha inspected the workplace and issued an citation for violation of f ii a,due to beverly failure to provide evaluation and testing at no cost to the employee.beverly timely contested these citations.
on march,the alj issued a decision and order upholding the citations.she held that the at no cost language required beverly to pay for travel time and expenses.she also held that beverly was required to compensate pacovsky and kosanovich for the time they spent undergoing the evaluations and procedures.her interpretation relied on the dictionary definition of cost and the preamble to the bps,stating that the purpose of the regulation was to induce compliance and thereby reduce the number of infections.she therefore determined that the employees incurred costs by expending time and effort securing evaluation and treatment outside of work hours and traveling to and from the treatment facility.she opined that these costs operated as a disincentive to employees voluntary participation in the program,and would therefore defeat its purpose.
based on this analysis,the alj determined that the term at no cost to the employee was clear and unambiguous,and that regardless,any ambiguity was resolved by the secretary reasonable interpretations as set forth in the current osha compliance directive,two predecessor directives,and the osha opinion letter.she also found that the secretary had provided constitutionally adequate notice that the bps required employers to compensate employees for the travel expenses and time related to their evaluation and treatment.she therefore ordered beverly to reimburse pacovsky and kosanovich for the time spent receiving evaluation and treatment during hours and for travel expenses.
the commission granted beverly petition for discretionary review.a majority found that the at no cost provision of the bps was ambiguous,but that the secretary cost included time and travel reasonable.despite this finding,the majority held that neither the bps itself,nor any other materials available to beverly,explained with ascertainable certainty that the bps required employers to compensate employees for travel costs and time,and thus,the secretary had failed to provide fair notice of its interpretation.the lone dissenting member of the commission agreed with the majority that the provision was ambiguous and that the secretary interpretation was reasonable,but stated that the osha opinion letter provided sufficient notice of the secretary interpretation to allay due process concerns.the secretary timely filed a petition for review.
we exercise jurisdiction over the secretary petition for review pursuant to b.we accord substantial deference to the secretary interpretation of a regulation promulgated by her agency.martin occupational safety and health review comm n,d.t he commission,and ultimately the court of appeals,review the secretary interpretation to assure that it is consistent with the regulatory language and is otherwise reasonable.id.at.we will decide all relevant questions of law,and interpret constitutional and statutory provisions.in addition,we will hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.a.issues of law are subject to plenary review.dole penn,cir.
before we assess whether the secretary interpretation of the bps is reasonable or whether beverly had fair notice of that interpretation,we must determine whether the meaning of regulatory language is free from doubt.martin,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.beverly contends that,as a threshold matter,the plain language of the bps unambiguously excludes compensation for time and travel expenses from beverly obligations to its employees under the at no cost provision,and therefore,no alternate interpretation of the secretary could possibly be reasonable.if beverly is correct,our inquiry would be at an end.see,owcp associated coal,cir the responsibility to promulgate clear and unambiguous standards is upon the secretary.the test is not what he might possibly have intended,but what he said.however,if we determine that the language is not free from doubt,we will defer to the secretary interpretation if it sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.martin,at.
a regulation is ambiguous when it is not free from doubt,martin,at,and where no particular interpretation of the regulation is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of promulgation of the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d.because the term cost,as utilized in the bps,has a number of common definitions and can comfortably bear multiple interpretations,see auer robbins,d,the plain language of the bps does not compel any one particular interpretation.verizon communications,d the fact is that without any better indication of meaning than the unadorned term,the word cost is a chameleon,a virtually meaningless term.moreover,aside from the statement in the preamble to the bps generally stressing the importance of the at no cost provision in achieving the goals of the osh act,neither party has pointed to any indication contemporaneous with promulgation unequivocally stating the agency intent to interpret the provision in a particular way.therefore,and for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the commission did not err in determining that the language of the bps is ambiguous.
beverly argues that the regulation is not ambiguous and that it fully complied with the plain language of the bps.beverly contends that the at no cost language unambiguously includes only the cost of evaluation and and does not encompass compensation for time or travel expenses.beverly correctly observes that the bps does not specifically direct employers to compensate employees for their time or travel expenses.while the secretary interprets the term cost to encompass travel expenses and time,beverly alleges,without citation,that t he ordinary meaning of cost is the amount charged to purchase goods or services.in beverly view,employees have not been charged for time or travel expenses,and are therefore not entitled to be compensated for these sums.
beverly proffers the mandatory declination form required by the bps as evidence that cost is meant to encompass only charges for goods and services.the form reads,in relevant part 
if in the future i continue to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials and i want to be vaccinated with hepatitis b vaccine,i can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me.
app.a.in addition,beverly points out that a number of other osha standards require that medical surveillance be made available or provided at no cost to the employee,but include the additional language,without loss of pay.see,inorganic arsenic standard stating that medical surveillance shall be provided without cost to the employee,without loss of pay and at a reasonable time and place.
however,as our sister circuit noted in construing a similar provision of the inorganic arsenic standard,cost has many common meanings.phelps dodge occupational safety and health review comm n,cir phelps dodge ii.some of these meanings include the amount or equivalent paid or given or charged,whatever must be given,sacrificed,suffered,or foregone to secure a benefit,and the expenditure or outlay of money,time or labor see sec y of labor phelps dodge,cas.bna,comm phelps dodge i citing webster third new international dictionary.in phelps dodge i,the commission adopted the secretary broad interpretation of cost,an interpretation virtually identical to the one proffered here,holding that employees given examinations during hours have incurred a cost cognizable under the regulation and should be paid for their time.phelps dodge i,cas.bna at.in addition,the commission found that e mployees who are not reimbursed for extra transportation expenses incur a cost in the plainest and most natural sense of the word.id.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.see phelps dodge ii,at.
with respect to beverly other arguments,the term at no charge in the declination letter is nearly as susceptible to broad or narrow interpretations as the term at no cost.the terms charge and cost,as used in this context,are functionally more similar than they are different.a charge is an expenditure or expense incurred,which might naturally include travel expenses and compensation for time.webster third new international dictionary.moreover,beverly reliance on the existence of the without loss of pay phrase in regulations other than the bps is misplaced for purposes of determining whether the plain language of the bps is itself ambiguous as the phelps dodge decisions illustrate,the at no cost portion of the regulation may still be read broadly to include employees time and travel expenses,notwithstanding the existence of the without loss of pay provision in that case.see phelps dodge ii,at.
in light of this,we agree with the unanimous view of the commission that the language of the at no cost provision of the bps is ambiguous,and therefore,as the regulatory language is not free from doubt,we will give effect to the secretary interpretation so long as it is reasonable.martin,at.it is that question to which we now turn.
the secretary maintains that her interpretation of the bps at no cost language to include compensation for time and travel expenses is reasonable.this conclusion is also consistent with the unanimous view of the commission,which determined that the secretary broad reading of the at no cost provision conformed to the purpose and wording of the bps,and that without such compensation,the likelihood that an employee will obtain necessary medical treatment declines.the commission also observed that the preamble to the bps reiterates the at no cost language,and restates its importance in achieving the goals of the osh act,therefore justifying a broad reading.
we agree with the commission that the secretary broad interpretation of the at no cost provision is reasonable.the secretary interpretation is based on an accepted dictionary definition of the term cost and does not impermissibly strain the plain language of the regulation.moreover,as explained by the commission,the secretary broad interpretation comports with the bps purpose in encouraging employees to seek evaluation and treatment for occupational exposure.plainly,compensating employees for their time and effort in undergoing testing and evaluation is an effective way to ensure that employees who have potentially been exposed to a bloodborne pathogen pursue testing.
before us,beverly argues that even if the commission correctly determined that the at no cost provision is ambiguous,the secretary interpretation is nonetheless unreasonable.first,beverly argues that the secretary interpretation fails to comport with the purpose and wording in the bps.curiously,beverly does not directly address the secretary contention that cost can reasonably be interpreted as the expenditure or outlay of money,time or labor.nor does it make any other argument specifically contending that the language of f ii a can not comfortably bear the meaning assigned by the secretary.see auer,at.
instead,beverly asserts that it is the secretary position that the source for any requirement that an employer must compensate its employees for time and travel expenses would be f ii b,the m ade available to the employee at a reasonable time and place provision.building on this premise,beverly contends that because it was cited only for violation of subsection f ii a the at no cost not for violation of subsection f ii b,it would be improper to impose costs that could only arise,pursuant to its characterization of the secretary position,under f ii b.
this argument is a straw man and a mischaracterization of the secretary position.the secretary does not actually argue that the at a reasonable time and place provision is the source of the requirement that employers must compensate employees for time and travel expenses.throughout her brief,the secretary repeatedly argues that the at no cost provision is the source of the requirement.the secretary cites subsection f ii b only for the proposition that while it may be reasonable for an employer to require an employee to seek evaluations and procedures during time,under subsection f ii b,i t is not reasonable,however,to shift the cost of that choice onto an employee under subsection f ii a.since it is the cost,and not the reasonable availability of evaluation and treatment that is at issue here,it is plainly the secretary interpretation of subsection f ii a that matters.therefore,beverly argument that it was not cited for a violation of subsection f ii b is to no avail,as its compliance with that subsection was never at issue 
consequently,the commission did not err when it determined that the secretary interpretation of the at no cost provision was reasonable and consistent with the language and purpose of the regulation.
as explained previously,a majority of the commission determined that beverly did not have fair notice of the secretary broad interpretation of the bps,despite finding that it was a reasonable interpretation.specifically,the majority concluded that neither the regulation itself,its preamble,nor any other documentation issued by the secretary explained with ascertainable certainty what the bps requires,relying on the standard laid out in gates fox occupational safety and health review comm n,citing diamond roofing occupational safety and health review comm n,cir.the majority considered,but discounted,the premise that the osha opinion letter,which stated that travel expenses are compensable and that an employee is considered when receiving evaluation or treatment,provided sufficient notice of the secretary interpretation of the bps.it discounted the letter in part because it was,in its eyes,at odds with a department of labor letter interpreting the fair labor standards act flsa letter,which stated that i n order for time spent waiting for or receiving medical attention or treatment to be compensable,the visit to the doctor must be at the direction of the employer and it must occur during the employees normal work hours on days when the employee is working.the majority stated that regardless,the secretary had ample opportunity to formalize her opinion on the matter,and that even without the conflicting flsa letter,the most recent compliance directives were studiously vague in interpreting the provision.
the dissenting member of the commission disagreed,concluding that the osha opinion letter militated for a finding of fair notice.the dissent observed that the letter predated the cited conduct,and directly addressed both travel expenses and time compensation.the dissent questioned the majority reliance on the flsa letter,noting that it was promulgated by a different agency under a different statute,likely mitigating much of the possible confusion it might have caused.the dissent,relying on corbesco sec y of labor,cir,suggested that,moreover,even if the two letters created some confusion,they at least provided enough notice such that beverly should have inquired of osha.for the reasons that follow,we hold that beverly had fair notice of the secretary interpretation.
beverly argues that the commission correctly determined that beverly lacked constitutionally adequate notice because neither the regulation nor any other documents explained,with ascertainable certainty,that compensation of time and travel expenses was required by the bps.beverly asserts that if the term cost is ambiguous,the bps is unconstitutional because it fails to give notice of what is required of employers.although we have indeed determined that the at no cost provision is ambiguous in this context,this alone is not sufficient to deprive beverly of fair notice.
we have previously cited with approval the line of cases enunciating ascertainable certainty as the applicable standard for fair notice.see dravo occupational safety and health review comm n,cir citing diamond roofing,at.but,as the court of appeals for the first circuit explained in united states lachman,that line of cases 
do es not stand for the proposition that any ambiguity in a regulation bars punishment.rather,they are addressed only to situations in which the agency had given conflicting public interpretations of the regulation,or,the regulation is so vague that the ambiguity can only be resolved by deferring to the agency own interpretation of the regulation,a situation in which the ambiguity is resolved by something comparable to a analysis under chevron,and the agency has failed to provide a sufficient,publicly accessible statement of that interpretation before the conduct in question.
cir.here,because the secretary has not given conflicting interpretations of the bps and has provided a sufficient,publicly accessible statement of her interpretation prior to the issuance of the two citations in question,beverly fair notice argument fails.
first,the osha opinion letter adequately and publicly stated the secretary position that transportation cost s must be covered by the employer and that employees must be considered when receiving treatment.beverly argues that this letter is insufficient to provide fair notice because the letter fails to comport with the wording in the bps.in effect,beverly contends that because the at no cost provision is open to interpretation,it does not clearly require compensation for travel expenses or time,and therefore,the interpretation letter incorrectly interpreted the bps.this argument is circular.it is precisely because the regulation is ambiguous that it must be interpreted,and the secretary here has provided such an interpretation.as such,the agency has not failed to provide a sufficient,publicly accessible statement that the bps required beverly to compensate its employees for travel expenses and time.lachman,at.
the decisions in phelps dodge i and ii provided additional notice to beverly that the bps required compensation of employees for travel expenses and time.beverly contends t
