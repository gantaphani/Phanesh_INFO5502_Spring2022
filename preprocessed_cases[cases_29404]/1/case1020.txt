opinion of the court 
nigel singh petitions for review of a final order of removal based on his conviction,under,for knowingly making a false statement under penalty of perjury in a bankruptcy proceeding.the board of immigration appeals bia determined that singh conviction was an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeded,and hence an aggravated felony under a m i.in his petition,singh argues that is a perjury offense that must meet the requirements for aggravated felonies under a s.singh further argues that,even if assessed under a m i,he is not removable because his offense did not cause an actual loss exceeding.while we reject singh first argument,we agree that under the unique facts of this case his offense did not cause an actual loss.because we hold that a m i requires an actual,not merely intended,loss,we will grant singh petition and vacate the order of removal.
facts procedural history 
singh was born in jamaica on august,and has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since december.since that time,singh has married a citizen and raised three children.in,singh founded the raeback corporation,a construction contracting firm that bid on public works projects as a minority business enterprise mbe.during his tenure as raeback president,singh was asked on several occasions by a business contact at a firm,rebar,to help rebar secure government contracts.in exchange for kickbacks,singh falsely attested that raeback was serving as a subcontractor on government projects when,in fact,rebar did the subcontract work.under the scheme,billing was done in raeback name and the general contractor paid raeback,which then forwarded the payments to rebar,less a ten percent kickback.one of the government entities that funded these projects was the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority.
in september,during the course of the port authority project,raeback filed for bankruptcy due to losses on another project.since the bankruptcy proceedings automatically froze raeback bank accounts,singh and his contact agreed on an arrangement in which the contact would deposit the general contractor checks and hold the funds for singh during raeback bankruptcy unbeknownst to singh,however,his contact was a confidential informant for the port authority,which had begun investigating rebar arrangement with raeback.rather than holding the funds for singh,therefore,the contact transferred the funds approximately in total to the port authority.
when the port authority informed singh of its investigation in,singh participated in two proffer sessions with law enforcement agents.during these sessions,agents learned of raeback bankruptcy proceeding.agents also learned that raeback bankruptcy petition failed to disclose its revenue stream from the port authority project.although the port authority did not take legal action against singh,singh was charged by the attorney office in the eastern district of new york for one count of fail ing to disclose all of raeback accounts receivable on raeback bankruptcy petition,in violation of.under,it is a crime to knowingly and fraudulently make a false declaration,certificate,verification,or statement under penalty of perjury in relation to a bankruptcy proceeding.on june,singh pled guilty.as part of the plea agreement,singh agreed to restitution in the amount of,to be paid by transferring the money held by the port authority to the bankruptcy trustee.
at the time the plea agreement was entered,the attorney believed singh failure to disclose the port authority funds had caused substantial interference with the administration of justice,thus warranting a sentencing enhancement under b.later,however,the attorney informed the sentencing court that,because the chapter bankruptcy proceedings are still ongoing and the bankruptcy trustee will receive the funds which the defendant attempted to secrete,the defendant crime will not affect the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.app.at.the attorney also informed the court that the trustee did not expend any substantial additional resources as a result of the defendant fraud.app.at.based on these discoveries,the attorney office dropped its request for the enhancement.singh,meanwhile,emphasized the restitution agreement as a factor supporting his request for a sentence.
on december,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sentenced singh to ten months in prison.although the court initial judgment did not mention restitution,an amended judgment issued on january,included a restitution order pursuant to the plea agreement.the terms of the court restitution order,identical in all relevant respects to the terms singh agreed to in the plea,ordered that the currently held by the port a uthority be transferred to the trustee.on march,the funds were transferred to the trustee,and on january,the trustee distributed raeback assets to its creditors.
shortly after singh began serving his sentence,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings by issuing him a notice to appear nta.in the nta,the dhs charged that singh conviction involved a loss or intended loss to a victim or victims exceeding and thus made him removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii.app.at.under a m i hereinafter,subparagraph m i,an aggravated felony is defined as an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.the immigration judge sustained dhs charge and entered an order of removal,which the bia affirmed on april.in an unpublished opinion,the bia ruled that a conviction under categorically involves fraud,as evident by our court determination of the crime essential elements in united states mathies,cir.the bia also ruled that singh agreement to pay restitution and the sentencing court restitution order provided clear and convincing evidence that singh offense caused a loss to the trustee exceeding.
after the bia issued its order,we granted singh request for a stay so that we could consider his petition for review.in granting the stay,we cited the second circuit decision in pierre holder,cir,where an intended loss exceeding was held insufficient,as a matter of law,to satisfy the loss requirement of subparagraph m i.
ii.legal background 
although a c divests federal courts of jurisdiction to review orders of removal based on an alien commission of an aggravated felony,this provision only applies if we are satisfied the petitioner is,in fact,an alien who has committed an aggravated felony.valansi ashcroft,cir.whether or not singh committed an aggravated felony is a question of law which we review de novo.bobb att y,cir.while we generally defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of the ina,w e do not defer to the bia determination of whether a crime constitutes an aggravated felony.henry bureau of immig.customs enforcement,cir.we also will not affirm a bia order if it can not be sustained on the grounds upon which the bia relied,unless it is highly probable that the omission or error did not affect the outcome.li hua yuan att y,cir.
under the ina,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.an aggravated felony under subparagraph m i has two distinct elements it must be a crime that involves fraud or deceit,in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.to determine whether a crime involves fraud or deceit,we must employ a categorical approach in which we focus on the crime statutory elements rather than the specific facts underlying the crime.kawashima holder,d.by contrast,we must use a approach to determine whether the alien offense involved a loss to a victim s exceeding,nijhawan holder,d kaplun att y,cir,wherein the loss must be tethered to the actual offense of conviction,not acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct,nijhawan.at alaka att y,cir.
iii.discussion 
fraud or deceit requirement 
we begin our analysis here by considering whether singh was convicted of an offense that categorically involves fraud or deceit.as the supreme court has recently made clear,a crime involves fraud or deceit if it necessarily entail s fraudulent or deceitful conduct.kawashima.at accord valansi,at.for the reasons that follow,we hold that a conviction under necessarily entails deceit and therefore qualifies as a deceit offense under a m i.
to violate,one must knowingly and fraudulently make a false declaration under penalty of perjury in relation to a bankruptcy proceeding.this court has previously interpreted the phrase knowingly and fraudulently in as requiring an intent to defraud.in re topper,cir interpreting as requiring actual intent on the part of the bankrupt to hinder,delay and defraud his creditors see also mathies,at.as singh correctly notes,however,the jurisdiction in which he was convicted the second circuit interprets differently than we do.under the second circuit interpretation,the words of the statute requiring that the testimony be given knowingly and fraudulently mean no more than an intentional untruth in a matter material to the issue which is itself material.in re robinson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the second circuit,therefore,only the basic requirements of perjury need to be proven.id.at.singh thus contends that the bia erred in concluding that categorically involves fraud.even if singh is correct,however,it would not change the result here because the second circuit definition of necessarily requires deceit.as noted in kawashima,the word deceit refers to the act or process of deceiving as by falsification,concealment or cheating.at.the second circuit element of knowingly making a false statement fits this definition thus,irrespective of which statutory elements we use,qualifies under subparagraph m i as an offense that involves deceit.
subparagraph s considerations 
singh also argues that because the second circuit considers to be essentially equivalent to a perjury statute,robinson,at,he can not be removable because his offense does not qualify under the ina provision for aggravated felonies,a s hereinafter,subparagraph s singh bases this position on congress purported intent when enacting subparagraph s and the basic rule that the specific statutory provision should prevail over the more general.appellant br.at.this argument is at odds with our precedent.
as we made clear in valansi,w hen the statutory language of the ina has a clear meaning,we need not look further.at.in valansi,the petitioner argued that her conviction for embezzlement was a theft offense and could only be an aggravated felony if it satisfied the ina specific criteria for theft offenses under subparagraph g.id.at.we rejected this argument because the plain meaning of subparagraph m i suggests that embezzlement with intent to defraud would qualify as an offense that involves fraud or deceit.id.at.a similar situation applies here,as the plain meaning of subparagraph m i encompasses offenses,such as,that involve knowingly making false statements.under valansi we need not look further.
c.the loss requirement 
we turn now to the issue of whether singh offense was one in which the loss to the victim exceeded.our determination depends in part on whether the government must prove actual loss,or merely an intended or potential loss.we begin,therefore,by considering the meaning of subparagraph m i requirement that there be a loss to the victim or victims.as we noted in granting singh request to stay removal,the second circuit holds that subparagraph m i requires the loss to be an actual one.see pierre,at citing ming lam sui ins,cir.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the second circuit.
since the ina does not define the term loss,we must interpret the word according to its ordinary meaning at the time congress enacted subparagraph m i.see robinson napolitano,cir a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning at the time congress enacted the statute.quoting perrin united states,d.thus,because subparagraph m i was enacted by congress in we will consider the ordinary meaning of loss as of that time.
the edition of webster new international dictionary provides numerous definitions of loss,along with illustrative examples.each of these definitions,and their corresponding examples,refer to loss that actually occurs.see webster third new international dictionary.loss is defined,for example,as a the act or fact of losing b a person or thing or an amount that is lost c the act or fact of failing to gain,win,obtain,or utilize d a decrease in amount,magnitude,or degree e the state or fact of being destroyed or placed beyond recovery and f the amount of an insured financial detriment due to the occurrence of a stipulated contingent event.corresponding examples to illustrate these definitions include a loss of a leg b killed,wounded,or captured soldiers c loss of opportunity d altitude loss e loss of life in war and f financial detriment caused by death,injury,destruction,or damage.importantly,not one of these definitions or examples refers to potential loss even where loss refers to a failure to gain,the loss is characterized as having already occurred,loss of a battle.
consistent with webster definition,this court stated in that the ordinary meaning of loss is actual loss,not probable or intended loss.united states kopp,cir superseded by statute on other grounds.we conclude,therefore,that when congress enacted subparagraph m i,the plain meaning of loss referred to actual,not merely intended,loss.accordingly,because neither subparagraph m i nor paragraph expand loss ordinary meaning,we hold that subparagraph m i requires actual loss.accord kharana gonzales,cir i nterpreting a m i such that a conviction involving an unsuccessful attempt to obtain more than counts as a conviction in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds flies in the face of the plain meaning of the statute.
although some have argued that subparagraph m i should include intended loss,the reasons for overriding the statute plain meaning are unconvincing.the concurrence in kharana advanced the argument,for example,that because loss under subparagraph u has been interpreted to include intended loss,see matter of s i k,bia and matter of onyido,bia,loss under subparagraph m i should be read to include intended loss as well kharana,at wallace,concurring.the kharana concurrence reasons that because subparagraph u does not provide additional gloss on the word,loss meaning under u applies with equal force to subparagraph m i.id.there are several problems with this argument.subparagraph u defines an aggravated felony as an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph.a u.since subparagraph u does not mention the word loss,it is hardly significant that u does not provide additional gloss on the word itself.further,we question the premise that subparagraph u does not provide any additional gloss.after all,the reason the bia interpreted subparagraph u to include intended loss is because u includes the word attempt,a word not present in m.see onyido,at.there is a clear textual reason,therefore,why loss under subparagraph u should not apply with equal force to subparagraph m i.whereas subparagraph u expressly applies to attempts and conspiracies to commit crimes of deceit,subparagraph m i applies to consummated crimes of deceit.the bia determined that intended loss is relevant under subparagraph u because,by definition,an attempt to commit a crime does not require the crime to be successfully carried out.see id.this rationale does not apply to completed offenses under subparagraph m i.in short,the fact that the bia has held that actual loss is unnecessary under subparagraph u,does not mean that actual loss must be unnecessary under m i.
along with the kharana concurrence,the seventh circuit has suggested,in dicta,that subparagraph m i should be interpreted to encompass intended loss.see eke mukasey,cir.the seventh circuit suggests that this interpretation would be reasonable because it is consistent with the sentencing guidelines definition of loss for fraud and deceit crimes under.id.this argument is also unpersuasive.the statutory language of subparagraph m i provides no indication that congress wanted loss to be defined in accordance with the sentencing guidelines.as the kharana concurrence observed,the guidelines and the ina are like apples and oranges.see kharana,at wallace,concurring.not only are they written by different bodies one by a commission,one by congress,but they serve distinctly different purposes one penological,one civil although we have recognized that there might be occasions where the guidelines can help divine congress intent when passing the ina,no such guidance is necessary when the ina statutory language has a clear meaning.valansi,at.indeed,w hen we find the terms of a statute unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete,except in rare and exceptional circumstances.rubin united states,d citations omitted.here,there are no rare or exceptional circumstances that compel us to override subparagraph m i plain meaning.
d.the actual loss from singh offense 
having determined that subparagraph m i requires actual loss,we now turn to the specific circumstances of singh offense to determine if the government has proved by clear and convincing evidence that his offense involved an actual loss to a victim,or victims,that exceeds.nijhawan.at.we begin by laying out the parameters of the approach.
although not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself,kaplun,at,the approach goes beyond the approach that is used for determining which elements of a disjunctive statute an individual was convicted of committing.see nijhawan.at citing shepard united states,d and taylor united states,d.for example,whereas the approach is limited to the record of conviction,indictment,plea agreement,criminal judgment,etc and judicial findings of fact,alaka,at,the approach may consider material,nijhawan.at.accord matter of babaisakov,bia.the guiding principle for the analysis is that immigration courts must use fundamentally fair procedures,including procedures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a government claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud with the relevant loss to victims.nijhawan.at.
here,the government argues that the approach proves the existence of a loss that exceeds.the government primary argument is that,on its face,the restitution order is clear and convincing evidence of actual loss because restitution orders are limited to actual losses that resulted from the offense of conviction.gov t br.at.the government also argues that the circumstances of the case prove that singh caused an actual,if temporary,deprivation of of assets to the bankruptcy trustee.
the restitution order 
according to the government,the very fact that the sentencing court issued a restitution order of is proof positive that the requisite actual loss occurred the government reaches this conclusion based on a misapplication of the federal statutes governing restitution orders by federal courts the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,and the victim and witness protection act vwpa,under the mvra,a federal sentencing court shall order restitution for certain offenses,but only if the court finds that an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss as a direct and proximate result of the offense.a,c b.offenses involving fraud or deceit are included under the mvra,c a,and,as the government notes,violations of have generally qualified as such further,as the government points out,courts ordering restitution under the mvra are limited to remedying the actual loss caused by the defendant offense of conviction.hughey united states,d ergo,the government concludes that the sentencing court restitution order of here is ipso facto evidence that singh caused an actual loss to a victim exceeding.
the government argument fails,however,for three reasons.first,its reliance on the mvra is misplaced because the record shows that the sentencing court issued restitution pursuant to an express agreement by the parties,not the mvra.second,the law governing restitution issued pursuant to a party agreement shows that such orders are not limited to actual losses from the offense of conviction.third,even if the court restitution order reflected a judicial finding of loss,nijhawan and our own precedent make clear that we need not take the order at face value for removal purposes,particularly when,as here,it conflicts with undisputed facts in the sentencing material.we will address each of these three reasons in turn.
first,the government reliance on the mvra is misplaced because it is doubtful the sentencing court issued restitution under the mvra.the sentencing court was only required to issue restitution under the mvra if,and only if,the court determined that singh offense caused a physical injury or pecuniary loss to a victim.c.this is significant because it is unlikely that the bankruptcy trustee here actually qualified as a victim under the mvra.although the government cites united states holthaus,cir,for the proposition that bankruptcy trustees can be victims of violations,it omits the fact that holthaus limited this holding to trustees whose compensation has been negatively impacted.id.adopting rule set forth by the seventh circuit in united states lowell,cir see also united states paradis,cir holding that trustee is not a victim of bankruptcy fraud under mvra where defendant concealed funds that would go to the creditors.here,the government agreed at sentencing that the trustee did not expend any substantial additional resources as a result of the defendant fraud.app.at.it is unlikely,therefore,that the sentencing court determined the trustee to be a victim with an actual loss under the mvra,particularly since there is nothing in the record of conviction indicating it deliberated on this otherwise novel ruling.
another factor suggesting that the mvra was not the statutory framework for the restitution order is the fact that the court expressly stated that it issued the order pursuant to the plea agreement.app.at.this suggests the order was issued under a of the vwpa,since that provision allows sentencing courts to order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.a emphasis added.supporting this view is the fact that the sentencing court does not appear to have demonstrated its consideration of the statutory factors under a,as courts in the second circuit are required to do when issuing restitution in the absence of an agreement.see united states harris,cir.accordingly,we do not agree with the government argument that the sentencing court was required to,or did in fact,issue restitution pursuant to the mvra 
second,the fact that the sentencing court issued its order pursuant to the plea agreement is significant because,in the second circuit,restitution is not limited to actual loss caused by the offense of conviction when issued pursuant to an agreement.united states silkowski,cir.this court and several other courts of appeals have recognized this prevailing rule.united states akande,cir restitution is limited to amounts directly caused by the conduct composing the offense of conviction,or those amounts that defendant expressly agree s to pursuant to the plea agreement.quoting silkowski,at united states maturin,cir united states broughton jones,cir united states schrimsher,cir united states soderling,cir.the government is thus incorrect when it asserts that u nder either the mvra or the vwpa,the restitution award can encompass only actual losses that resulted from the offense of conviction.gov t br.at citing hughey,at.united states zakhary,cir feldman,at united states badaracco,cir.importantly,all of the cases the government cites to support its position are cases where the court ordered restitution in the absence of an agreement by the parties see hughey,at.zakhary,at feldman,at badaracco,at.accordingly,because the sentencing court ordered restitution pursuant to singh express agreement,the government argument is based on inapposite law.
third,to the extent that the restitution order reflects the sentencing court determination of actual loss,nijhawan and our precedent make clear that immigration courts are not bound to accept this determination at face value.under nijhawan,a restitution order must be assessed in the context of conflicting evidence.at.since the petitioner in nijhawan did not point to any conflicting evidence,the court ruled that a restitution order for million coupled with the defendant stipulation that his offense caused more than million in loss was sufficient to meet the government burden.id.at.consistent with nijhawan,we have taken the position that a restitution order may be helpful to the loss inquiry,but is not definitive.munroe ashcroft,cir.in munroe,the sentencing court issued an amended restitution order of in a thinly veiled attempt to alter the effect of the conviction for immigration purposes.id.at.because we found it abundantly clear from the record,the indictment,guilty plea,and initial restitution order that the defendant offense caused a loss exceeding,we refused to let the amended restitution order be controlling.id.as with munroe,the circumstances here which we discuss below make it abundantly clear that the restitution in the court amended judgment does not reflect the actual loss resulting from singh offense.in other words,there is sufficient conflicting evidence to justify looking past the restitution order.
despite nijhawan and munroe,the government contends that singh is collaterally estopped from challenging the validity of the order.the government bases this argument on the fifth circuit decision in patel mukasey,cir.patel,however,was decided before nijhawan,and its current viability appears tenuous to us.in nijhawan,the court stated that petitioners,including those challenging restitution orders,have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss,the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing itself.at.further,the nijhawan court sided with the government,not because the petitioner was estopped from challenging his restitution order,but because he failed to point to sufficient evidence to cast doubt upon it.see id.unlike the petitioner in nijhawan,the petitioner here has pointed to undisputed facts in the sentencing material that undermine the restitution order reliability as a measure of actual loss we will now discuss this evidence.
specific offense circumstances 
at the time singh committed his offense of conviction,knowingly making a false statement in relation to raeback bankruptcy petition,the money that he failed to disclose was in the custody of the port authority and beyond his control.while singh may have subjectively believed his criminal act would enable him to obtain this money,in reality this was just as impossible as the failed attempt in onyido,where the bia accepted that the loss was only intended,not actual.see.in onyido,the dhs sought to remove the petitioner based on his conviction for filing a false claim with the intent to defraud an insurance company.id.at.onyido was convicted for signing paperwork to process a fraudulent claim in the presence of people he believed were insurance agents,but were in fact undercover officers.id.although the facts are somewhat more complicated here,we find them to be functionally equivalent to onyido.for starters,both cases involve situations where,at the moment the crime was consummated,a government sting operation made any intended benefit impossible.since the port authority had custody of the funds,basic principles of property law precluded singh from having any capacity to use this money for his benefit the fact that singh agreed to have this money transferred to the trustee as restitution was thus only a formality one in which he had nothing to lose,but potentially much to gain 
the impossibility of singh intended outcome does not end our inquiry,however,because it is obviously possible that singh offense could have still caused actual losses.it is conceivable,for example,that singh offense could have produced incidental losses for the bankruptcy trustee by forcing him to spend additional money and time accessing the.the record,however,does not demonstrate any such loss.indeed,as the attorney conceded in the sentencing memorandum,the trustee did not expend any substantial additional resources as a result of the defendant fraud.app at.thus,under the metric that federal courts of appeals have used for determining if bankruptcy trustees have suffered pecuniary harm,holthaus,at lowell,at paradis,at,the trustee in this case suffered no identifiable loss.
it is also conceivable that singh offense may have resulted in actual losses for the creditors.had the port authority,for example,not learned of singh bankruptcy proceedings,the trustee may never have learned about the,and,consequently,the creditors could have had a smaller estate from which to recover on their claims.again,however,the record shows that this potential loss did not actually occur,since the port authority transferred the funds to the trustee prior to the distribution of raeback assets.as noted in the attorney sentencing memorandum,the bankruptcy trustee will receive the funds which the defendant attempted to secrete,and thus,the defendant crime will not affect the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.app.at emphases added.
although singh offense did not deprive the creditors of assets,the government argues that singh offense caused an actual loss by depriving the trustee.to support this argument,the government contrasts this case with the intended loss at issue in pierre,where the petitioner was convicted of bank fraud for submitting fraudulent documents to obtain a loan from a bank.at.as the government notes,the bank in pierre detected the fraud before loaning any money,and was thus never deprived of any property for any period of time.by contrast,the government argues that singh offense deprived the trustee of from raeback estate what the government omits,however,is that the trustee,unlike the bank in pierre,was not a party that stood to lose from the deprivation itself as compared to the incidental effects thereof.instead,the only people who stood to lose were raeback creditors,and thus the deprivation should be assessed against them,not the trustee.accordingly,because the creditors were not deprived of any property for any length of time,the fact that the trustee was temporarily unable to access all of raeback assets does not constitute an actual loss to an actual victim.
while the government is correct that the creditors may have suffered a loss if singh was never caught,the same is equally true for the potential victim in pierre.indeed,the government argument that singh should not benefit from the fortuitous fact that he was caught before his creditors were harmed overlooks the reality that such fortuitous facts are inherent to all intended loss.while an intended loss may itself provide grounds for removal we are bound here to follow the statutory language of subparagraph m i,which requires actual loss.
finally,we wish to make clear that our conclusion does not mean,as the government contends,that an alien defendant can avoid a finding of actual loss for removal purposes simply by paying restitution after getting caught.indeed,we agree with the government that payment of restitution should not,and does not,negate a loss that actually occurred.our holding here is a narrow one,involving an offense that at no point resulted in an actual loss to any victim for any length of time.to highlight the narrowness of this rule,consider the result in a situation like pierre had the bank not detected the fraud.if a bank gives a person a loan under false pretenses,then no matter how soon afterwards it detects the fraud,whether one minute or one year,an actual loss results because the person obtains possession of the loan at the direct deprivation of the bank.it does matter how fleetingly the person obtains control.if the person offense deprives the defrauded party of property,an actual loss occurs to an actual victim under subparagraph m i.
contrary to the government suggestion at oral argument,therefore,nothing in this opinion will change the result in nijhawan and other cases where restitution was paid after the petitioner offense caused an actua
