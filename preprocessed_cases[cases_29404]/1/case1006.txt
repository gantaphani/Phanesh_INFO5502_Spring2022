statutory language is important.it takes on added significance when a person freedom is at stake.under the immigration and nationality act,immigration officials shall take into custody any deportable alien who has committed various crimes when the alien is released from detention for those crimes.c.the act requires officials to hold such aliens without any possibility of release while awaiting their removal proceedings.id.c.the scheme is known as mandatory detention.
this case presents a straightforward question do immigration officials lose authority to impose mandatory detention if they fail to do so when the alien is released the answer turns on the interplay between several provisions of the act.we conclude that dilatory officials do not lose authority,and so we will reverse the district court decision to the contrary.
michel sylvain is a citizen of haiti.he entered the united states as a legal permanent resident in.since then,sylvain has had multiple with the law.in total,he has been convicted of over ten crimes indeed,he once served a prison sentence for making and selling cocaine,and he spent a week in jail for possessing drugs as recently as.he also has been convicted for unlawfully possessing a weapon and for criminal mischief.suffice it to say,sylvain has not been a model noncitizen while living in the united states.
most recently,sylvain was arrested in for possessing drugs.he pled guilty and received a conditional discharge.under new york law,a conditional discharge does not require imprisonment or probation.penal law.a person who receives a conditional discharge generally must perform community service although no direct supervision is necessary.see id.noting that defendants subject to a conditional discharge must meet such conditions as the court may determine.this means that sylvain did not see the inside of a jail cell for nearly a decade.
sylvain luck ran out two years ago.officials from immigration and customs enforcement arrested him on april.they concluded that he was deportable under the immigration and nationality act because he had committed various deportable particular,he was an aggravated felon with a history of drug crimes.see a a iii,a b i.the officials further concluded that he was subject to mandatory detention under c and held him without a bond hearing.they reached this conclusion even though sylvain was last in custody on drug charges in,nearly four years before his arrest in 
one month after his arrest,sylvain petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of new jersey.sylvain did not challenge his removability.rather,he argued that mandatory detention did not apply to him.in his view,the phrase when released in c means that immigration officials must detain aliens at the moment of their release from prior custody.if the officials delay as they did in his case mandatory detention does not apply.he thus argued that he was eligible for a bond hearing.the district court agreed and granted his petition on june.sylvain received a hearing,paid bond,and is no longer in custody.the parties tell us that his next removal hearing is on july.
the government appealed.it argues that mandatory detention does not require immediate detention.as a result,the officials retained authority to impose mandatory detention despite their delay.for his part,sylvain continues to argue that officials must act immediately.he also argues for the first time on appeal that the conditional discharge following his conviction was not a release within the meaning of the statute.c the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who has committed various crimes when the alien is released.emphasis added.
congress created mandatory detention less than twenty years ago.under the original text of the immigration and naturalization act,all deportable aliens were eligible for a bond hearing.see patel zemski,cir,abrogated by demore kim,d.as time passed and crime rates soared,congress began making it more difficult for aliens to receive a bond hearing.id.this culminated in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,the act establishes a general rule that allows bond hearings for most aliens and an exception for some criminals the former in subsection a,the latter in subsection c 
a arrest,detention,and release 
on a warrant issued by the attorney general,an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the united states.except as provided in subsection c of this section and pending such decision,the attorney general 
may continue to detain the arrested alien and 
may release the alien on 
a bond of at least with security approved by,and containing conditions prescribed by,the attorney general or 
b conditional parole 
c detention of criminal aliens 
the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who 
a is inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense covered in section a of this title,
b is deportable by reason of having committed any offense covered in section a a ii,a iii,b,c,or d of this title,
c is deportable under section a a i of this title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been sentence sic to a term of imprisonment of at least year,or 
d is inadmissible under section a b of this title or deportable under section a b of this title,
when the alien is released,without regard to whether the alien is released on parole,supervised release,or probation,and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.
the attorney general may release an alien described in paragraph only if a narrow exception applies,and the alien satisfies the attorney general that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding 
subsection a applies to most deportable aliens.it allows immigration officials to detain an alien pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the united states.id.a on a warrant issued by the attorney general,an alien may be arrested and detained.such aliens are eligible for a bond hearing.id.and they are free to leave detention if an officer decides that they do not pose a danger to society and likely will attend a future removal proceeding.see c.but they are not eligible for a bond hearing if subsection c applies in such instances,the detention is mandatory.see a except as provided in subsection c.
subsection c imposes mandatory detention on a narrow class of criminal aliens.the first paragraph requires officials to detain aliens who have committed one of the crimes listed in subparagraphs a through d.these crimes include human trafficking,drug trafficking,crimes of moral turpitude,drug conspiracies,prostitution,firearm offenses,treason,espionage,and the like.id.c a d citing offenses listed in,the second paragraph then mandates that officials hold such aliens without a bond hearing unless a narrow exception applies.that exception does not apply to sylvain.
in recent years,the executive branch has concentrated its resources on criminal aliens especially those subject to mandatory detention.the director of immigration and customs enforcement stated in a memorandum that the agency first priority was a liens who pose a risk to public safety.memorandum from john morton,immigration customs enforcement,on civil immigration enforcement priorities for the apprehension,detention,and removal of aliens,http.this includes aliens convicted of crimes,with a particular emphasis on violent criminals,felons,and repeat offenders.id.at.the memorandum instructed those within the agency to use detention resources for aliens subject to mandatory detention by law.id.at.one month after the director issued this document,immigration officials arrested sylvain and imposed mandatory detention.against this backdrop,we turn to the issues.
as always,we must review the basis for jurisdiction.bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.citation and quotation marks omitted.the district court had jurisdiction to grant sylvain habeas petition under a.in turn,we have jurisdiction to consider the government appeal under.
nothing in e prevents us from deciding whether the immigration officials had statutory authority to impose mandatory detention for one thing,whether the officials had authority is not a discretionary judgment.e.and if the officials lacked authority,they could not act under.see singh holder,cir section e does not limit habeas jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law.al siddiqi achim,cir t his section does not deprive us of our authority to review statutory and constitutional challenges.kim,at concluding that it had jurisdiction to consider a constitutional challenge to the statutory framework.
we turn next to the question presented do immigration officials lose their authority to impose mandatory detention if they fail to act when the alien is released from state or federal custody for reasons that we will explain,the answer is no.
chevron deference lurks in the background of this case.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.that doctrine requires us to defer to an agency reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes.the supreme court has explained that the board of immigration appeals must receive deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.ins aguirre aguirre,d quoting ins cardoza fonseca,d see also negusie holder,d noting that the board interpretation of the immigration and nationality act generally must receive deference chen ashcroft,cir.
over a decade ago,the board of immigration appeals concluded that mandatory detention does not require immediate detention.in re rojas.to reach that conclusion,the board examined the phrase an alien described in paragraph from paragraph of the statute.id.at discussing c.the title of the paragraph is r elease,but that title is something of a all,paragraph is the portion of the statute that authorizes mandatory detention.the board stated that the literal language of the paragraph does not unambiguously tell us whether it encompasses the when the alien is released clause in paragraph or merely references the four categories of aliens described in subparagraphs a through d.id.after a lengthy discussion,it held that the phrase does not encompass the when released clause.id.at.this would mean that officials retain authority to impose mandatory detention even if they fail to act when the alien is released.
the government agrees that the statute is ambiguous.in its view,we must defer to the board interpretation.the government has pressed this argument in district courts across the country sometimes with success often without only one other circuit has considered the issue.hosh lucero,cir in that case,the fourth circuit agreed that the statute is ambiguous.the court focused on the word when,noting that it might mean immediately,or it might mean sometime thereafter.id.at w hen in c can be read,on one hand,to refer to action or activity occurring at the time that or as soon as other action has ceased or begun.on the other hand,when can also be read to mean the temporally broader at or during the time that,while,or at any or every time that.citations and internal quotation marks omitted under the former reading,the alien was not detained when released from state custody.under the latter reading,he might have been.in light of this ambiguity,the fourth circuit deferred to the board 
we need not take a stand on this issue.even if the statute calls for detention when the alien is released,and even if when implies something less than four years,nothing in the statute suggests that immigration officials lose authority if they delay.the alleged ambiguity does not determine the outcome of this case,so we need not decide whether chevron emerges from the background.
we reach this conclusion for a number of reasons.first and foremost is the text the government authority to impose mandatory detention does not depend on its compliance with the when released deadline.the text states that immigration officials shall take into custody any alien who has committed various crimes when the alien is released.c.the text does not explicitly remove that authority if an alien has already left custody.we are loath to interpret a deadline as a bar on authority after the time has passed even when the word shall appears in the text.see cyberworld enter.tech.napolitano,cir.
this principle of statutory interpretation descends from a long line of supreme court precedents.see,barnhart peabody coal,d united states nashville,c.in these cases,the court has explained that a statute directing official action needs more than a mandatory shall before the grant of power can sensibly be read to expire when the job is supposed to be done.barnhart,at.in other words,a provision that the government shall act within a specified time,without more,is not a jurisdictional limit precluding action later.id.at,concluding that a provision stating that the government shall make certain assignments by october,did not eliminate the government authority to make assignments after that date.
bureaucratic inaction whether the result of inertia,oversight,or not rob the public of statutory benefits.the tenth circuit has called this the principle.united states dolan,cir,aff sub nom.dolan united states,d.congress imposes deadlines on other branches of government to prod them into ensuring the timely completion of their statutory obligations to the public,not to allow those branches the chance to avoid their obligations just by dragging their feet.id.the court noted that i t would be a strange thing indeed if a bureaucracy or court could avoid a congressional mandate by unlawful delay.id.
we recently applied this principle in the immigration context.see cyberworld,at.in that case,we concluded that the government did not lose authority to fine a company for alleged violations of the immigration and nationality act simply because the government had failed to act within a deadline.id.at brock pierce,d holding that the secretary of labor did not lose authority to recover funds despite his failure to comply with the requirement that he shall act within days dolan.at the fact that a sentencing court misses the mandatory victims restitution act day deadline does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution.
the closest analog to the present dispute is a case from two decades ago.united states montalvo murillo,d.there,the supreme court interpreted the bail reform act of.this act allows the government to detain defendants leading up to their trial if they pose a risk of fleeing or a danger to others.id.e f.importantly,before the government can detain anyone under the act,a judicial officer shall hold a bond hearing immediately upon the person first appearance before the officer to assess the person flight risk and danger.id.f.guadelupe montalvo murillo did not receive a hearing upon his first appearance he instead received one a few days later.he argued that the delay stripped the government of authority to detain him under the act.the supreme court rejected this argument 
we hold that a failure to comply with the first appearance requirement does not defeat the government authority to seek detention of the person charged there is no presumption or general rule that for every duty imposed upon the court or the government and its prosecutors there must exist some corollary punitive sanction for departures or omissions,even if negligent.in our view,construction of the act must conform to the great principle of public policy,applicable to all governments alike,which forbids that the public interests should be prejudiced by the negligence of the officers or agents to whose care they are confided.
montalvo murillo,at citations and quotation marks omitted.
the same is true of mandatory detention.like the bail reform act,the statute allows the government to detain a person in the days leading up to a legal proceeding.both statutes have two prerequisites one that focuses on timing,the other on the person in custody.under the bail reform act
