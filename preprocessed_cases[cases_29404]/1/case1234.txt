the widow of a deceased coal miner returns to this court to appeal the benefits review board third denial of her claim for survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act blba.she claims that the alj did not properly weigh the lay and medical evidence on remand following our earlier decision,soubik office of workers compensation programs,wl cir.june,soubik i,and that the board should not have affirmed the alj decision.for the reasons that follow,we will once again reverse and remand.
after mining and hauling coal for nearly years,michael soubik filed a claim under the blba in august.the claim stated that soubik could no longer work because he was and had difficulty climbing stairs.the office of workers compensation programs owcp denied his claim in july.he requested a hearing in after being notified that the denial of benefits had been reaffirmed,and a hearing was held before an alj in.he died shortly after the hearing.jere wagner,one of his treating physicians,signed a death certificate that listed acute myocardial infarction as the cause of death.in,an alj again denied his application for benefits.although the owcp had stipulated that soubik suffered from coal miners pneumoconiosis the alj concluded that the pneumoconiosis had neither substantially contributed to,nor hastened,soubik death as required for blba benefits.the brb affirmed in.
in,while her husband claim was still being litigated,cecilia soubik filed her claim for survivor benefits under the blba.the owcp administratively denied her claim on february,and soubik requested a hearing before an alj three days later.the claim was then referred to another alj,who found that the only remaining question was whether pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to,or hastened,her husband death.however,this alj concluded that he was bound by the original alj determination that pneumoconiosis did not hasten soubik death.accordingly,the second alj denied soubik claim for survivor benefits.
in december,soubik appealed to the brb.it affirmed the alj decision denying her benefits in march,and denied her motion to reconsider its decision in october soubik then submitted a request for modification of the brb decision to owcp which denied it in april.
over five years later in,owcp granted soubik request for another hearing before an alj.that july,an alj denied soubik claim.soubik appealed to the brb,but it denied her appeal on july.she then filed a petition for review in this court.we reversed the brb affirmance of the alj decision in soubik i and remanded the case back to the brb.
two years later,in june,the brb remanded the case to an alj for proceedings consistent with soubik i.that alj again denied soubik benefits.the brb affirmed and this petition for review followed.
evidence before the third alj in 
the third alj had before him the medical opinions of three doctors as well as the lay opinions of soubik friends and family.this evidence is summarized below.
medical opinions 
karlavage,who was in family practice and dedicated about percent of his practice to treating coal miners and former coal miners for pulmonary problems,treated soubik from october until his death in april.during that period,soubik had three office visits.in his deposition,karlavage stated that he was aware of soubik three pulmonary function tests pfts.he stated that the pft was abnormal,the pft was normal,and the pft was essentially normal because it had some normal readings although one reading was consistent with obstructive lung disease at percent.karlavage also stated in his deposition that an from indicated anthracosilicosis and one from indicated pneumoconiosis uncomplicated.
based on his examinations of soubik,his review of soubik medical and occupational history,and the medical tests he ran,karlavage concluded that soubik had lung disease best described as pneumoconiosis and i think did have coronary artery disease.he concluded that the pneumoconiosis was caused by soubik exposure over a several decade period to silica,rock,and coal dusts.he reconciled the variable results from the three pfts with his conclusion that soubik death was substantially related to his pneumoconiosis,stating that soubik 
has a chest that does indicate pneumoconiosis.his physical examination revealed,in my opinion,some lung disease.there is variability among pulmonary function tests that certainly does occur p ulmonary function tests can and do change from month to month and from year to year.so,he was apparently breathing a little bit better more recently.
he also noted a contrary negative reading of one of the chest indicating that soubik did not have pneumoconiosis.however,he explained that result by noting the obvious discrepancies in the doctor report who read the chest as normal.that doctor also claimed that the results of a pft that was taken at the same time as this were abnormal.karlavage also discounted the significance of the normal pft in because the doctor who conducted that test did not account for the medication soubik was taking and the effect it would have had on the pft.
in february,karlavage wrote a letter to soubik attorney.it stated in relevant part 
during that time in which i took care of soubik,i had the opportunity to review a positive chest and an abnormal pulmonary function test.as you are aware,soubik expired when he was years old at the shamokin hospital.the patient death certificate indicates arteriosclerotic heart disease but on further inquiry,the family has discovered directly from the attending physician,that coal worker pneumoconiosis was involved in his death.sic 
in conclusion,it is my opinion,as it was before,that the patient death was substantially incurred due to coal worker pneumoconiosis.indeed,he had arteriosclerotic heart disease and nerve block,but there is no doubt in my mind that coal worker pneumoconiosis weakened him,worsened his condition,and speeded his death.
wagner treated soubik for his heart condition from may until soubik death,and signed soubik death certificate soubik death certificate listed his cause of death as acute myocardial infarction with complete heart block and included cardiogenic shock under other significant conditions.wagner was unaware that soubik had also been treated by karlavage when he signed the certificate.nine years after soubik died,wagner wrote a letter in response to an inquiry from soubik.the letter stated that,after reviewing karlavage medical records including pulmonary function studies and findings,wagner concluded that soubik pulmonary impairment secondary to his pneumoconiosis could have contributed to the miner cardiac condition and subsequent death.
the owcp had spagnolo,who was in internal medicine and pulmonary diseases,review soubik medical history.that history included the pfts from,and two blood gas tests and two chest readings.based on his review of soubik history,spagnolo concluded that pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing factor to soubik death,and that there was no reasonable evidence that the miner death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis.
spagnolo gave no weight to karlavage medical opinion to the contrary because spagnolo believed that karlavage had not adequately explained the normal results of the pulmonary function tests from and he also gave no weight to wagner opinion because it was based on karlavage records and also failed to explain the normal pulmonary function test results.
spagnolo concluded that 
the medical record in my opinion provides little evidence for the presence of a pneumoconiosis.in fact,the only report indicates no evidence of coal workers pneumoconiosis.nevertheless,assuming that a pneumoconiosis was present in soubik,his lung function in and again in march shortly before his death was normal.the normal arterial blood gas results in provide further support for the conclusion that soubik had normal lung function.thus,this medical record does not provide reliable evidence of a clinically significant impairment of lung function or evidence of progression of any lung problem at the time of his death.therefore,even if soubik had a pneumoconiosis,it did not result in a clinically significant impairment of his heart or lung.
in summary,soubik death was not caused by a pneumoconiosis.a pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing factor leading to his death and there is no reasonable evidence including a well reasoned medical opinion that his death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis.
lay evidence 
there were lay opinions in the record from soubik himself as well as soubik walter koshinskie,their neighbor and soubik john soubik,the soubiks son frank alberts,soubik and adeline cecilia dilliplane,the soubiks daughter.
soubik testified that he had suffered difficulty breathing and shortness of breath for the last years and as the years progress,it is getting more and more.he stated that if he walked a city block he would have to stop that if he had to walk up or down steps,he had to stop several times and that he coughed up black mucus at night.he also testified that he took brondicon for his breathing and nitroglycerin for his heart.he retired completely in due to his breathing problems,had a heart attack in,and never smoked.
soubik testified during the hearing on her survivor claim.she also stated that her husband took brondicon for his black lung problem.she stated that it sort of loosened up his phlegm so that he had to spit up.she also testified that he took medication for his heart after having a heart attack in,shortly before his death.the day he died,he became short of breath and was taken to the hospital where he was put in an oxygen tent.he stayed in the tent until he died.
she also testified during the hearing that she personally observed her husband breathing difficulty for a long period of time before his death.even after he retired from work and started receiving social security disability benefits,he would breathe heavily and spit up blood and mucus every day.the problem was particularly pronounced in the evening.she also saw that,just before his death,he could barely walk and was very weak 
walter koshinskie 
koshinskie testified at the hearing that he had known soubik for forty years soubik had hauled coal for him,and their homes were close to each other on the same street.he noticed that soubik health was slipping because soubik could not walk well or walk up stairs because it would take his wind.the day that soubik died,koshinskie noticed that he was winded from walking outside.
john soubik 
john soubik testified at the hearing that every time he came home to visit his parents,he could see his father condition had deteriorated.he observed that his father had considerably slowed down,and heard him make gasps for air and have a trying to catch his breath feeling.he also saw his father raise his chest like he was trying to get air,and hold on to the bannister a lot going down the stairs.john soubik also took his father to the hospital where he was hooked up to that breathing apparatus.
frank alberts 
alberts testified at the hearing that he had known soubik,his,for about years at the time of soubik death in.alberts had worked with him for about a decade starting in the.he could see soubik gradually slowing down over a period of years and could see his breathing was getting slower and he have to fight for his breath starting in about or.he saw soubik have trouble catching his breath pretty regular.periodically,he saw him coughing or spitting when they would visit.he noticed that soubik had trouble going up the steps in his house as he got older.
adeline cecilia dilliplane 
dilliplane had known soubik since when her son married the soubiks daughter.she stated that soubik had trouble helping her son build a house.h e would do some things and then he would stop because he start wheezing.he start coughing.she said that she thought he had breathing problems comparable to hers,and she had serious problems with asthma.over time,they saw each other less often but regularly.during visits she would hear him wheeze and knew he was having a bad breathing problem.
b.the alj decision 
the alj decision denying benefits was based on spagnolo opinion.the alj discounted wagner opinion as too vague,and he discounted karlavage opinion because it was based on the report of the miner relatives that pneumoconiosis was involved in the miner death as wagner had conveyed to them.the alj noted that soubik and the miner sons and had testified that soubik had become short of breath over time,but he did not discuss that evidence.
in soubik i,we reversed the brb decision affirming the alj denial of benefits,and we remanded for further consideration of the lay evidence.we agreed with the alj that the only dispute was causation.accordingly,soubik had to establish that soubik death was due to pneumoconiosis,that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to her husband death or that his death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis under c we also concluded that soubik could prove her claim using medical evidence alone,evidence alone,or the combination of medical and evidence under hillibush dep t of labor,cir.hillibush explicitly held that lay testimony must be considered in a survivor case under.
in the case at hand,we held in soubik i that neither the alj nor the brb had given any consideration to the lay evidence offered in support of soubik claim,and this evidence could be enough to satisfy soubik burden of proof that pneumoconiosis hastened her husband death.we also noted that the alj and brb had relied heavily on the opinion of spagnolo,and that he had formed his opinion based on his review of soubik medical history rather than the opinions of soubik treating physicians,karlavage and wagner.
d.the alj decision on remand 
upon remand from soubik i,the alj summarized the lay testimony in the record.he found that the lay opinions did not clearly establish that soubik ongoing deterioration was due to pneumoconiosis or a pulmonary condition.he also discussed each of the three doctors opinions again,and reached the same conclusion,that spagnolo opinion was the most persuasive.
the alj again found that wagner opinion was equivocal and vague because he merely stated that the pneumoconiosis could have contributed to the miner death,as he had in.he also found that karlavage opinion was not well documented nor well reasoned because he did not discuss the basis for his conclusion that the miner was totally disabled from coal mine employment due to his lung disease given his own deposition testimony that the miner pulmonary function study results from studies taken in and were normal.he also stated that karlavage february,letter established that the doctor bases his conclusions regarding the cause of the miner death,in part,only on statements from the miner relatives.
the alj concluded that spagnolo opinion would outweigh the other doctors opinions even if they could establish that pneumoconiosis hastened soubik death because of spagnolo superior credentials and because wagner did not treat the miner for respiratory problems and karlavage only saw the miner on three office visits over a six month period.the alj believed that the lay testimony was also outweighed by the thorough and complete report of spagnolo.the alj described spagnolo as both a highly qualified pulmonary specialist as well as the beneficiary of a complete review of soubik medical records.the alj thus concluded that soubik did not establish pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing factor in her husband death or that it hastened his death,and he therefore denied survivor benefits.
ii.standard of review 
because the brb adopted the alj factual findings,we independently review the entire record to determine if the alj factual findings are rational,consistent with applicable law,and supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.see mancia director,owcp,cir citing kowalchick director,owcp,cir.substantial evidence has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.we exercise plenary review over the alj legal conclusions adopted by the brb.see also carozza steel,cir.
iii.discussion 
soubik argues that the alj did not follow soubik i on remand because he failed to properly weigh the lay evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole.she also argues that the alj did not properly consider the opinions of karlavage and wagner.finally,assuming we find these arguments meritorious,she requests that we grant her blba benefits rather than remanding and reversing.
weighing the lay evidence 
the alj did consider the lay evidence on remand per our instructions in soubik his opinion summarized what each layperson said and analyzed its probative value.the alj noted that each of the lay witnesses established that soubik was having trouble breathing,noticed that soubik had increased trouble with his breathing over time,and observed his frequent coughing and spitting up mucus blood.he then explained his rationale for rejecting the lay evidence.according to the alj,the lay evidence that soubik had breathing trouble did not establish that pneumoconiosis was responsible for,or a contributing factor to,soubik breathing impairment.the alj concluded that spagnolo opinion regarding the cause of soubik breathing problems was more persuasive than these lay opinions.
weighing the medical evidence 
although the lay evidence alone did not offer an etiology of soubik breathing troubles the alj improperly minimized its significance in weighing spagnolo opinion and karlavage contrary opinion.soubik argues that this was error because spagnolo conclusion that no pneumoconiosis was present contradicted the parties stipulation to the contrary.she also argues that the alj erred in discounting karlavage opinion and that he misunderstood the basis of that opinion 
in soubik i we noted that the alj relied heavily on spagnolo opinion,and that opinion was based solely on a review of soubik medical history.spagnolo never saw soubik.we thus raised the alj reliance on spagnolo opinion as an issue,but did not definitively state that the alj had incorrectly relied on it.accordingly,there is no law of the case regarding the doctors opinions.
the court of appeals for the fourth circuit has held that an alj may not credit a medical opinion stating that a claimant did not suffer from pneumoconiosis causing respiratory disability after the alj had already accepted the presence of pneumoconiosis unless the alj stated specific and persuasive reasons why he or she relied upon such an opinion.scott mason coal,cir internal citation omitted.like the medical opinion in scott,spagnolo expert opinion states that soubik did not have pneumoconiosis despite the parties agreement that he did.spagnolo opinion can be distinguished from the opinion in scott because he stated that even if soubik had pneumoconiosis,there is still no evidence that it contributed to his death.however,that superficial hypothetical does not reconcile his opinion with the stipulation that pneumoconiosis was present.common sense suggests that it is usually exceedingly difficult for a doctor to properly assess the contribution,if any,of pneumoconiosis to a miner death if does not believe it was present.the alj did not explain why spagnolo opinion was entitled to such controlling weight despite spagnolo conclusion that soubik did not have the disease that both parties agreed was present.
moreover,on remand,the alj obviously misunderstood how karlavage arrived at his opinion and this contributed to his improper discounting of karlavage conclusion.the alj cited part of karlavage letter to soubik counsel,which stated the patient death certificate indicates arteriosclerotic heart disease but on further inquiry,the family has discovered directly from the attending physician,that coal worker pneumoconiosis was involved in his death.the alj then concludes that,since karlavage based his opinion that pneumoconiosis contributed to soubik death on information from soubik family,karlavage opinion was not nor.
that conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence.in fact,it is flatly contradicted by karlavage deposition,which was part of the record from soubik earlier hearings before other aljs.the deposition details karlavage examination and analysis of three pfts,the same two chest that spagnolo relied on,and his own personal observations of the patient.based on this information,karlavage opined in that soubik pneumoconiosis advanced his death.the language in wagner letter,written nine years after he issued his initial opinion regarding the factors contributing to soubik death,indicates only that wagner later amended his opinion to say that pneumoconiosis could have contributed to soubik death after he reviewed karlavage records and opinion.karlavage opinion was based on much more than just the family opinion that pneumoconiosis hastened soubik death.it was therefore irrational for the alj to discount karlavage opinion merely because it refers to wagner letter.
it was also improper for the alj to assume that karlavage consideration of information from soubik family and others who had observed him regularly was a failing.the alj did not explain that assumption.he stated only that the lay evidence standing alone does not provide support for the theory that pneumoconiosis hastened or caused soubik death.he does not explain why he assumed that karlavage opinion would be worth less than spagnolo because karlavage took such information into account when forming his opinion.indeed,it seems that karlavage opinion would be stronger because it factored in the lay observations of those who knew soubik 
the alj also failed to give karlavage opinion the additional deference it was due as the opinion of a treating physician.the alj stated that he did not credit karlavage opinion as that of a treating physician because karlavage had only seen soubik three times over six months.that was,of course,three more times and six months more than spagnolo saw him.so easily minimizing a treating physician opinion in favor of a physician who has never laid eyes on the patient is not only indefensible on this record,it suggests an inappropriate predisposition to deny benefits.it is in this circuit that treating physicians opinions are assumed to be more valuable than those of physicians.mancia director,owcp,cir.the alj nevertheless ignored karlavage clinical expertise an expertise derived from many years of diagnosing and treating coal miners pulmonary problems.the alj did so without making any effort to explain why spagnolo board certification in pulmonary medicine was a more compelling credential than karlavage many years of hands on clinical training.
directing blba benefits 
we turn to the final issue that soubik raises.she asks us to remand this case to the brb solely to direct entry of an award of benefits based on the inordinate delay in properly adjudicating her claim.she argues that allowing her claim to drag on any longer would be unfair and inappropriate because she would certainly be granted compensation upon remand 
we agree that this litigation has been unnecessarily protracted.we have previously expressed our frustration over the inefficiency and delay that is all too often part of the black lung administrative process.we have done so in a case where a claimant had been litigating her claim for benefits for seven years,ten fewer years than soubik.mancia,at internal citation omitted.in mancia,we quoted our decision in lango director,owcp,cir in noting that we had previously expressed our concern over the dismaying inefficiency of the black lung administrative process.at quoting lango,at.the delay in lango was years,again substantially shorter than the delay that soubik was made to endure.we there gave several examples of inordinate delay ranging from ten years to as many as seventeen and even nineteen years we then stated,h opefully,the publication of our concern will come to the attention of authorities who can do something about it.lango,at.we made that statement in.yet,even after that admonition,it took the brb two years to remand this matter to the alj following our remand to the brb.we therefore have little reason to think that the delays that attend black lung litigation have been mitigated or even addressed by the administrative agencies involved.given our continuing concern,we ta
