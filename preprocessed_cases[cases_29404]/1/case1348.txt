as recounted in our prior opinion in these black lung benefits act proceedings,see sharpe,owcp,cir sharpe i,coal miner william sharpe was awarded total disability benefits in,and received those benefits until he died in.a week after sharpe death,his widow,mae ann sharpe,made a claim for survivor benefits.within two months of sharpe claim being filed and nearly seven years after sharpe living miner claim was approved liable employer westmoreland coal company filed a modification request,by which it sought reconsideration of sharpe award of benefits the modification request.in,an administrative law judge alj agreed to modify the award,retroactively denying sharpe living miner claim and,thus,also rejecting sharpe survivor claim.then,in,the benefits review board the brb affirmed the alj decision.on sharpe petition for review,however,we vacated and remanded for further proceedings,explaining that the alj had failed to exercise the discretion accorded to him with respect to the modification request.see sharpe i,at.
on remand,the alj again denied sharpe living miner claim and sharpe survivor claim,but the brb reversed.accordingly,this matter is now before us on westmoreland petition for review,with sharpe and the director of the office of workers compensation programs being the designated respondents.as explained below,we deny westmoreland petition for review and thereby affirm the brb decision in sharpe favor.
the early history of the sharpes claims was outlined in our sharpe i opinion.see at.william sharpe worked for years in the coal mines of southern west virginia and western virginia,and was employed by westmoreland coal company for at least eight of those years.sharpe last worked for westmoreland as a manager in and around underground coal mines,and he retired in.sharpe had previously worked in various mining operations as a general superintendent,a foreman,a section foreman,a rock driller,and a coal loader.in march,sharpe filed his claim for benefits,maintaining that he suffered from black lung disease,or pneumoconiosis.see a providing that,i n the case of total disability of a miner due to pneumoconiosis,the disabled miner shall be paid benefits.an alj denied sharpe living miner claim in,but the brb subsequently vacated the alj finding that sharpe did not suffer from complicated pneumoconiosis.see,westmoreland coal cox,cir recognizing that condition described in c is known as statutory complicated pneumoconiosis and entitles claimant to irrebuttable presumption of total disability.the living miner claim was then remanded to a different alj,who,by decision of august,the alj decision,found that sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis and awarded him benefits retroactive to the initial filing of his living miner claim in.
westmoreland appealed the alj decision to the brb,which affirmed the benefits award on september.significantly,westmoreland failed to pursue its statutory right to seek judicial review of the brb affirmance of the alj decision.see c allowing that a ny person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board may obtain a review of that order in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred sharpe thus received total disability benefits from until his death on april.
after her husband died,mae ann sharpe promptly filed,on april,her claim for survivor benefits.see a providing that,i n the case of death of a miner due to pneumoconiosis,benefits shall be paid to his widow if any at the rate the deceased miner would receive such benefits if he were totally disabled on june,westmoreland filed its modification request,for the purpose of upsetting the award of benefits on sharpe living miner claim.see authorizing modification of a benefits award on grounds including a mistake in a determination of fact implementing with respect to black lung benefits according to westmoreland,the alj decision was premised on a mistake of fact,in that sharpe had never suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.on july,an alj denied the modification request and awarded benefits to sharpe on her survivor claim.westmoreland appealed to the brb,which,on august,vacated and remanded for further proceedings.
thereafter,by decision of april,the alj decision,the alj reversed himself and concluded that a mistake of fact had been made in the alj decision finding that sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.on that basis,the alj modified the alj decision by retroactively denying sharpe living miner claim,and consequently also denied sharpe survivor claim.the brb affirmed the alj decision by its decision of june,the brb decision,likewise assuming that westmoreland had a right to modification of the award upon simply establishing a mistake of fact.
the sharpe i proceedings arose from sharpe petition for review of the brb decision,in which she contended,inter alia,that the brb had erroneously affirmed the alj decision modification of the alj decision.we,of course,agreed with sharpe.that is,we recognized that the modification of a black lung award or denial does not automatically flow from a mistake in an earlier determination of fact.sharpe i,at.rather,the adjudicator may,if he so chooses,modify the final order on the claim upon finding a mistake of fact.id.at quoting jessee,owcp,cir.in exercising that discretion,modification should be made only where doing so will render justice under the act.id.at quoting banks chi.grain trimmers ass n,d see also betty b coal,owcp,cir w e have no quarrel with encouraging aljs to exercise their discretion to reopen when doing this would promote justice and we would not hesitate to correct abuses of that discretion.applying those principles to the rulings on westmoreland request to modify the award of living miner benefits to sharpe,we explained that 
none of the administrative decisions rendered in connection with the modification request assessed all the factors relevant to an exercise of sound discretion.instead,they addressed only one whether a mistake of fact had been made in the alj decision.because the alj decision affirmed by the brb decision found that a mistake of fact had been made,the adjudicators were obliged to exercise their sound discretion,pursuant to a,by evaluating the modification request in light of whether reopening the case would render justice under the black lung benefits act.
sharpe i,at see also id.at concluding that the alj and the brb misapprehension of the applicable legal standard is,by definition,an abuse of discretion.
in remanding this matter,we instructed that a proper exercise of discretion should lead the adjudicators to assess,in addition to the need for accuracy,the diligence and motive of westmoreland in seeking modification,the possible futility of modification,and other factors that may bear on whether modification will render justice under the act.sharpe i,at see also id.at observing that finality interests may sometimes be relevant to a proper modification request ruling,though the principle of finality just does not apply to black lung claims as it does in ordinary lawsuits quoting jessee,at.for further guidance,we provided the following examples of potentially significant factual issues 
why did westmoreland wait to seek modification under a until june,two months after sharpe death,and nearly seven years after the brb had affirmed his living miner award a decision that westmoreland never appealed 
should westmoreland motive in seeking modification be deemed suspect 
was the modification request part and parcel of westmoreland defense to sharpe claim for survivor benefits,which had been filed less than two months earlier 
is the modification request futile or moot,in that no overpayments made to sharpe could be recovered 
is the modification request akin to a request for an advisory opinion,in that a favorable resolution thereof will have no impact on the living miner claim 
id.at.relevant to those issues,we observed that westmoreland is unable to seek recovery from sharpe for any overpayments made under sharpe living miner claim,and that the company is only entitled to seek recovery of any such overpayments from sharpe estate.id.at citing d we also acknowledged that,if westmoreland were to make a compelling showing that the issues should be resolved in its favor,such a showing would be entitled to appropriate consideration by the adjudicators.id.at 
on remand,the alj conducted a january,hearing,during which sharpe testified and sharpe last will and testament was entered into the record.premised on that evidence,the alj found in his subsequent decision of march,the alj decision,that sharpe estate has no assets from which westmoreland can recoup its payments on the living miner benefits award.see alj decision explaining that the sharpes had jointly owned all their property,that sharpe was the sole beneficiary of her husband life insurance policy,and that,although sharpe willed his possessions to his wife,there was nothing in the estate to pass to her through his will.
even so,the alj determined that westmoreland modification request was not futile,because reconsideration of the finding that sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis might be the only way in which westmoreland could protect itself from an automatic award of benefits on sharpe survivor claim.alj decision.the alj cited the irrebuttable presumption that a miner death was due to pneumoconiosis that attaches to a finding of complicated pneumoconiosis,see,as well as the possibility that sharpe could employ the doctrine of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel to foreclose relitigation of sharpe diagnosis,see collins pond creek mining,cir according preclusive effect in survivor claim to earlier finding of simple pneumoconiosis in living miner claim.in the alj view,there was no question that preclusion of the operation of nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel by modification of sharpe living miner award belies any contention that modification would be futile to westmoreland.alj decision.the alj emphasized that,even though our collins opinion the modification request,westmoreland was wise to anticipate a collateral estoppel application.id.summarizing his futility ruling,the alj declared that an employer objective to thwart a survivor claim or a potential survivor claim is sufficient basis for finding that modification of a miner claim is not a futile act,regardless of whether the employer could recoup the payment of benefits it made to the miner.id.at.
on the question of diligence,the alj observed that only westmoreland,and not or sharpe,was prejudiced or harmed by any lack of diligence on westmoreland part,in that westmoreland paid sharpe black lung benefits each month for seven years which also benefited sharpe.alj decision.additionally,the alj credited westmoreland assertion that its modification request was premised on new evidence uncovered during discovery efforts that were prompted by the filing of the survivor claim.id.at.in any event,the alj deemed it immaterial whether or not westmoreland could have discovered the new evidence prior to the miner death,in that a modification request can not be denied out of hand on the basis that the evidence may have been available at an earlier stage in the proceeding.id.emphasis omitted quoting old ben coal,owcp,cir.
addressing westmoreland motive for the modification request,the alj found that the company simply used the available legal means to attempt to protect and obtain justice for itself.alj decision.in short,the alj concluded,where a party action is not prohibited by law it should not be precluded simply because the party is motivated by.id.
the alj analysis pivoted on his belief that diligence,motive,futility,and other justice under the act factors are to be considered only as a potential bar to modification,and that modification should be barred only where the party seeking it has engaged in bad conduct.alj decision.the alj specified two type s of bad conduct that should disqualify an applicant from seeking modification refusal to participate in the prior administrative proceedings and attempting to overcome earlier litigation mistakes by retrying the case then found that neither of these two disqualifying circumstances is present in the instant case.id.citing mccord cephas,kinlaw stevens shipping terminal co,ben.bd.serv.mb,aff,cir unpublished table decision see also id.at acknowledging several additional circumstances which might disqualify a party from seeking modification,including serial modification requests submitted with no new evidence,and a modification request made without new evidence and after a long and unexplained delay.
absent what he characterized as disqualifying bad conduct,the alj considered himself constrained to grant westmoreland modification request if a mistake of fact was previously made.in the alj words,if the award of benefits was made erroneously,on what theory of justice should that award be permitted to stand indeed,to uphold the award,in the face of an erroneous finding that the miner had complicated pneumoconiosis,could result in the unjust enrichment of the miner wife.alj decision.thus turning to the accuracy of the alj decision,the alj stood by his determination in the alj decision that the evidence established only simple,rather than complicated,pneumoconiosis,and further failed to show that sharpe was totally disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment.see id.at.the alj therefore retroactively denied sharpe living miner claim,and also denied sharpe survivor claim.id.at 
in reversing the alj decision by its decision of june,the brb decision,the brb was mindful of its deferential scope of review,carefully explaining if the administrative law judge findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by substantial evidence,are rational,and are consistent with applicable law,they are binding upon this board and may not be disturbed.see brb decision citing b.the alj decision justice under the act analysis was unsustainable,according to the brb,because it was not consistent with applicable law,the alj did not address the diligence,motive and futility factors in the manner directed by this court sharpe i opinion.see id.at.
the brb interpreted sharpe i to hold that modification should be granted only when to do so would render justice in the claim to be reopened.brb decision emphasis added.with that understanding,the brb limited the futility question to whether westmoreland could recoup any overpayment of living miner benefits from sharpe estate the answer being an undisputed no.see id.at.thus,the brb deemed the alj futility analysis to be fundamentally flawed,in that he determined that it was in the interest of justice to grant modification of the decision in sharpe claim in order to preclude sharpe reliance on collateral estoppel in the survivor claim,a separate claim.id.
with respect to diligence,the brb did not directly confront the alj finding that westmoreland alone was prejudiced by the gap between the alj decision and the modification request.moreover,the brb did not question the premise,recited by the alj,that a modification request can not be denied out of hand on the basis that the evidence may have been available at an earlier stage in the proceeding.see alj decision emphasis omitted quoting old ben coal,at.the brb took issue,however,with the alj acceptance of westmoreland assertion that its modification request was premised on new evidence uncovered during discovery efforts that were prompted by the filing of the survivor claim.see id.specifically,the brb pointed out that westmoreland relied solely on old evidence when it filed its modification request,and only submitted its new evidence after the modification proceedings were already underway.see brb decision.
the brb concluded that the nature of the supporting evidence westmoreland initially proffered,along with t he timing of its modification request,proved what the company itself admitted that its motive in seeking to set aside the award of benefits in sharpe claim was to evade application of the irrebuttable presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis,as well as application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel,in sharpe survivor claim.see brb decision.the brb also indicated that,by finding that correcting an erroneous award of benefits trumped concerns about employer reasons for requesting modification,the alj had wrongly discounted the motive behind westmoreland modification request.see id.at.
taking account of motive,the brb observed that westmoreland was attempting to circumvent the law,which,in this case,prohibited employer from defending against the survivor claim by showing that the miner did not have complicated pneumoconiosis.brb decision.the brb then underscored that g ranting modification when the moving party motive is to circumvent the law does not render justice under the act.id.for support,the brb cited verderane jacksonville shipyards,cir disallowing modification under where employer sought to circumvent its earlier waiver of limited liability relief.the brb also invoked sharpe i,concluding that we therein explicitly condemned the motive to thwart claimant good faith claim for being adverse to the remedial purpose of the black lung benefits act.brb decision first alteration in original quoting sharpe i,at.that is,as we recognized in sharpe i,if the party purpose in filing a modification is to thwart a claimant good faith claim or an employer good faith defense,the remedial purpose of the statute is no longer served.at quoting old ben coal,at.
importantly,because there was nothing remarkably different about the new evidence that westmoreland eventually submitted,the brb reasoned that it was appropriate to consider the interest in finality.see brb decision citing sharpe i,at recognizing that finality interests may sometimes be relevant to a proper modification request ruling.the brb noted the absence of particularly reliable evidence,such as autopsy evidence,id.at,and concluded,given the circumstances,that it was proper to grant survivor benefits based on finding s made during the miner life,id.at.drawing on a seventh circuit opinion approving the use of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel in a survivor claim,the brb explained t here is no point in readjudicating the question whether a given miner had pneumoconiosis unless it is possible to adduce highly reliable evidence which as a practical matter means autopsy results.otherwise the possibility that the initial decision was incorrect is no reason to disturb it.id.quoting zeigler coal,owcp,cir.
having assessed futility,diligence,motive,and finality,the brb concluded that modification of sharpe living miner benefits award would not render justice.brb decision at.but the brb did not stop there rather,it proceeded to review and reject the alj ruling that the complicated pneumoconiosis finding was premised on a mistake of fact.see id.acknowledging significance of accuracy in modification proceedings.in so doing,the brb decided that the alj accuracy determination was neither rational nor supported by substantial evidence.id.rather,the alj decision was based on more of the same evidence considered in,and on a flawed analysis of the alj decision.id.at.
the brb final conclusion concerning the modification request was that the alj abused his discretion in holding that modification of the decision awarding benefits in sharpe claim was in the interest of justice.brb decision.according to the brb,the alj misapprehension of the applicable law led to a clear error of judgment on the conclusion he reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,the brb reversed the alj decision insofar as it granted modification,by retroactive denial,of sharpe living miner benefits award.id.the brb further concluded that offensive collateral estoppel precludes westmoreland from relitigating,in sharpe survivor claim,the issue of the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis,and that sharpe is entitled to the irrebuttable presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis set forth in.id.at.the brb thus recognized sharpe entitlement to benefits in the survivor claim and reversed the alj contrary ruling.id.at 
as we recognized in sharpe i,an alj possesses broad but not unlimited discretion in ruling on modification requests.see at such an exercise of discretion by an alj is not boundless and subject to automatic affirmance.quoting westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir.a modification ruling will be reversed if it was guided by erroneous legal principles,or if the adjudicator committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.quoting westberry,at.such standard is consistent with the brb general mandate to affirm the alj if his findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by substantial evidence,are rational,and are consistent with applicable law.see brb decision citing b.where the brb has reversed the alj,we must review the brb decision for errors of law and to ensure the brb decision adhered to its statutory standard of review.dehue coal ballard,cir.more generally,we review de novo the brb conclusions of law.collins pond creek mining,cir conducting de novo review of legal aspects of brb collateral estoppel ruling.
in assessing westmoreland petition for review of the brb decision,we begin with the modification request.consistent with the modification statute,the implementing regulation provides 
upon his or her own initiative,or upon the request of any party on grounds of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact,the deputy commissioner may,at any time before one year from the date of the last payment of benefits,or at any time before one year after the denial of a claim,reconsider the terms of an award or denial of benefits.
a see also specifying that a new compensation order may terminate,continue,reinstate,increase,or decrease compensation,or award compensation.to be sure,t he plain import of the provision is to vest a deputy commissioner with broad discretion to correct mistakes of fact,whether demonstrated by wholly new evidence,cumulative evidence,or merely further reflection on the evidence initially submitted.aerojet shipyards,d.significantly,however,due consideration must yet be given to whether modification would render justice under the black lung benefits act,whose stated purpose is 
to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.
a see old ben coal,owcp,cir a n alj administration of justice must be grounded in the stated purpose of the act dynamics,owcp,cir in deciding whether to reopen a case under,a court must balance the need to render justice against the need for finality in decision making the basic criterion is whether reopening will render justice under the act.internal quotation marks omitted.
we endeavored in our sharpe i opinion to outline the justice under the act factors,as described by this court,our sister circuits,and the supreme court.unfortunately,instead of heeding the legal principles spelled out in sharpe i and other pertinent authorities,the alj decision concocted a new test for modification requests,under which modification must automatically be granted if the adjudicator finds a prior mistake of fact and an absence of bad conduct by the requesting party.simply put,the alj test is not the proper analysis.while the alj certainly enjoys wide discretion in deciding whether to modify a benefits award,that discretion does not extend to reinventing the applicable law.
in these circumstances,the brb decision properly concluded,faithful to the brb statutory standard of review,that the alj was guided by erroneous legal principles and,thus,abused his discretion in granting westmoreland modification request.moreover,the brb was right to reverse the alj modification ruling,rather than vacate and remand for further proceedings.
notably,the respondent director of the office of workers compensation programs urges the very disposition that we announce today,but on the narrow ground that westmoreland modification request is fatally futile.the director,like the brb,places the onus on westmoreland to show that it can obtain one of the statutory remedies in the claim it seeks to modify,in sharpe lifetime claim.br.of fed.resp t.according to the director,the relief sought by westmoreland r elief from the collateral estoppel effect of a factual finding is not an available statutory remedy.id.moreover,the director asserts that the statutory remedies that do exist including having the living miner award terminate d or decrease d,see are not obtainable by westmoreland because it can not recover any of the payments made on that claim.br.of fed.resp t.in the director view,that is the end of the modification request analysis,given that if the request for relief is futile,modification must be denied on that basis alone.id.at citing old ben coal,at,for the proposition that the remedial purpose of the act would be thwarted if an alj were required to reopen proceedings if it were clear from the moving party submissions that reopening could not alter the substantive award.
we generally accord deference to the director,as the administrator of the black lung benefits act,in his reasonable interpretation of the act ambiguous provisions.cwp fund stacy,cir explaining that when the director position is being advanced via litigation,it is entitled to respect but only to the extent that it has the power to persuade alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.we need not ratify nor reject the futility ruling advocated by the director today,however,because the brb decision otherwise merits affirmance adapting the words of the seventh circuit old ben coal opinion to the present situation,w e do not think it wise or consonant with the grant of discretion in the statute to unnecessarily cabin the alj ability to address the complexities of a motion to reopen.see at.
notwithstanding the possible futility of westmoreland modification request,the motive behind it is patently improper.see brb decision denouncing westmoreland attempt to circumvent the law,which,in this case,prohibited employer from defending against the survivor claim by showing that the miner did not have complicated pneumoconiosis citing sharpe i,at.we indeed highlighted in sharpe i that,if the party purpose in filing a modification is to thwart a claimant good faith claim or an employer good faith defense,the remedial purpose of the statute is no longer served.at quoting old ben coal,at.the alj disregarded that principle,instead validating westmoreland motive as occasioning the simple use of the available legal means to attempt to protect and obtain justice for itself.alj decision.but the old ben coal court rejected the alj exact premise,concluding that,where a modification request is aimed at thwarting a good faith claim or defense,the denial of modification does not constitute punish ment for simply employ ing the procedural mechanisms instituted by congress.see at.at bottom,allowing employers to regularly use modification to evade application of the collateral estoppel doctrine and the irrebuttable presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis would effectively eradicate those entrenched legal principles.see usery turner elkhorn mining,d upholding irrebuttable presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis zeigler coal,owcp,cir observing that normal rules of preclusion govern administrative proceedings in black lung cases see also supra note relaying that,under recent amendments to the black lung benefits act,there is now an automatic entitlement to survivor benefits.
we leave open the question of whether such an improper motive can ever be outweighed by the strong interest in accuracy underlying the modification statute,for the brb decision soundly concluded that accuracy can not offset motive and other justice under the act factors here.the brb directed some attention to westmoreland diligence,pointing out that the company having sat silent for years since forgoing its right to this court review of the alj decision filed the modification request in response to sharpe survivor claim and only later proffered new evidence.see brb decision 
the brb focused more intently on the quality of the evidence,old and new,concluding that it was not sufficiently compelling to justify reversing the living miner benefits award.see brb decision deeming it appropriate to consider the interest in finality because there was nothing remarkably different about the new evidence see also old ben coal,at explaining that the modification analysis will no doubt need to take into consideration many factors including the quality of the new evidence.in allowing the brb decision to stand,we are not unmindful of the modification statute general preference for accuracy over finality in the substantive award.see old ben coal,at.we also recognize that modification does not always require a factual error,changed conditions,or startling new evidence.see jessee,owcp,cir observing that the statute and regulations give the deputy commissioner the authority to simply rethink a prior finding of fact.but where,as here,a modification request is belatedly made with an improper motive and without compelling new evidence,the interest in finality rightly carries a great deal of weight.see old ben coal,at w e do not preclude the possibility that,in a given case,it might be quite appropriate to permit the concern for finality of decision to prevail in the adjudication of the case.
unlike the alj decision,the brb decision acknowledged and applied the correct legal principles,arriving at the ineluctable conclusion that retroactively denying the late sharpe living miner benefits award,in order to foil his widow good faith survivor claim,would not render justice under the black lung benefits act.we therefore will not disturb the brb rulings that the alj abused his discretion in granting westmoreland modification request,and that the alj erroneous decision was subject to outright reversal 
turning to the collateral estoppel issue,we recognized in our opinion in collins pond creek mining that a widow could rely on offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel to establish simple pneumoconiosis in her survivor claim.see,cir.we explained therein that 
a party seeking to rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel is obliged to establish five elements that the issue sought to be precluded is identical to one previously litigated element one that the issue was actually determined in the prior proceeding element two that the issue determination was a critical and necessary part of the decision in the prior proceeding element three that the prior judgment is final and valid element four and that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum element five.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we also recognized that,where the proponent of collateral estoppel was a to the prior proceeding,we are obliged to assess whether allowing her to rely on the doctrine of offensive collateral estoppel might be unfair to the opposing party.id.at outlining four nonexclusive factors to be considered under parklane hosiery shore,d,including whether procedural opportunities are available to the opposing party in the present proceeding that were unavailable to it in the prior proceeding.
although the alj opined that findings of complicated pneumoconiosis should never be given preclusive effect,see supra note discussing alj decision,we agree with the brb that the widow of a black lung benefits recipient may rely on offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel to establish complicated pneumoconiosis in her survivor claim,see brb decision.indeed,westmoreland does not advocate a blanket bar,but rather asserts that collateral estoppel should be unavailable to sharpe in the particular circumstances of this case.westmoreland principally contends that the complicated pneumoconiosis finding,made in the alj decision and affirmed by the brb in,is not final element four of the collateral estoppel test that it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum element five and that new procedural opportunities are now available to it one of the parklane hosiery fairness factors.all of those arguments rest on the notion that westmoreland modification request validly placed the prior findings at issue.see br.of pet r.
westmoreland assertion that that its modification request hindered the finality of the decisions finding complicated pneumoconiosis must be rejected for the reasons delineated in the brb decision 
under entitled finality of decisions and orders,filing a request for modification is not identified as a procedure that affects the finality of a decision and order.indeed,provides a party who is dissatisfied with a decision and order which has become final in accordance with may request a modification of the decision and order if the conditions set forth in are met.emphasis supplied.thus,pursuant to,modification requests do not alter the finality of a decision and order,but rather pertain to decision and orders that have become final.the board decision and order affirming the alj award of benefits in sharpe claim became final on november.see.since westmoreland did not appeal that decision,it can not now be heard to question the finality of the alj decision.
brb decision.additionally,we agree with the brb that westmoreland has no cause to contend that,in light of the new evidence proffered in support of its modification request,it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the complicated pneumoconiosis issue in the prior proceeding.see id.the existence of new evidence is irrelevant to the issue of whether westmoreland was provided a full and fair opportunity to present the evidence it had at that time.finally,we reject westmoreland bare and puzzling contention that its modification request and new evidence somehow constitute previously unavailable procedural opportunities that could readily cause a different result.see parklane hosiery,at.as such,we conclude that the brb appropriately applied the doctrine of offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel in approving sharpe survivor claim.
pursuant to the foregoing,we deny westmoreland coal company petition for review and affirm the brb decision denying modification of william sharpe living miner benefits award and granting survivor benefits to his widow mae ann sharpe.
petition for review denied 
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.it errs,in my view,by failing to follow established precedent and by improperly substituting the judgment of the appellate court for that of the administrative law judge alj.
at the outset,it is critical to set forth the proper standard of review.we review for abuse of discretion a decision to grant a modification request on a living miner claim.sharpe,owcp,cir sharpe i.the majority correctly states that a modification decision can be reversed based on a finding of abuse of discretion where it was guided by erroneous legal principles,or if the adjudicator committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.ante at quoting sharpe i,at internal quotation marks omitted.
however,when an appellate court reviews the decision of an alj,we must be mindful of the limited scope of our judicial involvement.see ceres marine terminals,green,cir.as a panel of this court recently explained 
as in all agency cases,we must be careful not to substitute our judgment for that of the alj.hays sullivan,cir ultimately,it is the duty of the administrative law judge reviewing a case,and not the responsibility of the courts,to make findings of fact and to resolve conflicts in the evidence.because the alj is the trier of fact,we defer to the alj evaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions.stiltner island creek coal,cir.as long as substantial evidence supports an alj findings,w e must sustain the alj decision,even if we disagree with it.smith chater,cir.we review the legal conclusions of the board and the alj de novo.island creek coal compton,cir.
harman mining,owcp,cir emphasis added.thus,except as to matters of law,our review of the administrative record is highly circumscribed.
furthermore,and as the majority rightly notes,when we review an order of the benefits review board brb reversing the alj,we must ensure the brb decision adhered to its statutory standard of review.ante at quoting dehue coal ballard,cir.by statute,the findings of fact in the decision under review by the board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.b emphasis added.the substantial evidence standard is not a particularly difficult bar to meet as it is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.ceres marine terminals,at quotation marks and citation omitted.and in reviewing whether substantial evidence supports the alj ruling,we and the brb must give d eference to the inferences and credibility assessments.id.at.thus,to affirm the brb reversal of the alj,we must agree with it that the alj factual findings are unsupported by more than a scintilla of evidence.as the cases make clear,this bar is set as it is to prevent interference in the alj statutory exercise of discretion by either the brb or this court.
our highly deferential standard of review is significant in two respects.first,in the order,the alj made detailed factual findings with respect to whether william sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.as more fully explained below,these findings should be the baseline,if not altogether dispositive,of our appellate inquiry.to disturb the alj findings with respect to the medical facts underlying the modification request is to ignore and exceed our limited judicial role.
second,as judge smith noted in his dissent from the brb order reversing the alj,the alj addressed each of the factors identified in sharpe i at length in his decision and order and made findings that are rational and supported by substantial evidence.brb decision at smith,dissenting.it is simply not our role to second guess the judgment of the alj when weighing factors such as the alj considered here.see harman mining,at reviewing the alj to assess whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.quotation marks and citation omitted.
the majority,circumventing the discretion afforded by law to the alj,cloaks its analysis in the false veil of de novo review,stating,ante at,that the brb properly concluded that the alj analysis was guided by erroneous legal principles.the record does not support that conclusion.the alj based the decision to grant modification on the factors identified by this court in sharpe i factors that we described as factual in nature.see at and in this situation,an objective adjudicator could readily identify significant factual issues that are pertinent to a proper evaluation of westmoreland modification request.emphasis added.
after directing the alj to consider,as a factual matter,questions such as should westmoreland motive in seeking modification be deemed suspect and is the modification request futile or moot see,the majority,apparently dissatisfied with the answers provided by the alj,now undertakes de novo review to revisit those answers and provide substitute factual answers it would have preferred had it been sitting as the alj.
for example,in sharpe i,the court directed the alj to undertake a factual inquiry into westmoreland motive in seeking modification.see id.the alj did so,finding as a matter of fact that westmoreland simply used the available legal means to attempt to protect and obtain justice for itself.alj decision at.the majority,however,undertakes its own independent,de novo review of westmoreland motives and reaches the opposite result,finding,ante at,that westmoreland motive was to thwart a good faith claim or defense.the majority independent review inappropriately displaces the well settled role of the alj in black lung benefit litigation.see harman mining,at as long as substantial evidence supports an alj findings,we must sustain the alj decision,even if we disagree with it.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
when the facts,as determined by the alj,are reviewed under the correct standard,the alj decision should be affirmed and the brb decision reversed.
when interpreting of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,the supreme court has directed that we begin with the language of the statute.see metro.stevedore rambo,d.the statute provides that 
upon his own initiative,or upon the application of any party in interest,on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner,the deputy commissioner may,at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation,whether or not a compensation order has been issued,or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim,review a compensation case and issue a new compensation order which may terminate,continue,reinstate,increase,or decrease such compensation,or award compensation.
the statute itself sets forth two grounds upon which a modification request should be granted on the ground of a change in conditions and because of a mistake in a determination of fact.in addition,the statutory text sets forth only one limitation the one year period from either the date of the last payment of compensation or the date of the rejection of a claim.other than this express limitation,there is simply no other textual limitation cabining the discretion of the alj to grant modification in accordance with the statute.
of course,we do not read the statute in a vacuum.the supreme court has embossed with a gloss based on the legislative history of that statute.the court noted that the scope of the modification statute was expanded in to broaden the grounds on which a deputy commissioner can modify an award when changed conditions or a mistake in a determination of fact makes such modification desirable in order to render justice under the act.aerojetgeneral shipyards,d per curiam quoting,internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.
the ultimate guidepost for our legal analysis,therefore,is,what constitutes justice under the act the majority begins to answer this query by reference to the stated purpose of the black lung benefits act,which is 
to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.
ante at quoting a.it is of course true that the purpose of the black lung benefits act is to ensure that coal miners who actually suffer from black lung disease are compensated.and,as a corollary to this purpose,to provide that when a coal miner dies from black lung disease his dependents receive derivative benefits.however,as with any statutory grant of rights not accorded at common law,only those who actually qualify as a recipient of that right come within its purview.as the seventh circuit aptly stated,congress accomplished this goal,in part,by incorporating within the statute a broad reopening provision to ensure the accurate distribution of benefits.old ben coal,owcp,cir emphasis added.
thus,our search for justice under the act should be guided,first and foremost,by the need to ensure accurate benefit distribution.see,at modification statute provides the deputy commissioner with broad discretion to review factual errors in an effort to render justice under the act emphasis added banks chicago grain trimmers ass n,d noting that the purpose of the modification statute was to allow modification where a mistake in a determination of fact makes such modification desirable in order to render justice under the act emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted old ben coal,at justice under the act cabins the discretion of the alj to keep in mind the basic determination of congress that accuracy of determination is to be given great weight in all determinations under the act emphasis added.
thus,precedent directs that accuracy must be,at the very least,the jumping off point for any discussion of justice under the act.as the seventh circuit recognized in old ben coal,owcp,however,justice under the act is not the same as the interest of justice a standard the court described as amorphous,cir.therefore,to the extent that factors other than accuracy are relevant to the alj decision,they should be considered in light of the stated preference for accuracy in the award of benefits.see id.this distinction is not simply one of semantics.the justice under the act formulation cabins the discretion of the alj to keep in mind the basic determination of congress that accuracy of determination is to be given great weight in all determinations under the act.
the mandate of sharpe i directed the alj to assess,in addition to the need for accuracy,the diligence and motive of westmoreland in seeking modification,the possible futility of modification,and other factors that may bear on whether modification will render justice under the act.at emphasis added.despite sharpe i call for the alj to make factual findings related to the accuracy of the initial benefit award,however,the majority simply disregards those findings.
on review of the alj decision,the majority jettisons any purported concern for accuracy,and focuses only on consideration of westmoreland motive,its diligence,and the alleged futility of modification.while it is true that sharpe i identified those considerations as potentially relevant to whether a modification request should be granted,id.at,there is simply no support for the majority approach in the case at bar focusing solely on those factors at the expense of the core black lung benefits act determinant accuracy.indeed,it is telling that in its opinion today,the majority devotes only a few bare sentences by footnote as to whether the alj decision was correct as to the question of whether sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.see ante at declining to review the brb rejection of the alj conclusion that the complicated pneumoconiosis ruling was based on a mistake of fact,but nevertheless ruling that were we to do so,we would agree with the brb.i fail to see how a valid analysis of whether modification serves justice under the act can be undertaken without first considering whether the benefits award westmoreland seeks to modify was,in fact,accurate.
the majority formulation of justice under the act is therefore fundamentally in error,not for noting that the alj should consider factors other than accuracy,but rather for failing to provide any analytical framework for evaluating when and under what circumstances accuracy must give way to other considerations.the majority simply recites the factors of motive,diligence,and futility,reweighs the evidence,and summarily concludes that those factors militate against modification.the majority opinion turns the justice under the act standard on its head,rewriting the formulation to reflect the sort of amorphous considerations that old ben coal discussed and rejected.
the majority concludes today,without support from any authority,that motive,futility,and an assumed lack of diligence are so overwhelming in this case that accuracy is irrelevant,notwithstanding that accuracy is the only consideration identified in the precedent of this court and the supreme court as being tied to the purposes of the black lung benefits act even mccord and old ben,the only other cases on the circuit court of appeals level to remand a modification attempt based on the conduct of a party,did not go so far as the majority.rather,those cases rightly recognized that the discretion lies with the alj,not the courts,to weigh the relevant factors to determine whether modification renders justice under the act.
contrary to the majority holding,the alj in this case applied the proper standard to the modification request and his decision is entitled to deference both from this court and the brb.
in my view,the majority wrongly concludes that the alj was guided by erroneous legal principles.i do not agree that the alj reinvent ed the applicable law,or failed to faithfully apply the principles set forth in sharpe ante at.on the contrary,a fair assessment of the alj decision reveals that the opposite is true.
the alj began by setting forth the applicable legal standard for review of westmoreland modification request.the alj carefully recited the holdings of sharpe i and old ben coal,placing appropriate emphasis on the latter pronouncement that the alj must keep in mind the basic determination that accuracy of determination is to be given great weight in all determinations under the act.alj decision at quoting old ben coal,at.
after discussing several cases on point,the alj arrived at the following legal conclusions 
accuracy is the overarching goal of justice under the act,and modification should be barred only where the party seeking it has engaged in the type of conduct that occurred in mccord refusal to participate in the prior administrative proceedings,or in kinlaw stevens shipping and terminal,brbs attempting to overcome earlier litigation mistakes by retrying the case.
alj decision at.
the majority mischaracterizes this holding,accusing the alj of crafting a formulation wherein modification must automatically be granted if the adjudicator finds a prior mistake of fact and an absence of bad conduct by the requesting party.ante at.but,as the foregoing quote proves,the alj did not hold that modification is automatic in those circumstances.rather,the alj simply explained an established point of law because accuracy is the overarching purpose of the modification statute,modification should be granted where the party requesting modification demonstrates that the ruling sought to be modified was factually incorrect,unless there is a very compelling reason not to grant modification,to set accuracy aside.the alj gave two nonexclusive examples from the caselaw,but at no point did the alj state a per se rule or limit the scope of analysis in future cases with different facts.tellingly,the alj gave several additional examples of factors that might weigh against modification in an appropriate case serial petitions.see alj decision at.a fair reading of the full text of the alj opinion shows the majority opinion mischaracterizes its actual holding.
the alj formulation of justice under the act was not guided by erroneous legal principles.to the contrary,it was based on the unassailable legal principle that accuracy is of paramount importance in rendering modification decisions.in this case,it is the majority that arbitrarily alters the justice under the act standard to something far removed from the purposes of the black lung benefits act.the majority approach is counterintuitive,asking first whether the party requesting modification has engaged in some manner of egregious conduct or,as is in the case at bar,benign conduct deemed suspect by the majority,and,only upon answering that question in the negative deems the accuracy of the benefits award to be relevant.such an approach does not render justice under the act.
because a proper assessment of the alj legal conclusions from the established facts shows the alj applied the proper legal analysis,i would grant the petition for review and reverse the judgment of the brb on the foregoing basis alone.
notwithstanding my objection to the erroneous weight that the majority gives to the other factors,the alj assessment of each factor was correct as a matter of law and supported by substantial evidence.i address each factor in turn.
as accuracy is the primary consideration of whether modification renders justice under the act,i begin with a review of the alj findings that the benefit award on sharpe living miner claim was based on a mistake of fact because the evidence does not establish complicated pneumoconiosis.
i note at the outset that sharpe has forfeited her challenge to the alj factual conclusions regarding the benefit award by failing to raise any argument whatsoever related to that issue in her brief on appeal.even appellees waive arguments by failing to brief them.roth dep t of justice,quoting united states ford,cir see mironescu costner,cir citing federal rule of appellate procedure b for the proposition that appellees must state their contentions and the reasons for them at the risk of abandonment of an argument not presented quotation marks and citation omitted.despite the centrality in this appeal of the issue of whether the benefit award was correct,sharpe devotes not one word in her brief to an explanation of why it was so.on that basis alone,i would leave undisturbed the alj medical findings.
even ignoring the waiver,the alj findings are manifestly supported by substantial evidence.the alj reviewed the medical evidence in this case twice once in and again in on remand from this court judgment in sharpe i.in both instances,the alj ruled that sharpe did not suffer from complicated pneumoconiosis.
the alj ruling was based on his review of evidence gathered in,and twice in.alj decision at.after discussing the medical opinions that had been issued to date,the alj stated the following in support of his determination 
i n considering the evidence,i find it highly significant that although pneumoconiosis is a progressive and irreversible disease all the physicians who provided the interpretations of the post readable films found that these films do not indicate the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis all of these physicians are to interpret chest for the presence of pneumoconiosis,as they are either,or dually qualified i find that the post evidence,which unanimously is contra the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis,outweighs the four complicated pneumoconiosis interpretations of the two films.in addition,further doubt is cast on the interpretation of complicated pneumoconiosis by the five physicians who found that the april,does not reveal complicated pneumoconiosis and the six physicians who found that the july,does not reveal complicated pneumoconiosis.
alj decision at emphasis in original.
on review,the brb rejected the alj assessment,only because the brb improperly excluded the evidence the alj relied upon in concluding that sharpe did not suffer from complicated pneumoconiosis.the brb held that 
t he evidence submitted on modification,consisting of,ct scans,medical records and medical opinions spanning the period from to the miner death in,is of the same sort as the evidence that was available during the miner life.under these circumstances,it is proper to grant survivor benefits based on the finding made during the miner life.
brb decision at.in excluding clearly reliable evidence that sharpe did not suffer from pneumoconiosis,the brb imposed a requirement,not found in any case or statute,that the alj must only consider its version of highly reliable evidence,autopsy results in granting a modification.id.in this respect,the brb grossly misstated the law and reached a conclusion to ignore evidence not on any proven ground of relevance,but as an arbitrary and capricious act.the cases to have considered the issue are unanimous that there is no limitation on the type of evidence that may justify granting modification.see,at modification permitted to correct mistakes of fact,whether demonstrated by wholly new evidence,cumulative evidence,or merely further reflection on evidence initially submitted.old ben coal,at neither the statute nor its interpreting case law limits the type of evidence that may justify reopening.
in this respect,the brb acted well outside the statutory standard of review and relied on incorrect principles of law.if the brb had considered as it was bound to do all of the evidence reviewed by the alj,it would no doubt have concluded,as judge smith did in dissent,that the alj findings were supported by substantial evidence.judge smith also noted that,as to the factual question of whether sharpe suffered from pneumoconiosis,the brb had previously affirmed the alj findings based on the same evidence.brb decision at smith,dissenting.the alj determination of accuracy is thus entitled to deference on appeal and there is no basis to set it aside.
as the majority notes,the director brief on appeal urges us to reject westmoreland modification request on the grounds that it is f
