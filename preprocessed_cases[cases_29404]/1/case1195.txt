the board of immigration appeals,in a series of decisions over the course of several years,denied numerous requests by batsaihan purveegiin for withholding of removal under the convention against torture cat purveegiin claimed that,if deported to his native country of mongolia,he would be imprisoned for outstanding student loan debts and his criticisms of the communist party,and that he would be denied essential medical treatment while detained.an immigration judge granted purveegiin relief from removal,but the board,acting through a single member,reversed.
purveegiin now petitions for review.he asserts that the board erred factually in discounting his allegations,legally in concluding that his imprisonment would not constitute torture,and procedurally in refusing to refer the case to a panel for resolution.we agree with the last point,and will remand to the board for further proceedings.
purveegiin was working as an artist in communist mongolia during the late when he came to the attention of the prime minister.the official admired his work,and became purveegiin patron.he helped purveegiin to obtain a student visa and arranged for him to receive approximately in government funds to attend art school in new york city.purveegiin entered the united states in and commenced his studies later that year.
things did not go as planned.he quit school in,for reasons that are not clear from the record.he was diagnosed with diabetes in,and placed on insulin treatment.he was convicted by new york authorities of petty larceny,criminal impersonation,and sexual abuse in and.the prime minister who had been his patron was arrested and detained,and other mongolian officials,now in power,informed purveegiin that the was a loan,not a grant,and must be repaid.
he sought support from the mongolian consulate,but the results were decidedly negative.the chief consular official not only denied his request for additional funds but also threatened that,if purveegiin did not pay back the money,he would be imprisoned.purveegiin responded,perhaps unwisely,by criticizing the communist party,further angering the consular official.
he fared no better with united states authorities.the immigration and naturalization service charged purveegiin in as an alien subject to deportation for failure to maintain the conditions of admission,a c i,and for convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude,a a i,ii.purveegiin conceded removability,but sought withholding of removal under the cat 
a hearing on the application for withholding of removal was held in october.purveegiin recounted his entry into the united states,his failed art studies,and his conflicts with mongolian officials.he testified that he feared imprisonment if returned to mongolia and argued,relying on country reports from the united states department of state and amnesty international,that he would be denied medical care if detained.he stressed that he required daily insulin injections and that,without treatment,he would die in a very short time.
the immigration judge granted withholding of removal.the judge found,based on purveegiin testimony and the country reports,that purveegiin more likely than not would be imprisoned upon his return to mongolia,on account of his defaulted loan obligations and comments,and would be deprived of necessary medical treatment while in detention.moreover,the judge concluded that,because government officials know of the abysmal conditions in the prison cells and would not be ignorant of the severe pain to purveegiin or any other prisoners,the pain and suffering caused to purveegiin would be specifically intended by those officials 
the board,acting through a single member,reversed.it disagreed with the immigration judge findings that purveegiin would be jailed upon his return to mongolia and would be denied medical care.it stated,without elaboration,that there is no convincing evidence that purveegiin will be imprisoned or even briefly detained if deported to mongolia.the board further concluded that it is not established that purveegiin would not be provided with medication in mongolian prison facilities.it did not address the immigration judge finding that any pain and suffering caused to purveegiin in prison would be specifically intended by government officials.
purveegiin filed a petition for review in this court in july.soon thereafter,the government filed an unopposed motion to remand the case to the board in light of zubeda ashcroft,cir.we stated in zubeda that an alien may be entitled to withholding of removal based on evidence showing that,if deported to her native country,she would be detained indefinitely and would likely be raped in prison.the panel recognized that detaining officials might not have the specific intent to inflict pain and suffering upon her,but determined that their knowledge of the conditions of detention could suffice to show that they specifically intended the harm that would likely occur.id.at in a summary order,we granted the motion to remand in light of zubeda.
the board,again acting through a single member,reaffirmed its reversal of the decision of the immigration judge.it admitted into the record new country reports from,authored by the united states department of state and amnesty international.these documents contained somewhat contradictory accounts of prison conditions both reported continued problems with excessive force and torture against prisoners and detainees but both also acknowledged that conditions were improving.the state department report noted that mongolian officials were reforming the prison system to monitor abuses and provide better medical care to inmates,and that hundreds of inmates with tuberculosis had received treatment.
the board concluded that purveegiin had not demonstrated,based on current country conditions,that he would be subject to torture if deported to mongolia.it stated that purveegiin testimony,uncorroborated by evidence of outstanding warrants for his arrest,was insufficient to establish that he would be imprisoned in mongolia.it also found,based on the reports of improving prison conditions,that purveegiin would likely receive adequate medical care even if he were detained.again,the board did not address the specific intent element of the torture claim.
in september,purveegiin filed a timely petition for review with this court and a motion for reconsideration with the board.he criticized the board for fail ing to adequately consider the impact of zubeda.he also asserted that reversal of the immigration judge decision by a single member of the board,as opposed to a panel,was improper under agency regulations.
a single member of the board denied the motion for reconsideration.the summary order discounted purveegiin arguments relating to zubeda,concluding that the board had conducted the review required by zubeda but had determined,as a factual matter,that purveegiin would not be subject to severe pain and suffering in mongolia.it simply rejected,without explanation,purveegiin demand for review.
another timely petition for review followed.we consolidated this petition with the one filed from the order of the board in september 
the department of justice has in recent years promulgated a series of regulations aimed at decreasing the backlog of pending immigration cases.perhaps the most well known of these efforts are the streamlining regulations that went into effect in.they allowed,for the first time,a single member of the board to affirm a decision of an immigration judge without written opinion,if the decision was squarely controlled by existing precedent.see dia ashcroft,cir en banc.these provisions,now codified at e,have been subject to criticism by courts and commentators,see,berishaj ashcroft,cir evelyn cruz,double the injustice,twice the harm the impact of the board of immigration appeals summary affirmance procedures,stan.pol y,but have been lauded by the agency as an effective and adequate means to resolve simple cases in an expeditious manner,see procedural reforms to improve case management,the department believes that the board experience with the streamlining initiative has proven that fears of procedural failures or substantive errors being overlooked are not well founded.
other regulations,promulgated in,further expanded the authority of a single member of the board to resolve appeals.id.codified at e,they provide that all cases will be reviewed in the first instance by a single board member 
if the board member to whom an appeal is assigned determines,upon consideration of the merits,that the decision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion,the board member shall issue a brief order affirming,modifying,or remanding the decision under review,unless the board member designates the case for decision by a panel under paragraph e of this section a single board member may reverse the decision under review if such reversal is plainly consistent with and required by intervening board or judicial precedent,by an intervening act of congress,or by an intervening final regulation.
id.this provision expresses a preference in favor of adjudication for the majority of cases.see procedural reforms to improve case management.at.
only in certain circumstances,enumerated in paragraph e of,do the regulations provide for referral of a case to a panel 
cases may only be assigned for review by a panel if the case presents one of these circumstances 
i the need to settle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges 
ii the need to establish a precedent construing the meaning of laws,regulations,or procedures 
iii the need to review a decision by an immigration judge or the service that is not in conformity with the law or with applicable precedents 
iv the need to resolve a case or controversy of major national import 
v the need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination by an immigration judge or 
vi the need to reverse the decision of an immigration judge or the service,other than a reversal under e.
e.a case should be referred to a panel only if the legal and factual issues are in reasonable dispute or the case is of exceptional importance.see see also procedural reforms to improve case management.at.
these regulations,purveegiin argues,required the board to refer his case for review.there are two questions that must be addressed in resolving this issue.initially,we must determine whether the decision to employ review is committed to agency discretion,such that we lack jurisdiction to consider the matter.if it is not,then we must address whether the board invocation of the procedure in this case was arbitrary or capricious.
under the administrative procedure act,any person suffering legal wrong because of agency action is entitled to judicial review.see also id.b.there are only two exceptions to this general rule when a statute precludes judicial review of the action,and when the action is committed to agency discretion by law.id.a.no statute proscribes judicial review of the board decision to employ review,so the only question here is whether the matter is committed to agency discretion.see smriko ashcroft,cir.
an action is considered to be within an agency absolute discretion,and not subject to judicial review,if the relevant statute or regulation is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency action.lincoln vigil,d quoting heckler chaney,d.only if the governing provisions affirmatively circumscribe the agency authority,constraining its decision in a definite and defined manner,may a court competently assess the validity of its action.see see also smriko,at.
a strict reading of arguably suggests that the decision to employ review is a matter committed to agency discretion.paragraph e lists cases in which an appeal shall be decided by a single member,and paragraph e lists cases in which an appeal may be referred to a panel.id.notably,neither of these provisions states that a single member shall not decide a particular case,even if he or she determines that it falls within one of the categories of paragraph e.nor do they state that a single member decision to resolve a case without panel review might violate these standards.the regulations are phrased as permissive,not review in certain circumstances,in the discretion of the board.
nevertheless,the structure of the regulations and their history make clear that they impose affirmative limits on the authority of a single member to decide an appeal.the first sentence of paragraph e of states t he board member to whom an appeal is assigned shall issue a brief order affirming,modifying,or remanding the decision unless the board member designates the case for decision by a panel under paragraph e of this section.id.e emphasis added.by directing that a single member shall resolve a case unless it falls within the categories of paragraph e,the provision necessarily implies that a single member shall not resolve a case if it does fall within one of those categories.a member who determines that a case qualifies for referral under paragraph e should refrain from decision and,instead,assign the matter to a panel.see id.e.
a contrary view would render these provisions largely superfluous.a board member determination that a case qualified for review under paragraph e would have no bearing on his or her ultimate authority to resolve the appeal.notwithstanding the propriety of panel review,the member could still dispose of the appeal in a summary order and,if a motion for reconsideration is filed,could deny that motion,again without the involvement of other board members.see id.e a motion to reconsider a decision that was rendered by a single board member may be adjudicated by that board member unless the case is reassigned to a panel.only if the regulations are viewed as mandating referral under the circumstances enumerated in paragraph e may the board and the courts monitor a member compliance with the regulatory duties established by e.
the history of the regulations confirms this view.the rule initially proposed by the agency stated in paragraph e that c ases shall be assigned for review by a panel if the case presents one of the enumerated circumstances.procedural reforms to improve case management,proposed,emphasis added.the mandatory language of this provision demonstrates the agency understanding that individual board members would lack authority to decide cases that fall within the listed categories.they would instead be required to refer these cases for panel review.
the reason that the mandatory shall was dropped in the final regulations in favor of the permissive may only was,according to the agency,to avoid judicial enforcement of panel review.procedural reforms to improve case management.at.but,despite this semantic shift,the agency made clear in its accompanying commentary that t his change does not broaden the authority of a single board member to decide these cases.id.in other words,a single member is still bound by the same limitations that existed under the proposed mandatory version of the regulations.see id.at.the member is still required,even under the facially permissive final regulations,to refer cases that fall within the categories of paragraph e for panel review.
that the agency did not intend for the courts of appeal to review the board decision to employ review is not even whether the matter is committed to agency discretion.smriko,at.rather,the availability of judicial review depends solely on the language of the regulations and the interpretation given to them by the agency.see see also auguste ridge,cir t he board interpretation and application of its own regulations is entitled to great deference.quoting abdille ashcroft,cir.when an agency rules circumscribe its authority in a defined and assessable manner,the judiciary is compelled under the administrative procedure act,pass upon the agency compliance with those provisions.smriko,at.
under the agency own interpretation of the regulations,a board member discretion to decide a case without panel review is informed and constrained by e and e.see procedural reforms to improve case management.at.these provisions offer concrete,judicially manageable standards by which a court may determine whether disposition is permissible in a given case.batalova a
