the dol investigation into the management of the funds arises out of a million loss of erisa plan assets as a result of the funds investments in entities related to bernard madoff,who has since been convicted of securities fraud for organizing a dollar ponzi scheme

dol employee benefit security administration ebsa conducts audits pursuant to a of erisa,which authorizes dol to investigate whether a violation of title i of erisa or regulations or orders issued thereunder has occurred or is about to occur.a.on april,dol issued two subpoenas duces tecum requesting documents relating to the administration of the funds.the request covered a range of the funds activities,but focused on information concerning the decision to commit assets to investments.
on april,the funds provided documents partially responsive to the subpoenas,but redacted portions of some documents and wholly withheld some others,claiming they were protected by and work product privileges.dol and the funds negotiated over the next few months regarding the scope of the subpoenas.in response to the funds concerns,dol agreed to limit the time period covered by the request and to narrow the scope of of the subpoena specifications.throughout these discussions,ebsa maintained that the funds were not permitted to withhold documents based on or work product privileges.the negotiations eventually broke down,however,and,on march,the secretary filed a petition in federal district court to obtain compliance with the subpoenas.
following briefing and a hearing,the district court granted the secretary petition on may.in reaching its decision,the district court applied the fiduciary exception to the privileges asserted by the funds.the district court ordered the funds to comply with the subpoenas and produce documents dealing with board of trustees and policy committee meeting minutes for the funds documents referred to or distributed during these meetings notes taken at these meetings any correspondence relating to the funds investments and documents outside the four categories listed above that the funds withheld based on privilege claims.in accordance with the secretary offer to exempt certain categories from production,the district court excluded the production of documents dealing exclusively with benefits disputes,benefits claims,subrogation agreements,delinquent contributions,withdrawal liability,or collection actions involving employers.the district court order also excluded information covered by the privilege or work product protection in documents dated after service of the subpoenas or prepared in connection with the current investigation.
notably,the district court addressed the funds concerns about the ability of third parties to access the information disclosed in response to the subpoenas,finding that compliance with the order does not waive any or work product privilege with respect to any third party and ordering dol to notify the funds of any requests received under the freedom of information act,for documents produced under the order.the funds produced the documents required by the district court order and filed a timely notice of appeal.the funds seek reversal of the district court order and the return of the privileged documents 
recognizing that congress delegated enforcement mechanisms to agency discretion,this court has emphasized that the district court role in a proceeding to enforce an administrative subpoena is sharply limited.eeoc city of norfolk police,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also eeoc am.efird mills,cir.to enforce an administrative subpoena,the district court need only find that the agency is authorized to make such an investigation the agency has complied with statutory requirements of due process and the materials requested are relevant.see,united states am.target,cir am.efird mills,at.if the agency can make such a showing,the court must enforce the subpoena unless the party being investigated demonstrates that the subpoena is unduly burdensome.eeoc maryland cup,cir citing ftc texaco,en banc.this court reviews the factual findings underlying a district court enforcement of an agency subpoena for clear error.eeoc lockheed martin,aero naval systems,cir.we review questions of law de novo.see maryland cup,at internal citations omitted.
on appeal,the funds do not challenge the secretary authority to issue the subpoenas nor do they raise due process or relevance concerns.instead,they argue that the and work product privileges protect some of the materials requested by the secretary from disclosure and that the district court erred in applying the fiduciary exception to override these privileges.this court reviews de novo a district court decision regarding the scope and applicability of an asserted privilege to the extent the court holding rests on application of controlling legal principles to the facts.in re allen,cir see also in re grand jury subpoena,cir.we address in turn the funds claims of and work product privilege.
intended to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients,the privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.upjohn united states.nonetheless,the privilege is not absolute,and this court has noted that it is to be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.united states aramony,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
courts have recognized one such limit in the context of fiduciary relationships.rooted in the common law of trusts,the fiduciary exception is based on the rationale that the benefit of any legal advice obtained by a trustee regarding matters of trust administration runs to the beneficiaries.consequently,trustees can not subordinate the fiduciary obligations owed to the beneficiaries to their own private interests under the guise of privilege.riggs nat.bank of washington,zimmer.ch.
this principle has been applied to fiduciary relationships beyond the traditional trust context.see,garner wolfinbarger,cir balancing potential costs and benefits of disclosure to hold that,in shareholder derivative action against corporate officers,availability of the privilege be subject to the right of the stockholders to show cause why it should not be invoked in the particular instance.several of our sister circuits,moreover,have recognized the exception to assertions of privilege by erisa fiduciaries.see,bland fiatallis am,cir recognizing fiduciary exception but finding it did not apply to communications relating to actions,including amendments to plan benefits united states mett,cir finding fiduciary exception applied in erisa context,but did not extend to any advice that a fiduciary obtains in an effort to protect herself from civil or criminal liability united states doe,cir applying fiduciary exception to claims of privilege in context of erisa enforcement action becher long island lighting,cir recognizing fiduciary exception to privilege in erisa context was limited to fiduciary matters wildbur arco chem,cir recognizing fiduciary exception but finding it did not apply to communications that were made for the purpose of defending the pending lawsuit and did not deal with plan administration.wachtel health net,cir describing evolution of fiduciary exception in erisa context and finding exception did not reach communications of erisa plan insurer with plan attorneys regarding benefit claims.
analogizing the erisa fiduciary role to the role of the trustee at common law these courts have relied on one of two related rationales.applying the reasoning of the fifth circuit in garner,some courts have concluded that the erisa fiduciary duty to act in the exclusive interest of beneficiaries supersedes the fiduciary right to assert privilege.see,e,bland,at becher,at.other courts,however,have reasoned that the erisa fiduciary,as a representative of the beneficiaries,is not the real client in obtaining advice regarding plan administration and thus never enjoyed the privilege in the first place.mett,at internal citations omitted.see doe,at wildbur,at washington baltimore newspaper guild,local washington star.under either rationale,where an erisa trustee seeks an attorney advice on a matter of plan administration and where the advice clearly does not implicate the trustee in any personal capacity,the trustee can not invoke the privilege against the plan beneficiaries.mett,at.
this court has not previously examined the fiduciary exception in the context of erisa,though several district courts in this circuit have addressed the issue see,tatum reynolds tobacco,recognizing the existence of a fiduciary exception where an erisa plan administrator asserts privilege to withhold from plan beneficiaries communications related to matters on which a fiduciary duty is owed to the beneficiaries coffman metro.life ins,finding that fiduciary exception required disclosure of documents dealing with plan administration to erisa trust beneficiaries.persuaded by the reasoning set forth in the opinions of our sister circuits and the lower courts within our circuit,we find that the fiduciary exception to privilege extends to communications between an erisa trustee and a plan attorney regarding plan administration.
in now recognizing the fiduciary exception,we acknowledge that it is not without limits.the exception will not apply,for example,to a fiduciary communications with an attorney regarding her personal defense in an action for breach of fiduciary duty.see mett,at.similarly,communications between erisa fiduciaries and plan attorneys regarding matters,such as adopting,amending,or terminating an erisa plan,are not subject to the fiduciary exception.see bland,at.
in the context of the shareholder derivative action,the fiduciary exception also has been limited by a requirement that one seeking to overcome a privilege show good cause.see garner,at,rejecting unqualified fiduciary exception out of concern,in part,that corporations may be vulnerable to suit by shareholders whose interests or intention may be inconsistent with those of other shareholders.in the context of the secretary investigative or enforcement activity under erisa,however,the concerns that inspired the good cause requirement in the corporate context do not obtain,as there exists no legitimate need for a trustee to shield his actions from those whom he is obligated to serve.washington star.at,see also in re occidental petrol,cir noting that the garner court concern regarding potential for conflicting interests in corporate context was not triggered where plaintiffs seek discovery only to uphold occidental fiduciary duties to the employee stock ownership plan of which plaintiffs are beneficiaries.martin valley bank,noting that principles governing required disclosure of trustee communications do not impose a good cause limitation on the beneficiary access to this type of information,and neither garner nor its progeny offer the slightest suggestion as to why that principle ought now to be set aside.several other courts that have addressed the scope of the fiduciary exception in the erisa context have also refused to apply a good cause requirement.see mett,at applying fiduciary exception without reference to good cause requirement wildbur,at same becher,at same tatum,at expressly rejecting garner good cause analysis henry champlain,inc,applying good cause requirement to plaintiffs shareholder derivative claim but not to their erisa claims hudson dynamics,finding good cause not required in erisa context washington star.at same indeed,to our knowledge,only one district court opinion has applied the good cause requirement to limit the fiduciary exception in the erisa context.see donovan fitzsimmons.we do not find that case persuasive.
even courts that have refused to impose a good cause requirement,however,have maintained the limits imposed by the fiduciary relationship itself.in particular,communications and a trustee personal legal advice will not be subject to the exception.thus,the application of the fiduciary exception to any particular communication remains a matter of context and content.mett,at tatum.
in sum,we conclude that application of the fiduciary exception to the privilege in the context of a subpoena issued by the secretary of labor under erisa does not require a showing of good cause instead,its application turns on the context and content of the individual communications at issue.
turning to the case before us,the funds argue that the district court erred in applying the fiduciary exception to their claim of privilege in the context of the secretary investigation.courts have held,and the parties agree,that the fiduciary exception extends to the secretary acting on behalf of beneficiaries in the context of an erisa enforcement action.see doe,at recognizing that the government may invoke the exception when it is seeking to vindicate the rights of erisa beneficiaries mett,at valley nat.bank,at noting that any communications by the bank with the firm seeking advice as to the administration of the trust should be disclosable to the secretary,who is suing on behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust fitzsimmons.at finding that at this point,both dol and the plan participants have exactly the same interest,securing complete disclosure in order to ferret out and discover any past wrongdoing affecting the fund wsol fiduciary mgmt,wl.thus,although the funds concede that the fiduciary exception may apply to lawsuits filed by dol under of erisa,they argue that it should not extend to a dol compliance investigation under of erisa we disagree.
