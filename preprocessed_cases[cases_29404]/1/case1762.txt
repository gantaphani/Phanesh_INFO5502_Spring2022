carole squire,a former judge on the franklin county domestic relations and juvenile court,appeals an order of disbarment entered against her by the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.following an investigation,squire was suspended from the practice of law by the state of ohio for two years,with twelve months of that suspension stayed on the condition that she commit no further disciplinary violations within the suspension period.shortly thereafter,the district court reciprocally disbarred squire from practicing in federal court.
squire claims that she should not have been reciprocally disbarred because she was denied due process during her state disbarment proceeding when ohio refused to reveal to squire the names of every witness with whom the ohio disciplinary counsel for the supreme court of ohio,jonathan coughlan,spoke during the investigation.she further alleges that the findings of the ohio supreme court are against the weight of the evidence presented and that her investigation was nothing more than the product of political machinations between members of the ohio supreme court and the franklin county domestic relations and juvenile court 
however,failing to disclose to squire the names of every person with whom coughlan may have spoken during his investigation did not deprive squire of her opportunity to present a meaningful defense.moreover,there is not such an infirmity of proof establishing her misconduct as to give rise to a clear conviction that we can not accept as final the conclusion of the ohio supreme court.therefore,we affirm the district court imposition of reciprocal discipline.
squire was elected for a term on the franklin county domestic relations and juvenile court in columbus,ohio and began her term in january.on august,squire sent a letter to judge thomas moyer,justice of the supreme court of ohio,alleging,among other things,that other judges on the court were interfering with squire cases and failing to perform their jobs adequately.it is unclear from the record whether chief judge moyer responded or took any action as a result of receiving squire letter,although squire claims that chief judge moyer did nothing.
some time after that,lori mccaughan,a lawyer arguing a case before squire,consulted judge james mason,another judge on the franklin county domestic relations and juvenile court,about the case.mccaughan complained that squire repeatedly refused to hold a hearing in connection with an ex parte civil protection order,as required by ohio law squire refused to accept service of an emergency custody order issued by a fellow judge,judge dana preisse squire had sequestered a child involved in a custody dispute in her chambers squire refused to accept service of mccaughan affidavit of disqualification disqualifying squire from mccaughan case and squire had behaved inappropriately towards attorneys and their clients who appeared in squire courtroom.
sometime prior to october,coughlan notified squire that she was under investigation for allegedly violating the canons of judicial ethics and sent her a draft complaint.according to coughlan,the draft complaint contained the names of all persons who had filed a grievance and the names of all potential witnesses in the formal proceeding against squire.however,coughlan did not provide the names of every person with whom he had spoken during the course of conducting his investigation.squire demanded that coughlan provide the names of every complainant,but coughlan responded that squire had been provided with all of the complainants names.he further asserted that no particular person filed a grievance for one of the two counts charged,as the facts underlying that claim came to his attention during the course of his investigation.a probable cause hearing was set for october before a panel of the board of commissioners on grievances and discipline.
on october,squire filed suit against coughlan in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,alleging that coughlan had violated her due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and denied her a meaningful opportunity to respond to the draft complaint by not providing her the names of all the complainants and witnesses against her.squire requested a temporary restraining order to prohibit coughlan from proceeding with the hearing and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring coughlan to provide the requested names and attorney fees.the district court dismissed the case sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction,finding that it was barred under the younger abstention doctrine from considering squire federal case because squire state disciplinary proceedings were ongoing.see squire,at.
squire filed a second complaint with the district court on october that was identical to her first complaint,adding an additional defendant,lori brown,the assistant disciplinary counsel.because the board probable cause hearing was set for october,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the evening of october and again dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under younger.id.the district court further found that,even if it had jurisdiction,squire claim would fail on the merits.id.squire then filed a motion with the board to obtain the names of everyone with whom coughlan had spoken during the investigation against her,alleging that due process entitled her to know the identity of all witnesses against her and the opportunity to avoid public disclosure of sensitive facts.the board denied her request.
on october,coughlan made public the formal complaint against squire,based upon two cases heard by squire,allison patterson and camburn camburn.this complaint presented claims that,in both cases,squire repeatedly refused to hold a hearing in connection with an ex parte civil protection order as required by ohio law was discourteous to attorneys had improper ex parte communications and failed to disqualify herself when appropriate.coughlan amended the complaint on march,to include two additional counts rising from two other cases heard by squire,fleming fleming and in re tylee delibro.the additional counts claimed that squire made false and inflammatory statements in her entry to disqualify herself from the fleming case did not follow statutory procedural requirements had improper ex parte communications was discourteous to attorneys wrongly disqualified herself from a case when it was not appropriate and refused to consider all matters before her in relation to a motion for continuance.in total,the amended complaint listed four counts of misconduct involving forty violations of the code of judicial conduct and twelve violations of the code of professional responsibility.
a panel of the board heard the case over eight days of proceedings in august,september,and october.witnesses testified,and the parties presented more than one hundred exhibits.the panel made unanimous findings of misconduct on all counts and recommended that squire be suspended from the practice of law for twelve months,with six months stayed on the condition that she commit no further disciplinary infractions within the suspension period.the board accepted the panel findings and recommended that squire be suspended from law practice for two years,with one year of her suspension stayed.
on november,the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,in accordance with rule ii of the the model federal rules of disciplinary enforcement,entered an order that squire show cause why the district court should not impose identical discipline upon her.thereafter,the district court suspended squire from the practice of law in that court for two years with twelve months of the suspension stayed on the condition that she commit no further disciplinary violations during the suspension period.squire timely appealed.
on appeal,squire challenges the sufficiency of the due process protections she was afforded in her state disbarment proceedings.we are precluded by the doctrine from reviewing any claims that challenge the sufficiency of the proceedings afforded squire by the state of ohio,as opposed to the process afforded squire in her federal disbarment proceedings.in re cook,cir holding that the precluded an attorney from challenging the supreme court of ohio disbarment proceeding.the pertinent question in determining whether a federal district court is precluded under the doctrine from exercising jurisdiction over a claim is whether the source of the injury upon which plaintiff bases his federal claim is the state court judgment.id.at quoting lawrence welch,cir.this is true regardless of whether the party challenges the validity of the state court judgment on constitutional grounds.id.citing lawrence,at.
although we do not directly review ohio decision to disbar squire,because the district court relied on the record developed by the state courts,this court must consider whether alleged defects in those proceedings so infected the federal proceeding that justice requires reversal of the federal determination.id.at quoting in re ruffalo,see also lawrence,at.because the requirements for admission and continued practice in federal and states courts are distinct,federal courts are not conclusively bound by state disbarment orders.cook,at citing theard united states.
however a disbarment order handed down by a state court is entitled to due respect.id.quoting theard,at.federal courts also have noted that there are sound practical reasons for deferring to state judgments in this context,explaining that state bars are much larger than federal bars,and with size has come the development of the means to investigate charges of misconduct and resolve factual disputes.id.quoting in re cook,cir.
federal courts should proceed on the presumption that federal courts should recognize the condition created by the judgment of the state court unless certain factors are present including 
that the state procedure from want of notice or opportunity to be heard was wanting in due process,that there was such an infirmity of proof as to facts found to have established the want of fair private and professional character as to give rise to a clear conviction on our part that we could not consistently with our duty accept as final the conclusion on that subject or,that some other grave reason existed which should convince us that to allow the natural consequences of the judgment to have their effect would conflict with the duty which rests upon us not to disbar except upon the conviction that,under the principles of right and justice,we were constrained so to do.
id.at quoting in re selling.thus,federal courts may give considerable weight to the findings and conclusion of the state courts in such disciplinary matters,but it is ultimately the responsibility of the federal courts to determine whether a member of the federal bar is fit to practice in federal court.id.
squire alleges that coughlan violated her due process rights by refusing to disclose to squire the name of every person with whom he may have spoken during the course of his investigation.she further alleges that the record reveals an infirmity of proof as to her bad acts,which must give rise to a clear conviction that this court could not accept as final the ohio supreme court conclusion to disbar her 
due process 
in our past cases involving disbarred or suspended attorneys who claimed either due process or inadequacy of the record violations,we have upheld a district court decision to reciprocally disbar an attorney so long as the district court reasoning in reaching its decision was not totally invalid.in re ruffalo,cir rev on other grounds by ruffalo,u.at.
due process requirements are met where an appellant attended and participated actively in the various hearings,and was afforded an opportunity to present evidence,to testify,to witnesses,and to present argument.ginger circuit court for wayne county,cir in which appellant attorney represented himself.due process requirements are also met where an appellant is given an opportunity to respond to the allegations set forth in the complaint,testify at length in her own defense,present other witnesses and evidence to support her version of events,and is able to make objections to the hearing panel findings and recommendations.cook,at.
squire has not shown that her state proceedings deprived her of due process.the record unequivocally reveals that squire was given notice of all the claims brought against her.in over eight days of hearings recorded in a transcript that runs several thousand pages long,she had ample opportunity to respond to the state charges,to testify in her own defense,to present witnesses and evidence,and to make objections.thus,under our prior precedent,she received due process.see id.
squire claims,however,that due process entitles her to know the identity of every witness against her including,not only the name of every complainant and witness coughlan called at the hearing,but also the names of every person with whom coughlan spoke during the course of his investigation.however,she has provided no legal support for the notion that due process requires that coughlan disclose the names of persons to whom coughlan may have spoken about squire during the course of the investigation,but who did not ultimately testify against squire at her hearing.in her brief,squire cites several supreme court cases to support this notion,but they are inapposite neither the names of undisclosed individuals to whom coughlan may have spoken,nor their statements,were part of the administrative record that resulted in squire disbarment and,thus,she did not need to know their names in order to prepare a meaningful defense.
therefore,we find that failure to disclose the names of those persons to whom coughlan may have spoken during the course of his investigation,but who were not part of the administration record resulting in squire disbarment and did not testify against her,was not a due process violation requiring reversal.thus,we affirm the district court finding.
sufficiency of the record 
coughlan amended complaint listed four counts of misconduct involving forty violations of the code of judicial conduct and twelve violations of the code of professional responsibility.the transcript of squire hearing runs thousands of pages long and includes numerous witnesses who testified to squire misconduct.although the specific incidents are too numerous to list individually,we will highlight misconduct from one count 
in allison,on november,theresa allison requested a civil protective order on behalf of her minor child and filed an amended that specifically enumerated allegations contained in the protective order.although ohio law required squire to hold an ex parte hearing on the same day that the order was filed,she instead ignored allison repeated requests to make a decision regarding the order for several days.
a few days later,judge preiss granted allison an emergency protective order.nicole hall,another attorney,served the emergency protective order on patterson who was in squire conference room with the couple child.hall escorted the child to another floor to await allison arrival.however,shortly thereafter,hall and the child were advised by other attorneys to return to squire courtroom and complied.according to the testimony of allison attorney,mccaughan,when squire saw the child being led through the hallway towards her courtroom,she swoop ed in and grabb ed the child pull ed her and yelled at hall.trial tr.vol.squire allegedly told hall that it was an invalid order.squire kind of grabbed the child who was standing next to hall,and pulled the child over next to squire.squire told hall that squire was going to have hall charged with kidnapping.id.at.according to the record,squire then took service of the emergency protective order back from patterson,id.at but she did not act upon it 
after returning the child to her chambers,squire went to the courtroom and began conducting a proceeding.mccaughan was unsure whether an ex parte hearing or full hearing was taking place,as the hearing did not follow the typical procedures of an ex parte hearing,but it was taking place days before the full hearing was scheduled.when mccaughan asked multiple times for squire to clarify w
