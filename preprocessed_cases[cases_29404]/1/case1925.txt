the principal question in this appeal is whether the public service commission of kentucky the psc correctly applied a superseded federal communications commission fcc regulation on the ground that application of the current regulation to a pending case would be impermissibly retroactive.this issue arises in the context of southeast telephone,attempt to modify the terms of its contract with bellsouth telecommunications.underlying the dispute is a complex statutory and regulatory scheme,as well as important principles of retroactivity analysis.the district court agreed that applying the current fcc rule would be impermissibly retroactive,and thus upheld the administrative ruling.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to vacate the order of the psc.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
in passing the telecommunications act of act,et,congress sought to end the longstanding regime of monopolies in the local telephone markets.at t iowa utils,d.to that end,the act imposes on incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs the obligation to share their existing networks with new entrants to the market,who are referred to as competing local exchange carriers,or clecs.see c.the act,as this court has explained,
specifies three methods of competition the ilec must provide to a clec that has or builds its own local telephone network,interconnection with the ilec network the ilec must provide access to its own network elements on an unbundled basis to a clec wishing to acquire a network by leasing all or part of the ilec network,and the ilec must sell its retail services at wholesale prices to a clec planning simply to resell the incumbent services at retail prices.
michigan bell tele.strand,cir citations omitted.
one of the key obligations imposed by the act is the requirement that ilecs make interconnection and network elements services available to a clec that requests those services.see c.interconnection is the actual physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.network elements,as the name indicates,are individual components of the ilec existing network,including but not limited to,subscriber numbers,databases,signaling systems,and information sufficient for billing and collection.id.these services must be provided on rates,terms and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory.c d.
ilecs are not,however,required to provide these services to clecs free of charge.instead,the act includes specified procedures for forming interconnection agreements,the congressionally prescribed vehicle for implementing the substantive rights and obligations set forth in the act.strand,at.parties may reach these agreements through direct negotiation or arbitration,although the agreements remain subject to the approval of the relevant state regulatory commission.if the agreement is a negotiated one,the state commission may reject it only by finding that the agreement discriminates against a carrier not a party to the agreement,or that the agreement is not consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.e a.state commissions may reject arbitrated agreements that fail to comply with the statutory requirements,including the pricing standards set forth in d of the act.
an additional duty imposed on ilecs is at the heart of this case.section i of the act requires ilecs to make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.this section effectively allows a clec to opt in to the terms of an agreement that an ilec has previously entered into with another carrier and that a state commission has already approved.see bellsouth,universal telecom,wl,at cir.july,explaining that i permits an entrant to a local telephone market to forgo negotiation or arbitration with an incumbent like bellsouth by adopting a previously negotiated or arbitrated interconnection agreement between the incumbent and another carrier.what the statute does not specify,however,is whether a clec that chooses to opt in can do so on a or basis or must instead agree to be bound by the entirety of the existing interconnection agreement.
the fcc initially resolved this ambiguity in favor of the former interpretation when it promulgated what came to be known as the rule.see first report and order,implementation of local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,first report and order.this rule permitted clecs to obtain access under section i to any individual interconnection,service,or network element arrangement on the same terms and conditions as those contained in any agreement approved under section,id.emphasis added,and also instructed state commissions to adjudicate requests on an expedited basis.id.at.the final version of the rule,which was codified at,highlighted the importance of expeditiously processing claims by requiring ilecs to make the covered services and facilities available to clecs without unreasonable delay.id.a.
at the same time,the final rule explicitly permitted ilecs to raise specified challenges before the state commission regarding a clec attempt to opt in to the terms of an existing agreement.three limitations on a clec power to opt in were included in the final rule,and a fourth was set forth in the first report and order.first,an individual agreement was available for opting in only for a reasonable period of time after the approved agreement is available for public inspection under the act.id.c see bellsouth,wl,at recognizing that t he right to adopt an existing interconnection agreement contains several limitations,one of which is time.
the final rule also permitted ilecs to interpose a challenge to the requested opt in on one of two other grounds that t he costs of providing a particular interconnection,service,or element to the requesting clec are greater than the costs of providing it to the telecommunications carrier that originally negotiated the agreement,or that t he provision of a particular interconnection,service,or element to the requesting carrier is not technically feasible.b see also global naps,verizon new england,cir describing these three limitations to a clec opt in rights under i.finally,the fcc explained in its first report and order that ilecs could require a third party to agree to certain terms and conditions beyond the requested service so long as the ilec proved to the state commission that the terms and conditions were legitimately related to the purchase of the individual element being sought.fcc rcd.at.
ilecs across the country challenged the validity of the rule,eventually convincing the eighth circuit to strike it down.see iowa utils.bd.fcc,cir.but the supreme court reversed the eighth circuit,holding that t he fcc interpretation is not only reasonable,it is the most readily apparent.at t iowa utils,d.the court rejected the ilecs contention,endorsed by the eighth circuit,that the rule unreasonably threaten ed the of negotiations because ilecs would not make concessions in any agreement out of fear that all other market entrants could benefit from the same concession.id.at.in so ruling,however,the court emphasized both the protections afforded ilecs by the rule itself and by the fcc statement that an ilec can require a requesting carrier to accept all terms that it can prove are legitimately related to the desired term.id.at.citing the first report and order.the court concluded that the ultimate question of whether the rule would positively or negatively affect negotiations was a matter eminently within the expertise of the commission and eminently beyond our ken.id.
based upon the cumulative experience of the ilecs under the act,the fcc decided to change course in august of.it issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in which it tentatively concluded that the rule discourages bargaining.second report and order,review of the section unbundling obligations of local exchange carriers,fcc rcd,recounting the conclusions announced in the nprm.the fcc then proposed replacing that rule with a new one under which,if an ilec files for and obtains state approval for a statement of generally available terms sgat,the current rule would apply only to that sgat,and all other interconnection agreements would be subject to an rule.id.at.after further study,the fcc jettisoned this proposal and instead promulgated a new rule that was all or nothing across the board.in other words,if a clec wants to adopt a term or service of an existing agreement,it must opt in to the entire agreement.see id.at.
the fcc intended for the new rule to go into effect immediately.specifically,the fcc declared that,in order to allow this regime to have the broadest possible ability to facilitate compromise,the new rule will apply to all effective interconnection agreements,including those approved and in effect before the date the new rule goes into effect.id.at.as of the effective date of the new rule,therefore,the rule will no longer apply to any interconnection agreement.id.under the rule,ilecs are required to make available without unreasonable delay to any requesting clec any agreement in its entirety to which the ilec is a party that is approved by a state commission upon the same rates,terms,and conditions as those provided in the agreement.a emphasis added.the rule became effective on august,one month after its publication in the federal register.see final rule,review of section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers.july.
factual and procedural background 
bellsouth entered into an interconnection agreement with southeast in october of.the agreement contained two clauses relevant to the present controversy.first,paragraph of the agreement governed the resolution of disputes between the parties.that paragraph provided 
except as otherwise stated in this agreement,if any dispute arises as to the interpretation of any provision of this agreement or as to the proper implementation of this agreement,the aggrieved party shall petition the psc for a resolution of the dispute.however,each party reserves any rights it may have to seek judicial review of any ruling made by the psc concerning this agreement.
another provision,paragraph,tracked the language of i,allowing southeast to opt in to any interconnection,service,or network element provided under the existing agreement,but also requiring southeast to adopt all rates,terms,and conditions legitimately related to the other terms that it chose.the psc approved bellsouth agreement with southeast in november of.
over a year later,bellsouth entered into a separate arbitrated agreement with cinergy communications company,another clec.the provision of the agreement with cinergy differed in two notable ways from the one signed by southeast.first,the provision permitted the parties to avail themselves of any available legal remedies in the appropriate forum with respect to all issues over which the psc does not have authority.second,the cinergy agreement required the parties to carry on their respective obligations under the agreement while any dispute resolution is pending.the purpose of this latter clause was to ensure that cinergy retained access to bellsouth facilities and would thus continue to be able to serve its any legal battles with bellsouth.
on june,southeast filed with the kentucky psc a notice of intent to adopt certain provisions of bellsouth agreement with cinergy.the only provision that southeast sought to adopt was the one governing resolution of disputes.southeast expressed in the notice its intent to be bound by the terms of numerical paragraphs and subsection of the cinergy agreement.those terms would replace the ones contained in paragraph of southeast agreement with bellsouth.insisting that its request should be reviewed expeditiously and promptly granted,southeast asked the psc to a pprov e the request and mak e the amendment to the interconnection agreement effective as of the date of the order.
bellsouth opposed southeast request and filed a formal objection with the psc on june.in its filing,bellsouth argued that southeast was not entitled to adopt the provision for two reasons.the first was that the plain language of both i and the rule in effect at the time required ilecs to make available to clecs only interconnection s,service s or network element s.bellsouth argued that the provision did not fall under any of these categories,so that southeast was not entitled to opt in to it.second,bellsouth read its agreement with southeast as obliging southeast to submit any proposed modifications to bellsouth before invoking the authority of the psc.
the psc issued its order on september.by that time,the rule,which had been published in the federal register as having an effective date of august,had already supplanted the rule.under the new rule,as the psc acknowledged,southeast request would have to be rejected.the psc nevertheless concluded,in a analysis,that southeast adoption notice should be reviewed under the law as it existed when the notice was filed.according to the psc,the procedures sought by southeast are an integral term and condition of a contract and directly relate to the provision of interconnection,service,or network elements.southeast request to adopt the provision from the cinergy agreement was therefore granted.
bellsouth requested a rehearing,which the psc denied.the psc denial order was accompanied by an explanation of its decision to apply the fcc rule in effect at the time of southeast request.under the psc longstanding practice,the explanation read,southeast request would have been granted by order within a few days of receipt but for bellsouth objections.in other words,southeast request would have allegedly been granted before the rule took effect had bellsouth not filed objections.the psc was concerned that applying the new rule to the pending request would give ilecs an incentive to delay proceedings when matters are pending in order to invoke beneficial changes in the law.because the psc would ordinarily have entered its order approximately one month prior to the effective date of the new rule,the psc decided that applying the new rule to southeast adoption request would have been unjust.
bellsouth challenged the decision of the psc in the district court,arguing that the psc erred in refusing to apply the rule to southeast pending adoption request,and under the plain language of the statute and the rule,southeast was not entitled to adopt the provision because that provision was not an interconnection,service,or network element arrangement.the district court rejected both of these arguments and upheld the psc decision.
as to bellsouth first challenge,the district court applied the framework set forth by the supreme court in landgraf usi film products.establishing a analysis for determining whether an intervening change in the law can be properly applied to a pending case.the court first concluded that the fcc had not expressly defined the temporal reach of the new rule.at the second step of the landgraf analysis,the district court reasoned that the mandatory language in i granted southeast a vested right to adopt terms contained in other bellsouth agreements while the rule was still in effect.that vested right would be impaired,the court reasoned,by application of the rule.the court thus held that applying the new rule would be impermissibly retroactive and that,because congress had not explicitly endorsed such a result,the presumption against retroactivity controlled.
with respect to bellsouth second challenge,the district court read the statute and regulation as allowing clecs to opt into all terms and conditions of existing agreements,and ruled that provisions are an integral term and condition of the agreements under which ilecs provide services.finally,the court rejected bellsouth contention that the provision was legitimately related to other terms of the cinergy agreement and that southeast could adopt that provision only by adopting these other terms.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the ruling of a state administrative body under two separate standards.questions of law,in particular a state commission interpretation of the act,are reviewed de novo.see michigan bell tele.mcimetro access transmission,cir we review the commission interpretation of the act de novo,according little deference.on the other hand,a state commission findings of fact made in the course of exercising its enforcement authority are reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.michigan bell tele.strand,cir.the question presented by this applying the rule to southeast pending application would have had an impermissible retroactive a purely legal one that we will review de novo.see mcimetro access,at.
b.the district court erred in concluding that application of the rule to southeast request would have had an impermissible retroactive effect 
the supreme court has struggled in recent years to resolve the apparent tension between two seemingly contradictory statements found in its decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes in the law.landgraf usi film.as a general rule,a court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.id.at.quoting bradley school bd.of richmond,d quotation marks omitted.because r etroactivity is not favored in the law,however,courts should not construe congressional enactments and administrative rules to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.id.quoting bowen georgetown,d quotation marks omitted.in other words,courts should apply the law in effect at the time that they decide a case unless that law would have an impermissible retroactive effect as that concept is defined by the supreme court.see patel gonzales,cir courts should apply the law in effect at the time of the decision,unless such law has a retroactive effect on the parties.
the difficult issue in these cases is deciding under what circumstances a statute or regulation operates retroactively.answering this question,as the supreme court has noted,is not always a simple or mechanical task.landgraf,at.for one thing,a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment,or upsets expectations based in prior law.id.at.citation omitted.courts must accordingly ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment,id.at,such as by impair ing rights a party possessed when he acted,increas ing a party liability for past conduct,or impos ing new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.at.in making this determination,courts take sound guidance from familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.at.
the supreme court recently confirmed the sequence of analysis to be employed when an objection is made to applying a particular statute said to affect a vested right or to impose some burden on the basis of an act or event preceding the statute enactment.gonzales,d.a reviewing court must first examine 
whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach,and in the absence of language as helpful as that we try to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal reach specifically intended by applying our normal rules of construction.if that effort fails,we ask whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.if the answer is yes,we then apply the presumption against retroactivity by construing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in question owing to the absence of a clear indication from congress that it intended such a result.
id.citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
the district court in the present case concluded,and none of the parties dispute,that the fcc rule does not set forth its temporal reach,and that neither congress nor the fcc has addressed the application of the new regulation to pending cases.under the framework set forth above,therefore,the dispositive question before us is whether applying the rule to southeast request would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.see id.citation,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
applying the rule to southeast request would not be impermissibly retroactive 
at the heart of the dispute lies southeast contention,accepted by the district court,that southeast acquired a vested right to adopt the provision in question upon filing its notice of intent with the psc.southeast principal argument,therefore,is that applying the rule to its adoption request would impair a vested right and be impermissibly retroactive under landgraf.see at.endorsing justice story statement that a statute that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws must be deemed retrospective.we agree with bellsouth,however,that a proper understanding of the statutory framework demonstrates that southeast acquired no vested rights upon the filing of its adoption request.
neither i of the act nor the fcc regulations interpreting it create an unconditional right or guarantee that a clec adoption request will be granted.to the contrary,both the rule and the current rule contemplate a regime under which ilecs retain the ability to challenge requests.the rule,as explained in part above,permitted ilecs to oppose an adoption request on the bases of comparable cost and technical feasibility,and also on the ground that the clec waited too long after the publication of the original agreement to invoke its right.see also bellsouth,universal telecom,wl,at cir.july,explaining that the regulation by its terms links the reasonableness of an adoption to the passage of time.
in addition to the above three grounds,the first report and order included a fourth limitation on the right,allowing ilecs to require a requesting carrier to accept all terms that it can prove are legitimately related to the desired term.at t iowa utils,d quoting the first report and order.these grounds for challenging a clec entitlement to opt in to an existing agreement would be meaningless if,as southeast and the psc maintain,southeast adoption request became effective and binding at the moment that the request was filed.
a recent decision by the first circuit also refutes southeast contention that the right conferred by the act and the regulation was unconditional and automatic.see global naps,verizon new england,cir.in that case,the clec global naps entered into unsuccessful negotiations with the ilec verizon new england.the parties eventually asked that the disputed aspects of their negotiation be arbitrated by the massachusetts state commission,which resolved the open issues and ordered the parties to incorporate the terms into their agreement by a certain date.id.at.before that deadline passed,however,global naps refused to accede to the arbitrated agreement and instead sought to opt in to an existing agreement between verizon and sprint.id.at.the state commission denied global naps request and ordered it to comply with the commission previous ruling.id.at.both the district court and the first circuit affirmed.
in a section of its analysis especially pertinent to the present case,the first circuit rejected global naps contention that i gives it an unconditional right to opt into a previously available agreement.id.at.reading that section in light of the structure and intent of the statute,the first circuit concluded that i is written in terms of an obligation on the part of ilecs to make agreements available to potential clecs,not as an unconditional right.id.at emphasis added.the court then interpreted the fcc the rule in supporting the same conclusion.it reasoned as follows 
the fcc regulation itself rejects global naps premise that i grants an unconditional right to clecs to adopt the terms of any interconnection agreement the ilec has with another clec.the obligation of ilecs to make those agreements available to other clecs is itself subject to conditions,and the restrictions are three such conditions contemplated by the regulation.
the first circuit analysis elucidates two propositions crucial in the context of the present case.first,i speaks in terms of an ilec obligations,not in terms of a clec rights.the second and related proposition is that,because the obligations of the ilec are not absolute,any concomitant rights conferred upon clecs are similarly limited and therefore conditional.
if a clec rights are conditional,upon what are they conditioned the answer,simply stated,is that the right to adopt the provision of an existing agreement is contingent upon a state commission determination that such an adoption is proper under the statute and the governing regulation.southeast appears to concede this point in part,admitting that the kentucky psc had to formally approve the revision to the interconnection agreement,and bellsouth had the option to propose to incorporate additional terms and conditions in connection with the provision that southeast specified for opt in.in the next breath,however,southeast insists that its vested opt in right was not contingent upon the psc process for approving the revised agreement because such a result would contravene the fcc statement that clecs need not undergo a lengthy negotiation and approval process before being able to utilize the terms of a previously approved agreement.see first report and order,fcc rcd.at.
but southeast can not have it both in to the existing agreement either was or was not an event at the moment that the request was filed.southeast acknowledgment that its attempt to revise the agreement did not become final until the psc approved its request contradicts its argument that the psc approval process amounted to a recognition of an event.if,as southeast appears to concede,the request did not become final until approval by the psc,then the event simply was not completed at the time of filing.this conclusion is confirmed by the language that southeast itself used in the adoption request,where it asked the psc to a pprov e the request and mak e the amendment to the interconnection agreement effective as of the date of the order.emphasis added.again,if the opt in was truly finalized at the time the request was filed,one would expect southeast to have sought a nunc pro tunc order in which the psc formally approved the adoption and made it effective as of the date of the initial request.but southeast sought nothing of the kind.
a hypothetical example might help to illuminate the problematic nature of southeast position.assume that the provision in the original agreement called for the parties to submit all disputes to the psc.the provision in the cinergy agreement,in contrast,allows the parties to take disputes falling outside the psc jurisdiction directly to court.southeast proceeds to file its adoption request on june,with the expectation that the psc will act on that request in a matter of weeks.assume now that a major dispute outside of the psc jurisdiction arises between southeast and bellsouth on june,well before the psc is expected to act.could southeast immediately invoke the new provision that it has sought to adopt and thus file suit against bellsouth directly in court,rather than file a grievance with the psc we believe that the proper answer is clearly no,because southeast can not invoke a provision that has not yet been declared part of the contract between the parties.
this hypothetical illustrates a point convincingly pressed by bellsouth in its briefs that filing an application with an agency does not generally confer upon the applicant an inviolable right to have the agency rule on the application pursuant to the regulations in effect at the time of filing.see pine tree med.assocs.sec.of health and human,cir agreeing with the district court ruling that the mere filing of an application is not the kind of completed transaction in which a party could fairly expect stability of the relevant laws as of the transaction date.in pine tree medical associates,the plaintiff,a provider of healthcare services,requested that a government agency designate a particular town as a medically underserved population,or mup.id.at.healthcare providers that serve mups may be eligible for substantial,reimbursement under medicare and medicare programs.id.the agency altered the guidelines used to make the mup determination after the provider had submitted an application but before the agency had ruled.using the stricter guidelines for evaluating the provider request,the agency then denied the application.id.the first circuit found no retroactivity problem with the use of the new guidelines,squarely rejecting the proposition that filing an application with an agency essentially fixes an entitlement to the application of those substantive regulations in force on the filing date.id.at emphasis in original.
we agree with bellsouth that the district court attempt to distinguish pine tree medical associates is unconvincing.the district court reasoned that the healthcare provider had sought a prospective benefit,whereas southeast notif ied an agency of a preexisting right to adopt.we have two responses to this line of reasoning.the first is that the distinction strikes us as one without a difference.just as the healthcare provider in pine tree medical associates claimed that it was entitled to a statutory benefit under the regulations in effect at the time,southeast argues that it was entitled to the statutory benefit under an fcc regulation that was in effect at the time of its application but repealed by the time that its request was decided.procedurally,therefore,the present case is on all fours with pine tree medical associates.
second,the relief sought by southeast,although not a governmental benefit,nevertheless tilts toward being prospective in nature.because the new provision would take effect as of the date of the psc order,that provision would govern only the future relations between the parties.applying new statutes or regulations that authorize or affect the propriety of prospective relief,the supreme court has said,does not raise retroactivity concerns.landgraf,at.the court in landgraf gave as an example of such a statute one that governed the propriety of injunctive relief against labor picketing.id.while the effect that a newly enacted regulation has on how parties future disputes will be resolved is not directly analogous to the court injunction example,the fact that applying the rule would deprive southeast of only a future contractual benefit serves to distinguish the present case from the quintessentially backward looking damages provisions held to be impermissibly retroactive in landgraf.id.at.
one other aspect of landgraf is particularly instructive in the present context.the supreme court in that case emphasized that a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it upsets expectations based in prior law.id.at.emphasis added.at the end of that sentence,the court added an explanatory footnote elaborating on why a statute potential to upset expectations that a party had formed based upon the prior state of the law was not enough,in and of itself,to make application of that statute impermissibly retroactive 
even uncontroversially prospective statutes may unsettle expectations and impose burdens on past conduct a new property tax or zoning regulation may upset the reasonable expectations that prompted those affected to acquire property a new law banning gambling harms the person who had begun to construct a casino before the law enactment or spent his life learning to count cards.see fuller,the morality of law if every time a man relied on existing law in arranging his affairs,he were made secure against any change in legal rules,the whole body of our law would be ossified forever.moreover,a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.
id.at.citations and quotation marks omitted.in other words,the fact that parties engage in conduct on the assumption that the law will allow them to act or to benefit in a certain manner is not a sufficient reason to refuse to apply a ne
