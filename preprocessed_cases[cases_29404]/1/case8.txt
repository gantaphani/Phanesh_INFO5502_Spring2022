article ii of the constitution requires that the president obtain the advice and consent of the senate before appointing officers of the united states.cl.given this provision,the responsibilities of an office requiring presidential appointment and senate confirmation pas office may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and the president and senate can not promptly agree on a replacement.congress has accounted for this reality by giving the president limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant pas office without first obtaining senate approval.
the current version of that authorization is the federal vacancies reform act of fvra.section a of the fvra permits three categories of government officials to perform acting service in a vacant pas office.subsection a prescribes the general rule that,if a vacancy arises in a pas office,the first assistant to that office shall perform the office functions and duties temporarily in an acting capacity.subsections a and a provide that,notwithstanding paragraph,the president may direct a person already serving in another pas office,or a senior employee in the relevant agency,to serve in an acting capacity instead.
section also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.subsection b states notwithstanding subsection a,a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section if the president nominates him for the vacant pas office and,during the period preceding the vacancy,the person did not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or served in that position for less than days.
the general counsel of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board is a pas office.in june,a vacancy arose in that office,and the president directed lafe solomon to serve as acting general counsel.solomon qualified for acting service under subsection a of the fvra,because he was a senior employee at the nlrb.in january,the president nominated solomon to serve as the nlrb general counsel on a permanent basis.the senate never took action on the nomination,and the president ultimately withdrew solomon name in favor of a new candidate,whom the senate confirmed in october.throughout this entire period solomon served as the acting general counsel to the nlrb.
in january,an nlrb regional director,exercising authority on solomon behalf,issued an unfair labor practices complaint against respondent sw general.an administrative law judge concluded that sw general had committed unfair labor practices,and the nlrb agreed.sw general sought review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit,arguing that the complaint was invalid because,under subsection b of the fvra,solomon could not perform the duties of general counsel to the nlrb after having been nominated to fill that position.the nlrb countered that subsection b applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection a,not to acting officers who,like solomon,serve under a or a.the court of appeals vacated the board order.it concluded that the prohibition on acting service by nominees contained in subsection b applies to all acting officers,regardless of whether they serve pursuant to subsection a,a,or a.as a result,solomon became ineligible to perform the duties of general counsel in an acting capacity once the president nominated him to fill that post.
subsection b of the fvra prevents a person who has been nominated to fill a vacant pas office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity.the prohibition applies to anyone performing acting service under the fvra.it is not limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection a.
a the text of the fvra requires this conclusion.
subsection b applies to any person and prohibits service as an acting officer for an office under this section.person has an expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the fvra.see pfizer government of india.and under this section clarifies that subsection b applies to all of the fvra contains to specific subsections and paragraphs.but subsection b refers to,which contains all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.the rest of the fvra also uses the pairing of person and section to encompass anyone serving as an acting officer under the fvra,and congress could readily have used more specific language if it intended subsection b to apply only to first assistants acting under a.
the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstanding subsection a confirms the breadth of the prohibition on acting service by nominees.in statutes,notwithstanding clauses show that one provision prevails over another in the event of a conflict.here,that means that subsection b applies even when it conflicts with the default rule in a that first assistants shall perform acting duties.
the board argues that,because the phrase notwithstanding subsection a does not mention a or a,congress did not intend the prohibition in subsection b to apply to people serving as acting officers under those provisions.the board relies on the interpretive canon,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,expressing one item of an associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.chevron echazabal,internal quotation marks omitted.
this interpretive canon applies,however,only when circumstances support a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.at.a notwithstanding clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.singling out one conflict generally does not suggest that other,unaddressed conflicts should be resolved in the opposite manner.here,the conflict between a and b is unique the former uses mandatory language the first assistant shall perform acting duties while the latter identifies who may not serve as an acting officer.the notwithstanding clause clarifies that the mandatory language in subsection a does not prevail over subsection b in the event of a conflict.subsections a and a lack that mandatory language,so the natural inference is that congress left these provisions out of the notwithstanding clause because they differ from subsection a,not to implicitly exempt them from the prohibition in subsection b.
moreover,subsection b specifies that b shall not apply to certain people who are serving as the first assistant.if b applied only to first assistants,stating that limitation would be superfluous.
b because the text is clear,the board arguments about legislative history,purpose,and practice need not be considered.in any event,its arguments are not compelling.
the original draft of the fvra contained a prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers,but explicitly limited that prohibition to first assistants.the board argues that,when congress revised this original draft,it made changes to give the president more flexibility to appoint acting officers and did not intend to broaden the prohibition on nominees performing acting service.the glitch in this argument is that congress did change the prohibition on nominees performing acting service,revising it to clearly apply to all acting officers.the fact that certain senators stated that they wanted to give the president more flexibility to appoint acting officials does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.nor does a statement by one of the sponsors of the fvra who said that subsection b applies only to first assistants overcome the clear text,particularly given that the very next senator to speak offered a contradictory account of the provision.
the board also argues that,since the fvra was enacted,congress has not objected when presidents have nominated individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsection a or a,and that the office of legal counsel and government accountability office have issued guidance construing subsection b to apply only to first assistants.relying on nlrb noel canning,the board contends that this historical practice is entitled to significant weight.
h istorical practice is too grand a title for the board evidence.the fvra was not enacted until,and the evidence the board cites is not significant enough to warrant the conclusion that congress failure to speak up implies that it has acquiesced in the view that subsection b applies only to first assistants.by contrast,the court decision in noel canning dealt with the president constitutional authority under the recess appointments clause an issue that had attracted intense attention from presidents,attorneys general,and the senate dating back to the beginning of the republic.
applying the fvra to this case is straightforward.subsection b prohibited solomon from continuing his service as acting general counsel once the president nominated him to fill the position permanently.the president could have appointed another person to serve as acting officer in solomon place,but did not do so.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
article ii of the constitution requires that the president obtain the advice and consent of the senate before appointing officers of the united states.cl.given this provision,the responsibilities of an office requiring presidential appointment and senate confirmation known as a pas office may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and the president and senate can not promptly agree on a replacement.congress has long accounted for this reality by authorizing the president to direct certain officials to temporarily carry out the duties of a vacant pas office in an acting capacity,without senate confirmation.
the federal vacancies reform act of fvra,et,is the latest version of that authorization.section a of the fvra authorizes three classes of government officials to become acting officers.the general rule is that the first assistant to a vacant office shall become the acting officer.the president may override that default rule by directing either a person serving in a different pas office or a senior employee within the relevant agency to become the acting officer instead.
the fvra,however,prohibits certain persons from serving as acting officers if the president has nominated them to fill the vacant office permanently.the question presented is whether that limitation applies only to first assistants who have automatically assumed acting duties,or whether it also applies to pas officers and senior employees serving as acting officers at the president behest.we hold that it applies to all three categories of acting officers.
the senate advice and consent power is a critical structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme.edmond united states.the framers envisioned it as an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the president and a guard against the appointment of unfit characters from family connection,from personal attachment,or from a view to popularity.the federalist,rossiter ed.hamilton.the constitutional process of presidential appointment and senate confirmation,however,can take time the president may not promptly settle on a nominee to fill an office the senate may be unable,or unwilling,to speedily confirm the nominee once submitted.yet neither may desire to see the duties of the vacant office go unperformed in the interim.
since president washington first term,congress has given the president limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant pas office without first obtaining senate approval.the earliest statutes authorized the appointment of any person or persons to fill specific vacancies in the departments of state,treasury,and war.act of may,ch,stat.congress at first allowed acting officers to serve until the permanent officeholder could resume his duties or a successor was appointed,but soon imposed a limit on acting service,act of,ch,stat.
congress revisited the issue in the,ultimately passing the vacancies act of.the vacancies act expanded the number of pas offices that the president could fill with acting officers.act of july,ch,stat.see also act of,ch,stat.with that expansion came new constraints.the authority to appoint any person or persons as an acting officer gave way to a default rule that the first or sole assistant shall perform that function,with an exception allowing the president to instead fill the post with a person already serving in a pas office.stat.and rather than six months of acting service,the vacancies act generally authorized only ten days.ibid.that narrow window of acting service was later lengthened to days.act of,ch,stat.
during the and,interbranch conflict arose over the vacancies act.the department of justice took the position that,in many instances,the head of an executive agency had independent authority apart from the vacancies act to temporarily fill vacant offices.the comptroller general disagreed,arguing that the act was the exclusive authority for temporarily filling vacancies in executive agencies.see rosenberg,congressional research service report for congress,the new vacancies act congress acts to protect the senate confirmation prerogative rosenberg.congress then amended the vacancies act to clarify that it applies to such agencies,while at the same time lengthening the term of permissible acting service to days,with a tolling period while a nomination is pending,at see presidential transitions effectiveness act,stat.
but tensions did not ease.by,approximately percent of pas offices in executive agencies were occupied by temporary designees,most of whom had served beyond the limitation period without presidential submissions of nominations.rosenberg.these acting officers filled positions,sometimes in obvious contravention of the senate wishes.one,for instance,was brought in from outside government to serve as acting assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the justice department,immediately after the senate refused to confirm him for that very office.see rosenberg,congressional research service,validity of designation of bill lann lee as acting assistant attorney general for civil rights.perceiving a threat to the senate advice and consent power,see rosenberg,congress acted again.in,it replaced the vacancies act with the fvra.
section a of the fvra permits three categories of government officials to perform acting service in a vacant pas office.subsection a prescribes a general rule if a person serving in a pas office dies,resigns,or is otherwise unable to perform his duties,the first assistant to that office shall perform the office functions and duties temporarily in an acting capacity.
the next two paragraphs of a identify alternatives.subsection a provides that notwithstanding paragraph,the president may direct a person who already serves in a pas office to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity.subsection a adds that notwithstanding paragraph,the president may direct a person to perform acting duties if the person served in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least days in the period preceding the vacancy 
section also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.subsection b states notwithstanding subsection a,a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section if the president nominates him for the vacant pas office and,during the period preceding the vacancy,the individual did not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or served in that position for less than days.subsection b creates an exception to this prohibition,providing that p aragraph shall not apply to any person serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the senate advice and consent.
other sections of the fvra establish time limits on acting service and penalties for noncompliance.in most cases,the statute permits acting service for days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs tolls that time limit while a nomination is pending and starts a new clock if the nomination is rejected,withdrawn,or returned.a b.upon a second nomination,the time limit tolls once more,and an acting officer can serve an additional days if the second nomination proves unsuccessful.b.the fvra ensures compliance by providing that,in general,any function or duty of a vacant office performed by a person not properly serving under the statute shall have no force or effect.d.
the national labor relations board nlrb or board is charged with administering the national labor relations act.by statute,its general counsel must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate.d.
in june,the nlrb general counsel who had been serving with senate confirmation resigned.the president directed lafe solomon to serve temporarily as the nlrb acting general counsel,citing the fvra as the basis for the appointment.see memorandum from president barack obama to solomon june.solomon satisfied the requirements for acting service under subsection a of the fvra because he had spent the previous ten years in the senior position of director of the nlrb office of representation appeals.
the president had bigger plans for solomon than acting service.on january,he nominated solomon to serve as the nlrb general counsel on a permanent basis.the senate had other ideas.that body did not act upon the nomination during the congress,so it was returned to the president when the legislative session expired.cong.rec.the president resubmitted solomon name for consideration in the spring of,at may,but to no avail.the president ultimately withdrew solomon nomination and put forward a new candidate,whom the senate confirmed on october,at.throughout this entire period,solomon served as the nlrb acting general counsel.
solomon responsibilities included exercising final authority to issue complaints alleging unfair labor practices.d,b.in january,an nlrb regional director,exercising authority on solomon behalf,issued a complaint alleging that respondent sw general,a company that provides ambulance services had improperly failed to pay certain bonuses to employees.an administrative law judge concluded that sw general had committed unfair labor practices,and the nlrb agreed.
sw general filed a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.it argued that the unfair labor practices complaint was invalid because,under subsection b of the fvra,solomon could not legally perform the duties of general counsel after having been nominated to fill that position.the nlrb defended solomon actions.it contended that subsection b applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection a,not to acting officers who,like solomon,serve under a or a.
the court of appeals granted sw general petition for review and vacated the board order.it reasoned that the text of subsection b squarely supports the conclusion that the provision restriction on nominees serving as acting officers applies to all acting officers,no matter whether they serve pursuant to subsection a,a or a.cadc.as a result,solomon became ineligible to serve as acting general counsel once the president nominated him to be general counsel.at we granted certiorari,and now affirm.
subsection b of the fvra prevents a person who has been nominated for a vacant pas office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity.in full,it states 
notwithstanding subsection a,a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section,if 
a during the period preceding the date of the death,resignation,or beginning of inability to serve,such person 
i did not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer or 
ii served in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than days and 
b the president submits a nomination of such person to the senate for appointment to such office.
subsection b adds that p aragraph shall not apply to a person serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the advice and consent of the senate.
we conclude that the prohibition in subsection b applies to anyone performing acting service under the fvra.it is not,as the board contends,limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection a.the text of the prohibition extends to any person who serves as an acting officer under this section,not just to first assistants serving under subsection a.the phrase n otwithstanding subsection a does not limit the reach of b,but instead clarifies that the prohibition applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that first assistants shall perform acting duties.
our analysis of subsection b begins with its text.subsection b applies to any person and prohibits service as an acting officer for an office under this section.the key words are person and section.they clearly indicate that b applies to all acting officers under,regardless of the means of appointment.
start with person.the word has a naturally expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the fvra.see pfizer government of india.important as they may be,first assistants are not the only person s of the bunch.
now add under this section.the language clarifies that subsection b applies to all persons serving under.congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes section,subsection,paragraph,and on down the line.see koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,filson,the legislative drafter desk reference.congress used that structure in the fvra and relied on it to make precise.when congress wanted to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph,it said so.see,a subsection b b paragraph but in b congress referred to the entire section which subsumes all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.
the rest of the fvra uses the pairing of person and section the same way.section,for example,specifies how long the person serving as an acting officer as described under section may serve in the office.emphasis added.and d describes the consequences of noncompliance with the fvra by referring to the actions taken by any person who is not acting under section,or.emphasis added.no one disputes that both provisions apply to anyone serving as an acting officer under the fvra,not just first assistants serving under subsection a.
had congress intended subsection b to apply only to first assistants acting under a,it could easily have chosen clearer language.replacing person with first assistant would have done the trick.so too would replacing under this section with under subsection a.the fact that congress did not adopt either readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports the conclusion that subsection b applies to any acting officer appointed under any provision within.knight commissioner.
the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstanding subsection a confirms that the prohibition on acting service applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that the first assistant shall perform acting duties.the ordinary meaning of notwithstanding is in spite of,or without prevention or obstruction from or by.webster third new international dictionary black law dictionary ed.despite in spite of in statutes,the word shows which provision prevails in the event of a clash.scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.subsection a sets the rule that first assistants shall perform the vacant office functions and duties in an acting capacity.but the notwithstanding clause in subsection b means that,even if a first assistant is serving as an acting officer under this statutory mandate,he must cease that service if the president nominates him to fill the vacant pas office.that subsection b also applies to acting officers serving at the president behest is already clear from the broad text of the independent clause they are all person s serving under this section.
the board takes a different view of the phrase n otwithstanding subsection a.it begins by noting that a uses three different subsections to create three separate paths for becoming an acting official.reply brief.the prohibition in subsection b,the board continues,applies n otwithstanding only one of these subsections subsection a.ibid.in the board view,singling out subsection a carries a negative implication that congress did not intend subsection b to override the alternative mechanisms for acting service in subsections a and a.at.
we disagree.the board relies on the interpretive canon,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,expressing one item of an associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.chevron echazabal,quoting united states vonn.if a sign at the entrance to a zoo says come see the elephant,lion,hippo,and giraffe,and a temporary sign is added saying the giraffe is sick,you would reasonably assume that the others are in good health.
the force of any negative implication,however,depends on context.marx general revenue,slip,at.the expressio unius canon applies only when circumstances support a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.echazabal,at.a notwithstanding clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.such a clause confirms rather than constrains breadth.singling out one potential conflict might suggest that congress thought the conflict was particularly difficult to resolve,or was quite likely to arise.but doing so generally does not imply anything about other,unaddressed conflicts,much less that they should be resolved in the opposite manner.
suppose a radio station announces we play your favorite hits from the,and.notwithstanding the fact that we play hits from the,we do not play music by british bands.you would not tune in expecting to hear the british band the clash any more than the beatles.the station,after all,has announced that we do not play music by british bands.the notwithstanding clause just establishes that this applies even to music from the,when british bands were prominently featured on the charts.no one,however,would think the station singled out the to convey implicitly that its categorical statement we do not play music by british bands actually did not apply to the and.
drawing a negative inference from the notwithstanding clause in subsection b is similarly inapt.without that clause,subsection b plainly would apply to all persons serving as acting officers under a.adding notwithstanding subsection a makes sense because a conflicts with b in a unique manner.the former is mandatory and the first assistant shall perform acting duties.the latter,by contrast,speaks to who may not be an acting officer.so if a vacancy arises and the president nominates the first assistant to fill the position,a says the first assistant shall perform the duties of that office in an acting capacity while the nomination is pending,and b says he may not.the notwithstanding clause clarifies that the language of a does not prevail if that conflict occurs.
compare the mandatory language of subsection a to a and a.people appointed under those provisions are just as much acting officers as first assistants who assume the role.but there is no freestanding directive that they perform acting duties subsections a and a just say that the president may direct them to do so.the natural inference,then,is that congress left these provisions out of the notwithstanding clause because they are different from subsection a,not to exempt from the broad prohibition in subsection b those officers serving under a and a.
indeed,notwithstanding is used the same way in other parts of.subsections a and a are each preceded by the phrase notwithstanding paragraph.the phrase recognizes that subsection a is unique,and resolves the potential conflict between the mandatory shall perform in that provision and the permissive may direct in a and a.but it implies nothing about other potential conflicts that may arise in the statutory scheme.in subsection b,it works the same way the notwithstanding clause simply shows that b overrides a,and nothing more.
step back from the board focus on notwithstanding and another problem appears its interpretation of subsection b makes a mess of b.subsection b specifies that b shall not apply to any person if a that person is serving as the first assistant b the first assistant position is itself a pas office and c the senate has approved the appointment of such person to that office.
the board interpretation makes the first requirement superfluous,a result we typically try to avoid.williams taylor,it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.if subsection b applied only to first assistants,there would be no need to state the requirement in b a that such person is serving as the first assistant.the board proposes that congress did so for clarity,but the same could be said of most superfluous language.
the board and the dissent counter that applying the prohibition in subsection b to anyone performing acting service under a has its own problem doing so would also require applying it to c,which would nullify that provision.reply brief.the dissent deems this no way to read a statute.post,at.
we agree,and it is not the way we read it.under our reading,subsection b has no effect on c.subsection b addresses nominations generally,prohibiting any person who has been nominated to fill any vacant office from performing that office duties in an acting capacity.subsection c speaks to a specific nomination scenario when a person is nominated by the president for reappointment for an additional term to the same office without a break in service.in this particular situation,the fvra authorizes the nominee to continue to serve in that office.c.i t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank.the general prohibition on acting service by nominees yields to the more specific authorization allowing officers up for reappointment to remain at their posts.applying subsection b to a hardly compels a different result.
the text of subsection b is clear subject to one narrow exception,it prohibits anyone who has been nominated to fill a vacant pas office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity,regardless of whether the acting officer was appointed under subsection a,a,or a.it is not limited to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under a.
the board contends that legislative history,purpose,and practice uniformly show that subsection b applies only to first assistants.the text is clear,so we need not consider this evidence.see state farm fire casualty united states ex rel.rigsby,slip,at.in any event,the board evidence is not compelling.
the board argues that subsection b was designed to serve a specific purpose preventing the president from having his nominee serve as an acting officer by making him first assistant after or right before a vacancy arises.brief for petitioner.the original draft of the fvra authorized first assistants and pas officers to perform acting service.subsection b of that draft provided that if a first assistant was nominated to fill the vacant office,he could not perform that office duties in an acting capacity unless he had been the first assistant for at least days before the vacancy.several senators thought the fvra too restrictive.they asked to add senior agency officials to the list of potential acting officers and to shorten the requirement in subsection b.their requests,the board says,were granted the final version of the fvra included subsection a for senior employees and shortened the requirement to days.there was no intent to extend the prohibition in subsection b beyond first assistants,at.
the glitch in this argument is of course the text of subsection b.congress did amend the statute to allow senior employees to become acting officers under subsection a.the only substantive change that was requested in b was to reduce the requirement.congress could have done that with a few tweaks to the original version of subsection b.instead,congress went further it also removed language that expressly limited subsection b to first assistants.and it added a provision subsection b that makes sense only if b applies to all acting officers.in short,congress took a provision that explicitly applied only to first assistants and turned it into one that applies to all acting officers.
the board protests that congress would not have expanded the prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers after senators asked to give the president more flexibility.see brief for petitioner.that certain senators made specific demands,however,does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.passing a law often requires compromise,where even the most firm public demands bend to competing interests.see ragsdale wolverine world wide.what congress ultimately agrees on is the text that it enacts,not the preferences expressed by certain legislators.see oncale sundowner offshore services,i t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.
compromise is precisely what happened here a period of intense negotiations took place after senators demanded changes to the original draft of the fvra,and the final bill was a compromise measure.rosenberg.the legislation as passed did expand the pool of individuals the president could appoint as acting officers,by adding senior employees in subsection a.but it also expanded the scope of the limitation on acting service in b,by dropping the language making b applicable only to first assistants.
the board contends that this compromise must not have happened because senator thompson,one of the sponsors of the fvra,said that subsection b applies only when the acting officer is the first assistant,and not when the acting officer is designated by the president pursuant to a or a.cong.rec.but senator byrd the very next speaker offered a contradictory account a nominee may not serve as an acting officer if he is not the first assistant or has been the first assistant for less than days,and has not been confirmed for the position.at.this is a good example of why floor statements by individual legislators rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.see milner department of navy,those of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text.we will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.
finally,the board supports its interpretation with practice.it notes that the office of legal counsel and the government accountability office have issued guidance construing subsection b to apply only to first assistants.and three presidents have,without congressional objection,submitted the nominations of individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsections a and a.the board contends that this historical practice is entitled to significant weight because the fvra concern s the allocation of power between two elected branches of government.brief for petitioner quoting nlrb noel canning,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
h istorical practice is too grand a title for the board evidence.the fvra was not enacted until,and the nominations that the board cites make up less than two percent of the thousands of nominations to positions in executive agencies that the senate has considered in the years since its passage.even the guidance documents the board cites paid the matter little attention both made conclusory statements about subsection b,with no analysis.
in this context,congress failure to speak up does not fairly imply that it has acquiesced in the board interpretation.see zuber allen,alexander sandoval.the senate may not have noticed that certain nominees were serving as acting officers in violation of the fvra,or it may have chosen not to reject a qualified candidate just to make a point about compliance with the statute.either is at least as plausible as the theory that the legislature inaction reflects considered acceptance of the executive practice.
our decision in noel canning the chief opinion on which the board relies is a sharp contrast.that case dealt with the president constitutional authority under the recess appointments clause,an issue that has attracted intense attention and written analysis from presidents,attorneys general,and the senate,at slip,at.the voluminous historical record dated back to the beginning of the republic,and included thousands of recess appointments.at,slip,at.that the chronicle of the recess appointments clause weighed heavily in noel canning offers no support to the board here.
applying the fvra to this case is straightforward.solomon was appointed as acting general counsel under subsection a.once the president submitted his nomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity,subsection b prohibited him from continuing his acting service.this does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the nlrb needed to go unperformed the president could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in solomon place.and he had a wide array of individuals to choose from any one of the approximately senior nlrb employees or the hundreds of individuals in pas positions throughout the government.the president,however,did not do so,and solomon continued service violated the fvra.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.
section of the fvra provides 
a if an officer of an executive agency including the executive office of the president,and other than the government accountability office whose appointment to office is required to be made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,dies,resigns,or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office

i join the opinion of the court because it correctly interprets the federal vacancies reform act of fvra,et.the dissent conclusion that the fvra authorized the appointment in this case,however,implicates an important constitutional question that the court interpretation does not whether directing lafe solomon to serve as acting general counsel of the national labor relations board nlrb or board,without the advice and consent of the senate,complied with the constitution.i write separately to explain my view that the appointments clause likely prohibited solomon appointment.
the appointments clause prescribes the exclusive process by which the president may appoint officers of the united states.united states germaine,accord,buckley valeo,per curiam a ll officers of the united states are to be appointed in accordance with the clause.no class or type of officer is excluded because of its special functions it provides that the president 
shall nominate,and by and with the advice and consent of the senate,shall appoint ambassadors,other public ministers and consuls,judges of the supreme court,and all other officers of the united states,whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for,and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,as they think proper,in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.art.ii,cl.
f or purposes of appointment,the clause divides all officers into two classes inferior officers and noninferior officers,which we have long denominated principal officers.germaine,supra,at.principal officers must be appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate.see edmond united states.that process is also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers.ibid.but the clause provides a limited exception for the appointment of inferior officers congress may by law authorize the president,the head of an executive department,or a court of law to appoint inferior officers without the advice and consent of the senate.ibid.
the fvra governs the process by which the president may temporarily fill a vacancy in an executive branch office normally occupied by an officer of the united states.as relevant in this case,when a vacancy arises,the president may direct an official to perform the functions and duties of the office temporarily.a.that official may be an officer previously appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate to any office,or certain employees of the agency in which the vacancy arose.ibid.the fvra does not,however,require the president to seek the advice and consent of the senate before directing the official to perform the functions of the vacant office.
when the president direct s someone to serve as an officer pursuant to the fvra,he is appoint ing that person as an officer of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause.around the time of the framing,the verb appoint meant t o establish anything by decree,johnson,a dictionary of the english language def.ed.sheridan,a complete dictionary of the english language to appoint ed,or t o allot,assign,or designate,webster,an american dictionary of the english language def.when the president direct s a person to serve as an acting officer,he is assign ing or designat ing that person to serve as an officer.
the fvra authorizes the president to appoint both inferior and principal officers without first obtaining the advice and consent of the senate.appointing inferior officers in this manner raises no constitutional problems.that is because the appointments clause authorizes congress to enact law s,like the fvra,vest ing the appointment of such inferior officers in the president alone.appointing principal officers under the fvra,however,raises grave constitutional concerns because the appointments clause forbids the president to appoint principal officers without the advice and consent of the senate.
because we interpret the fvra to forbid solomon appointment in this case,we need not confront these concerns.but the dissent contrary interpretation necessarily raises the question whether that appointment complied with the requirements of the appointments clause.that inquiry turns on two considerations whether the general counsel of the nlrb is an officer of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause and,if so,whether he is a principal officer who can be appointed only by and with the advice and consent of the senate in my view,the general counsel plainly is an officer of the united states.i also think he is likely a principal officer.
as an initial matter,the nlrb general counsel is an officer of the united states whose appointment is governed by the appointments clause.extensive evidence suggests that,at the time of the framing,this phrase was understood to encompass all federal officials with responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty.mascott,who are officers of the united states stan.forthcoming manuscript,at,online at as last visited,see also officers of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause,op,an officer of the united states was originally understood to be an official who hold s a position with delegated sovereign authority and whose office was continuing,rather than incidental or ad hoc and this court has previously held that an officer of the united states is any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states.buckley,at see also free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,breyer,dissenting collecting cases addressing who counts as an officer.
the general counsel is an officer of the united states under both the probable original meaning of the clause and this court precedents.he is charged by statute with carrying out significant duties.he exercise s general supervision over all attorneys employed by the board and over the officers and employees in the regional offices.d.he has final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuances of complaints and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the board.ibid.the general counsel is effectively the nation prosecutor and is therefore an officer of the united states.see edmond,at treating the general counsel of the department of transportation as an officer.
although a closer question,the general counsel also is likely a principal officer.in edmond,we explained that an inferior officer is one whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the senate.at.that view is consistent with the original meaning of the term and with the practices of the early congresses.see,at morrison olson,scalia,dissenting see also,sheridan,supra,inferiour johnson,supra,inferiour def.webster,supra,inferior by contrast,a principal officer is one who has no superior other than the president.
the general counsel of the nlrb appears to satisfy that definition.before,the board controlled not only the filing of complaints,but their prosecution and adjudication as well.nlrb food commercial workers.the labor management relations act,ch,stat,however,effected an important change in the nlrb structure by separat ing the prosecuting from the adjudicating function,to place the former in the general counsel,and to make him an independent official appointed by the president.lewis nlrb.congress thus separated the nlrb into two independent branches,food commercial workers,at,and made the general counsel independent of the board supervision and review,at see also,at congress decided to place the general counsel within the agency,but to make the office independent of the board authority moreover,the general counsel prosecutorial decisions are unreviewable by either the board or the judiciary.nlrb sears,roebuck,vaca sipes.although the board has power to define some of the general counsel duties,see d,and the general counsel represents the board in certain judicial proceedings,see higgins,labor czars commissars keeping women in the kitchen the purpose and effects of the administrative changes made by,cath,the statute does not give the board the power to remove him or otherwise generally to control his activities,see edmond,supra,at the power to remove officers,we have recognized,is a powerful tool for control see also free enterprise fund,at holding that executive officials were inferior officers in large part because they were subject to a superior removal.because it appears that the general counsel answers to no officer inferior to the president,he is likely a principal officer accordingly,the president likely could not lawfully have appointed solomon to serve in that role without first obtaining the advice and consent of the senate.
i recognize that the burdens on governmental processes that the appointments clause imposes may often seem clumsy,inefficient,even unworkable.ins chadha.granting the president unilateral power to fill vacancies in high offices might contribute to more efficient government.but the appointments clause is not an empty formality.although the framers recognized the potential value of leaving the selection of officers to one man of discernment rather than to a fractious,multimember body,see the federalist,cooke,they also recognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the government,see,at story,commentaries on the constitution of the united states.the framers had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked,chadha,supra,at,and they knew that liberty could be preserved only by ensuring that the powers of government would never be consolidated in one body,see the federalist.they thus empowered the senate to confirm principal officers on the view that the necessity of its in the business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of the president.the federalist,at story,supra,at.we can not cast aside the separation of powers and the appointments clause important check on executive power for the sake of administrative convenience or efficiency.see bowsher synar.
that the senate voluntarily relinquished its power in the fvra does not make this around the appointments clause constitutional.the clause,like all of the constitution structural provisions,is designed first and foremost not to look after the interests of the respective branches,but to protect individual liberty.nlrb noel canning,scalia,concurring in judgment slip,at internal quotation marks and bracket omitted.it is therefore irrelevant that the branch approves the encroachment.free enterprise fund,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.neither congress nor the executive can agree to waive the structural provisions of the constitution any more than they could agree to disregard an enumerated right.freytag commissioner.the judicial branch must be most vigilant in guarding the separation between the political powers precisely when those powers collude to avoid the structural constraints of our constitution.
courts inevitably will be called upon to determine whether the constitution permits the appointment of principal officers pursuant to the fvra without senate confirmation.but here,the proper interpretation of the fvra bars the appointment.

many offices in the executive branch may be filled only by a person who has been nominated to the position by the president and confirmed by the senate.the federal vacancies reform act of fvra cedes the senate confirmation authority,partially and on a temporary basis,to allow executive agencies to continue to function when one of those offices becomes vacant.it authorizes certain categories of officials to perform the duties of vacant offices on an acting basis.one of its provisions pulls back that authorization when an official has been nominated to fill the vacant office on a permanent basis.the scope of that provision is at issue here.i agree with the court that the provision applies to first assistants to a vacant office who serve as acting officials automatically,by operation of the fvra.i with the court conclusion that the provision also applies to other officials who may serve as acting officials if the president directs them to serve in that capacity.the court gives the provision a broader reach than the text can bear with no support from the history of,or practice under,the fvra.i respectfully dissent.
as the court explains,the fvra governs vacancies in offices held by persons whose appointment to office is required to be made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate.a.these are known as pas offices.when an official in a pas office dies,resigns,or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office the fvra steps in.see also c an expiration of a term of office makes an official unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.
section of the fvra authorizes four categories of officials to perform the duties of a vacant office.subsection a contains a default rule the first assistant to the office automatically assumes the vacant office and performs the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity.a.subsections a,a,and c authorize the president to override that default rule.the president may direct a person already confirmed by the senate to a pas office to serve as the acting officer.see a.the president may direct certain senior officials in the same agency to serve as the acting officer.see a.or the president may direct a person whose term in the office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term in that same office to serve as the acting officer until the senate acts on the nomination.see c.
subsection b takes away this authorization in a specific situation.it provides that,n otwithstanding subsection a the first assistant default rule a person may not serve as an acting official while nominated to fill the office if the person was not the first assistant to the office for at least of the days preceding the vacancy.b.the prohibition in subsection b does not apply to a person serving as the first assistant to the vacant office.see b.
in my view,the text,purpose,and history of the fvra make clear that the prohibition in subsection b applies only to a first assistant who performs the duties of a vacant office under subsection a.
as the court observes,subsection b contains some potentially broad language.the provision specifies when a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section that is.the words person and this section,taken in isolation,could signal that the prohibition applies to subsections a,a,a,and c and thus covers all acting officials.but context matters.and here,the context cabins those words and gives subsection b a more limited reach.
the text of subsection b contains a clear signal that its prohibition applies only to first assistants who automatically assume a vacant office under subsection a it begins with the
