after first learning in that she had been entitled to begin collecting her full pension benefits nearly eight years earlier,plaintiff francine helton contacted her pension plan seeking to recoup her lost benefits.the pension plan denied helton claim,and helton,in turn,brought this action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa against defendants at t,her former employer,and the at t pension benefit plan collectively,at t.following a bench trial,the district court found that at t unreasonably denied helton claim and failed to adequately notify her of a material change to its pension plan that allowed her to collect full benefits earlier than she had originally understood.the court awarded helton plus interest,reflecting the benefits she would have received from november,when she became eligible to collect her pension benefits,until september,when she was informed of her eligibility.
on appeal,at t challenges the district court consideration of evidence outside of the administrative record and the court determination that at t breached its statutory and fiduciary duties to helton.at t also contends that the remedy the district court awarded retroactive benefits was barred by the supreme court recent decision in cigna amara,d.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court properly considered limited evidence outside of the administrative record but known to at t when it rendered helton benefits determination correctly determined that at t breached its statutory and fiduciary duties to helton and did not err in awarding helton her lost benefits.accordingly,we affirm.
helton,who was born in october,began working for at t in and moved to her present home in arlington,virginia in.in april,helton took paid vacation time and,after her paid vacation was exhausted,an unpaid leave of absence from at t to open a restaurant.she formally resigned from the company on may.at the time she left,helton was a deferred vested pensioner of the legacy at t management program of the at t pension plan the pension plan and believed,at that time correctly,that she was not eligible to receive benefits under the pension plan until she turned.at t both funds and,for erisa purposes,serves as plan administrator of the pension plan.
in august,at t amended the pension plan through a special update,which,among other provisions,allowed certain participants,including helton,to elect benefits at age without facing any benefit reduction.at t attempted to notify eligible individuals about the special update in at least two ways through an april,letter from then at t executive vice president harold burlingame to active management employees and in the pension plan january,summary plan description spd,which also was mailed to active management employees.helton testified that she did not receive either of these communications.
under the special update,helton was entitled to begin receiving full pension benefits in october,when she turned.on march,at t employee diane ahlin forwarded an to the company pension service center stating i know that my ncs is but i am not quite sure of my last date of employment.can you please let me know.and is it true that i am not entitled to any pension benefits until i reached the age of.helton name and social security number were at the bottom of the message,and her ncs,an employee with at t,matched the one in the message.helton testified that she did not recall sending the message and that she had never interacted with ahlin,but said she did have those questions at the time.
the pension service center case notes for helton indicate the center received a request for pension information on march,the same day as the ahlin was forwarded.in response,the center prepared a calculation of benefits on april.the case notes further indicate that the calculation of benefits was mailed to helton as part of a pension commencement package on april.according to the case notes,helton never returned this package,which included forms helton had to complete in order to elect her benefits.the calculation of benefits was,therefore,destroyed,pursuant to at t standard practice.however,a separate at t record does not show that at t mailed the april,commencement package to helton,even though it indicates that other pension materials were mailed to her.helton testified that she did not receive a commencement package or other communication from at t in.helton further testified that she did not receive at t spd,which also discussed the special update,until.
on july,helton,who was approaching her birthday,contacted the pension service center to find out how much she would receive when she became eligible for her pension.at t records indicate that,in response to helton request,it mailed pension materials to helton on july,august,and august.however,helton testified that she only received the materials sent on august.in that mailing,helton received a commencement of benefits packet stating that she was immediately eligible to begin collecting her full pension benefit,despite the fact that she had not yet turned.after learning about the special update from the pension service center,helton contacted at t pension plan administrator,aon consulting and requested pension benefits dating back to her birthday.the administrator denied helton request on december,stating that,under the pension plan terms,benefits are payable on a forward going basis and there is no provision in the plan for retroactive pension payments.
on december,helton appealed the administrator denial of benefits to at t employee benefits committee the benefits committee,stating that she never received the commencement package or the burlingame letter.helton suggested that she might not have received the mailings because she was on personal leave at the time they were mailed or because,even when properly sent,t here is often mail that is and often not returned.
christine holland,an at t employee and secretary of the benefits committee,prepared the materials for the committee to consider in reviewing helton appeal.the administrative record holland assembled included a brief statement of facts regarding helton claim,a timeline,a copy of the burlingame letter,excerpts from the version of the pension plan in effect in,excerpts from the spd,a screen shot of helton address in at t employee masterfile,and copies of correspondence between at t and helton regarding her claim.
after reviewing the record,the benefits committee,which was composed of five at t human resources vice presidents,denied helton appeal on march,affirming the administrator decision that retroactive benefits are unavailable under the terms of the pension plan.the benefits committee also determined that helton was appropriately notified of the special update because she was an active management employee on august,when the burlingame letter was mailed,and her address has remained the same since at least and there was no indication that mail has been returned to at t as undeliverable from helton address.
following the benefits committee denial of her appeal,helton requested that at t provide her with all materials in its possession related to her claim,as required by federal law.see j,m.in response,at t provided helton with the pension service center case notes for her claim and a model version of the benefit calculation that would have been included in her commencement package.
on august,helton filed a complaint against at t in federal district court alleging,among other things,that at t improperly denied her retroactive benefits violated erisa disclosure obligations by failing to inform her about the special update breached its fiduciary duty to keep her informed about her benefits under the plan and failed to provide her with information she requested.the complaint sought benefits for the period between when helton turned and when she began receiving benefits in,as well as further monetary and declaratory relief.at t moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted at t motion with respect to the fourth claim and denied the motion as to the other three claims.
following a bench trial,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on september,finding for helton on all three surviving claims.helton v.at t,d.the court entered a judgment in helton favor for the first claim but awarded only declaratory relief for the remaining two claims,holding that multiple recovery would be inequitable.id.at t appealed.

first,at t challenges the factual findings and legal conclusions underlying the district court holding that helton is entitled to retroactive pension benefits under a b,which authorizes a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.
this court reviews de novo a district court review of a coverage decision by an erisa plan administrator,applying the same standard of review as the district court applied.williams metro.life ins,cir.the scope of a district court review in an action challenging an administrator coverage determination under section a b turns on whether the benefit plan at issue vests the administrator with discretionary authority.firestone tire rubber bruch,d woods prudential ins.of,cir.if a plan does not give the administrator discretionary authority,a district court reviews the coverage determination de novo.woods,at.
however,when an erisa benefit plan vests with the plan administrator the discretionary authority to make eligibility determinations for beneficiaries,a reviewing court evaluates the plan administrator decision for abuse of discretion.williams,at.under this standard,this court should affirm a discretionary decision of a plan administrator if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and is supported by substantial evidence,even if we would reach a different decision independently.id.at.
here,the pension plan states that the benefits committee shall have sole and complete discretionary authority and control to manage the operation and administration of the plan,including,but not limited to interpretation of all plan provisions and determination of the amount and kind of benefits payable to any participant.because this language gives at t discretionary authority in administration of the pension plan,we review at t decision to deny helton retroactive benefits for abuse of discretion.
at t contends that,under this standard of review,the district court improperly granted helton retroactive benefits under section a b for four reasons it improperly relied on evidence outside of the administrative record it erred in holding that at t denial of helton claim was not reasonable it should have remanded the case to at t for reconsideration after finding that at t abused its discretion in denying helton claim and it was precluded,under the terms of the pension plan,from awarding helton retroactive benefits.we disagree.
first,we address the district court decision to consider limited evidence outside of the administrative record prepared by at generally,consideration of evidence outside of the administrative record is inappropriate when a coverage determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion sheppard enoch pratt hosp.travelers ins,cir see also bernstein capitalcare,cir.the rationale for this rule is that,to the extent possible,the administration of erisa plans should be left to plan fiduciaries,not federal courts.bernstein,at.additionally,promoting internal resolution of claims furthers erisa goals of expeditiously,efficiently,and inexpensively resolving coverage disputes.see perry simplicity eng g,cir.
at t contends that in sheppard,in which we set out our current approach to consideration of extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review,we established an absolute bar to considering evidence outside of the administrative record.appellant br.at this court has made clear that a district court assessment of the reasonableness of a plan administrator decision is limited to a review of the documents in the administrative record.in applying the standard,courts are entitled to only look at the evidence that was before the plan administrator and determine if the decision,based on that evidence,was reasonable.
however,a closer review of our precedent demonstrates that we have taken a more nuanced approach to consideration of extrinsic evidence on deferential review,rather than embracing an absolute bar.in particular,in discussing what evidence may be considered,we generally have focused on whether evidence was known to the administrator when it rendered its decision,not whether it was part of the administrative record.for example,in sheppard we held that the reasonableness of the administrator decision must be based on the facts known to it at the time.at emphasis added see also elliott sara lee,cir same.likewise,in jett blue cross blue shield of alabama,which was the genesis of the language regarding extrinsic evidence that we used in sheppard,the eleventh circuit emphasized that whether evidence was known to the administrator at the time the decision was made is the determinative consideration as to whether the district court can consider extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review,cir.thus,like the eleventh circuit in jett,in sheppard we did not focus myopically on whether evidence was part of the administrative record but,rather,on whether the evidence was known to the administrator when it rendered its decision.
by contrast,we have refused to consider extrinsic evidence only in cases in which a plaintiff seeking benefits sought to first introduce evidence in federal court that was unknown to the administrator.see,elliott,at holding that the district court properly refused beneficiary request for the court to consider affidavit of a vocational consultant hired by the beneficiary,when the beneficiary failed to submit affidavit to plan appeals committee despite having had an opportunity to do so sheppard,at refusing to consider affidavit of beneficiary treating physician,when beneficiary failed to submit affidavit to plan review committee webster black decker,cir unpublished refusing to consider social security administration determination letter when beneficiary first produced letter in federal court.
not surprisingly,then,at t can not cite,nor have we found,any case in which we have held that a district court could not consider evidence from outside of the administrative record when that evidence was known to the administrator at the time the administrator rendered its benefits determination.indeed,other circuits confronted with a plan administrator that knew or should have known of certain pieces of evidence outside of the administrative record have held that a district court properly considered such evidence on abuse of discretion review.see hess hartford life acc.ins,cir holding that district court properly considered beneficiary employment contract,even though plan administrator said that it never saw the contract brooking hartford life and acc.ins,cir holding that a district court may consider plan documents,even if such documents were not part of the administrative record.
had sheppard allowed plan administrators the unchecked opportunity to pick and choose what evidence in their possession to include in the administrative record,as at t argues,we would have effectively surrendered our ability to review erisa benefits determinations because plan administrators could simply omit any evidence from the administrative record that would suggest their decisions were unreasonable.as the seventh circuit explained in hess,t he fact that a plan administrator did not bother to read pertinent evidence actually before him can not shield the plan decision from review.at.
although the plain language of sheppard permits district courts to consider extrinsic evidence known to the administrator at the time of its review,such a reading is also compelled by the framework we have established for abuse of discretion review in actions brought under section a b of erisa.in particular,we have long recognized that certain types of extrinsic evidence often are necessary for a court to assess whether an administrator abused its discretion in denying a plan member request for benefits.
in booth wal mart stores.associates health welfare plan,which was decided after sheppard,we identified eight nonexclusive factors for courts to consider in evaluating whether a plan administrator abused its discretion 
the language of the plan the purposes and goals of the plan the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it whether the fiduciary interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan whether the process was reasoned and principled whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of erisa any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion and the fiduciary motives and any conflict of interest it may have.
cir.since booth was decided,both this court and our district courts have applied this multifactor test on numerous occasions.see,carden aetna life ins,cir williams metro.life ins,d,aff williams,at.the booth factors incorporate many principles from trust law and,in so doing,reflect a desire to ensure that plan sponsors can not,through artful plan drafting,impinge on the proper role of courts in enforcing contracts and establishing principles of judicial review.at.
as is facially apparent,a district court in many cases may not be able to adequately assess a number of the booth factors in the absence of evidence from outside the administrative record.for example,the fourth factor requires a court to consider whether the coverage determination at issue is consistent with earlier interpretations of the plan.because the administrative record focuses on the coverage determination at hand,courts would have to look at extrinsic evidence concerning the plan administrator prior coverage determinations to assess this factor.see gooden provident life acc.ins,cir explaining extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine how an administrator has interpreted terms of the plan in other instances quotation omitted.similarly,one can envision many circumstances in which a court would need to look to extrinsic evidence to evaluate the adequacy of the administrative record,as is required by the third factor,or the impact of a plan fiduciary conflict of interest,as is required by the eighth factor see murphy deloitte touche group ins.plan,cir w ithout discovery,a claimant may not have access to the information necessary to establish the seriousness of the conflict of interest.
thus,were we to accept at t reading of sheppard and its progeny as absolutely barring consideration of extrinsic evidence,we would preclude our district courts from assessing many of the factors we have directed them to consider in determining whether an erisa plan administrator abused its discretion.but when interpreting our precedent,we seek to reconcile our past decisions,not adopt interpretations that place them squarely in conflict.see mcmellon united states,cir en banc holding that only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between opinions issued by panels do we follow the rule that the first case decided on an issue is controlling emphasis added united states hogan,cir a panel is obligated,if at all possible,to distill from apparently conflicting prior panel decisions a basis of reconciliation and to apply that reconciled rule.
at t nevertheless identifies language in some of our decisions that,at first blush,appears to absolutely bar consideration of evidence outside the administrative record.in particular,at t points out that in williams we noted that b oth this court and the district court conduct these abuse of discretion reviews based solely on the existing administrative record,rather than on any testimony or other additional evidence obtained outside the administrative record.at.however,this comment was made in the context of addressing an entirely different issue whether,after concluding that the district court had applied the improper standard of review,it was necessary to remand the case for reconsideration.id.so in that case,we merely observed that because we apply the same standard of review as the district court,and the district court had not considered any evidence from outside of the administrative record in rendering its decision,remand was unnecessary.id.at.
at t also cites similar language in our unpublished decision in frankton metropolitan life insurance.cir unpublished.however,like in sheppard,elliott,and webster,the frankton panel considered only whether it was proper for the district court to refuse to consider extrinsic evidence that was not known to the administrator when it made its benefits determination.id.at.
allowing for consideration of evidence outside the administrative record but known to the administrator on abuse of discretion review is consistent with the trend in our sister circuits.historically,most circuits prohibited consideration of extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review.see,miller united welfare fund,cir.yet a number of circuits,including this one,softened that rule by creating a less deferential standard of review for decisions by plan administrators who served both as a fiduciary to plan beneficiaries and as the party responsible for making payments under the plan.see williams,at ellis metropolitan life ins,cir,rev by metropolitan life ins.glenn,d see also chambers family health plan,cir cataloguing the circuits approaches to reviewing decisions by erisa plan administrators.
but in,the supreme court held in metropolitan life insurance glenn that although courts may consider an administrator conflict of interest in assessing the reasonableness of a benefits decision,they may not change the applicable standard of review because of such a conflict.id.at.as a result,it became all the more important for courts to have access to adequate evidence to assess,for example,how a conflict of interest may have impacted the adequacy of the administrative record and,consequently,a contested benefits determination.
since glenn,circuits have begun explicitly recognizing exceptions to the general rule barring consideration of extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review.noting that the supreme court decision in glenn contemplates the possibility of discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest,the tenth circuit now expressly permits consideration of extrinsic evidence regarding the extent and impact of a plan administrator conflict of interest.murphy,at.similarly modifying its abuse of discretion review framework in the wake of glenn,the ninth circuit held that courts may consider evidence from outside of the administrative record in at least three situations to determine whether and to what extent an administrator conflict of interest adversely affected the administrative process,when procedural irregularities undermined the development of a full administrative record,and when a plan representations caused a participant to incorrectly but reasonably believe a document was part of the administrative record.burke pitney bowes.long term disability plan,cir.and the fifth circuit allows consideration of extrinsic evidence in cases where procedural irregularities inhibited the development of an adequate record.see lafleur.health service indem,cir.
at present,the overwhelming majority of our sister circuits agree with the position we first embraced in sheppard and do not absolutely bar consideration of extrinsic evidence on deferential review.compare id.rejecting absolute bar to consideration of extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review murphy,at same burke,at same rittenhouse unitedhealth group long term disability ins.plan,cir same evans unumprovident,cir same orndorf paul revere life ins,st cir same zervos verizon,cir same hess,at same with fleisher standard ins,cir barring consideration of extrinsic evidence on abuse of discretion review blankenship metropolitan life ins,cir same.
in sum,under sheppard,a district court may consider evidence outside of the administrative record on abuse of discretion review in an erisa case when such evidence is necessary to adequately assess the booth factors and the evidence was known to the plan administrator when it rendered its benefits determination.since sheppard,we have not had occasion to clearly address when a plan administrator can be charged with knowledge of evidence outside of the administrative record.nonetheless,the general rule is that corporate entities,like plan administrators,have knowledge of two types of information.
first,relying on principles of agency,courts have found that knowledge obtained by corporate employees acting within the scope of their employment is imputed to the corporation.united states v.one parcel of land located at hwy,three lakes,oneida,cir duplex envelope denominational envelope,cir see generally james cox thomas lee hazen,the law of corporations william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of corporations.second,because corporations are charged with knowledge of information known to their officers and because officers are charged with knowledge of information in corporate books and records,corporate entities also have constructive knowledge of the contents of their records.albert lea foundry iowa sav.bank of marshalltown,iowa,cir see generally fletcher cyclopedia of corporations.therefore,an erisa plan administrator can be charged with knowledge of information acquired by its employees in the scope of their employment and the contents of its books and records.
turning to the case at hand,at t identifies several pieces of extrinsic evidence upon which it contends the district court improperly relied 
the fact that helton did not initially receive the commencement package and that at t sent a second package to helton after her request 
the march,diane ahlin,which did not contain a request for a commencement package 
helton multiple telephone calls to the pension service center in september,during which she maintained that she did not receive any information about the special update 
a screen shot indicating helton home address in 
the trial testimony of paula stoia 
the trial testimony of edwin adam and 
the trial testimony of laurie banwart.
appellant br.at.
we hold that the district court properly considered this evidence,with the exception of the trial testimony of adam,who oversaw the mailing of pension plan communications for at t contractor universal mailing services,and banwart,who was employed by aon as a director of operations at at t pension service center.we do so,first,because the district court considered this evidence in the course of determining whether the benefits committee relied on adequate materials in denying helton appeal,one of the eight booth factors.see helton,d at there is no evidence that the pension plan administrator inquired about or evaluated the mailing procedures,and the benefits committee seemed to rubberstamp without question the administrator assertions that the materials were sent.the benefits committee did not inquire into the mailing process.
second,all of this evidence,with the exception of adam and banwart testimony,was known to,or in the control of,at t when the benefits committee made its decision.the screen shots indicating the two failed mailings of helton commencement package,the ahlin,recordings of helton september phone conversations with the pension service center,and the screen shot of helton home address in all are at t corporate records that the benefits committee readily could have considered,had it made an effort to do so.at t also can be charged with knowledge of stoia testimony since she worked for at t in,when the decision was rendered.see duplex envelope,at.thus,the benefits committee easily could have communicated with stoia regarding any facts relevant to helton claim.
however,the district court should not have considered adam and banwart testimony.both adam and banwart stopped working with at t in and therefore had no relationship with at t when the benefits committee rendered its decision in.accordingly,at t was free to interview adam and banwart as part of its review of helton claim but can not properly be charged with knowledge of their testimony.
next,keeping in mind which pieces of evidence are properly considered on deferential review,we must decide whether the district court erred in holding that at t abused its discretion in denying helton request to recoup her lost benefits.we do so with the aid of the factors set out in booth,at.all eight booth factors need not be,and are not,in play in this case.booth,at.those factors that do apply convince us that at t decision to deny helton claim was unreasonable.
first,the decision was not supported by the language of the pension plan,as required by the first booth factor,nor was it consistent with other terms in the pension plan,as required by the fourth factor.specifically,in denying helton claim,the benefits committee pointed to language in two documents that it contended precluded the award of retroactive benefits section of the pension plan version in effect when at t provided the special update and the spd.section d provides 
the failure of an employee and spouse to consent to a distribution while a benefit is immediately distributable,within the meaning of section c,shall be deemed to be an election to defer commencement of payment of any benefit sufficient to satisfy this section d.
this provision does not address,much less preclude,retroactive recovery of benefits,particularly in cases of administrative error.while the administrator is entitled to discretion in interpreting the terms of its plan,those interpretations must be reasonable.booth,holding that even when an erisa plan gives an administrator broad discretion to interpret plan language,this court will enforce the administrator decisions only if they are reasonable.here,the administrator interpretation was not reasonable.
the spd states that pension benefits are payable on a basis only.while this language might be read as precluding the award of retroactive benefits,an spd does not constitute the terms of a plan for purposes of determining whether a plan participant is entitled to a particular form of relief.amara.at s ummary documents provide communications with beneficiaries about the plan and do not themselves constitute the terms of the plan for purposes of a b.emphasis in the original see also mccravy metro.life ins,cir.therefore,neither the terms of the pension plan nor the spd precluded awarding helton retroactive benefits.
moreover,section of the pension plan version in effect at the time helton sought to recover her lost benefits explicitly allows for the pension plan administrator to grant restorative benefits 
plan provisions to the contrary notwithstanding,if an error has occurred in connection with the plan as a result of human or systems error,da
