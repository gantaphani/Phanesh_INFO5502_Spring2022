opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment by the district court sustaining two decisions of the united states department of the interior,office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement.plaintiffs challenge the agency decisions to terminate a program deficiency notice issued pursuant to,and delete a required amendment that was codified at h,both of which directed pennsylvania to comply with the requirements of e.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the agency decisions were inconsistent with its own regulations and regulatory obligations.we will therefore reverse the judgment of the district court,in part,and set aside both agency actions.
background 
plaintiffs in this case are several nonprofit public interest organizations,corporations,and coalitions dedicated to the preservation of pennsylvania environment and conservation of its natural resources.for the sake of convenience,they will be referred to collectively as the federation.the individual defendants have all been sued in their official capacities as administration officials.in addition,the commonwealth of pennsylvania,department of environmental protection padep,has been permitted to join as an.the federation alleges that the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm has taken a position and performed actions inconsistent with its regulatory obligations under the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra,et.a short review of the origin and purpose of smcra is therefore in order.
congress enacted smcra to provide protection against environmental degradation from coal mining and to clean up areas damaged by past coal mining.see a it is the purpose of this act to establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations.many of the adverse effects of surface coal mining relate to the large number of abandoned and unreclaimed coal mining sites strewn across the nation.these sites continue,in their unreclaimed condition,to substantially degrade the quality of the environment,prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources,or endanger the health or safety of the public h.smcra aims to promote the complete reclamation of these abandoned mining sites and seeks to assure that the untreated mine discharges of abandoned sites are abated.see pennsylvania coal ass babbitt,cir.the statute empowers the secretary of the interior,through osm,to promulgate regulations to realize these goals and oversee the regulatory program.c.
significantly,however,smcra allows a state to steward its own regulatory program if it can administer that program according to federal standards.under this cooperative federalism approach,individual states are expected to take the lead in regulation while the federal government oversees their efforts.once a state program is approved,the state achieves primacy over the regulation of its surface mining program under smcra.pennsylvania attained primacy in.see,july.
when a state has primacy,operators of surface coal mining sites are required to file an application for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit with the state regulatory authority.a.to receive a mining permit,operators are required to submit a detailed reclamation plan for the site in question.this plan must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that complete reclamation can be accomplished.d,a.in addition,after the permit application has been approved,but before the permit is issued,applicants are required to file a performance bond with the regulatory authority.a.smcra bonding program is designed to provide further assurance of complete reclamation of mine sites.cat run coal babbitt.under smcra,the bonds collected by states from mining operators must be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work had to be performed by the regulatory authority,the state.a.
a conventional bond system cbs,authorized by a,is sometimes referred to as a full cost system because the cost of the bond is not discounted or supplemented by any other source.rather,the operator must pay the entire cost of the bond needed to complete reclamation in the event of forfeiture.id.a cbs bond is site specific,covering the permit area upon which the operator conducts surface coal mining.id.the bond shall cover that area of land within the permit area upon which the operator will initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the initial term of the permit.as mining and reclamation operations within the permit area are expanded,the permit holder must file additional bonds to cover the additional operations.id.as succeeding increments of surface coal mining and reclamation operations are to be initiated and conducted within the permit area,the permittee shall file with the regulatory authority an additional bond or bonds to cover such increments.
an alternative bond system abs,authorized by c,is a collective system that draws in part on a bond pool to cover the reclamation liabilities of each individual mining site.an abs allows a state to discount the amount of the required bond to an amount that is less than the full cost needed to complete reclamation of the site in the event of forfeiture.individual mine operators contribute to the bond pool,thereby sharing the liability of reclamation and compensating for the discounted bonds.
pennsylvania past and present efforts to comply with its obligation to maintain a solvent bond system form the backdrop for this appeal.pennsylvania first instituted an abs to cover surface coal mines in,even before it obtained primacy over mining activities in the commonwealth.see.bull.august,final rule implementing abs.as previously noted,osm approved pennsylvania surface coal mining regulatory program in.july,see generally hodel virginia surface mining reclamation ass n,d describing state program approval process.under the approved program,pennsylvania had the authority to implement either an abs or cbs.
from until,pennsylvania opted for a bifurcated bond system,with surface coal mines,as well as coal refuse reprocessing operations and coal preparation plants,covered by an abs,and underground coal mines and coal refuse disposal operations covered by a cbs.the abs that pennsylvania used for its surface coal mines consisted,in part,of bonds set below the cost of reclamation.these discounted bonds were supplemented by a statewide bond pool called the surface mining conservation and reclamation fund pa smcra fund.stat.ann.the pa smcra fund receives revenue from several sources,including the collection of a,nonrefundable,reclamation fee paid by individual operators of surface coal mines.that fee was originally per acre,but was raised to per acre in.see e.
on january,osm director notified padep that pennsylvania alternative bonding system must be modified to provide the resources needed to reclaim existing permanent forfeiture sites within a reasonable timeframe and to ensure that future forfeiture sites will be reclaimed in a timely manner.these resources must be sufficient to complete the reclamation plan approved in the permit.on may,in a final rule conditionally approving a proposed state program amendment,osm codified a required regulatory program amendment,h,directing pennsylvania to submit information by november,indicating that the pa smcra fund was solvent.specifically,the rule required pennsylvania to either submit information,sufficient to demonstrate that the abs can be operated in a manner that will meet the requirements of e,or to amend its rules or otherwise amend its program by november,to be compliant with federal standards,may.this required amendment was published in the federal register on may,as a final rule,following public notice as a proposed rule in the february,federal register and a period of public comment.id.
in addition,on october,osm sent pennsylvania a letter pursuant to part notice.part of the code sets out the procedural requirements for submission,review and approval of state programs,id,along with the requirements for submission and approval of state program amendments.id.as described by the district court,a part notice is a document in which osm notifies the state that its regulatory program must be amended to be in accordance with smcra and consistent with the federal regulations such notification may be necessary as a result of federal regulation changes,state or federal court decisions,or problems identified during oversight or other program review processes.pennsylvania fed of sportsmen clubs norton,d.
the part notice in this case indicated that pennsylvania regulatory program was no longer in compliance with smcra and related federal regulations specifically,osm explained that a field office evaluation had determined that pennsylvania abs system was financially incapable of abating or permanently treating pollutional discharges from bond forfeiture sites,and that the default reclamation requirements of e were no longer satisfied.osm acknowledged that pennsylvania had already initiated the legislative process to increase the reclamation fee for the pa smcra fund which would eventually lead to the to increase in,but concluded that a more comprehensive analysis had to be conducted to determine if the revised abs could reasonably be expected to generate sufficient funds.osm required that pennsylvania submit within sixty days either proposed amendments or a description of amendments to be proposed to remedy the deficiency.in response to this demand,padep sent a letter on december,which briefly outlined its plan to address the bonding concerns.the letter described padep efforts to initiate an actuarial review of its abs and proposed a and umbrella trust fund approach to meeting its obligations under smcra.on march,osm responded that padep plan was still insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the part notice.
on july,osm approved pennsylvania reclamation fee increase from to.however,it emphasized the mutual understanding between osm and pennsylvania that this fee increase was a measure,an intermediate step to keep the shortage in the pa smcra fund from further deteriorating,id.at,rather than a long term solution to the insolvency problem of the pa smcra fund.the pennsylvania environmental quality board agreed that t o allow the pa smcra fund to remain insolvent is not an acceptable bond program under pennsylvania smcra or the federal smcra.
nearly two years later,on may,osm sent the secretary of padep a letter the federation describes as a dunning letter reminding the secretary of padep outstanding obligations under osm part notice to amend its program to address the pa smcra insolvency problem.the letter acknowledged an earlier october padep proposal to enhance its bonding system through a master trust fund,but observed that no action had been taken to implement this proposal.it directed padep to take immediate action to finalize these or other proposals.
a letter dated september,from padep to the pennsylvania coal association director of regulatory affairs,underscored the magnitude of pennsylvania bonding program deficiencies 
pa dep is currently holding about million in reclamation bonds,involving coal operators and financial institutions on permits that have long been reclaimed,but have one or more discharges.pennsylvania law prohibits the release of these bonds unless other financial assurances for the treatment of water are provided.in addition,the bonds do not represent anywhere near the amount of money required to provide for the treatment of discharges in case of default by an operator.
this letter set forth various proposals for ameliorating the problem and concluded that t he risk,and i believe certain consequence,of not dealing with this problem now and in earnest is the real possibility that some court will eventually decide the issues for us.the dog is no longer sleeping.
less than a year later,on june,the citizens for pennsylvania future pennfuture,on behalf of various parties,filed the advance notice required for a citizen suit.this notice alleged,inter alia,that pennsylvania bonding system had been insolvent for over a decade,and that t he amount of bond money posted for those sites is grossly insufficient for providing long term treatment.in the midst of settlement negotiations between pennfuture and padep,padep issued an october,news release announcing its decision to adopt a cbs that would fully reflect the department estimated cost for reclamation 
osm initial position on this proposed solution to the insolvency of the pa smcra fund was expressed at a november,meeting with padep representatives.the osm concluded that conversion to fcb full cost bonding for all current and future permits,as outlined by padep,would not resolve the outstanding part notification because it failed to address current liability that has accrued against the abs and that padep could not dissolve the abs without first addressing those existing liabilities.osm explained that the liability of a bond pool for the reclamation costs on a given forfeited site is not limited to any assigned amount.rather its obligation,as stated in e,is to have sufficient money available to complete the reclamation plan for any areas which may be in default at any time.consequently,osm concluded that padep proposal can not be approved in its entirety.
osm clarified this position in a document sent to padep in a june memorandum in response to padep request for guidance,explaining that f ederal regulations do not authorize partial or full write off of liability through abs modification,and pennsylvania must administer the program so that all liabilities accrued against the abs are accounted for three months later,in a letter to the secretary of padep dated october,osm regional director restated the position that a ddressing forfeiture sites remains a critical aspect of osm notice on abs insolvency and requires corrective action.the regional director explained that osm had consistently interpreted the provisions of e as requiring that a state is responsible to administer its abs in a manner that provides sufficient funds,including funds for treatment of amd acid mine drainage emanating from forfeiture primacy permits and an abs can only be terminated when all sites bonded under the system are successfully reclaimed or adequate replacement bonds are provided.
on august,padep formally announced the termination of its abs and conversion to a cbs for surface mines,coal refuse reprocessing and coal preparation plants.in an attempt to resolve concerns regarding osm may codified required amendment and part notice,padep and osm exchanged drafts of what would become the jointly authored pennsylvania bonding systems program enhancements program enhancements document.the program enhancements document was officially submitted to osm on june,and provides descriptions of various aspects of pennsylvania bonding program,including summaries of actions taken and plans for future actions.
the program enhancements document outlines pennsylvania august termination of the abs and conversion to a cbs as well as revisions made and proposed to the cbs system subsequent to the conversion.specifically,it explains that,after the conversion,pennsylvania existing and future mine operators could no longer rely on the commonwealth existing abs to meet performance bond requirements.existing operators originally permitted and bonded under the abs fund were required to obtain new cbs bonds.new operators were also required to be permitted and bonded under a cbs bond and,consequently,were required to pay the full cost of bond coverage.
in addition,the program enhancements document discusses revisions and proposed revisions to the cbs,including measures directed to osm original concerns regarding pennsylvania compliance with e.for land reclamation on bond forfeiture sites,the program enhancements document indicates that padep requested and the pennsylvania general assembly appropriated million to address the deficit in the pa smcra fund.additionally,in the course of the abs to cbs conversion,the program enhancements document indicates that padep would continue to collect the reclamation fee from mine operators filing for new permits for the pa smcra fund to cover forfeitures that occurred during the conversion.
finally,the program enhancements document includes a workplan that prioritizes and allocates resources,purporting to adequately provide for abatement or treatment of pollutional discharges on primary forfeiture sites.the document asserts that this workplan addresses more discharges than is required by federal smcra.attached as an appendix to the program enhancements document,the workplan full title is the alternate bonding system primacy discharge abatement workplan.it explains that padep and osm had completed an initial inventory of discharges on sites forfeited under the state abs.briefly summarized,the workplan describes padep intent to clean up those discharges through a watershed approach that utilizes various financial and programmatic resources 
osm regional director sent a letter to padep on june,one week after submission of the program enhancements document,stating that padep transition of existing active and inactive permits covered by the abs conventional bonds is now complete.the letter concurred with padep conclusions that the measures taken by padep,as described in the program enhancements document,were sufficient to remedy the deficiencies set forth in osm october,part notice.osm noted that pennsylvania cbs had been revised and improved and concluded that the actions taken by padep warranted termination of the part notice.
in addition,two weeks later on june,osm issued a proposed rule to remove the required amendment at h.in that proposed rule,osm asserted that the strategy outlined in the program enhancements document would satisfy osm concerns as to whether the pa smcra fund can be operated in a manner that will meet the requirements of e.id.at.osm also stated s ince we are now satisfied that pennsylvania bonding program enhancements adequately address ed our concerns about the ability of the bonding program to ensure the completion of the reclamation plan,we are proposing the removal of the first portion of h.id.osm invited public comments on whether it should consider the information submitted by pennsylvania sufficient to remove the required amendment.id.however,it stated that b ecause we decided on june,that padep bonding program enhancements satisfy the concerns expressed in our october,part notification letter,we are not seeking comments on the adequacy of those bonding program enhancements.id.at.
the federation submitted extensive comments on the proposed rule,as well as on osm decision to terminate the part notice,in a memorandum to osm regional director on july.it asked the regional director to reconsider and rescind the termination of the notice,and similarly reconsider and decline to adopt the proposed rule the federation characterized osm actions as a retreat from responsibility,and a,and argued that pennsylvania new program failed to cover the costs of mine drainage treatment,and thus the full cost of reclamation,at many sites with discharges.the federation complained that pennsylvania was writing off abs reclamation liabilities by leaving discharges from abs forfeiture sites untreated and by transferring those liabilities to other programs and sources of funding identified in the workplan.in addition,the federation observed that the workplan lacked any meaningful and enforceable commitments to funding levels or implementation deadlines.to this end,the federation argued that a workplan is no substitute for the guarantee of treatment required by smcra.consequently,the federation argued that the required amendment at h should not be removed.
on october,osm declined the federation request that it rescind its june,letter terminating the part notice,and stated that the federation request that osm retain h will be separately addressed in a fr final rule notice to be published in the near future.on october,osm published a final rule in the federal register,announcing its removal of the required amendment at h.the final rule responded to the federation objections by explaining that pennsylvania conversion from the abs to full cost bonding,renders moot that portion of the required amendment concerned with the solvency of the fund.id.at.
on december,the federation commenced the underlying action in the district court by filing a complaint.the parties presented their cases,as is customary in agency review proceedings,in cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied the federation motion and granted osm cross motion to dismiss the complaint on all three counts in a memorandum and order issued february,this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under and a.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from a final judgment of the district court under.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,applying the same standard the district court was required to apply.gordon lewistown,cir.a grant of summary judgment is proper where,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,the moving party has established that there is no genuine dispute of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
judicial review of agency actions under smcra is conducted according to the deferential standard applied to administrative actions.smcra provides that any action subject to judicial review under this subsection shall be affirmed unless the court concludes that such action is arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise inconsistent with law.a.this standard is consistent with the administrative procedure act requirement that an agency action be set aside if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also ohio river valley envtl,kempthorne,cir comparing smcra standard to apa standard.the scope of review under this standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
however,courts are not obliged to stand aside and their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute.nlrb brown,d see also mercy catholic med.ctr.thompson,cir a reviewing court must ensure that an agency ruling is not inconsistent with applicable regulations.the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies equally to an agency decision to pass a rule or rescind a rule.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.moreover,an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.id.at.
in determining whether an agency actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise inconsistent with law we look to the statute delegating authority to the agency to make and enforce rules pursuant to the statute.see chevron natural res.def.council,d.in this case,the statute is smcra,which delegated rulemaking power to the department of interior and consequently osm,which is within the interior department.b authorizing permanent program regulations.under the familiar chevron analysis,a court first looks to the statute to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we move to step two of the inquiry.at step two,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.the supreme court has described the standard of review at step two as arbitrary and capricious review.see united states mead,d see also national cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d w e defer at step two to the agency interpretation so long as the construction is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make.internal quotes omitted.we therefore approach agency regulations with great deference when reviewing them under chevron second step.
iii.discussion 
the osm actions under review in this appeal are the agency termination of the part notice and removal of the codified required amendment at h.our review of these actions requires us to consider the applicability of e because osm argues,and the district court agreed,that pennsylvania conversion from an abs to a cbs rendered e inapplicable and mooted the issue of compliance with the provision.pennsylvania fed of sportsmen clubs,d at a conversion to the cbs amounts to a conversion of applicable statutory provisions and regulations and as a result any ongoing obligations from e cease to apply.as a threshold matter,however,we must determine whether pennsylvania abs system was actually terminated by pennsylvania august,announcement,and,if so,whether osm actions in approving this purported termination of the abs and conversion to a new bonding system were inconsistent with the applicable regulations and therefore an abuse of discretion.
the federation argues that because pennsylvania abs is part of the approved pennsylvania regulatory program,it may be dissolved only through padep submission and osm approval of a state program amendment deleting the authorization for an abs from the program see g whenever changes to laws or regulations that make up the approved state program are proposed by the state,the state shall immediately submit the proposed changes to the director as an amendment.no such change to laws or regulations shall take effect for purposes of a state program until approved as an amendment.however,pennsylvania program,as originally approved in,provides for the option to implement either a cbs or an abs.pa smcra states in relevant part that 
the amount of the bond required shall be in an amount determined by the department based upon the total estimated cost to the commonwealth of completing the approved reclamation plan,or in such other amount and form as may be established by the department pursuant to regulations for an alternate coal bonding program which shall achieve the objectives and purposes of the bonding program.
ann.osm approved this bonding portion of pa smcra without condition.see.setting forth conditions of state regulatory program approval.as such,it is unnecessary for padep to codify a new regulation or amend its existing regulation.under the current regulations,both state.ann.and federal.at,pennsylvania is already authorized to pursue any bonding scheme it desires so long as that scheme achieves the ultimate objective of the bonding program,which is to guarantee sufficient funds for reclamation.the conversion from an abs to a cbs is therefore not a change to laws or regulations that make up the approved state program,g,that triggers the smcra program amendment process.it is merely an exercise of authority already granted to pennsylvania in the existing regulations.osm actions in approving this conversion were therefore not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise inconsistent with law.
the federation alights on the fact that pennsylvania continues to collect the reclamation fee,which continues to supply the pa smcra fund or abs fund,app.this fund,the federation observes,may only be used to reclaim mining sites that had obtained bond coverage under the former abs by paying the abs reclamation fee.e,a.this continued use of an abs fund fed by an abs reclamation fee,the federation argues,confirms the continued existence of an abs however,while it is true that the abs fund continues to exist in name,it no longer operates as an abs,that is,as a bond pool to provide liability coverage for new and existing mining sites.under the new terms of padep program enhancements document,existing and future operators can no longer rely on the pa smcra fund for their bond coverage.existing operators that were originally bonded under the abs,and relied on the supplemental revenue in the fund,were required to obtain new,cbs bonds.new operators were and are required to be permitted and bonded under a cbs bond and,consequently,were and are required to pay for the full cost of their bond coverage.thus,while there still is a legacy alternative bond fund that is being paid into and drawn on to cover for forfeitures that occurred during the conversion,there is no longer a current or prospective abs in pennsylvania.
although we have determined that pennsylvania has effectively converted to a cbs and osm did not abuse its discretion in approving that conversion,neither we nor osm are yet out of the woods,so to speak.that is because we are still faced with the question of what obligations,if any,pennsylvania has to ensure reclamation of sites forfeited before the conversion to a cbs began,plus any additional sites whose reclamation costs are still not fully covered by cbs bonds.to clarify,it is important we distinguish between the abs as a bonding program,which no longer exists in pennsylvania,and the particular mine sites bonded under that now defunct program.this distinction is a critical one as the conclusion that it is permissible under smcra for a state to dissolve its abs program,in the manner pennsylvania has,does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that all liabilities accrued under that program are also automatically dissolved.in other words,there are still mining sites in pennsylvania that were originally bonded under the abs and forfeited prior to the cbs conversion.the question remains as to what obligations pennsylvania has to provide for complete reclamation and treatment of these mining sites and their pollutional discharges.
osm argues,and the district court agreed,that whatever obligations pennsylvania has,those obligations are not the ones set forth in e.that provision,osm maintains,simply ceased to apply once the prospective conversion to a cbs was announced and approved.osm position,simply stated,is that,because there is no longer an abs in pennsylvania,e is no longer applicable and any obligations set forth in that provision are no longer binding.to reiterate,the district court agree d that a conversion to the cbs amounts to a conversion of applicable statutory provisions and regulations.pennsylvania fed of sportsmen clubs,d at.we do not agree with this conclusion entirely.we agree that the conversion to a cbs amounts to a change in statutory provisions going forward for those mining sites where complete reclamation costs are now fully covered by cbs bonds.however,we do not agree that sites forfeited before the conversion began are no longer subject to regulation under e.
to start,like the federation,we find osm apparent about face on the issue of the applicability of e,and more generally pennsylvania outstanding and future reclamation liabilities,striking however,an agency is not estopped from changing a view it believes to have been grounded upon a mistaken legal interpretation and an administrative agency is not disqualified from changing its mind good samaritan hosp.shalala,d citations omitted.indeed,chevron itself involved an agency reversal on a significant question of statutory construction.see chevron,at.on the other hand,a s a general matter,of course,the case for judicial deference is less compelling with respect to agency positions that are inconsistent with previously held views.pauley bethenergy mines,d see also ins,d an agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency earlier interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view.when an agency sharply change s its substantive policy,then,judicial review of its action,while deferential,will involve a scrutiny of the reasons given by the agency for the change.natural res.def.council,epa,cir.under these circumstances,osm bears the burden of rationally explaining its departure from its previous position.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.
with respect to the step one of the chevron congress has spoken directly to the question at agree with the district court that t he language of smcra itself does not address dissolution of an abs one way or the other.pennsylvania fed of sportsmen clubs,d at.to state the issue more precisely,congress has not set forth any requirements under smcra or any of its regulations dictating how a conversion from an abs to a cbs is to be executed and how any remaining liabilities from an insolvent abs are to be discharged.as smcra and its regulations are silent on the issue of dissolution of an abs,we proceed to step two of the chevron analysis where the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.the basic tenets of statutory construction apply to construction of regulations and our starting point on any question concerning the application of a regulation is its particular written text.wilson united states parole comm n,cir.the regulation at issue provides 
osm may approve,as part of a state or federal program,an alternative bonding system,if it will achieve the following objectives and purposes of the bonding program 
the alternative must assure that the regulatory authority will have available sufficient money to complete the reclamation plan for any areas which may be in default at any time.
osm fixes on the words may approve and argues that the terms of the provision therefore refer only to the conditions for approval of abs programs however,this suggested narrow construction is contradicted by the more expansive language in e,which requires that the regulatory authority have available sufficient money to complete the reclamation plan for any areas which may be in default at any time read naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.united states gonzales,d quoting webster third new international dictionary.osm argument that the at any time component applies to the abs that is the subject of the proposal and approval,br.of appellees at,is unavailing given that the words at any time are immediately preceded by the words any areas which may be in default.the context makes clear that the words at any time apply not to the abs program in general,but to specific areas,mining sites bonded under the abs.see textron lycoming reciprocating engine div.automobile workers,d i t is a fundamental principle of statutory construction and,indeed,of language itself that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.citation and quotations marks omitted.thus,a plain reading of the words any areas which may be in default at any time indicate that the obligations prescribed by e are not restricted to the immediate circumstances surrounding the approval of an abs,but are instead ongoing in nature and apply at any time,so long as those mining areas originally bonded under the abs,and not yet converted to cbs bonds,still exist.
furthermore,keeping in mind the distinction between sites bonded under the abs and the abs itself,we see no reasonable basis for osm assertion that a purely prospective transition to a cbs initiated on august,have retroactive effects on obligations that already accrued and guarantees that were already made under the abs while the abs was still active.this assertion is inconsistent with the expansive language of e insofar as it adds to the phrase any areas which may be in default at any time an implicit limitation until a new bonding system is in place for new or ongoing mine operations.furthermore,it would allow the regulatory authority to disclaim or write off existing reclamation liabilities a result which would be contrary to the fundamental purpose of smcra bonding requirement,which is to ensure complete reclamation of mining sites in the case of forfeiture.see cat run coal.at a.consequently,even under the deferential standard applicable to agency interpretations,osm construction of e is impermissible.mercy catholic med,at.we conclude that e continues to apply to sites forfeited prior to the cbs conversion and that e requires that pennsylvania fulfill the obligations it voluntarily assumed to ensure that these sites are fully reclaimed.
finally,we turn to pennsylvania program enhancements document.this document provided the justification for pennsylvania claim that the deficiencies identified in osm notice and h amendment had been remedied.osm is careful to emphasize that,for purposes of its review,it did not view the program enhancements document as a means of complying with e because it believed that pennsylvania bond conversion mooted the issue of compliance with that provision.as the district court correctly observed,however,the decision to terminate the part notice was made after consideration of the actions taken over the that were described in the program enhancements document.pennsylvania fed of sportsmen clubs,d at.in light of our conclusion that e continues to apply to sites forfeited prior to the conversion,the program enhancements document takes on special significance.if,in fact,the program enhancements document does not ensure compliance with e,then it is an inadequate response to osm notice and h amendment,both of which emphatically called for pennsylvania to take measures to comply with its obligations pursuant to e.
as described supra,the program enhancements document presents an elaborate array of proposals for discharge abatement.the federation argues that many of these proposals are inadequate,but we need not reach that argument because we believe the program enhancements document is inadequate for a more basic reason none of the proposals described in it represent enforceable commitments.osm and padep describe these proposals in the language of a guarantee,see,br.of appellee padep at describing the workplan as a commitment,acknowledged by osm that became a programmatic obligation,but pennsylvania is only obligated under the regulations to enforce the provisions of its approved state program.in turn,osm may only take oversight action against pennsylvania for failure to implement those provisions.because the program enhancements document is not part of an approved program amendment,it is not part of the commonwealth approved state program,and pennsylvania is therefore under no obligation to implement its programmatic commitments.while we would not go as far as the federation in describing the use of language such as programmatic commitments and programmatic accountability as bureaucratic obfuscation,we do agree that such references do not obscure the simple fact that the program enhancements document sets forth policy aspirations,not enforceable obligations.
even if we were to concede that padep is unlikely to disregard the goals described in the program enhancements document,given the time and effort put into drafting it,smcra demands that sufficient money will be available at any time a discharge from an abs bond forfeiture site must be treated.e.the plain language of this provision requires that pennsylvania demonstrate adequate funding for mine discharge abatement and treatment at all abs forfeiture sites.while the program enhancements document appears to be a good faith effort by osm and padep to allocate scarce resources,smcra requires that reclamation and treatment of all mining areas be guaranteed.e.the program enhancements document is a policy directive,not an enforceable guarantee accordingly,osm actions in rescinding the october,part notice and deleting the h amendment were inconsistent with smcra and osm own regulation,e,and therefore an abuse of discretion.
iv.conclusion 
close to thirty years ago,through smcra,congress dealt with the reclamation problem that then faced this country as a result of decades of coal mining that provided needed supplies of energy,but left many states and communities with land that was badly scarred,no responsible party to reclaim the land,and no taxpayer funds that would allow the federal or state government to do the work.pennsylvania was one of those states with such a problem.at the same time,pennsylvania had an abundance of coal,communities whose economies benefited from coal mining,and a coal mining industry interested in doing the work.to provide for reclamation and at the same time allow states such as pennsylvania to continue mining,smcra established new stringent rules for permitting,bonding,mining and reclamation.notably,it was also one of the first laws passed by congress employing a new form of federalism,whereby states could assume primary responsibility for implementing the law
