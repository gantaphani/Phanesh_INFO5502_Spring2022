richard kporlor is a liberian citizen in his late twenties who has lived in the united states as a lawful permanent resident since september.after returning from a trip to liberia,kporlor was detained when officials found that he had a criminal record,and removal proceedings were initiated against him.kporlor filed claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat,but the immigration judge ij reviewing the case found that none had merit.kporlor appealed only the withholding of removal order,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.kporlor has now petitioned this court for review of that claim and his cat claim.
we must dismiss kporlor petition because a c strips us of jurisdiction to review bia denials of withholding of removal in cases involving certain criminal aliens.additionally,we lack jurisdiction to review kporlor cat claim because kporlor did not appeal the ij denial of that claim to the bia and thus did not exhaust his administrative remedies.see d.
the parties do not dispute that kporlor committed crimes which subject him to removal.indeed,kporlor admits that he has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude,br.of petitioner at,triggering removal under a a i i.he was convicted in august of grand larceny,ann,and of procuring a vehicle with intent to defraud,ann.kporlor explained to the ij that the underlying behavior for these offenses consisted of taking several taxi cab rides for which he could not pay.additionally,kporlor testified that he was convicted of identity fraud and of two violations of a protective order against him sought by his,although those crimes did not form the basis for his removability.
although the convictions in this case occurred in,kporlor was not detained until april,when he applied for reentry into the country after a trip to liberia.he was charged with removability under a a i i as a criminal alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude 
in response,kporlor applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat.he claimed he feared to return to liberia because he had been tortured and forced by the liberian government to serve as a child soldier in the early during liberia civil war and believed he would face future persecution there as a result.
the ij held multiple hearings and eventually denied kporlor withholding and cat applications finding that kporlor testimony was not credible and that documentary evidence from both sides indicated that child soldiers were not used by liberian government forces at the time kporlor claimed he was conscripted by them.although kporlor testified to truly horrible experiences as a child,including assertions that he was beaten,had boiling water and melted wax poured on his body,had the bottoms of his feet cut open,and was shot in both legs,the ij found that multiple inconsistencies undermined his assertions.
perhaps more importantly,kporlor admitted that he had recently made two separate trips to liberia,and the ij found that he had stayed for lengthy periods of time,without suffering any harm.further,the ij noted that the fact of kporlor repeated travel to liberia undermines both his credibility and his claim that he would fear for his safety if returned there.while kporlor claimed that he had to sneak in and out of the country on both trips,his travel documents were stamped with regular entry and exit stamps from the main airport in monrovia,liberia capital city.kporlor claimed that the stamps were forged but provided no evidence in support.
kporlor also failed to provide any support for his claim that he was forced into making the two liberia trips after facing possible desertion charges from the united states marine corps.indeed,not only did kporlor fail to produce any documentation of the purported desertion charges,but he also failed even to provide evidence beyond his own assertion to show that he was ever in the marine corps at all.
after the ij denied kporlor applications for withholding of removal and cat protection,kporlor,acting through pro bono counsel,appealed only the withholding of removal decision to the bia.he contested the ij determination that he was not credible.the bia affirmed the decision,noting that the immigration judge credibility determination is not clearly erroneous in this case.
following the bia affirmation,kporlor filed a pro se brief,now appealing both his withholding and cat claims.this court appointed new counsel and asked for discussion of whether the bia erred in not addressing the cat claim in its disposition.importantly for the current appeal,new counsel acknowledged that kporlor did not appeal his cat claim to the bia,and thus that t he bia did not review the ij denial of that claim.br.of petitioner at.because questions exist about our jurisdiction over both of kporlor claims,we must resolve them before we can even consider the merits of his contentions.as we find that we have no jurisdiction,we dismiss kporlor petition.
federal appellate courts determine de novo whether they have subject matter jurisdiction to decide a case.saintha mukasey,cir tillman resolution trust,cir.jurisdictional strictures are always important,but nowhere more so than where congress has set those strictures in an area implicating foreign affairs.see jama immigration and customs enforcement,d removal decisions may implicate our relations with foreign powers and require consideration of changing political and economic circumstances.quoting mathews diaz,d.kporlor attempts in his pro se brief to challenge the ij and the bia denial of his application for withholding of removal under b.he argues that the ij improperly weighed the evidence he presented in support of his assertions that he had been tortured and faced a future risk of injury.however,the fact that kporlor also admits that he committed a crime involving moral turpitude divests us of jurisdiction to review the claim.
this admission is an understandable one.the supreme court long ago explained in the immigration context that w hatever else the phrase crime involving moral turpitude may mean in peripheral cases,the decided cases make it plain that crimes in which fraud was an ingredient have always been regarded as involving moral turpitude.jordan de george.at a minimum,kporlor conviction for violating ann.by procuring a vehicle with intent to defraud qualifies as a morally turpitudinous act.
the relevant statute,a c,states as follows 
notwithstanding any other provision of law no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by rea son of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or several other sections of title.
in turn,sections a a i and i i direct that,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,any alien convicted of,or who admits having committed a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible.we have noted that section a c bars review completely except when it is necessary to determine whether a petitioner actually has triggered the statute jurisdiction stripping provision.see,jahed acri,cir no jurisdiction under a c except to evaluate whether petitioner was an alien who committed a prohibited criminal offense afeta gonzales,cir same alim gonzales,cir same bosede mukasey,cir same,but reviewing purely constitutional claim under section a d berhe gonzales,cir same.but see morales gonzales,cir unuakhaulu gonzales,cir.in the present case,there is no argument that kporlor is an alien,and he admits that he has committed a crime involving moral turpitude,thus subjecting him to removal.br.of petitioner at.
section a c phrase any final order of removal is a broad one that precludes our consideration of the subsidiary issue of withholding of removal,a claim that is typically asserted to defend against a removal charge.while the resolution of a withholding claim need not itself rest on whether an alien committed a criminal act,it can only be triggered by a charge of removability.see b a removal not allowed if alien life or freedom threatened due to race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.indeed,t
