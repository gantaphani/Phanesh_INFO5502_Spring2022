the plaintiff in this case brought a discrimination claim against her former employer under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,for denying her a reasonable accommodation following her foot surgery.the district court dismissed her case after concluding she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not filing her proposed accommodation with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.because we think that plaintiff administrative remedies were adequately exhausted,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
in january,carolyn sydnor,a public health nurse employed by the fairfax county health department,underwent surgery on her left foot.she returned to work that march.on november,fairfax county terminated sydnor from her position because it believed that her medical restrictions following surgery limited her capacity to perform the full clinical duties of a public health nurse.
following her termination,sydnor filed an administrative charge with the eeoc on december,alleging that the county had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability in violation of the ada.according to her charge,sydnor had requested a reasonable accommodation from her manager,edwyna wingo,but was denied her desired relief.the charge did not describe the accommodation requested.
along with the charge,sydnor completed an eeoc intake questionnaire.in her questionnaire,she described her disability as limited walking ability can not lift more than must use electric wheelchair if moving for any length of time limited writing ability.she also confirmed that she had asked the county for changes or assistance to do her job because of her disability.in response to the questionnaire instruction to describe the changes or assistance that you asked for,sydnor wrote that she had requested to be assigned as nurse of the day and to be in the clinic doing lighter duty work.she then alleged that in response to her request,wingo said she did not want me around the patients in the clinic because of my wheelchair.
the eeoc issued sydnor a notice on august,and she filed a complaint against the county in federal court ten days later.following discovery,the county moved for summary judgment.as the district court observed,at this stage of the litigation,sydnor claimed that the reasonable accommodation she should have been offered was to work in the clinic with a wheelchair.the court denied the county motion after finding that it remains in dispute whether plaintiff could have served as a public health nurse while in a wheelchair.
the county then filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence that sydnor had requested to work in the clinic in her wheelchair.according to the county,the sole accommodation that sydnor informed the eeoc that she had requested was light duty work and she had never stated in her eeoc charge that she would have been able to perform the essential job duties of a clinic nurse in a wheelchair.the district court agreed that plaintiff did not file her proposed accommodation with the eeoc and dismissed the case sua sponte because of her failure to exhaust administrative remedies.sydnor now appeals.
modeled after title vii of the civil rights act of,et,the ada incorporates that statute enforcement procedures,id.a,including the requirement that a plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the eeoc before pursuing a suit in federal court,see id.b,f.rather than a formality to be rushed through,this exhaustion requirement is an integral part of the title vii enforcement scheme.chacko patuxent,cir.for one thing,requiring a party to file a charge with the eeoc ensures that the employer is put on notice of the alleged violations,miles dell,cir,thereby giving it a chance to address the alleged discrimination prior to litigation.this means that injured parties can often obtain relief far earlier than they would be able to in the courts,where the ponderous pace of formal litigation can force victims of discrimination to wait while injustice persists.chacko,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for another,the requirement places the resolution of employment discrimination disputes initially in the hands of the eeoc.allowing this agency the first crack at these cases respects congress intent to use administrative conciliation as the primary means of handling claims,thereby encouraging quicker,less formal,and less expensive resolution of disputes.chris tenet,cir.
the goals of providing notice and an opportunity for an agency response would be undermined,however,if a plaintiff could raise claims in litigation that did not appear in his eeoc charge.to prevent such gamesmanship,we have held that the scope of the plaintiff right to file a federal lawsuit is determined by the charge contents.jones calvert,cir.thus,a plaintiff fails to exhaust his administrative remedies where his administrative charges reference different time frames,actors,and discriminatory conduct than the central factual allegations in his formal suit.chacko,at.we have therefore not found exhaustion where a charge alleges only racial discrimination but the complaint includes sex discrimination,bryant bell atl,cir,or where a charge alleges only retaliation but the complaint alleges racial discrimination as well,jones,at.
at the same time,however,the exhaustion requirement should not become a tripwire for hapless plaintiffs.while it is important to stop clever parties from circumventing statutory commands,we may not erect insurmountable barriers to litigation out of overly technical concerns.title vii sets up a remedial scheme in which laypersons,rather than lawyers,are expected to initiate the process.fed.express holowecki,d internal quotation mark and citation omitted.it would be inconsistent with this framework to require untrained parties to provide a detailed essay to the eeoc in order to exhaust their administrative remedies.as the supreme court has made clear,d ocuments filed by an employee with the eeoc should be construed,to the extent consistent with permissible rules of interpretation,to protect the employee rights and statutory remedies.id.at.
accordingly,an administrative charge of discrimination does not strictly limit a title vii suit which may follow.miles,at.instead,so long as a plaintiff claims in her judicial complaint are reasonably related to her eeoc charge and can be expected to follow from a reasonable administrative investigation,she may advance such claims in her subsequent civil suit.smith first union bank,cir.we have therefore found exhaustion where both the administrative complaint and formal litigation concerned discriminat ion in promotions but involved different aspects of the promotional system,chisholm postal,cir,and where both the eeoc charge and the complaint included claims of retaliation by the same actor,but involved different retaliatory conduct.smith,at.in doing so,we have sought to strike a balance between providing notice to employers and the eeoc on the one hand and ensuring plaintiffs are not tripped up over technicalities on the other.
we now turn to plaintiff efforts to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.it is clear that sydnor filed an administrative charge with the eeoc.it is clear that she filed her charge on time.see e.and it is clear that her charge claimed what her suit now claims that she had been discriminated against based on her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation.the county nevertheless contends that she did not exhaust her administrative remedies.according to the county,the accommodation sydnor raised at summary judgment working full duty with the assistance of a wheelchair is so fundamentally different from the one mentioned in her eeoc questionnaire light duty work that she failed to satisfy the exhaustion requirement appellee br.at.
we are not persuaded.the variation in these proposed accommodations does not mean that sydnor failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.the touchstone for exhaustion is whether plaintiff administrative and judicial claims are reasonably related,smith,at,not precisely the same,and there are sufficient similarities between t
