this civil action was initiated more than seven years ago by three heavy equipment manufacturers collectively,volvo against several equipment dealers,and has involved numerous claims,and defenses arising from a contract dispute between the parties.while originally pending in the western district of north carolina,the district court granted judgment on the pleadings against the defendants,including clark machinery company,an arkansas corporation clark.clark and two other defendants collectively,the dealers appealed from the judgment,and we affirmed the district court decision in all aspects except one its judgment for volvo on clark claims under the arkansas franchise practices act the arkansas act for termination of its franchise without good cause.see volvo constr.equip,clm equip,cir vacating judgment on clark claims under arkansas act and remanding for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court entered summary judgment against volvo with respect to its liability to clark under the arkansas act.during the ensuing trial on damages,the jury declined to make a damages award to clark.the court subsequently denied clark requests for a new trial and for attorneys fees.in its appeal,clark seeks relief from the court orders denying its motions for a new trial and for attorneys fees.by its,volvo challenges the district court summary judgment decision.because we conclude that the court did not err in the remand proceedings,we affirm.
the factual and procedural underpinnings of this matter were explained in detail in our prior decision.see volvo constr,at.in short,the parties dispute revolves around the termination of agreements the dealer agreements under which champion road machinery limited champion had supplied large motor graders champion motor graders to clark and the other dealers for resale.after purchasing champion in,volvo decided that it could compete more effectively with other manufacturers if it marketed motor graders under a single brand name,volvo and through a single dealer network,that of volvo.volvo thus proceeded to volvoize its products by reengineering and rebranding champion motor graders for sale under the volvo trademark,and to implement a dealer rationalization plan by integrating the volvo and champion dealer networks.in,the dealers responded to the volvoization and dealer rationalization efforts by demanding that volvo continue to supply them with motor graders manufactured by volvo at the former champion factory.the dealers,however,were not selected as authorized sellers of such motor graders,and were notified by volvo that it would no longer supply them with champion motor graders.more particularly,volvo notified clark on october,that its dealer agreement would be terminated on january.
also on october,volvo filed its complaint in the western district of north carolina the north carolina litigation,seeking a declaration that,pursuant to the dealer agreements,it was not obliged to continue supplying champion motor graders to champion dealers.the complaint was later amended to name clark as a defendant,along with among others the previously named dealers.on march,the dealers filed a separate action against volvo in the eastern district of arkansas the arkansas litigation.the arkansas court subsequently transferred the arkansas litigation to the western district of north carolina,and the parties thereafter consented to consolidation of the arkansas litigation with the north carolina litigation in the north carolina court.notably,clark and the other dealers asserted twelve counterclaims in the north carolina litigation that mirrored their twelve claims in the arkansas litigation.among them were clark claim and counterclaim based on volvo alleged violation of the arkansas act.
on december,the district court in north carolina filed the opinion from which the original appeal and our prior decision emanated.see volvo trademark holding aktiebolaget clm equip,d the opinion.by its opinion,the court granted volvo partial judgment on the pleadings.the court determined,inter alia,that volvo refusal to supply the dealers with champion motor graders did not breach the dealer agreements because each agreement contained a without cause provision authorizing termination of a dealership without cause.in addition,the court concluded that the dealers were not protected by state dealer protection statutes the state statutes including the arkansas act invoked by,according to the dealers,trumped the without cause provision and precluded volvo from terminating the dealer agreements without cause.volvo subsequently dismissed its remaining claims,rendering the opinion appealable.
the dealers appealed and,by our prior decision of october,we to the contention of the the district court committed no error in exercising jurisdiction in the north carolina litigation.see volvo constr,at.next,we rejected the dealers assertion that the court erred in ruling that volvo had not breached it contractual obligations by terminating the dealer agreements,id.at,as well as the dealer contention that volvo was nevertheless estopped from breaching certain oral promises it had made after the dealer agreements were executed,id.at.finally,we addressed the dealers position that,notwithstanding the without cause provision in the dealer agreements,volvo was prohibited by the state statutes from terminating the agreements without cause.id.at.ultimately,we deemed only clark to be entitled to statutory protection,specifying that such protection arose under the arkansas act.id.at.
our discussion of the applicability of the arkansas act focused,in relevant part,on volvo contention that clark could not rely on the act because a provision in its particular dealer agreement provided that the rights,duties and obligations of the parties shall be determined according to the laws of south carolina.volvo constr,at.clark had countered that the provision was invalid,in that the law selected thereunder,that of south carolina contravened a fundamental policy of clark home state of arkansas.id.at.before assessing whether the arkansas act constituted a fundamental policy of arkansas and thus governed clark dealer agreement,we considered the issue of whether clark was a protected party under the act.id.at.in so doing,we observed the following 
in the district court,volvo maintained that clark was not protected by the arkansas act because,pursuant to the provision,clark dealer agreement is governed by south carolina law.volvo did not,however,assert that the statute in question,by its terms,fail s to apply to clark dealer agreement.absent the provision,clark could state a claim under the arkansas act 
we then turned to an assessment of whether the arkansas act embodied a fundamental state policy,recognizing that north carolina will not honor a provision if the law of the chosen state is contrary to the fundamental policy of a state possessing a greater interest in the issue than the chosen state.volvo constr,at we concluded that the arkansas act indeed embodied a fundamental state policy,explaining that the act render ed the termination of a dealer agreement,absent good cause,a violation of the fundamental policy of arkansas,and that arkansas had a materially greater interest than south carolina in determining whether a dealer agreement between an arkansas dealer and an manufacturer can be terminated without cause.id.at.having so ruled,we addressed volvo assertion that,even if clark dealer agreement was governed by the arkansas act,volvo did not violate the act because the agreement was terminated for good cause.id.we determined that a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether volvo possessed good cause,under the arkansas act,to terminate clark dealer agreement.id.at.by our prior decision,we therefore remanded clark statutory claim in the arkansas litigation and its statutory counterclaim in the north carolina litigation for the district court assessment of whether,pursuant to the arkansas act,volvo terminated clark dealer agreement without good cause.id.
on february,during the remand proceedings,the district court granted summary judgment to clark on its claims under the arkansas act,concluding,inter alia,that volvo had terminated the dealer agreement without good cause.see volvo trademark holding aktiebolaget ais constr.equip,d.the court then scheduled the issue of damages for trial.on july,the jury returned a verdict finding that,despite volvo violation of the arkansas act,clark had suffered no actual damages.on july,the court entered judgment on the verdict,specifying that clark was not entitled to damages.
on july,clark filed a motion for a new trial based on several contentions of error,and,on august,it filed a motion,pursuant to the arkansas act,for attorneys fees.on september,the district court denied clark motion for a new trial.thereafter,on october,the court rejected clark motion for attorneys fees.clark has timely appealed the court denial of its requests for a new trial and for attorneys fees,and volvo has from the court summary judgment award in favor of clark.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
volvo contentions on concern the district court award of summary judgment to clark on its claims under the arkansas act.because reversal of the summary judgment award would render moot the contentions made in clark appeal,we first address volvo.volvo makes two appellate contentions the district court erred in concluding that volvo was precluded from raising the issue of the applicability of the arkansas act on remand,and the court erred in concluding that volvo terminated clark dealer agreement without good cause.we assess volvo contentions in turn.
volvo first contends that the district court erroneously applied the mandate rule in deciding on remand that volvo was precluded from asserting that the arkansas act did not apply to clark dealer agreement.we are obliged to review de novo a district court interpretation of an appellate mandate.see atl.of,lp riese,cir explaining that w e review de novo whether a judgment of a district court contravenes the mandate rule,or whether the mandate has been scrupulously and fully carried out internal quotation marks omitted.
on remand,volvo asserted that the existence of a franchise is an element of any claim for violation of the arkansas act,and that the burden was on clark to show that the dealer agreement granted it a franchise under the act.see ann.west specifying that this subchapter applies only to a franchise.volvo maintained that clark had not satisfied this burden,and thus that the act did not apply to clark dealer agreement.without reaching the merits of this contention,the district court concluded that volvo was precluded from pursuing it on remand.in so ruling,the district court relied on the following language from our prior decision 
in the district court,volvo maintained that clark was not protected by the arkansas act because,pursuant to the provision,clark dealer agreement is governed by south carolina law.volvo did not,however,assert that the statute in question,by its terms,fail s to apply to clark dealer agreement.absent the provision,clark could state a claim under the arkansas act 
volvo trademark,d at quoting volvo constr,at.the district court then explained that t he fourth circuit would not have considered whether the act constituted fundamental policy unless and until it found that clark was a protected part y under that statute.id.quoting volvo constr,at.invoking the mandate rule,the district court further explained that,by determining that the arkansas act constituted a fundamental state policy,this court had foreclosed volvo argument that the act does not offer protection to clark.id.additionally,the district court observed that volvo had not raised the franchise element issue either before it or in this court prior to the remand proceedings.id.
in its,volvo contends that the district court erroneously applied the mandate rule in the remand proceedings and that our prior decision did not absolve clark of its burden of proving the franchise element of its claim under the arkansas act.the mandate rule is a specific application of the law of the case doctrine.see united states bell,cir.the rule forecloses litigation of issues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal or otherwise waived,for example because they were not raised in the district court.id.significantly,as the district court recognized,volvo did not raise the franchise element issue in the earlier proceedings,either in the district court or in this court.see volvo constr,at volvo did not assert that the arkansas act,by its terms,fail ed to apply to clark dealer agreement.volvo trademark,d at volvo did not raise the issue of before this court in the first proceeding.as the district court also recognized,under the mandate rule a remand proceeding is not the occasion for raising new arguments or legal theories.consequently,it properly concluded that volvo had waived its contention on the franchise element and,as a result,was not entitled to raise it on remand.
furthermore,absent exceptional circumstances,the mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.bell,at.our prior opinion expressly provided that a bsent the provision,clark could state a claim under the arkansas act.volvo constr,at.by concluding that clark could state a claim under the arkansas act,we necessarily recognized that clark dealer agreement granted it a franchise under the arkansas act 
volvo next contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to clark on the basis of its conclusion that volvo had terminated clark dealer agreement without good cause.as a general proposition,we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see lee york county sch,cir.an award of summary judgment may be appropriately made only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.c.
the arkansas act includes a list of eight occurrences that constitute good cause for termination or cancellation of a franchise.see ann.west the district court held,adopting clark position,that this list constituted the exclusive means by which a franchisor may terminate a franchise for good cause under the arkansas act.volvo acknowledges that it did not terminate clark dealer agreement for any of the specific reasons provided for in the arkansas act,but contends that those eight occurrences are not an exclusive list of what constitutes good cause for termination of a franchise.appurtenant to this contention,volvo maintains that its reasons for termination,volvoization and dealer rationalization,also constitute good cause for a franchise termination under the arkansas act.
as the district court aptly recognized,volvo contention presents an issue of statutory construction,and a federal court sitting in diversity is obliged to apply state law principles to resolve such a question,utilizing such principles as enunciated and applied by the state highest court.see volvo trademark,d at citing cooper distrib,amana refrigeration,cir.the arkansas supreme court has not resolved the statutory issue raised by volvo,and we are therefore obliged to interpret the arkansas act by applying the principles of statutory construction that would guide an arkansas court in making such a decision.see,selective ins.of,cir.
the district court made a thorough explanation of its ruling on this issue.according to the applicable arkansas legal principles,if a statute is clear,it is to be given its plain meaning,and courts are not to search for any legislative intent.see volvo trademark,d at citing hinchey thomasson.arkansas also subscribes to the legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,meaning that the express designation of one thing may properly be construed to mean the exclusion of another.id.quoting gazaway greene county equalization.
applying these controlling principles to the arkansas act,the district court concluded that good cause for terminat
