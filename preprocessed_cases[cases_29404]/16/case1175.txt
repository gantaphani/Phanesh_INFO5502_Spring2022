background 
upmc health system upmc,a nonprofit corporation that operates a system of hospitals and health care facilities,negotiated with metropolitan life insurance company metlife for an umbrella dental insurance policy for all of upmc employees.on july,metlife issued a written quote for a insurance policy for a high option dental plan.upmc rejected this proposal,requested changes,and metlife issued a revised proposal,dated august.this revised proposal included dual option coverage,whereby employees would be able to choose between high option and low option plans,and a coverage commitment and rate guarantee,which provided that the rates for the second year of coverage would be no more than higher than the rates for the first year 
because metlife could not know in advance how many upmc employees would choose the high option versus the low option,its revised proposal included rates higher to account for this risk,although it based its calculations on an assumed split between the high and low options.it also increased its rates by to account for the increased risk associated with its,as opposed to its original,commitment.important for this appeal,the proposal included a reservation of rights provision that stated 
notwithstanding any rate guarantee,we reserve the right to change our rates for any of the following reasons 
a.the composition of the group,employees,dependents or life insurance volume,has changed or more from the composition when quoted 
b.the financial arrangement on any part of the package is changed 
any of the coverages are cancelled or not issued 
any of the plan designs are changed 
this revised proposal was to remain in effect until january.
upmc accepted the revised proposal in september.its employees were thereby required to enroll in metlife plan before january,in order to be covered in.enrollment was complete in november,with a split between the high option and the low option,which fact metlife knew prior to the commencement of coverage on january.policy number issued and became effective on january.
the policy was a form policy for one year,and included only the first year rates,not the second year rates or guarantee.metlife standard practice was to issue form policies such as this regardless of negotiated rate guarantees.the policy,however,included a changes in rate section section,which stated 
metropolitan may change any or all of the premium rates if there is a change in the terms of this policy.metropolitan may also change any or all of the premium rates a on the first day of each policy period which begins after the date of issue and b on any premium due date following the date there has been a change,since the last day of the prior policy period,of more in the number of employees insured for personal insurance dependent insurance under this policy.
the term policy period was defined as each calendar year,thereby giving metlife the right to increase rates for the second year of coverage.it also included an integration clause section,titled entire contract,which provided that t his policy and the application of the employer constitute the entire contract between the parties.a copy of the application is attached to this policy.the copy of the policy provided to upmc,however,did not contain the application,although it was included in the copy produced from metlife files.the application stated that,by signing it,the policyholder agreed that a ll of the terms and conditions under which the insurance is to be provided will be set forth in the group policy or policies issued.upmc never signed the application,and,it argues,never agreed that all of the terms of its contract with metlife were set forth in the policy.
by june,metlife was losing money on the upmc policy,and realized the mistake it had made during underwriting in entering data into its computer spreadsheet,causing it to quote rates at least too low.upon realizing this error,the metlife regional vice president decided to pull the second year rate guarantee.metlife calculated that,even if it did not try to recoup its year losses,it would need a rate increase to reach its profitability goals for.in july,metlife tried to convince upmc to accept higher rates for the second year of coverage because it was losing money on the policy,and because it claimed that upmc had not provided all of the data required during the quote process.by,metlife conceded that it had been given the required data,and instead invoked its right to increase the rate because the number of lives had changed by.it soon abandoned this justification,and,instead,on september,invoked its right under the august revised proposal to increase the rate because the composition of the group had changed sufficiently,and threatened a increase notably,metlife did not then argue that the rate guarantee was inapplicable because the policy was an integrated contract it argued only that the provisions of that guarantee allowed it to unilaterally raise its rates because of the changed circumstances.
upmc refused to pay the threatened rate increase,and on october,metlife issued a renewal notice that called for a rate increase.on december,upmc informed metlife that it would not accept any rate increase beyond,and that it intended to enforce the coverage commitment and rate guarantee.in response,metlife informed upmc that it would send a premium bill reflecting the increase.upmc paid only the rate increase agreed to as a result of the august,revised proposal,although metlife continued paying claims.during,metlife submitted premium bills to upmc totaling,but upmc remitted only difference of.
on january,upmc filed this action in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania,seeking both a declaratory judgment that metlife was contractually obligated to provide group dental insurance at a guaranteed rate for a two year period count one,and damages for conduct in violation of pennsylvania bad faith statute.ann.count two.metlife counterclaimed for breach of contract,seeking damages for upmc refusal to pay the rate increase.
on may,metlife moved for summary judgment on liability.on august,the arthur schwab,to whom the case had been reassigned,issued a memorandum opinion and order granting metlife motion.among other things,the district court held that the policy was an integrated,enforceable contract that contained all of the terms of the parties agreement in unambiguous terms.it concluded that the august,revised proposal could not be considered to defeat those clear terms,and that even if it could,the rate increase for was allowed under that proposal because there had been a sufficient change in the composition of the group of employees.the court also dismissed upmc bad faith claim because it was not premised on metlife refusal to pay a claim.the parties were directed to either stipulate to damages,or to file position papers on damages.
on august,after the parties exchanged briefs on damages,the district court awarded to in premiums upmc refused to pay plus in interest,and interest at a rate of in accordance with pennsylvania law.upmc appealed both the order of august and the order of august.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.
