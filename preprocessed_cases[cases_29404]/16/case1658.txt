the brazos river authority bra appeals a judgment after a jury trial in its suit for breach of contract,breach of implied warranties,and fraud against ge ionics,ionics,and cajun constructors,cajun,arguing that the district court improperly excluded evidence.finding reversible error,we vacate and remand.
bra is responsible for developing and managing the water resources of the brazos river basin as part of its duties it operates the lake granbury surface water and treatment system swats.because lake granbury has a high concentration of salts,swats used a process called electrodialysis reversal edr to reduce the salt content of the water.ionics designed and manufactured the original mark iii edr system installed at swats in.
the fundamental working unit of the edr system is a stack,which consists of alternating layers of membranes and plastic spacers.the spacers contain channels through which water flows.electric current is applied to the stack,and the resulting electrical field separates the salt ions out of the water,reducing the mineral content.other edr components relevant in this appeal are the electrodes,which are large metal plates that transfer electricity electrode cable assemblies,by which voltage is supplied to the electrodes electrode spacers,which are special thicker spacers adjacent to the electrodes and stack siding,which are large plastic protective coverings for the stacks.
in the ionics developed the mark iv or third generation spacers for its next generation mark iv edr stack systems.ionics also made a retrofit version of the spacer for use in older mark iii systems known as the retrofit,retrofit screen,and the retrofit spacer.in bra concluded that it needed to expand the capacity of swats to meet customer demand.the parties disagree about many of the details after this point.
ionics proposed that bra could increase its capacity by using the retrofit spacers.bra accepted the proposal and announced the job for public bid.cajun constructors,cajun,submitted a bid and was awarded the prime contract,then entered into a subcontract with ionics whereby ionics agreed to retrofit the stacks with the new spacers.cajun and ionics performed the retrofit in and.bra alleges,and brought evidence at trial,that after the retrofit it began experiencing problems with the plant so that the water quality decreased,problems that culminated in fires in june and march and april.bra closed the swats plant in december.
bra sued in state court,inter alia,ionics and cajun,alleging negligence,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,breach of implied warranty of good and workmanlike performance,breach of implied warranty of merchantability,breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,strict liability in tort,and breach of contract.the suit was removed to federal court.before trial the district court dismissed the tort claims on account of the contractual relationship among the parties the dismissal of the tort claims was not appealed.the jury rendered a verdict in favor of ionics and cajun on all the remaining claims.
the standard of review for evidentiary rulings is abuse of discretion.if,however,the district court applies the wrong legal rule,the standard is de novo.moss ole real estate,cir 
bra argues that the district court incorrectly applied federal rule of evidence b,by excluding,as to an inanimate object as distinguished from a natural person,evidence meant to prove action in conformity with character.we agree this was serious error.specifically,the court erred in excluding evidence of fires at other facilities on the basis of rule b.
rule b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith emphasis added.this rule is applied most frequently in the criminal law context,aetna cas.sur.guynes,cir,and we have limited its application to civil actions where the focus is on essentially criminal aspects,crumpton confederation life ins,cir.an example is a civil action for trade secret misappropriation in which the plaintiff seeks to introduce evidence of the defendant having taken proprietary trade secrets before from a prior employer because this would prove propensity to commit misappropriation.
as bra correctly points out,the propensities of a particular person to act a certain way are not at issue in this case,which involves the properties and functions of inanimate objects edr components at various facilities.the rule talks about the character of a person,and there is no person whose character bra is trying to prove.
given that it was error to exclude evidence of similar occurrences on the basis of rule b,we ask whether that error is harmless.compaq computer ergonome,cir.we may not disturb the district court exclusion of the evidence if that ruling can be upheld on other grounds,regardless of whether the court relied on those grounds.metallurgical,fourtek,cir.we will not reverse erroneous evidentiary rulings unless the aggrieved party can demonstrate substantial prejudice.viazis am.ass of orthodontists,cir citation omitted.
in davidson oil country supply klockner,cir per curiam on petition for rehearing,we held that exclusion of evidence of similar occurrences was not harmless,so a new trial was required.we explained that exclusion of similar occurrences seriously hindered the presentation of plaintiff case and that the scarcity of instances of ferrotubi pipe failure turned into affirmative proof of the lack of defect,discrediting the plaintiffs witnesses and creating an atmosphere so unreal and so prejudicial as to require remand our original opinion reflects the exclusion of a substantial volume of relevant evidence which created an atmosphere of disbelief for the claims and defenses of docs.this atmosphere of disbelief permeated the entire trial and tainted the jury findings.id.at.we noted that against the two isolated failures,the proffered and excluded evidence reflected approximately thirteen failures of ferrotubi tubing that contributed to the discrediting of docs witnesses,who were limited to telling of only two failures in ferrotubi materials.id.we explained that this atmosphere of disbelief permeated the entire trial and tainted the jury findings,permitting it to find for klockner despite spectacular admissions that it had made,as shown by for example admitted klockner documents acknowledging a tremendous quality problem with the ferrotubi material,davidson oil country supply klockner,cir.we also held that the evidence of similar failures was not irrelevant,because it was offered to prove that the ferrotubi products contained a latent manufacturing defect and because it was clearly relevant to the questions of merchantability and good faith.id.at.
ionics contends that davidson is distinguishable because,unlike the situation there,in the instant case significant evidence against ionics has been introduced at trial.nonetheless,although there was evidence acknowledging,as in davidson,a tremendous quality problem with ionics material,that evidence,as in davidson,could not dispel the atmosphere of disbelief created by the exclusion of evidence of the failure of ionics equipment.although this case is slightly closer than was davidson,because more evidence against the defendants appears to have been introduced here,the exclusion of this evidence is not harmless,because we can not say with positive assurance that the jury would have decided the same way had it been admitted 
we agree with bra that a crushing majority of the evidence of other fires was excluded,so the excluded evidence is not merely cumulative.in johnson william ellis sons iron works,cir on petition for rehearing,it was reversible error to exclude certain treatises,because although the substance of these publications was effectively placed before the jury,id.at,by expert evidence,the direct quotation from a number of sources would have been more dramatic and might have been more persuasive,id.it is not for us to decide that the effect of what was excluded might not have altered the jury views,because there was a reasonable likelihood,that a substantial right was affected.
we also do not view lightly the evidence ionics presented to the jury to the effect that bra had failed to maintain the edr plant to specifications,had failed to maintain required pressures to perform required maintenance tasks such as salt cip to tend to hot spots timely and to replace corroded components and to the further effect that this created a propensity for product malfunction.but we can not say with positive assurance that the evidence of other fires would not have influenced the jury in believing bra rebuttal of some of ionics maintenance by indicating that there was a problem with ionics equipment independently of the maintenance issues.
ionics also argues that davidson is inapplicable because it dealt with merchantability issues arising from the sale of a product the pipe,while this case deals with claims about system design,which are not covered by ucc implied warranties.we disagree.
the law implies a warranty that goods are fit for some particular purpose where the seller,at the time of the transaction,has reason to know of the particular purpose for which the goods are required and the buyer is relying on the seller skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.see.bus.ann.vernon.the particular purpose must be a particular purpose.the complex and specialized nature of the retrofit makes its purpose.
bra purchased goods from ionics during the retrofit and allegedly relied on ionics special skills and representations that the retrofit goods the new thin membranes were fit to replace the goods that were changed during the retrofit thicker membranes and would work with bra other existing components to produce more water at the same or higher quality than previously was the case.therefore,the design claim relating to the compatibility of the retrofit goods with the components is included in bra claim for breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.we reject defendants argument that the warranties claims fail because no defect existed at the time of delivery like davidson,this case deals with a latent defect.
as we have said,we will not remand for a new trial if the evidence erroneously excluded could nonetheless be barred on another ground.ionics argues that the evidence was properly excluded under rules and of the federal rules of evidence as irrelevant or prejudicial.for this analysis,it is immaterial whether the district court actually rejected evidence on these grounds 
relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.evidence of similar accidents might be relevant to the defendant notice,magnitude of the danger involved,the defendant ability to correct a known defect,the lack of safety for intended uses,strength of a product,the standard of care,and causation.ramos liberty mut.ins,cir.
the excluded documents show that most fires occurred in environments that many may have occurred as a result of failure of the insulated bars and that all involved the same flammable stack siding as that at bra.therefore,the evidence is not excludable as irrelevant under rule.the higher voltage environment is not merely problematic as a design flaw,but relates,as explained,to the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
the higher voltage was required by the new thin membranes installed during the retrofit because the membranes were thinner,there were more of them occupying the space than before the retrofit,so they held a larger volume of water per minute,which in turn required more voltage for desalination.this larger volume was the express purpose of the enable bra to produce more desalinated water per unit of time.
thus,bra is not attempting to bring breach of warranty claims as to the stack siding and bars that were installed before and that would be barred by the statute of limitations.rather,bra is arguing that the components installed during the retrofit were not fit for the purpose of working together with the stacks to desalinate water,as shown by bra obtaining a variance after the retrofit because the water exceeded the acceptable salinity levels.that is,given bra special needs resulting from the tendency of some of its existing components to fail in environments,ionics should not have recommended the retrofit a product,such as the thin membranes,that required a high voltage environment.
although ionics urges that the district court properly excluded evidence of other fires because the circumstances of the bra fires were unique,the law in this circuit with respect to cases,such as this case or davidson,that are not product liability cases,is that the degree of similarity is a question that goes to the weight of the evidence for the jury,not to admissibility.as long as there are similarities as there are here,the differences are for the jury to decide similarly here,the issue,which is whether possible unique circumstances of the bra fire,hot spots made the bra event distinguishable from other fires,goes to the weight of the evidence,not to admissibility.
evidence of similar accidents occurring under substantially similar circumstances and involving substantially similar products may be probative of any number of factors.jackson firestone tire rubber,cir.the question of admissibility of substantially similar accidents is necessarily determined on a basis,with consideration to be given to any number of factors,including the product or component part in question,the plaintiff theory of recovery,the defenses raised by the defendant,and the degree of similarity of the products and of the other accidents 
t he court order in effect limits similar accidents to those involving the firestone base and the goodyear lw side ring.at trial plaintiff expert testified that he was not aware of any other accidents involving those exact components.appellees conclude rather disingenuously from this that jackson accident was unique,and no other accidents were admissible.we decline to take such a narrow and unrealistic view of the matter.
the substantially similar predicate for the proof of similar accidents is defined,again,by the defect or,as we have also termed it,the product at issue.if the disputed defect were restricted to the mismatch of these two parts,then the trial court ruling would have been correct.but if that defect is the danger of all parts because of the great risk of poor fit,then some proof of other accidents involving rims is admissible on the issue of the magnitude of the danger.
the mere fact that some but not all of the fires involved the rather unique mk retrofit spacers or hot spots does not mean that they are not relevant and therefore admissible under the factors outlined above.bra is arguing that the high voltage of the retrofit consequence of the thinner membranes installed during the with the propensity of the assemblies and stack siding to ignite in high voltage a breach of the implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability.because all the other fires appeared to involve at least two of these characteristics,they are similar to the occurrence at bra the jury is to decide the weight to be given to any distinguishing factors.
additionally,because the cause of the fires was a disputed issue at trial,the exclusion of some of this evidence may have prevented bra from rebutting ionics argument that poor maintenance was the cause.see ramos,at.causation is relevant in this case even if the tort claims were dismissed,because ionics opened the door to that evidence by arguing and presenting witnesses that its goods were merchantable and that the fires were not caused by its products,but by bra poor maintenance of the products 
nor was the excluded evidence unfairly prejudicial.unfair prejudice as used in rule is not to be equated with testimony that is merely adverse to the opposing party.virtually all evidence is prejudicial otherwise it would not be material.the prejudice must be unfair.dollar long,cir.the evidence here was not inflammatory 
although there is some prejudice from forcing defendants to explain why the other fires were dissimilar,that burden is not unfair in this case,in which the similarities are not insignificant.in ramos,although we noted that the was installed vertically with a crane,while was scoped out horizontally and then lifted,we held that 
the evidence of the failure was relevant and that the mast and collapse were sufficiently similar to be admitted.in addition,the failure was not too remote in time from the collapse.the trial court generally has broad discretion in the admission of evidence,but that discretion does not sanction exclusion of competent evidence without a sound,practical reason.bailey,cir.
bra argues that the district court erroneously excluded,under federal rule of evidence,evidence of ionics documents showing its investigations of and recognition of component problems.bra explains that rule applies only to measures taken after the injury for which the plaintiff sues that the remedial measure has to be actually taken and that plans,investigations,and testing do not constitute subsequent remedial measures.
for one of the following reasons,the evidence of changes made related to the products in question should not have been excluded 
a the injuries harm to which any remedial measure might apply were the fires,but the claim for damages is for the alleged failure of the product to conform to the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose 
b the evidence was offered to rebut a defensive theory of causation and 
c many of the remedial measures either were not actual measures,or the measures were initiated before the problems occurred.
by definition,rule would not apply in these circumstances.under that rule,when,
after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event,measures are taken that,if taken previously would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur,evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence,culpable conduct,a defect in a product,a defect in a product design,or a need for a warning or instruction.
we now examine each of these reasons in turn 
bra does not seek recovery for the damage caused by the fires,but for the failure of the products it purchased to achieve their intended desalinate and produce water of acceptable quality.the cause of action is breach of warranty for the failure of the product to perform its intended purpose or a particular purpose.
although the parties have not directed us to a rule case on point,we note that a product can fail to perform as warranted without necessarily creating an injury or harm as contemplated by the rule.a lemon is not necessarily a safety hazard.further,in a situation in which a lemon could present a safety hazard,a party could forego a recovery for that injury or harm and merely seek to recover the benefit of its bargain the claim could be eliminated either voluntarily by a party narrowing its pleading,or involuntarily pursuant to rulings by the trial court.
in these instances,the primary rationale underlying rule does not apply.the commentary to the rule makes it plain that the more impressive ground for exclusion rests on a social policy of encouraging people to take steps in furtherance of added safety.advisory committee note to rule.thus,courts have excluded remedial measures because their admission would unduly risk that the factfinder would imply culpability for the injury or harm alleged.see mills beech aircraft,cir.in the instant case,that would not be an issue if recovery is not being sought for the injury or harm.the admission of evidence of changes made merely to improve a product,as distinguished from remedial measures that make an injury or harm less likely to occur,is not barred by the rule.
as noted,rule bars the admission of remedial measures to prove negligence,culpable conduct,a defect in a product,a defect in a product design,or a need for a warning or instruction.the evidence at issue here does not go to the subject of negligence or culpability,because liability here is based on the warranties made and the failure of the product to work as warranted.a breach of warranty is proven by comparing the actual product condition with its warranted condition.rule only applies when the remedial measure is offered to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.the reference is to the event that triggered the remedial measure.wright graham,federal practice and procedure.but,because there is some excluded evidence of product failure related to safety hazards in addition to that of product failure unrelated to that harm,we do not reverse the trial court evidentiary ruling on this ground as to that evidence.
rule does not preclude the admission of subsequent remedial measures on grounds other than to prove culpability.defendants countered bra breach of warranty contention by arguing that the fires resulted from poor maintenance.this court has long recognized that subsequent remedial measures can be introduced on the issue of causation if that is in controversy.
in bailey,at,we were faced with an analogous situation.the plaintiff claimed a ship was unseaworthy because of a faulty crane.id.the defendant countered that the boom had failed because of improper handling by the longshoremen.id.the district court excluded,as a subsequent corrective measure,evidence that the boom subsequently fell and then operated appropriately when the excess grease was removed.id.the exclusion of the evidence that grease was removed was the issue on appeal.the evidence was not offered to prove that by removing the grease,shipowner,in effect,acknowledged that it was negligent rather,it was offered in the context of shipowner successful defensive theory to show the operational cause,not who was to blame id.at.this evidence rebutted defendant argument that the improper rigging of other longshoremen caused the injury.id.at.consequently,we held that the evidence was offered not to prove culpability,but rather to rebut the theory on proximate cause,so it was admissible.id.at.
similarly,some of the evidence excluded in the instant case also serves to rebut ionic defense that the fires were caused by poor maintenance.the admission of the evidence was not barred by rule,and it should have been admitted to rebut defendant theory of causation.
by definition,the rule excludes only remedial measures,so to the extent the district court excluded evidence of design changes or investigations that started before the june accident the investigation of the clamping bar that was error.we have declined to decide whether evidence of investigations is admissible.see james bell helicopter,cir.today,however,we have the benefit of the accumulated wisdom of sister courts that have decided the question.
unfortunately,these courts are split.some take the strict literal interpretation that because,to be excluded under the rule,the measure must be one that could have been taken before the event that gave rise to the claim and one can not investigate an accident before it occurs,an investigation and report taken in response to an accident can not be a measure that is excluded from evidence under the rule.ensign marion county.this position is subject to the criticism expressed in alimenta stauffer,and martel.bay transp,that the purpose of rule encourage remedial be thwarted if the investigations from which such measures result were not undertaken in the first place for fear they would count as an admission.
nonetheless,despite the appealing logic of the rule policy,the text of that rule only prohibits evidence of subsequent measures,not evidence of a party analysis of its product.prentiss carlisle div.of timberjack,cir.the fact that the analysis may often result in remedial measures being taken as occurred here does not mean that evidence of the analysis may not be admitted.this argument is persuasive,because by themselves,investigations would not make the event less likely to occur only the actual implemented changes make it so 
furthermore,as explained in westmoreland cbs,although the logic expressed in cases such as alimenta parallels that which underlies rule see advisory committee note,
the fault of the argument is not in its logic but in that it goes too far and fails to credit the social value of making available for trial what is often the best source of information.cbs argument really goes beyond the issue of the admissibility of the investigative report its logic addresses as well the admissibility of the facts uncovered by the investigation.if the internal investigator uncovered the smoking gun,it is often a cosmetic matter whether this evidence is received as a part of the investigative report or in some other manner.the question of social policy raised by cbs is whether in order to encourage such investigations,their fruits should be shielded from use by adverse claimants.there is,however,no such doctrine either as to the internal investigative report or as to facts revealed by it.in industrial and railroad accident litigation,for example,it is commonplace that such reports,or at least the facts revealed by them,are used by the injured to establish the liability of the company that conducted the investigation in spite of cbs arguments.
we note that specht jensen,cir,and alimenta.at,are distinguishable because they involved an attempt by one party to admit a document specifically for the subsequent remedial measures it suggested.bra offered to redact references to remedial measures actually implemented.therefore,we do not find persuasive the third circuit reliance on those cases for the proposition that there is authority supporting the exclusion of evidence of investigations even if offered with redactions of references to measures.see complaint of consolidation coal,cir.
we do not decide,however,whether reports of investigations are always admissible if the remedial measures are redacted.rather,under the circumstances of this case,excluding various reports under rule was erroneous because it would have made the rule applicable to investigations,which by themselves do not make the accident less likely to occur,and,as to some evidence,it would have stretched the rule to apply to improvements unrelated to safety hazards.
therefore,it was error to exclude exhibit,discussing corporate exposure to product components with marginal product performance,such as the stack siding and the cable assemblies,on the basis of rule to the extent that actually implemented remedial measures would have been redacted.rule prohibits evidence of measures,and those only if actually implemented,but does not proscribe discussions of causation and its relation to poor product performance.
exhibit also was erroneously excluded on rule grounds.that document discusses problems with and improvements to the stacks and the retrofit.a number of the improvements discussed in the document deal with improving product performance,not with increasing the safety of products to prevent accidents that may have occurred because of that product.
for instance,the document discusses reducing the voltage difference in spacers so as to reduce the need for better electrode edge tape.it also talks about designing an electrode spacer specifically for the retrofit.although these improvements would also have the added benefit of increasing safety,there is no indication in the document that these design changes were proposed for any reason other that to make the products better and last longer for the purpose for which they were made.
the case for admitting exhibit,which was excluded based on rules b and,is even stronger.that document begins by explaining the history of the type of material used for the electrode connecting bars.any design change described there that occurred before the fire is therefore not even problematic.the document then relates several instances of failure of this that did not engender any fires or present any safety issues.
thus,this description of product failures can not be considered a investigation,because there was no accident producing harm or injury to investigate.rather,this merely shows a concern to improve a product,not to remedy a safety hazard.the document next discusses two fires,but they are not even bra fires,so the only basis for exclusion of that material would be the rule b ruling,which,as we have explained,is erroneous 
as with the excluded rule b evidence,the erroneously excluded rule evidence could not have been excluded on other grounds.the evidence was relevant and did not engender any unfair prejudice.we do not decide whether,by itself,the exclusion of the rule evidence was harmless,because in conjunction with the rule b exclusions the errors were not harmless as we explained in ramos,at,after a long and hotly fought trial,an appellate court is reluctant to overturn the rulings of a district judge.nevertheless,relevant evidence which engenders no unfair prejudice and which relates to the core of the dispute should not be summarily excluded.accordingly,we vacate and remand for retrial.
bra argues that the district court improperly restricted bra questioning of cajun corporate representative,todd grigsby.bra explains that,during pretrial discovery,it noticed the deposition of cajun on a variety of topics pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and neither ionics nor cajun objected.cajun designated grigsby to testify on all topics on cajun behalf,and bra deposed him.
at trial,bra called grigsby.it had previously designated excerpts from his testimony to be presented if he did not appear to testify he did,however,appear.according to bra,after a few questions,counsel for cajun,joined by counsel for ionics,objected to further examination of grigsby on the ground that he lacked personal knowledge.
the district court ruled that bra could elicit testimony from grigsby if it was offered with respect to cajun alone and did not reference ionics that grigsby testimony was inadmissible as to ionics pursuant to federal rule of evidence and that grigsby testimony would be unduly prejudicial to ionics because it would constitute hearsay as to ionics and because grigsby lacked personal knowledge.bra was prohibited from asking any questions that would address whether any component supplied by ionics was defective and from asking grigsby about the warranty notice given by bra to cajun.
rule b is designed to avoid the possibility that several officers and managing agents might be deposed in turn,with each disclaiming personal knowledge of facts that are clearly known to persons within the organization and thus to the organization itself.therefore,the deponent must make a conscientious endeavor to designate the persons having knowledge of the matters sought by the party noticing the deposition and to prepare those persons in order that they can answer fully,completely,unevasively,the questions posed as to the relevant subject matters.t he duty to present and prepare a rule b designee goes beyond matters personally known to that designee or to matters in which that designee was personally involved.the deponent must prepare the designee to the extent matters are reasonably available,whether from documents,past employees,or other sources 
obviously it is not literally possible to take the deposition of a corporation instead,the information sought must be obtained from natural persons who can speak for the corporation.thus,a rule b designee does not give his personal opinions,but presents the corporation position on the topic.taylor,at.when a corporation produces an employee pursuant to a rule b notice,it represents that the employee has the authority to speak on behalf of the corporation with respect to the areas within the notice of deposition.this extends not only to facts,but also to subjective beliefs and opinions if it becomes obvious that the deposition representative designated by the corporation is deficient,the corporation is obligated to provide a substitute 
we agree with bra that cajun violated rule b by failing to prepare grigsby with respect to issues that although not within his personal knowledge,were within the corporate knowledge of the organization,such as whether bra had presented a warranty claim to cajun.at the very least,cajun could have designated another witness with personal or corporate knowledge of the questions asked.
if the designated agent is no
