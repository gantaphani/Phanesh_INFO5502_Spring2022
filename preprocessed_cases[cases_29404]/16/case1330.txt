caci international caci appeals the district court decision that its insurer,paul fire and marine insurance company paul,had no duty to defend caci against claims alleging torture and abuse at abu ghraib and other prisons in iraq.caci acknowledges that the insurance policies at issue in this case generally limit coverage to the united states and canada.still,caci argues that some of the underlying claims implicate events that happened in the united states,and that other claims fall under an exception to the coverage provision for employees who were away from home for a short time.
we agree with the district court that the underlying complaints can not be read to allege events that happened in the coverage territory.under principles of insurance law,the place of the the place of some precipitating the location of the event for coverage purposes.further,the underlying complaints do not allege that any injuries resulted from the activities of a caci employee who was in iraq for a short time.requiring paul to defend caci on the mere possibility that some employee may have been briefly in iraq would allow the policies exception to to swallow the rule.we thus decline to extend caci coverage beyond the plain terms of its policies and affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,caci international entered into three contracts with the united states government to provide logistical and intelligence support for operations in iraq.this work included screening and interrogating detainees at abu ghraib and other prisons in iraq.also in,caci took out a commercial general liability protection policy with paul,which provided that paul would defend caci against any suit for covered injuries or damage and would indemnify caci for up to million.see policy policy a,march.caci renewed this policy for an additional year in march.for purposes of this case,the two policies are identical in all material respects and we will refer to them as the policies.
the policies covered bodily injury that was caused by an event.policy a at.they in turn defined event as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.id.they also obligated paul to pay any legally required damages for covered personal injury that was caused by a personal injury offense.id.but with one exception,the policies limited coverage to specific geographic areas,stating

only in the coverage territory and 
only for covered injury or damage that caused by events or offenses which happen or are committed there.
id.at.the coverage territory was defined as the united states,its territories and possessions,canada,and puerto rico.but the policies also stated that

they result from the activities of a person whose home is in the coverage territory,but is away from there for a short time on your business 
id.therefore,the policies included a short time exception to the general bar on coverage outside the home territory.
in the summer of,caci was sued by two groups of former iraqi detainees and their survivors who alleged torture and abuse by caci employees at abu ghraib and other prisons in iraq.the first suit accused caci and another corporation of implementing an ongoing torture conspiracy that,it alleged,the defendants began in with the goal of profiting by extracting intelligence through torture.al rawi titan,cal.filed june,the saleh complaint.the complaint alleged that the torture conspiracy exist ed separate and apart from the ongoing lawful operations of the defendants,and included specific actions such as stripping detainees,threatening them with dogs,kicking them,and forcing them to watch family members being tortured.id,b,e,d.finally,the complaint alleged negligent supervision and hiring on the part of caci.id.
the second lawsuit made similar allegations.it claimed that caci employees had beaten detainees,deprived them of food,stripped and photographed them,and forced them to witness violent attacks on their relatives.ibrahim titan,a b,e f,d filed july,the ibrahim complaint.the complaint also alleged that caci and other defendants had engaged in an ongoing,pattern of criminal conduct for which the enterprise has earned millions of dollars in profits.id.because of the similarities in the two complaints,the saleh case was transferred to the district court for the district of columbia,where it was consolidated with ibrahim for purposes of discovery.saleh titan,d.
when paul received notice of these complaints,it notified caci that it believed the alleged abuses did not implicate paul duty to defend or indemnify under the policies.in march,caci filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in virginia,seeking a declaration that paul was obligated under the policies to defend caci in both lawsuits.paul countered that it had no duty to defend or indemnify caci.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
in july,the district court granted paul motion for summary judgment and denied caci.see caci int l paul fire marine ins,d.in considering whether paul had a duty to defend,the district court applied the eight corners rule,which requires courts to compare the four corners of the insurance policy against the four corners of the underlying complaint to determine if any allegations may potentially be covered by the policy.id.at quoting capitol envtl,river ins,d.
while affirming the importance of the eight corners rule,the district court noted that few courts have discussed what evidence is intrinsic to the complaint and may be considered along with it.the court therefore compared the eight corners rule to the four corners rule,which limits what federal courts may consider when ruling on a.b motion to dismiss.id.at.under this rule,the fourth circuit has held that courts may consider the complaint itself and any documents that are attached to it.id.citing sec y of state for def.trimble navigation,cir.this circuit has also held that courts may consider a document that the defendant attaches to its motion to dismiss if the document was integral to and explicitly relied on in the complaint and if the plaintiffs do not challenge its authenticity.id.quoting am.chiropractic ass trigon healthcare,cir.applying those standards to the eight corners rule,the district court concluded that it would consider documents outside the complaint if they were attached to the complaint or the complaint explicitly relied on the documents and no party challenged their authenticity.id.at.
the court therefore looked at two documents attached as exhibits a and d to the saleh complaint a job posting for linguistic support positions with team titan,a collaboration between caci and other corporations and a military report on abu ghraib that discussed the involvement of two caci employees in abuses there.see id.the court also considered caci contracts with the government,which it concluded were expressly incorporated into the complaints,noting that several of the detainees legal claims were predicated on the contractual relationships created by the contracts.id.further,caci had not challenged the contracts authenticity and had even offered them as evidence to support its motion for summary judgment in the saleh proceeding.see id.finally,the district court noted that,in addition to the policies at issue here,caci had a global policy with paul that covered events outside the policies coverage territory but specifically excluded iraq.although the global policy was not part of the underlying complaints,its provisions were described in a declaration attached as exhibit e to caci complaint in the declaratory judgment action.
after comparing these with the complaints the paul policies,the district court concluded that caci could not invoke coverage under the short time exception because the alleged activities,by their very nature,were not indicative of a brief overseas business trip,but rather of a more permanent presence in iraq.id.the court also held that the claims of negligent supervision and hiring in the saleh complaint did not allege activities within the united states because the factual predicate for such claims arises from the underlying tortious conduct of the employee,all of which took place in iraq.id.at.caci now appeals.
because we have diversity jurisdiction in this case,we apply the choice of law rules of the forum this case,virginia.see klaxon stentor.virginia insurance law applies the law of the place where an insurance contract is written and delivered.buchanan doe.because paul delivered the policies to caci in virginia,we apply virginia law.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.fuisz selective ins.of,cir.
this case is not about the conduct of the war in iraq.it is simply a case about certain principles of insurance.it is also not a case about whether coverage could exist,but whether it did.principles of insurance law in virginia,as elsewhere,are solicitous of insureds.for example,ambiguous terms in a policy are construed against the insurer,who wrote the policy and presumably could have written it more clearly,fuisz,at.and as caci points out,doubts over coverage are typically to be resolved in favor of the policyholder and against a limitation of coverage.see am.reliance ins.mitchell.
likewise,it is that an insurer obligation to defend is broader than its obligation to pay.brenner lawyers title ins.for while the duty to defend is based on the allegations in the underlying complaint,the duty to indemnify relies on litigated facts.policyholders often pay more to insure against the costs of defending lawsuits,even those that are ultimately unsuccessful.see perdue farms,travelers cas.sur.of,cir.therefore,virginia and other states recognize the potentiality rule,wherein an insurer duty to defend is triggered if there is any possibility that a judgment against the insured will be covered under the insurance policy.bohreer erie ins.group,d.paul must therefore defend caci against the detainee lawsuits if there is any potential that the policies would cover the claims alleged in the underlying complaints.see.power northbrook prop.cas.ins.
but the duty to defend is not without limits.to implicate the duty,the underlying complaint must allege some facts on which the insurer would be liable.therefore,even construing policies in favor of the insured,and even considering virginia potentiality rule,if it appears clearly that the insurer would not be liable under its contract for any judgment based upon the allegations,the duty to defend will not attach.brenner,at.
it is also important to resolve disagreements over the duty to is after all a collateral early as possible in litigation.that is why virginia and other states have adopted the eight corners rule,which requires courts to look primarily at the underlying complaints and the insurance policy to determine if there is a potential for coverage,am.online,paul mercury ins,d.this rule serves a salutary purpose it prevents courts from conducting an intensive factual analysis at an early stage of the proceedings,which would only increase litigation costs and needlessly tax parties and courts before the underlying suit had barely begun.moreover,permitting courts to consider evidence outside the complaint would not only lead to duplicative factual inquiries in determining the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify,but would render the two duties indistinguishable and thus effectively depreciate the duty to defend.capitol envtl,d at.
therefore,the district court properly began its inquiry by looking at the complaints themselves.see caci int l,d at.it is less clear,however,whether the district court properly extended its inquiry by considering those documents attached to or relied on by the complaints.on the one hand,looking beyond the complaint might become a slippery slope.on the other hand,considering documents attached to the complaint would not entail the extensive factual inquiries or lengthy litigation that the eight corners rule seeks to prevent.as the district court noted,we have held in the rule b context that courts may look at documents that the defendant attaches to its motion to dismiss,trimble navigation,at.but those cases are partly motivated by concerns that a plaintiff could prevail on a motion to dismiss by selectively quoting documents in the complaint without providing their full context therefore,courts can prevent such manipulation by considering the documents in their entirety when presented by the defendant.see trigon healthcare,at.but there is no apparent need in the insurance context to counter possible manipulations by the plaintiff in the underlying complaint.
because the question is a matter of state insurance law rather than of federal procedure,and because virginia courts have not signaled a readiness to look beyond the underlying complaint,we will decline to consider those documents attached to the complaints or on which the complaints in the underlying action rely.moreover,we find it unnecessary to consider these documents because,as we hold below,the allegations in the complaints themselves foreclose the possibility of coverage under the territorial provision or short time exception of the policies.
to assess whether paul has a duty to defend in this case,we first ask whether the abuses alleged in the underlying complaints took place inside the coverage territory.to answer this question,we look initially to the policies to determine the scope of coverage.as noted,the policies agree to defend against suits seeking damages for covered injury that caused by events or offenses which happen or are committed in the coverage territory,which includes the united states and its territories as well as canada and puerto rico.policy a at.it is undisputed that all of the alleged abuse took place in iraq.
nevertheless,caci argues that some of the alleged activities took place in the coverage territory because the saleh complaint alleges negligent supervision and hiring,and these activities according to caci took place in virginia,california,and elsewhere in the united states.see saleh complaint.caci notes that the policies provide coverage for events or offenses which happen or are committed in the coverage territory,policy a at,and that the event causing the alleged injury was caci acts of negligent hiring and supervision.brief for appellants at.
this argument fails for two reasons.first,the complaint does not allege that the negligent supervision took place outside iraq it alleges only that caci acted negligently and directly harmed plaintiffs by failing to take appropriate steps to supervise those persons performing interrogation services.saleh complaint.the complaint does not state from where caci directed its supervision,and in fact suggests negligence on the part of those directly supervising ongoing interrogations in iraq.therefore,it is not clear that these allegations on their face implicate events in the coverage territory.
more importantly,however,even assuming that the complaint alleges activities that happened in the united states,the great weight of case law holds that it is the location of the of some precipitating determines the location of the event for purposes of insurance coverage.see farmers alliance mut.ins.salazar,cir collecting cases.the reasons for a place of the injury test are clear.as the district court noted,applying a cause in fact test would let plaintiffs sweep any number of worldwide events into the ambit of a domestic policy as long as the underlying complaint alleged negligent supervision.caci int l,d at.therefore,a causal test would create a windfall for the insured and render the insurer responsible for a liability for which it had not contracted.keystone automated equip.reliance ins,noting that if the policyholder had wanted coverage,it could have paid a higher premium to obtain it see also hagen supply iowa mut.ins,cir same.if domestic policies could be stretched to this extent,global policies would become superfluous and territorial coverage limitations would lose their meaning.hagen,at.
the cases cited by caci are not to the contrary.they
