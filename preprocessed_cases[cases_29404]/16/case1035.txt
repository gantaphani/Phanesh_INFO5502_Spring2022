appellants eurofins pharma holdings and viralliance appeal the dismissal of their complaint by the united states district court for the district of delaware,which held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the appellees,bioalliance pharma sa,viralliance sas,and gilles avenard,and also dismissed the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court ruling that it lacks personal jurisdiction over bioalliance pharma sa and viralliance sas,vacate the district court order that it lacks personal jurisdiction over gilles avenard,and affirm the district court dismissal of the action under forum non conveniens.
background 
this dispute arises out of the acquisition by appellants eurofins pharma holdings epush and viralliance vi collectively,eurofins group of intellectual property the ip from bioalliance pharma sa bioalliance and viralliance sas viralliance collectively,bioalliance group.the ip includes,among other things,in vitro phenotyping technology,known as assays,that assist in the development and administration of drugs used to treat hiv and hepatitis b by testing the effectiveness of those drugs on specific patients viruses.in,eurofins group and bioalliance group entered into an agreement the transfer agreement to transfer the ip from bioalliance group to vi,for the purpose of commercializing the ip in the united states market.
the gravamen of eurofins group complaint is that,despite bioalliance group contractual promise that no claims were pending or threatened against it regarding the use of the ip,bioalliance group knew about a patent infringement claim threatened against the ip by advanced biological laboratories,abl that gilles director of vi,the and chief operating officer of bioalliance,and the former president and chief executive of to inform the other vi board members of the threatened claim and that bioalliance group wrongly asserts that it continues to own the ip.
a.the parties

bioalliance,a société formed under the laws of france,with its principal place of business in france,is a pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of opportunistic infections in cancer and hiv.viralliance was a simplified société anonyme and subsidiary of bioalliance,formed under the laws of france,which was engaged in the development and commercialization of products and services to assess viral and cancer drug resistance.avenard,a director of vi and the and chief executive officer of bioalliance,is a citizen of france.he was also the president and chief executive officer of viralliance.
b.the transfer agreement 
the transfer agreement was executed on october,and the transaction,pursuant to the transfer agreement,closed on december.the parties agree that the majority,if not the entirety,of the transfer agreement negotiations took place in france.of the individuals involved in the transfer agreement negotiations,only jonathan lapin,a new york lawyer who assisted eurofins group,was not domiciled in europe 
the transfer agreement provided that eurofins formed vi as its wholly owned subsidiary and that it eurofins would fund vi with up to million.in exchange,bioalliance group would transfer the ip to vi for ten dollars and the future right to purchase stock options in vi the option.app.at.in addition,the transfer agreement provided that eurofins would elect one person nominated by bioalliance to vi board of directors while bioalliance group option remained outstanding.app.at.
the transfer agreement states that,to the best of bioalliance group knowledge,the ip is valid and enforceable and the current use by bioalliance group or its licensees or neither infringes on the rights of any third party nor constitutes an unauthorized use,app.at,and that there is no fact which could have a material adverse effect on either of vi or the ip which has not previously been disclosed in writing by bioalliance group.app.at.
the transfer from bioalliance group to vi of the ip included the transfer of bioalliance group right,title,and interest in and to all agreements,including licenses,relating to the ip.app.at.prior to the transfer agreement,bioalliance group had licensed patents that comprise part of the ip to specialty laboratories,specialty labs.the licensing agreement between bioalliance group and specialty labs contained a representation and warranty,as well as an indemnification obligation by bioalliance group,in favor of specialty labs.eurofins group assumed the indemnification obligation under the transfer agreement.
the transfer agreement embod ied the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and provided that the agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware,without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.app.at.it did not,however,contain a forum selection clause 
abl claim against the ip 
on or about july and august,abl contacted specialty labs to claim that its use of certain phenotyping technology,licensed to it by bioalliance group,infringed two abl patent numbers and.on january,abl sued ameripath,the corporate parent of specialty labs,for patent infringement vi stepped in to defend the action,pursuant to its contractual obligation to indemnify specialty labs.after six months of negotiations,the parties settled the lawsuit.under the settlement,abl granted vi a license to use patents and,in consideration for a payment and royalties.
the crux of the instant litigation is eurofins group allegation that it learned for the first time during the settlement negotiations that abl,in early,had informed bioalliance group that it bioalliance group required a license from abl,with respect to the phenotyping technology.abl had been in negotiations with bioalliance group to purchase viralliance assets prior to eurofins group involvement.abl also allegedly informed eurofins group that,in early,abl engaged the services of la societe bionest partners bionest to advise bioalliance group that it required a license from abl with respect to the phenotyping technology.eurofins group alleges that bionest has at least one piece of written correspondence reflecting the infringement claim it articulated on behalf of abl to bioalliance group in late or early.eurofins group has,as yet,been unable to procure this document due to confidentiality obligations asserted by bioalliance group 
at a july,meeting of the vi board of directors,avenard confirmed that bioalliance knew about the abl claim in,and that bioalliance refused to consent to the release of the bionest correspondence.the minutes of that meeting provide 
the fifth order of business was a discussion of bioalliance reasons for refusing to consent to the disclosure by bionest of its dossier relating to efforts of bionest on behalf of abl to acquire the viralliance business from bioalliance in avenard explained that bioalliance consent to bionest disclosure request was withheld because the bionest dossier contains confidential and sensitive strategic information relating to bioalliance efforts to sell the viralliance business and not relevant to vi.avenard went on to say that,as a negotiating tactic in,sayada alleged that the viralliance business infringed on abl patents in order to justify making a lower offer for the viralliance assets and that,at the time,bioalliance had obtained legal opinions which bioalliance had but would not make available that there was no infringement.
in connection with the transfer agreement,eurofins group and bioalliance group also entered into a technical assistance and research agreement tara.pursuant to the tara,bioalliance group was given a license to the ip in order to develop it for vi benefit.vi would own any of the technology that was developed in accordance with the tara and was obligated to reimburse bioalliance group for expenses.the instant litigation also concerns a dispute over certain technology developed by bioalliance group that vi claims ownership over,pursuant to the tara.
d.the litigation 
on september,eurofins group sued bioalliance group and avenard in the united states district court for the district of delaware on october,bioalliance group and avenard moved to dismiss the complaint.on january,bioalliance filed suit against eurofins group and abl in the commercial court in paris,france.on march,bioalliance group and avenard filed a motion to stay discovery in the delaware action pending the outcome of their motion to dismiss.
on july,the district court held a teleconference,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,to discuss the motions to dismiss and stay discovery.during the teleconference,the court issued an oral order staying discovery in the case pending its ruling on the motion to dismiss in a de facto sort of way,i am going to grant the motion for a stay,though not formally.app.at.
on september,the district court granted bioalliance group and avenard motion to dismiss.eurofins pharma holdings,bioalliance pharma sa,wl.specifically,the court held that the claims against bioalliance group and avenard should be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,and that the action should be dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.id.at.additionally,the court denied eurofins group request to take jurisdictional discovery.id.at.
on february,eurofins group filed the instant appeal challenging each of the district court holdings.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court jurisdiction was premised on a.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under.
iii.analysis 
for the reasons addressed below,we will affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against bioalliance group for lack of personal jurisdiction and the district court denial of eurofins group motion for jurisdictional discovery related to bioalliance group we will vacate the district court dismissal of the claims against avenard for lack of personal jurisdiction and we will affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens.
personal jurisdiction over bioalliance group 
we review de novo the district court decision that it lacks personal jurisdiction.telcordia tech telkom sa,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure e,a federal district court may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state in which the court sits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.whether a district court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is a inquiry.first,there must be a statutory basis for exercising jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant in accordance with the law of the forum state.metcalfe renaissance marine,cir.second,the nonresident must have minimum contacts with the forum state sufficient to satisfy constitutional due process.id.where the district court does not hold an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.id.citing sandy lane hotel,cir.further,i t is well established that in deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a court is required to accept the plaintiff allegations as true,and is to construe disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff.id.citing toys r us,step two,cir.
in pertinent part,the delaware statute provides a statutory basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over any nonresident who transacts business or performs work in delaware,contracts to supply services or things in delaware,or causes tortious injury in delaware by an act or omission in delaware.ann.tit,c section c is to be broadly construed to confer jurisdiction to the maximum extent possible under the due process clause.hercules leu trust banking bahamas.
eurofins group alleges that bioalliance group transacted business in delaware,contracted to provide services in delaware,and caused tortious injury in delaware.specifically,eurofins group asserts that the transfer agreement is based on a joint venture in which bioalliance group retains and asserts active control over vi.further,eurofins group argues that the transfer agreement is premised on the incorporation of vi as a delaware corporation.these arguments are not persuasive.
the terms of the transfer agreement do not indicate that vi is a joint venture or that bioalliance group retains any control over vi.to the contrary,the penultimate paragraph of the transfer agreement states 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this general agreement or in any of the other transaction documents,no partnership,joint venture or other similar arrangement or relationship is being created or shall exist between bioalliance group,on the one hand,and vi or eurofins,on the other hand,under or with respect to the transaction documents.
app.at.the transfer agreement also states explicitly that eurofins wholly owns vi.app.at.
in addition,the record lacks evidence that bioalliance group played any part in the decision to incorporate vi in delaware.while the purpose of the transfer agreement was the commercialization of the ip in the united states,app.at,there is no evidence in the record that bioalliance group had any intent that vi be incorporated in delaware.the record is also bereft of evidence that bioalliance group engages in the management of vi.
here,it is crucial to distinguish between avenard,as an individual,and bioalliance group,as corporate entities.while avenard,as a member of vi board,does participate in the management of vi,he does so in his capacity as an individual.it makes no difference that he was nominated by bioalliance in france,nor that eurofins was bound by the transfer agreement to appoint him.in other words,the relationship between eurofins group and bioalliance group is wholly contractual.as the district court explained,being the foreign parent of a delaware subsidiary,without more,is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant under the delaware statute.eurofins pharma,wl,at citing monsanto syngenta seeds,d.it follows that bioalliance group contractual right to select a board lesser indicia of control than being the corporate parent of a delaware also insufficient,without more,to confer personal jurisdiction over bioalliance group.
eurofins group also avers that the parties intended that disputes concerning the transfer agreement be litigated in delaware.to support its contention,eurofins group points to an ancillary contract,schedule to the transfer agreement,which contains a delaware forum selection clause.app.at.this argument,too,is unavailing.
bioalliance group is not a party to schedule.app.at.additionally,eurofins group admits that the parties fought over a forum selection clause in the transfer agreement,but in the end they agreed to omit such a clause from the contract.as such,schedule does not represent the parties intent to contest the issue of the proper forum in which to resolve disputes at a later time.
thus,even accepting eurofins group allegations in the complaint as true,they fail to establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.metcalfe,at.there is no indication that bioalliance group committed any act or omission in delaware,either in connection with the transfer agreement or the tara so as to permit jurisdiction to be asserted under subsections c or c of the delaware statute.ann.tit,c allowing for personal jurisdiction over a nonresident who transacts any business or performs any character of work in delaware id.at c allowing for personal jurisdiction over a nonresident who c auses tortious injury in the state by an act or omission in delaware see also tristrata,neoteric cosmetics.in order for a court to exercise jurisdiction under subsections c and c,some act must actually occur in delaware.furthermore,even if eurofins group had not waived its argument based upon subsection c by failing to raise it before the district court,which it has,eurofins group can not establish that bioalliance group contracted to provide services in delaware,since any services bioalliance group performed under the tara were carried out in france.see ann.tit,c allowing for personal jurisdiction over a nonresident who c ontracts to supply services or things in delaware.
eurofins group also appeals the denial of its request for jurisdictional discovery.we review the district court decision to deny jurisdictional discovery for abuse of discretion.toys r us,at.if the plaintiff presents factual allegations that suggest with reasonable particularity the possible existence of the requisite contacts between the party and the forum state,the plaintiff right to conduct jurisdictional discovery should be sustained.id.modification in original quoting mellon bank psfs,ass farino,cir.a plaintiff may not,however,undertake a fishing expedition based only upon bare allegations,under the guise of jurisdictional discovery.belden,ls,d.
eurofins group falls woefully short of making factual allegations suggesting with reasonable particularity the possible existence of contacts between bioalliance group and delaware.eurofins group argued that the heavily lawyered nature of the transfer agreement leads it to conclude that it is unlikely,if not impossible,that bioalliance group did not participate in the decision to incorporate vi in delaware.that reasoning,however,militates against eurofins group position because evidence of any such participation would be in eurofins group possession and is not dispositive of the issue of whether jurisdictional discovery is required.
thus,we affirm the district court denial of eurofins group motion for jurisdictional discovery and the district court dismissal of the complaint against bioalliance group for lack of personal jurisdiction.
personal jurisdiction over avenard 
eurofins group also appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint against avenard for lack of personal jurisdiction.specifically,eurofins group argues that the district court erred in holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over avenard under ann.tit,b.we agree.
section b states that any nonresident of delaware who accepts election as an officer of a delaware corporation is deemed to have consented to service of process in any action in which that officer is a necessary or proper party,or in any action against that officer for any violation of his duties as an officer.i t is the rights,duties,and obligations which have to do with service as a director of a delaware corporation which make a director subject to personal service under the terms of section b.hana ranch,lent.ch see also armstrong pomerance,section b authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction only in actions where directors of a delaware corporation are necessary or proper parties or where the cause of action is grounded on such individuals breach of the fiduciary duties owed to a corporation and its owners.thus,though avenard moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,whether the district court has personal jurisdiction over avenard is,pursuant to b,actually a question of whether eurofins group has stated a claim against avenard in his role as a director of vi upon which relief may be granted.
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.dique new jersey state police,cir.in deciding a motion to dismiss,all allegations of the complaint must be taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,and all inferences must be drawn in favor of them.mcternan city of york,cir.to withstand a rule b motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atlantic twombly,u.eurofins group alleges that avenard,in his role as director of vi,breached his fiduciary duties by failing to notify vi of abl patent claim.according to eurofins group complaint,avenard had knowledge of the abl claim at all relevant times,including prior to execution of the transfer agreement.app.at.moreover,avenard knew that under the transfer agreement,eurofins group assumed bioalliance group obligation to indemnify,among others,specialty labs for any claims of infringement arising out of the ip.app.at.avenard silence therefore protected bioalliance group interest in avoiding its indemnity obligations to specialty labs,knowing all the while that abl had asserted such a claim that bioalliance group otherwise would have been required to defend and suffer the disastrous financial consequences of that obligation.app.at.
the district court concluded that the complaint failed to state a valid claim for breach of fiduciary duty against avenard.eurofins pharma,wl,at.specifically,the court found that eurofins group failed to allege that avenard personally engaged in any transactions that were either harmful to vi,or beneficial to him.id.we disagree.
under delaware law,a director fiduciary duty of loyalty includes a duty to disclose.big lots stores,bain capital fund vii,llc.ch.the duty to disclose is not a general duty to disclose everything the director knows about transactions in which the corporation is involved.id.rather,it is t he intentional failure or refusal of a director to disclose to the board a defalcation or scheme to defraud the corporation of which he has learned,which itself constitutes a wrong.hoover,chase,wl,at.ch.july,quoted in big lots,at.
big lots cites several examples of cases in which courts held that a director violated his duty to disclose under delaware law.primary among those cases is hollinger international black.ch,the paradigmatic example of a director disclosure case,in which the controlling shareholder and director failed to disclose that he was shopping the company in violation of a signed contract that forbade such action.big lots,at citing hollinger,at.avenard attempts to distinguish the allegations in eurofins group complaint from hollinger and the other examples of director disclosure cases cited in big lots.avenard is correct in distinguishing those cases,as the allegations in those cases do not mirror those made here.the dissimilarity does not,however,mandate that the complaint against avenard be dismissed.
instead,we read big lots more broadly than does avenard.whereas he argues that big lots provides the sum total of the types of director disclosure claims that will survive a motion to dismiss,we do not think the big lots court intended the examples of director disclosure claims it provides to be exhaustive.the complaint alleges that,pursuant to the transfer agreement,eurofins group assumed the indemnity obligations to specialty labs formerly assumed by bioalliance group.additionally,the complaint alleges that at the time the transfer agreement was executed and the transaction closed,avenard knew that abl had asserted a claim against the ip licensed by eurofins group to specialty labs.yet,according to the complaint,avenard never came forward with that material information and allowed vi to assume bioalliance group obligations and expenses in connection with the ip.in short,as the complaint alleges,avenard favored the interests of bioalliance group and himself over those of vi.app.at.thus,the complaint states a claim that avenard breached his duty of loyalty to vi by failing to inform vi,at the time he became a director of vi,of abl claim against the ip.
the failure to inform vi was potentially harmful to eurofins group.vi was assured by contract that there were no known claims that could impact its indemnification responsibilities,but that was not true.further,it is conceivable that avenard benefitted from his failure to disclose abl claim.as the complaint alleges,avenard silence could have been intended,in fact,bioalliance group interest in avoiding its indemnity obligations to specialty labs,because bioalliance group knew that abl had told it bioalliance group that specialty labs use of the ip violated abl patents.it follows that avenard,the and chief operating officer of bioalliance,could have derived personal benefit from shifting the indemnification responsibility from bioalliance group to eurofins group.these allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss 
thus,we vacate the district court dismissal of the breach of loyalty claim against avenard on the ground that it lacked personal jurisdiction over him.
forum non conveniens 
finally,eurofins group appeals the district court decision to dismiss the complaint against all parties under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.we review for abuse of discretion the district court dismissal of the complaint under forum non conveniens.windt qwest comms.int l,cir.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the district court decision.
under the doctrine of forum non conveniens,a district court may,in the exercise of its sound discretion,dismiss the case where an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case and when trial in the plaintiff chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to the plaintiff convenience,or when the chosen forum is inappropriate due to the court own administrative and legal problems.windt,at citing koster am.lumbermens mut.cas.
w hen considering a motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,a district court must first determine whether an adequate alternate forum can entertain the case.id.at.if an adequate alternative forum exists,the district court must determine next the appropriate amount of deference to be given the plaintiff choice of forum.id.at.after the district court has determined the amount of deference due to the plaintiff choice of forum,the district court must balance the relevant public and private interest factors.id.if the balance of these factors indicates that trial in the chosen forum would result in oppression or vexation to the defendant out of all proportion to the plaintiff convenience,the district court may,in its discretion,dismiss the case on forum non conveniens grounds.id.
here,the district court determined that france provides an adequate alternate forum for this litigation.it found that each of the defendants is amenable to service of process in france and that,in any event,none of the defendants will contest personal jurisdiction there.eurofins,wl,at.eurofins group does not challenge these conclusions.it contends,however,that france constitutes an inadequate forum on several grounds.it argues that french practice neither provides for depositions as a discovery device nor provides a method for obtaining documents from an objecting adversary or.additionally,eurofins group argues that,under french law,it could not compel abl to appear at trial 
none of these arguments is compelling.regarding the availability of discovery,there are adequate discovery methods available to litigants under french law.see,ernst ernst,france is an adequate forum because there are several perfectly adequate discovery methods available under french law,albeit not as extensive as those available in our courts.concerning the availability of methods to compel abl to appear at trial,eurofins group conceded at oral argument that abl is already a party to ongoing litigation between these parties in france.see also appellees br.abl is a party to the french action now pending in the commercial court in paris,and it has not challenged the jurisdiction of that court.therefore,even if eurofins group correctly states the virtual impossibility of attaining evidence from,this critical fact is moot because abl is a party to the french litigation the supreme court has counseled that in rare circumstances,where the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory,the other forum may not be an adequate alternative.piper aircraft reyno,emphasis added.here,because france is not a clearly unsatisfactory forum,it provides an adequate alternative forum for this litigation 
after concluding that france was an adequate forum for the parties dispute,the district court next concluded that the deference owed to eurofins group choice of forum was outweighed by the relevant private and public interest factors the private interest factors that the district court must consider include 
the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witnesses possibility of view of premises,if view would be appropriate to the action and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.
gulf oil gilbert.the public interest factors include 
the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law that must govern the action the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws,or in the application of foreign law and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.
piper aircraft,at quoting gulf oil,at.
the district court cited the following facts as tipping the balance in favor of litigation in france the initial offer for the sale of the ip at issue in this litigation was extended in france by a french entity the contract at issue in this action was finalized and executed in france all of the sources of proof are located in france,including documents written in french and key witnesses and the at the center of this contract dispute conducts business in france.eurofins,wl,at.
regarding the private factors,eurofins group argues that,under french practice,it would have no ability to obtain key evidence from to a suit,such as abl.this argument repeats one of eurofins group asserted grounds for finding france an inadequate forum,and we reject it on the same grounds as we did in that context.eurofins group also points out that not all witnesses are located in france,since abl is located in luxembourg,one of eurofins group negotiators is based in new york,and a former,now defunct,sublicensing agent of abl used to be based in massachusetts.the record,however,reveals that the majority of key witnesses and sources of proof are,in fact,located in france or the european union.as such,even if the district court statement that all of the sources of proof are located in france overstated the matter,the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the location of the great majority of proof and witnesses in france favors dismissal.
our conclusion that personal jurisdiction exists as to avenard but is lacking over bioalliance group bolsters the court conclusion that the private interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal because,if the claim against avenard were to be heard in delaware,the parties would face the substantial inconvenience of litigating two actions,which involve a common nucleus of operative facts,in two fora.thus,allowing the action against avenard to proceed in delaware would not make trial of this case easy,expeditious and inexpensive,gulf oil,at.
as to the public factors,eurofins group contends that the district court should have given more weight to the fact that the contracts underlying the current dispute are governed by delaware law.although the court should have considered that fact in its analysis,we see no abuse of discretion in what we take to be the thrust of the court dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds is appropriate because the litigation is focused on french defendants alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duties,which took place in france,and,therefore france has a more significant interest in resolving the dispute than delaware.see lacey cessna aircraft,cir in evaluating the public interest factors the district court must consider the locus of the alleged culpable conduct,often a disputed issue,and the connection of that conduct to plaintiff chosen forum.quoting van cauwenberghe biard.
the mere fact that certain documents are written in english is insufficient to change that conclusion.further,though delaware has a significant interest in actively overseeing the conduct of those owing fidu
