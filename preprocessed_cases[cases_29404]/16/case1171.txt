for the third time in the past four years,we are asked to determine whether summary judgment was properly granted in favor of an insurer on the basis that an insurance applicant material omissions on an application constituted bad faith as a matter of law and rendered the policy void ab initio.compare justofin metropolitan life ins,cir,with burkert equitable life assur.soc.of america,cir.appellant kathleen babayan argues that our recent decision in justofin created a rule that bad faith can never be inferred as a matter of law if the applicant provides some relevant medical information,but fails to provide complete information.we decline to adopt babayan proposed rule in this case.the record contains incontrovertible documentary evidence that babayan omitted information in bad faith,and there is no relevant relationship between the information babayan provided on her application and the specific information she omitted.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the district court that babayan omissions on her insurance application constituted bad faith as a matter of law.
we also reject babayan remaining grounds for appeal.we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee northwestern mutual life insurance northwestern with respect to babayan novel bad faith claim premised upon northwestern underwriting practices.in addition,we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of babayan insurance agent,thomas gallina,as to babayan negligence claim because gallina actions did not cause northwestern to rescind babayan policy.
background 
a.the application process 
after missing six days of work because of bell palsy disorder in late december,babayan decided to obtain disability income insurance.in january,babayan telephoned gallina insurance agency.shortly thereafter,gallina met with babayan at her office in new jersey.during this meeting,babayan provided gallina with general,personal information for gallina to use in preparing a specific insurance proposal.several weeks later,on february,gallina presented his proposal to babayan.
babayan agreed to go forward with the application process and filled out a disability insurance application and a nonmedical questionnaire.each of the documents required babayan to respond to a number of specific questions that required either a yes or no response.gallina verbally asked babayan each question,then recorded her response on the application and the nonmedical questionnaire.gallina testified at his deposition that he read the questions from the documents verbatim.
the crux of the dispute between the parties is the interaction between gallina and babayan at the february meeting,particularly babayan responses to two of the questions.question.of the disability insurance application asked 
in the past years,has the insured been in a motor vehicle accident,has the insured been charged with a moving violation of any motor vehicle law,or has the insured driver license been restricted,suspended,or revoked 
babayan does not dispute that question.was answered no on the insurance application.neither does babayan dispute that the answer to question.is false.according to babayan,she informed gallina that she had previously been involved in a motor vehicle accident and a accident in or babayan claims that gallina told her not to disclose the incidents because that far enough away.gallina allegedly told her,i do think it will be a problem,but when you sign the medical waiver,they go get your records from your doctors and they find out that stuff.thus,babayan asserts that she acquiesced in gallina advice to mark no on the application.
in addition,babayan answered no to question.k of the nonmedical questionnaire,which stated in the last years,have you had,been told you had or been treated for arthritis,sciatica,gout,or any disorder of the muscles,bones,joints,spine,back or neck there is no evidence in the record that babayan asked gallina any questions relating to question.k,or that gallina gave babayan any advice on how to answer the question.
after gallina finished filling out the questionnaire in response to babayan answers,babayan signed both the insurance application and the nonmedical questionnaire.each of the documents contained certain representations above the signature line by signing the application and the nonmedical questionnaire,babayan represented that her answers on both forms were truthful and accurate.
the answers contained on the insurance application and the nonmedical questionnaire set forth above,however,were false.babayan was in an automobile accident on september,within five years of the date she submitted her insurance application.in addition,babayan was treated by several physicians between and february for neck,back,hip,leg,and knee pain resulting from her automobile accident,as well as a separate accident in july.babayan acknowledged in her deposition that the answer to question.k was false she stated,however,that she thought that the word disorder meant disease.babayan further testified that had she read question.k at the february,meeting with gallina,she would have asked gallina to explain what the question meant to clear up any misunderstanding.she claims that if gallina had told her that question.k referred to treatment for ongoing problems,she would have answered yes based upon her new understanding.
babayan asserts that written notes she took during her february,meeting with gallina confirm her version of the events.additionally,babayan stated that gallina told her she would have to sign a waiver authorizing northwestern to obtain her medical records.babayan signed the authorization for release of her medical records,and she informed northwestern on the nonmedical questionnaire that joseph kipp was her primary care physician.
paramedical examination 
on february,a paramedical examiner took babayan blood pressure and asked her some further questions about her medical history.several of the questions the examiner asked babayan were identical to questions she had previously answered in her meeting with gallina.babayan testified at her deposition that she did not remember specific questions the examiner asked her,although she stated that the examiner must have asked me obviously at least some of them.one of the questions the examiner asked babayan was question.k.as in her prior answer on the nonmedical questionnaire,babayan answered no to question.k on the paramedical questionnaire babayan testified at her deposition that she did not read the paramedical questionnaire before signing it.she further stated that if she had read the responses marked by the examiner,she would have realized the answers were incomplete and inaccurate.despite not reading the answers marked by the examiner,babayan signed the paramedical questionnaire,thereby representing that her answers and statements were correctly recorded,complete,and true to the best of her knowledge and belief.
after receiving babayan application,nonmedical questionnaire,and paramedical questionnaire,northwestern underwriter cynthia guss approved babayan policy on march.guss did not obtain any of babayan medical records at the time because she did feel that the medical history provided warranted medical records being ordered.in addition,guss testified at her deposition that the inconsistencies in questions and did not merit ordering babayan medical records after the application was approved,gallina delivered the policy to babayan in march.the effective date of the policy was february,the date babayan underwent the paramedical examination.
subsequent illnesses and rejection of claim 
beginning in march or april,babayan started suffering from fatigue,pain,headaches,and an inability to concentrate.kipp gave babayan a preliminary diagnosis of fibromyalgia.over the course of the next ten months,babayan sought treatment from kipp and a number of other physicians for her symptoms.in february,babayan applied for and received disability income payments from the state of new jersey 
on march,approximately one year after her symptoms began,babayan applied for disability benefits under her insurance policy.northwestern assigned disability benefit specialist lisa duller to review babayan claim.duller testified in her deposition that she made the decision to institute a contestability review of babayan claim because company policy provides that such a review is automatically performed if a claim is filed within two years of the application date.babayan application caused duller to request certain information from babayan,including an attending physician statement from kipp.kipp completed the statement,indicating that he had diagnosed babayan with fibromyalgia,depression,chronic pain,and cognitive dysfunction,and that he had set forth a treatment plan that included pain management and examination by specialists.duller also requested medical records from all of the doctors identified in kipp records as providing treatment to babayan.
thereafter,northwestern began a more extensive investigation of babayan claim.duller authorized an outside private investigation service to obtain information about babayan.furthermore,on may,a northwestern representative,jim porter,interviewed babayan at her home.during the course of that interview,porter informed babayan that her full and complete medical history,including her motor vehicle accident and accident,had not been reported to northwestern by gallina or the paramedical examiner.
in summer,babayan was diagnosed with sjogren syndrome,an autoimmune disorder,and primary biliary cirrhosis.babayan advised northwestern of her new diagnosis,and informed the company that the original diagnosis of fibromyalgia might no longer be applicable.
on july,duller referred babayan file to steve kien,an underwriter at northwestern.kien job was to review all of the information in babayan file to come to a determination whether northwestern would have issued the policy to babayan based upon the information it received during the contestability review.in a memorandum to duller dated july,kien concluded had we been aware of the chronic pain and arthralgias symptoms,extensive treatment history and mri confirmed disc disease and degenerative changes in the right knee,policy would have been declined.duller made the decision to recommend rescission of the policy on july.
on that same date,duller sent a memorandum to her supervisor,sharon raymond.duller testified at her deposition that she made the recommendation to rescind the policy based upon kien conclusions.duller further testified that she probably would have recommended that the policy be reformed by adding certain riders to the policy had that been kien recommendation.raymond agreed with duller recommendation,and,on august,duller sent a letter to babayan rescinding her policy.duller enclosed a check totaling babayan premium payments,plus interest,and informed babayan that by cashing the check she would release northwestern from all claims babayan did not cash the check.
ii.procedural history 
on february,northwestern filed a two count complaint alleging misrepresentation and fraud and deceit.northwestern sought to have babayan policy declared void ab initio,to have the policy returned,and to receive costs,fees and other relief.on march,babayan filed a complaint against northwestern and joseph savino.the parties stipulated to consolidate the actions for all purposes,and,pursuant to an additional stipulation,savino was dismissed with prejudice.
babayan filed an amended five count complaint on december,against northwestern and gallina seeking a declaratory judgment against northwestern,alleging bad faith denial of insurance benefits and breach of contract against both defendants,and alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against gallina northwestern and gallina filed motions for summary judgment as to all counts in the complaint.on august,the district court granted summary judgment to northwestern and gallina.the district court first determined that northwestern could rescind babayan policy because babayan knowingly made false and material misrepresentations as a matter of law.because this determination rendered the policy void ab initio,the district court then held that northwestern was entitled to summary judgment on babayan breach of contract claim.the district court next concluded that summary judgment was appropriate in favor of northwestern with respect to babayan bad faith claim.finally,the district court held that gallina was entitled to summary judgment as to babayan negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims as to the negligence claim,the district court held that babayan failed to produce sufficient evidence establishing that gallina owed her a duty of care.in addition based upon its earlier finding that babayan conduct was fraudulent as a matter of law,the district court held that babayan could not obtain contribution for her own willful misconduct as an intentional tortfeasor.alternatively,the district court held that babayan claims against gallina were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
babayan filed a timely notice of appeal on august.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to,because the parties are citizens of different states babayan pennsylvania northwestern wisconsin gallina new jersey and the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of,exclusive of interest and costs.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order of the district court pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of northwestern and gallina.morton int l,staley,cir.we therefore apply the summary judgment standard set forth under federal rule of civil procedure c.under that standard,we will affirm the judgment of the district court if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
northwestern rescission claim 
the initial issue confronting the court is whether babayan answers to question.of the insurance application and question.k of the nonmedical and paramedical questionnaires were knowingly false or made in bad faith.after reviewing the applicable case law,we conclude that babayan answer to question.did not constitute bad faith as a matter of law.if we were considering babayan answer to question.alone,we would be required to reverse the judgment of the district court.we are not,however,and we hold that babayan answer to question.k constituted bad faith as a matter of law for the reasons set forth below.
generally,in order to void an insurance policy under pennsylvania law an insurer has the burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence,the following three factors the insured made a false representation the insured knew the representation was false when it was made or the insured made the representation in bad faith and the representation was material to the risk being insured.justofin,at citing coolspring stone supply,am.states life ins,cir.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court is required to take the heightened standard of proof into account.id.at where the clear and convincing standard applies,the trial judge must inquire whether the evidence presented is such that a jury applying that evidentiary standard could find only for one side.
the parties do not dispute that the general framework as set forth in justofin governs northwestern rescission claim.nor do they dispute that northwestern proved the first falsity and third materiality factors as a matter of law.the dispute centers around the district court determination that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to whether babayan answers were knowingly false or made in bad faith.
two recent decisions of this court reached contrary conclusions as to whether,at the summary judgment stage,an insurer could obtain a judgment as a matter of law based upon the insured false misrepresentations in an insurance application.because of their importance to the pending appeal,we discuss each of the decisions in detail.
in the first decision,burkert,we held that a life insurance policy was void ab initio because the applicant knowingly made materially false misrepresentations in his insurance application.in that case,the decedent,seth jamison,applied for a million dollar life insurance policy through equitable life.in connection with his application,jamison was required to state whether he used narcotics and other drugs within the last ten years and whether he received medical counseling or medical treatment regarding the use of alcohol or drugs.jamison answered that he was treated for cocaine abuse in the late and early,but that he had no problems since.burkert,at we granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer on its rescission claim because the irrefutable evidence revealed that jamison was undergoing treatment for cocaine addiction with his clinical psychiatrist at the time he filled out the application.id.we rejected the beneficiaries argument that jamison answers were ambiguous,finding that jamison incomplete answers did not raise a question of fact because fraud is presumed from knowledge of the falsity.id.quoting coolspring stone supply,at.we further stated that an inference of fraud is irresistible when,for example,unreported illness or disability of the insured was so serious and so recent that he could not have forgotten it.id.quoting evans.mut.life ins.accordingly,we held that the beneficiaries argument that jamison answers were simply incomplete was frivolous in the face of substantial,incontrovertible evidence that jamison was using drugs and undergoing treatment for drug and alcohol abuse at the time he completed his application.thus,jamison misrepresentations constituted bad faith as a matter of law.
two years after our decision in burkert,we came to a different conclusion after considering a similar issue in justofin regarding whether an insurance applicant misstatements in her application constituted bad faith as a matter of law.
loretta justofin initially applied for a life insurance policy from metlife in.in that application,she stated that her son,christopher justofin justofin was her personal physician,and that he treated her for occasional arthritis of the hands and feet.justofin,at.metlife subsequently issued justofin a life insurance policy in the amount of.in,justofin applied to metlife for additional coverage up to.in connection with that process,justofin was required to complete an additional application.justofin answered yes to two questions on the application that she had been treated for,inter alia,arthritis and that she had been examined by a physician within the past five years.id.at.because justofin answered yes to both questions,the application instructed her to provide further details,including the name of each physician,the nature and severity of her condition,the frequency of attacks,specific diagnoses,and treatment.id.at.justofin listed the names of several doctors she had consulted for treatment,details of the treatment she undergone,and that she had foot surgery for her arthritis.justofin,however,did not mention in the application that her son was her physician.in addition,justofin stated in part b of the application that she had arthritis and that she took prednisone for her arthritis back in.in part c of the application,justofin indicated that she had an unknown type of arthritis that caused her hands to swell.
after justofin passed away,metlife brought an action to rescind her policy on the basis that she knowingly failed to disclose that her son was her physician and that she was prescribed prednisone.the insured relied upon deposition testimony from justofin that he was his mother personal physician from until that he visited his mother weekly during that period to examine her and pick up his mail that his mother had arthritis either rheumatoid,osteoarthritis,or both and that he used to prescribe a supply of prednisone for his mother arthritis.id.at.we agreed that justofin made false representations in the change application because the irrefutable evidence in the record showed that justofin clearly failed to inform metlife that she took prednisone for her arthritis between and.id.at.we disagreed,however,that justofin misrepresentations constituted bad faith as a matter of law.we noted the general rule that an insured state of mind is an issue of fact for the jury because evaluating state of mind often requires the drawing of inferences from the conduct of parties about which reasonable persons might differ.id.at.applying this standard,we held that justofin answers in her change application did not incontrovertibly establish her bad faith.in so holding,we stated that there were at least two possible reasonable inferences from the evidence that precluded summary judgment.first,a jury could conclude that justofin might not have thought that her son casual visits were important enough to report in her new application because a she had already disclosed in the initial application that her son was her physician and b her son discontinued his weekly visits one year prior to her submitting the change application.id.at second,as to justofin failure to list the type of arthritis she suffered from,and to disclose that she was taking prednisone to combat her arthritis,we stated that a jury could determine that further detail on the change application was unnecessary because she already listed on her change application that her arthritis was treated,inter alia,by surgery for these reasons,we held that a material issue of fact existed as to whether justofin answered the application in bad faith.
the crux of the parties competing arguments on the merits of northwestern rescission claim is the proper interpretation of our decision in justofin.babayan argues that justofin can be read as creating a bright line rule that where an insured provides some relevant medical information but fails to provide complete information,the question of the insured intent can not be inferred as a matter of law.in opposition,northwestern raises two arguments.first,northwestern argues that f ar from establishing a bright line rule,the justofin court confined its holding to the facts.second,northwestern argues that,assuming a bright line rule was created in justofin,that rule is inapplicable under the facts of this case because babayan own testimony demonstrates that she provided knowingly false answers in the application and questionnaires.
we agree with northwestern that justofin did not create a rule rather,the holding in justofin confirms the importance of analyzing bad faith cases at the summary judgment stage under the particular factual background of each case.justofin and burkert applied the same framework under pennsylvania law.we decline to extend the specific holding in justofin to a broad rule,particularly where numerous courts have applied the framework to diverse factual situations over the past sixty years.compare justofin,supra burton pacific mutual life ins,holding that judgment should not be entered in favor of the insurer because the insured was unaware at the time he applied for insurance that he suffered from incurable throat cancer and grimes prudential ins.of america,finding that insured did not act in bad faith when she failed to disclose a liver disorder and hypertension on her application where there was testimony that a the insured doctor told her that her liver results were elevated but normal and b her hypertension was an asymptomatic disorder with burkert,supra freedman mutual life ins.of new york,holding that judgment notwithstanding verdict should be entered in favor of insurer where insured answered in his application he had not visited any physicians over the past five years,yet the uncontradicted evidence revealed he had made twenty visits to five physician over the period stopper manhattan life ins.of new york,cir relying upon freedman,court of appeals found that applicant withholding of medical information constituted bad faith as a matter of law walsh john hancock mut.life ins,holding that trial court properly entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of insurer on insured bad faith where evidence revealed that plaintiff withheld from insurance application that he had been hospitalized for cardiac disorder days prior to application date american franklin life ins.galati.granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of insurer and monarch life ins.donahue.granting summary judgment in favor of insurer.
against this backdrop,it is clear that the different results in burkert and justofin did not depend on the application of a legal rule instead,we applied the same standard,examined the record evidence,and simply came to different conclusions as to whether there was incontrovertible evidence of bad faith.our decision in justofin did not foreclose the possibility of summary judgment being entered in the bad faith rescission context.in this respect,the current case does not require us to break any new ground.therefore,we reaffirm that summary judgment may be entered on a rescission claim when,based upon the evidence produced in discovery,the only reasonable inference a fact finder could draw is that the applicant answers were knowingly false,or made in bad faith 
babayan approach would create a number of practical problems.first,the approach ignores that we have to consider each response in the application separately.certainly,a number of questions might be similar in an insurance application,generating similar responses.in that respect,a complete or partially complete answer to one question may raise an issue of fact as to bad faith if the applicant answered a similar question differently.see justofin,supra.however,if a question in an application inquires about a specific health disorder,and the record reveals that the applicant answer was incontrovertibly false,the applicant should not be permitted to rely upon the fact that she provided information about a wholly unrelated ailment in response to another question in order to create a genuine issue of material fact as to bad faith.as examined in section below,this is a principal failure of babayan approach.second and related to the first concern,babayan approach would relieve the insurance applicant from ever having to answer insurance applications completely and truthfully.rather,the applicant could create a smokescreen by providing some evidence of unrelated disorders in response to a specific question and then argue,if the insurer attempted to rescind the policy,that the information provided was not false,but incomplete.we decline to adopt a broad standard that would encourage insurance applicants to be less than forthcoming in their applications.finally,babayan standard contains too expansive a concept of completeness.it is imprudent to adopt a rule that signing a waiver for the insurance company to retrieve medical information absolves the applicant of the obligation to provide truthful information 
in summary,we do not find that justofin upset the framework applied by courts considering pennsylvania law in this context over the past sixty years.thus,we will consider babayan appeal under the existing framework and will not adopt a approach that would engender more confusion than clarification.
applying the framework to the specific false answers babayan gave to northwestern,we agree with babayan that her answer to question.did not constitute bad faith as a matter of law.question.stated 
in the past years,has the insured been in a motor vehicle accident,has the insured been charged with a moving violation of any motor vehicle law,or has the insured driver license been restricted,suspended,or revoked 
babayan answered no to question.babayan subsequently acknowledged in her deposition testimony that her answer to question.was false.
the issue,however,is whether a fact finder could draw a reasonable inference from the record that babayan knew at the time she answered question.that her answer was false,was made in bad faith.a review of the record demonstrates that there is a genuine issue of material fact on this point.for example,babayan also testified in her deposition that she had the following exchange with gallina 
i recall i did talk about the slip and fall and the car accident.i remember i was embarrassed that i had two incidents within three months.i felt like i was a klutz or something.and i told him and he said to me,when was it i said i ca remember right now.i think it was.he said,that far enough away.i do think it will be a problem,but when you sign the medical waiver,they go get your records from your doctors and they find out that stuff.
from this evidence,it would not be unreasonable for a fact finder to infer that babayan was not sure of the date of her accident.taking babayan testimony as true,an inference can be drawn that babayan relied upon gallina representation that the accident was far enough away that it did not have to be listed in the application.a fact finder could ultimately decide to reject babayan answer as implausible,but,based upon evidence in the record,it was inappropriate for the court to reach that conclusion at the summary judgment stage.
in contrast,the district court correctly determined that babayan false answer to question.k constituted bad faith as a matter of law.based upon the detailed nature of question.k,babayan response,and babayan deposition testimony,the only reasonable inference a fact finder could draw would be that the answer to question.k was made in bad faith or with knowledge of its falsity.
in support of her argument that she produced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her answers were made in bad faith,babayan points out that she disclosed the name of her family doctor that she had once been hospitalized overnight that she suffered from bell palsy within the past year and that she was treated for pain relief as a result of a virus.the problem with babayan argument is that the information she provided can not be reconciled with the actual false representation she made in filling out her application.the information she points to as sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact is irrelevant to the specific question at issue.
question set forth in the footnote below,contains fifteen detailed and distinct categories of queries regarding the applicant medical treatment over the past ten years in this context,it is clear that question.k requires a specific answer as to whether the applicant was diagnosed with or treated for any of the specific disorders that are listed arthritis,sciatica,gout,or any disorder of the muscles,bones,joints,spine,back,or neck.during a lengthy colloquy with northwestern counsel during her deposition babayan expressly admitted each of the following facts 
she sought treatment and care from five physicians regarding knee and back pain on numerous occasions during the relevant time period listed on the application 
she underwent at least five magnetic resonance imaging mri tests on her knees back,and she had an electromyogram emg because of chronic back problems 
she was aware that these diagnostic tests revealed abnormalities in her knees and back 
she was aware that she was diagnosed with a bulging disc in her back and 
she received a cortisone injection in her knee to reduce constant pain.
furthermore,the record contains a verified complaint babayan filed in state court following her accident in which she alleged that,as a result of her accident,she was caused to sustain serious personal injuries to her knee and hip and surrounding areas.see whiting krassner,cir judicial estoppel prevents parties from taking different positions on matters in litigation to gain advantage.in spite of these concessions,babayan answered no to question.k.she testified in her deposition that the question was unclear but that with her new understanding she agreed that her previous answers were inaccurate.in addition,although babayan conceded that she did not read her responses on the final application,she admitted that she certified her answers were truthful and accurate.
the fact that babayan was hospitalized for one night for blood tests,received a prescription for pain relief as a result of a virus in january,and missed six days of work with bell palsy within the six months prior to her application is irrelevant to the question of whether she was diagnosed with or treated for arthritis,sciatica,gout,or any disorder of the muscles,bones,joints,spine,back,or neck.neither is it relevant that gallina may have told babayan not to list the automobile accident on the application because it occurred far enough in the past information regarding the accident is not incomplete as to the issue of whether babayan was treated for or diagnosed with any of the specific disorders listed in question.rather,like the answer at issue in burkert,babayan answer can be characterized as frivolous in the face of substantial evidence that she visited five different physicians on a number of occasions relating to problems with her knees and back,and that diagnostic tests confirmed that she had knee and back problems.on this information,the only reasonable inference a fact finder could draw is that babayan answered no in bad faith or knowing that her answer was false.
babayan concept of incompleteness seems to be that if an applicant provides evidence of a certain medical problem,the applicant does not have to provide any other information in answering a question regarding a totally different type of medical problem in order to survive a motion for summary judgment.that argument is a non sequitur.for example,suppose babayan,who checked no to a question asking whether she had high blood pressure,took a daily prescription to control her high blood pressure.would the fact that she disclosed that she had bell palsy for six days over the past year be sufficient to support an inference that her answer to the blood pressure question was merely incomplete rather than knowingly false sound public policy counsels against embracing babayan concept of incompleteness.see orr union fidelity life ins,holding that an answer describing only one of numerous injuries to a question asking applicant to list any injuries was not a truthful answer to a question on an insurance application.in the face of incontrovertible documentary evidence that she was treated on numerous occasions for back and knee pain during the relevant time period,babayan can not defeat northwestern motion for summary judgment by pointing to her disclosure of unrelated ailments.in this respect,the district court did not err in finding that babayan answer to question.k was made in bad faith as a matter of law and in entering summary judgment in favor of northwestern on counts one and two of northwestern complaint.
babayan breach of contract claim 
because the district court correctly concluded that the disability insurance contract was void ab initio,the district court did not err in granting northwestern motion for summary judgment as to babayan breach of contract claim.it is axiomatic that a breach of contract claim may not be maintained in the absence of a valid contract.see reformed church of ascension theodore hooven sons,holding that a claim for breach of contract requires the existence of a contract,including its essential terms.thus,the district court properly dismissed count four of babayan complaint.
babayan bad faith claim against northwestern is premised primarily on the argument that northwestern underwriting practices constituted bad faith.we conclude that the district court correctly determined that northwestern was entitled to summary judgment on babayan bad faith claim.
the pennsylvania statute governing bad faith insurance actions provides 
in an action arising under an insurance policy,if the court finds that the insurer has acted in bad faith toward the insured,the court may take all of the following actions 
award interest on the amount of the claim from the date the claim was made by the insured in an amount equal to the prime rate of interest plus.
award punitive damages against the insurer.
assess court costs and attorney fees against the insurer.
babayan bad faith claim 
ann.the statute does not define the term bad faith.we have predicted that the pennsylvania supreme court would define the term according to the definition set forth by the pennsylvania superior court in terletsky prudential property and casualty ins.see keefe prudential property and cas.ins,cir.there,the court adopted the following definition of bad faith 
bad faith on part of insurer is any frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay proceeds of a policy it is not necessary that such refusal be fraudulent.for purposes of an action against an insurer for failure to pay a claim,such conduct imports a dishonest purpose and means a breach of a known duty,good faith and fair dealing,through some motive of or ill will mere negligence or bad judgment is not bad faith.
terletsky,at quoting black law dictionary ed citations omitted.
ultimately,in order to recover on a bad faith claim,the insured must prove that the insurer did not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy and that the insurer knew of or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.keefe,at.courts have extended the concept of bad faith beyond an insured denial of a claim in several limited areas.see realty,northern ins,cir insurer failure to follow internal guidelines evidence of bad faith bonenberger nationwide mut.ins,insurer claims practice manual is relevant evidence in bad faith claim against insurer ex rel.mitro allstate,bad faith may extend to the misconduct of an insured during the pendency of litigation liberty mut.ins.marty.bad faith may extend to an insurer conduct in retrospectively rating and collecting premiums.the insured is required to meet its burden of proving bad faith by clear and convincing evidence.terletsky,at.although the insurer conduct need not be fraudulent,mere negligence or bad judgment is not bad faith.brown progressive ins,the insured must ultimately show that the insurer breached its duty of good faith through some motive of or ill will.id.at the summary judgment stage,the insured burden in opposing a summary judgment motion brought by the insurer is commensurately high because the court must view the evidence presented in light of the substantive evidentiary burden at trial.kosierowski allstate ins,d,citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
babayan argues that we should predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would conclude that underwriting may constitute bad faith.babayan concedes in her brief that there are no decisions interpreting pennsylvania law that have extended bad faith claims to underwriting practices.babayan,however,urges us to consider the law of bad faith generally.specifically,she directs us to consider a decision of the mississippi supreme court,lewis equity national life,so d,and a law review article condemning the practice.see thomas cady georgia lee gates,post claim underwriting,concluding that underwriting is per se evidence of bad faith 
we need not determine whether the pennsylvania supreme court would hold that the practice utilized by the insurer in lewis constitutes bad faith.we note that the concept of underwriting itself is nebulous,particularly because it is difficult to draw a distinction between eligibility investigation and underwriting.for example,pennsylvania law provides that it is not bad faith to conduct a thorough investigation into a questionable claim.see,at noting the existence of red flags that prompted the investigation.see also new york life ins.johnson,cir referencing period of contestability based upon material misrepresentations babayan concept of underwriting would usurp this general principal and prevent insurers from engaging in investigations,even in the face of incontrovertible evidence that an insured made a clear misrepresentation.
moreover,babayan bad faith claim would not succeed even under the more demanding mississippi test set forth in lewis.the evidence is clear that guss approved babayan policy after reviewing the application,nonmedical questionnaire,and the paramedical questionnaire.based upon babayan responses in the documents,including the medical information that she provided,guss did not seek to obtain babayan medical records.thus,northwestern utilized babayan responses as one method for screening out applicants who presented unacceptable risks.wesley.at
