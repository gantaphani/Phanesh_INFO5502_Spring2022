edward bogart bogart commenced this qui tam litigation on behalf of the united states,the district of columbia,and ten states with qui tam legislation appellees king pharmaceuticals and monarch pharmaceuticals collectively,king ultimately settled the claims of the jurisdictions with qui tam statutes,and bogart was paid counsel fees and expenses of approximately,plus relator fees in excess of million.king also entered into settlement agreements with the nearly states without qui tam legislation who were not parties to this case.contending that his efforts produced settlements totaling more than million for the tam states,bogart unsuccessfully argued in the district court that he was entitled to be paid up to of that amount as attorneys fees under a common fund theory of recovery.he has appealed the district court ruling.finding no merit in bogart contentions,we will affirm the district court.
on march,bogart commenced a qui tam action against king under the false claims act fca,he also asserted claims on behalf of ten states and the district of columbia that had statutes similar to the fca,seeking a relator share and attorneys fees under these statutes as well bogart,a former employee of king,alleged that king misrepresented pricing information it supplied to the federal and state governments as a condition of its participation in various medicaid programs.
bogart filed amended complaints on july,and june,to assert claims on behalf of appellee virginia and new mexico,respectively,which had recently enacted false claims statutes.in accordance with the fca,the original complaint and the amended complaints were filed under seal.
at the time bogart filed the second amended complaint,the united states permitted notification to the qui tam states of this litigation.bogart was also permitted to notify the national association of medicaid fraud control units namfcu,an association of state attorney general offices that coordinates interstate efforts to prosecute medicaid fraud claims 
after notice of this lawsuit,the namfcu formed a committee to negotiate a settlement with king on behalf of its members,many of whom did not have qui tam statutes and were not parties to this litigation.each state individually negotiated with king as well.bogart did not participate in these settlement discussions.
on september,in anticipation of impending settlements,bogart filed a third amended complaint,asserting a request for common fund relief with respect to amounts recovered by tam jurisdictions.in paragraph of the third amended complaint,bogart asserted 
while the states possessing qui tam statutes have a regulatory scheme for rewarding the relator for coming forward,those which have none will potentially receive a windfall with little or no investigation or commitment of time or resources to the recovery.the common fund doctrine preserves the right of the litigant or counsel to an award from the common fund generated.
bogart sought recovery of up to of the purported common fund,although he did not specify whether this percentage represented a relator share or counsel fees.
on october,the united states,the states,and king announced an aggregate settlement of.of this amount,was payable to the united states was payable to the qui tam states and was payable to the tam states.bogart did not participate in the negotiation of the settlements and was not a party to any of the settlement agreements.
king executed separate settlement agreements with the united states and each individual state.although the federal settlement agreement noted that king agreed to pay the states,the agreement explicitly stated that king obligation to pay the united states was independent of king settlement agreements with the individual states,and that king obligation to pay the state settlement amount shall arise only under the namfcu agreement and the state settlement agreements.
on october,one day before the announcement of the settlements,bogart moved for emergency injunctive relief to restrain king from making any payments pursuant to the settlement agreements.among other things,bogart alleged that he would be irreparably harmed if king paid the tam common fund because the district court would no longer have jurisdiction to provide from the settlement amounts what bogart contends are his legal entitlements.
on october,the district court denied bogart motion for a temporary restraining order.the court deferred consideration of bogart preliminary injunction motion until after the completion of pertinent discovery.
on december,bogart filed his first amended petition for fees,claiming that he was entitled to of the aggregate settlement proceeds payable to the tam states under the common fund doctrine.though one might conclude that,given its title,the petition was for counsel fees,bogart once again failed to specify within the submission whether this percentage constituted a relator share or counsel fees.the amended petition,however,stated that king had agreed to pay all fees and expenses to which bogart was entitled under the fca provision,d 
the district court addressed bogart claim for relief under the common fund doctrine in connection with its decision on a motion to dismiss filed by new mexico,one of the two states bogart added to this case in amended complaints.united states ex rel.bogart king,d.new mexico argued that its false claims statute did not apply because king alleged fraudulent activity had ended before new mexico false claims statute went into effect on may.the district court agreed that the statute could not apply retroactively and dismissed the claim under the new mexico false claims act id.at.
bogart argued alternatively that he was entitled to a share of new mexico settlement under the common fund doctrine.in a opinion,the district court concluded that the common fund theory of recovery did not apply.id.at.the court noted that the common fund doctrine has never been applied in a qui tam action,but rather its application has been limited to a narrow range of situations involving trust law,class actions and insurance subrogation.id.moreover,the district court was not persuaded by bogart arguments that the common fund doctrine should apply in this instance.first,the district court concluded that a common fund did not exist because the united states,the qui tam states,and the tam states negotiated and executed separate and severable settlement agreements with king.id.second,the primary consideration of the common fund avoid inequity that results where one party bears the cost of litigation that benefits not implicated because new mexico and the tam states retained their own counsel to negotiate and execute the settlement agreements with king,and bogart fees and expenses had been paid by king.finally,the district court reasoned that bogart request for litigation costs under the common fund doctrine was simply a veiled attempt to obtain a reward for providing information about king to states that have declined to authorize payment of relator fees.id.in this regard,the court observed that granting bogart request would effectively impose qui tam statutes on sovereign state governments that have decided against such legislation.id.at.therefore,the district court denied bogart request for common fund relief as to new mexico,and later incorporated this opinion into an order denying bogart request as to the remaining tam states see app.
on march,the qui tam states,king,and bogart filed a joint stipulation of dismissal and order,acknowledging the dismissal of the qui tam states claims against king and the resolution of all of bogart claims,with the exception only of his claim to a share from virginia and the tam states under the common fund relief as asserted in paragraph of the plaintiff third amended complaint.app.king thereafter satisfied its obligations to the states under the state settlement agreements and the namfcu agreement.on march,the district court entered a final judgment,dismissing a ll claims and counts,including but not limited to,common fund allegations against all states without qui tam statutes.id.at.this timely appeal followed.

under the american rule,litigants generally must bear their own attorneys fees.id.at.the common fund doctrine is an exception to this rule.it provides that a private plaintiff,or plaintiff attorney,whose efforts create,discover,increase,or preserve a fund to which others also have a claim,is entitled to recover from the fund the costs of his litigation,including attorneys fees.in re cendant.sec,cir quoting in re motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.
the supreme court first recognized the common fund doctrine in internal improvement fund trs.greenough,a case involving a bondholder successful lawsuit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated bondholders.the court held that the plaintiff,who incurred the entire expense of the litigation,was entitled to an award of fees from the common fund because it would be inequitable to allow the other bondholders to share in the recovery without contribut ing their due proportion of the expenses.id.at.we have also recognized the common fund doctrine.see,cendant,at motors,at.
the common fund doctrine is equitable in nature,intended to avoid unjust enrichment at the expense of the successful litigant.boeing van gemert,d.the doctrine operates to charge an award against the fund itself,rather than to impose personal liability against a party or beneficiary.see in re smithkline beckman.sec,in re dn.
in boeing,the supreme court explained that j urisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent inequity by assessing attorney fees against the entire fund,thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefited by the suit.at.emphasis added.application of the common fund doctrine thus requires court control over a fund or jurisdiction over the parties vincent hughes air west,cir.
asserting that this is a classic common fund case,bogart contends that the district court had control over the tam states settlement proceeds based upon its responsibility to approve king settlement with the united states.see c b.bogart claims that the district court power to approve the federal settlement agreement gave it control over the tam states settlement agreements because the federal settlement agreement referred to the aggregate settlement amount and the portion thereof allocated to the states,and the states could not receive payment before the united states was paid.
neither fact,however,shows that the tam states settlements were under the district court control or subject to its approval.to the contrary,the federal settlement agreement expressly stated that king obligation to pay the state settlement amount of,or any individual state share thereof,shall arise only under the namfcu agreement and the state settlement agreements.app.emphasis added.there is nothing in the settlement agreements executed by the tam states that would indicate they were subject to district court approval or control.the district court thus lacked control over the purported common fund.
nor did the district court have jurisdiction over the tam states.indeed,bogart does not argue to the contrary.bogart does contend,however,that the district court jurisdiction over king allowed it to award common fund relief,even though the tam states were not participants in this litigation,because king was the party responsible for making payments to the tam states.bogart,however,has not cited any authority that holds that jurisdiction over the defendant,alone,is sufficient to confer authority to grant common fund relief.consequently,because the district court did not have jurisdiction over the fund or the tam states,it lacked the authority to award common fund relief from the tam states settlement proceeds.
even if the district court had such authority,an award to bogart would be inappropriate.first,we agree with the district court that bogart litigation did not create a common fund.in the classic common fund case,like a class action,the litigation generates a pool of money,either through a judgment or settlement,to which the beneficiaries are entitled to claim a portion.see,boeing,at.greenough,at wininger si mgmt,cir.in this matter,there was no pool of money generated to which the tam states had a claim.instead,each tam state separately negotiated a settlement agreement with king.while bogart argues that the paid to the tam states constitutes the common fund,this figure only represents the sum of the separately negotiated and independent settlements between king and the tam states.as the district court observed,t he mere fact that a large number of parties has reached such settlements does not mean that the sum of the settlement amounts somehow constitutes a common fund in the manner of a class action award.bogart,d at.united states ex rel.merena smithkline beecham,d,calculating relator share under d based upon the amount received by the united states exclusive of the amounts received by the states pursuant to separate settlement agreements,rev on other grounds,cir.
bogart contends that the district court took an impermissibly narrow view of what constitutes a common fund.appellant br.none of the cases cited by bogart,however,involves circumstances similar to those presented here.for instance,in re prudential ins.am.sales practice litig.agent actions,cir,involved a class action settlement in which the defendant agreed to pay a set amount in counsel fees in addition to a base amount of million to resolve claims through a streamlined alternative dispute resolution process.at issue in prudential was the valuation of claims to be pursued through the adr process plus the valuation of other aspects of the settlement.significantly,the attorneys fees were not payable from the funds to be paid or monetary benefits provided to class members.the purpose of assessing the value of the settlement was to determine the reasonableness of the million fee prudential had agreed to pay.moreover,we questioned the propriety of including in the valuation those claims that would be pursued under a plan that had been put into place separate and apart from the settlement,observing 
while a party need not be the only catalyst in order to be considered a material factor and may be credited for benefits created,there must still be a sound basis that the party was more than an initial impetus behind the creation of the benefit.allowing private counsel to receive fees based on the benefits created by public agencies would undermine the equitable principles which underlie the concept of the common fund 
by way of contrast to the context in which prudential was decided,this case is not a class action,does not involve an assessment of the reasonableness of a fee the defendant has agreed to pay in addition to the amount to be recovered by claimants,and does not involve a settlement negotiated by the attorneys seeking recovery of a fee under common fund principles.instead,this case presents an attempt by bogart counsel to recover substantial fees from settlements negotiated independently by tam states who,with the exception of virginia,are not parties to this litigation.although bogart may have been the impetus for the creation of the benefits to the tam states,he has shown nothing more that would make recognition of a common fund appropriate here.
in puerto rico heckler,another case cited by bogart,the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit approved a fee award under the common fund doctrine where the judgment expressly provided for the recovery by beneficiaries.in other cases cited by bogart,the efforts of counsel had created binding precedent entitling the beneficiaries to recover under principles of stare decisis.see sprague ticonic nat.bank.city of klawock gustafson,cir administrative policy change attributable to litigation efforts may support common fund relief.
