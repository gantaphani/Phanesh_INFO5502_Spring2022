this appeal results from a jury verdict rendered in favor of allstate insurance company,allstate indemnity company,allstate property casualty insurance company collectively,allstate boston old colony insurance company,and the glens falls insurance company collectively,encompass.the jury awarded allstate and encompass in damages for fraud committed by accident injury pain centers.other defendants were determined to be jointly and severally liable for these amounts as in the fraud.exemplary damages adjudged severally against each of the defendants totaled.the district court entered an amended final judgment on the jury verdict that totaled.this amount included reduced prejudgment interest awards of to allstate and to encompass,amounts for which all defendants were adjudged jointly and severally liable.the district court also denied the defendants and motions for judgment as a matter of law.
because we find the evidence insufficient to support either the jury verdict on fraud or the damages award,we reverse and render judgment for the.
facts and proceedings below 
at issue in this case are over claim files held by insurers allstate and encompass most of which represent third party against an allstate or encompass liability insured brought by a person allegedly injured in an automobile accident.in relation to most of the claim files at issue,allstate or encompass paid money in settlements on behalf of,or in respect to judgments against,one of their insureds.the instant case covers claims made from january onwards and brought by claimants who had been treated by and its affiliates.
is a group of chiropractic clinics that specialize in treating patients who have suffered trauma in automobile accidents or through injuries.robert smith smith,a layperson,owns,which at its largest consisted of twenty clinics.the other in this least some of which were also established by in some way associated with and include chiropractors,employees,physicians,and diagnostic entities.they are metroplex pain center,lone star radiology white rock open air mri,white rock open air mri north texas open air mri,north texas open air mri,harris county mri,bexar county mri rehab,receivable finance company,rfc thomas rhudy,louis saucedo,kenneth lustik,mark rayshell,larry parent,christopher holowiski,carey fabacher,patricia johnson,kyle campbell,ramesh sanghani,robert smith steven smith tina cheshire lone star radiology management,lacidem management james laughlin,marlon padilla,marlon padilla,and dee martinez,
and its affiliates often treat patients who do not have health insurance,and consequently they frequently rely on letters of protection given to them by an uninsured patient personal injury attorney,who,almost always,has referred the patient to them.these letters assure and its affiliates treating the patient that if the patient attorney achieves a recovery on the patient personal injury claim,recovered funds will be used to pay for the patient incurred medical expenses.
when and its affiliates treat a patient for whom they have received a personal injury attorney letter of protection,corporate office drafts a final narrative report for the patient,based on a template the chiropractor fills out.according to,the chiropractor is able to review,edit,and electronically sign the report before it is issued.also according to,then sends the patient medical file,including the final narrative,to the patient attorney,who in turn usually forwards the file to the insurance carrier of the person against whom the patient is making a claim.if the as allstate or or otherwise resolves a claim on behalf of its insured,the insurer pays the funds in a lump sum jointly to the attorney and insurers,including allstate and encompass,generally do not pay or its affiliates directly.
the fraud claims in this case do not relate to staged or nonexistent accidents or to claimants who had not been patients at or the other defendants or the like,but rather relate to reports of and patient billings for allegedly grossly and knowingly unnecessary and excessive chiropractic medical diagnoses,treatments,procedures,services,consultations and the like,including xrays and mris and similar items.
leading up to allstate institution of this action,and sometime between march and may,allstate special investigative unit siu analyst bruce vest vest placed on provider on hold status throughout texas and designated this status retroactive for treatment provided by from october,onwards.as a result of status,whenever an allstate adjuster entered a bill associated with tax identification number,allstate computer system would instruct the adjuster to contact allstate siu.adjusters,however,whose job was described at trial as to investigate,evaluate,and settle a claim,could nevertheless authorize payment to.
on november,over a year after allstate labeled a provider on hold,allstate brought this suit against rfc,marlon padilla,padilla,and advanced medical systems and solutions,pllc advanced medical in its original complaint,allstate sought declaratory relief,requesting the district court to declare that rfc was engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine and the unauthorized employment of medical and osteopathic physicians that any contracts between rfc and such physicians were illegal and void as a matter of law and public policy that allstate need not pay any amount billed by or through rfc regarding any medical services fee and that all medical services previously billed through rfc were billed in violation of the texas medical practices act.rfc,advanced medical,and padilla responded by asserting that allstate lacked standing to bring the declaratory relief suit,but the district court denied their rule b motion to dismiss in february.the initial three defendants subsequently filed answers in march.
in november,allstate and encompass together filed an amended motion to amend complaint for declaratory relief in january,the district court granted the motion,and allstate and encompass filed their first amended complaint the same day.
in their first amended complaint,allstate and encompass named as defendants the appellants now before this court the amended complaint also added several requests for relief to those requests included in allstate original complaint.allstate and encompass added damages claims for common law fraud and conspiracy for relief for unjust enrichment for prejudgment and postjudgment interest and for punitive damages.further,the plaintiffs asked the district court to declare that various defendants constituted a joint business enterprise rfc,and smith were engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine and the unauthorized employment of medical and osteopathic physicians any contracts or agreements between rfc,and smith and such physicians were illegal and void as a matter of law and public policy allstate and encompass need not pay any amount billed by or through rfc in regards to any fee for medical services allstate and encompass were entitled to reimbursement for all medical services previously billed through rfc in violation of the texas medical practices act all medical services billed by or on behalf of,metroplex pain,lone star radiology,north texas open air mri,white rock open air mri,or rehab,as well as by any medical or osteopathic doctor for services billed through rfc,were void due to those entities and persons violations of the texas occupations code,and due to the fraudulent nature of the bills and allstate and encompass need not pay,and were entitled to reimbursement for previous payments on,any amount billed by or through,rfc,metroplex pain,lone star radiology,north texas open air mri,white rock open air mri,or rehab,as well as by any medical or osteopathic doctor for services billed through rfc.
in june,the district court issued an order denying the plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.
the district court allocated three weeks for trial,which began in september.each side had and hours of presentation before the jury.at the close of the insurance companies,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on damages on any measure other than disgorgement.after all the parties rested,the district court stated that it would limit the direct fraud issue to.also at that time,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants on all of allstate and encompass declaratory relief requests and on all of their statutory and regulatory claims.the court also then granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on allstate and encompass unjust enrichment claim.
consequently,the district court submitted to the jury questions on fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud,single business enterprise,and waiver.the jury returned a verdict finding that committed fraud against allstate and encompass,that the remaining defendants conspired to commit fraud,that certain defendants operated as a single business enterprise,and that allstate and encompass had not waived their claims.it awarded allstate and encompass a total of in damages and in exemplary damages.defendants subsequently filed renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law,for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,for new trial,and to modify the judgment 
in february,the district court entered an amended final judgment totaling and an order denying most of the motions,but granting motions to modify the judgment by reducing the prejudgment interest awarded the court amended final judgment reflected the prejudgment interest reduction and decreed that appellee allstate recover from for fraud against allstate appellee encompass recover from for fraud against encompass and that all are jointly and severally liable with as in the fraud.allstate and encompass were further awarded exemplary damages prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest.court costs were taxed against the defendants.
and the other have timely appealed.

discussion 
the district court jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship under.we have jurisdiction of this appeal under.the governing substantive law is that of texas.
we limit our discussion to two issues raised by on appeal texas common law fraud reliance element and the damages award specifically,argues that the record does not support the jury finding that allstate and encompass actually relied on any representation further,asserts that the damages award should not be affirmed because it was based on an improper damages of because it was not limited to revenue that obtained by fraud.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
texas common law fraud reliance element 
in texas,the elements of common law fraud are 
that a material representation was made the representation was false when the representation was made,the speaker knew it was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion the speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act upon it the party acted in reliance on the representation and the party thereby suffered injury.in re firstmerit bank.
before we can sustain the jury verdict in this case,we must determine whether the record reflects sufficient evidence supporting each of the above elements of texas common law fraud.see sw.ref.bernal,the plaintiff must prove,and the defendant must be given the opportunity to contest,every element of a tort claim.the record must reflect that allstate and encompass pleaded and proved that the insurers actually relied on an misrepresentation.see ernst young,pac.mut.life ins,to prevail on fraud claim,the plaintiff must prove that it actually and justifiably relied upon the representation see also rowntree rice,antonio,writ ref p laintiff in a fraud suit must plead and prove on the merits that he was ignorant of the falsity of defendant representations and in fact relied on same.a lack of sufficient evidence showing reliance will necessarily be fatal to the fraud claim see,johnson johnson,sanchez,rendering judgment on fraud claim where plaintiff did not present any evidence that she relied on any representation made.absent such evidence,it is not the defendant burden to disprove reliance.
after oral argument,this court requested the parties to submit additional briefing related to the sufficiency of evidence of actual reliance and the damages calculation.after reviewing these briefs as well as those originally submitted by the parties,and after conducting our own,independent examination of the record,we conclude that the evidence does not suffice to show that any allstate or encompass adjuster,or other agent or employee making,directing or approving any payment made on any of the claims in question,actually relied on an misrepresentation.the evidence does not support the jury verdict on direct fraud.
there is no evidence that allstate or encompass made any payment to or received any request for payment or receipt or release from or any of the other defendants,or that any payment by allstate or encompass in respect to any of the claims involved was other than one lump sum amount to the and his or her attorney without any breakdown or designation other than as covering any and all claimant claims respecting the accident and without any specific mention of or allocation of amounts to medical expenses nor is there any evidence of any such allocation or breakdown being reflected on allstate or encompass records or the like.
it is shown that with respect to all the some claims at issue,allstate paid the claimants a total of and encompass paid the claimants a total of,that out of all these payments not less than was eventually paid by the claimants or their respective attorneys to defendants,and that almost of the files had medical records which included some excessive or improper charges by defendants.however,there is no showing that any of the files contained medical records from defendants in which all or any particular fraction of the charges shown were improper.there is no showing on an individual claim basis either of the total amount of the claim,or of the total amount paid thereon by allstate or encompass,or of the particular amount of any property damage,lost earnings or earning capacity,pain and suffering or bodily impairment,or medical expense for service rendered by defendants or by others,being claimed or reflected in the file.nor is there any such showing for the some claims as a whole except that the total medical expenses claimed included at least which eventually went to defendants,and the total claims were at least some to allstate and to encompass.except for the fact of payment,there is no evidence as to allstate or encompass liability evaluation,was the insured at fault was the claimant at fault how clear or disputed were these matters on any specific claim or group of claims.there is no showing of how many of these claims were disposed of by judgment,or after trial,or by settlement after suit and before trial,or by settlement before suit.
some evidence was introduced,but this evidence skirted the central issue of whether any allstate or encompass adjuster or other such agent paid money to resolve a claim of a patient treated by the because the adjuster in fact believed and relied on representations as reflected in the medical file furnished the attorney for the claimant and by that attorney to allstate or encompass.for example,plaintiffs introduced evidence that it would be reasonable for an insurer to rely upon bills and documents received from a plaintiff attorney on examination of louis saucedo,a chiropractor and a in this case,allstate attorney asked,sir,do you believe it would be reasonable for the insurance carriers such as allstate to rely upon bills and documentations that they receive from the plaintiff attorney so long as a complete package was forwarded that they received from your company saucedo answered,if they review the records and not just the billing statements,yes,it would be reasonable.whether reliance by allstate or encompass would have been reasonable,however,is a distinct inquiry from whether reliance existed at all 
other evidence was sparse and unspecific.another allstate employee and siu analyst,joe rocha rocha,who testified at trial as encompass corporate representative,was asked whether there was any indication in the files at issue that claim representatives were relying upon the billings and medicals being submitted rocha responded,yes,there was.yet rocha did not personally adjust or otherwise take any action concerning settlement or disposition of any of the files involved in this suit.a third allstate employee,assistant vice president edward joseph moran moran testified,o bviously if we paid the claims,we relied on the representations of the defendants.when pressed on his rationale,moran replied simply,we paid the claim.finally,moran elaborated,stating i know that if we paid claims,you know,because we either could prove the fraud or because of the way texas law is,you know,in terms of,you know,having to pay claims timely,you know,i believe that we would still be able to recoup that if we proved that the claims were fraudulent.
finally,while allstate siu analyst vest testified that allstate employees rely on the diagnosis codes submitted by,and stated,we certainly rely on getting accurate information from whatever the source is,be it the doctors or the chiropractors,the clinics,his comments related only to the information allstate inputs into its medical billing review system mbrs,a computer tool.
allstate and encompass did not call to testify any adjuster or other similar employee or agent who actually adjusted or paid or was in any way actually involved in the handling or paying of any claim in the claim files at issue.indeed,rather than making a serious attempt to prove actual reliance,allstate and encompass emphasized the fact that the insurance companies had no practical or feasible alternative to paying on the claim files.allstate counsel,in his opening statement,described the insurance companies predicament 
f rankly,you could,you could actually see the development of this pattern.i mean,nobody knows over a period of time,but after months,then years,and you start to see and say,i seeing the same thing over and over again,i seeing the same referrals,i seeing the same pattern of treatment,that allstate adjusters that see this much,yeah,they were suspicious yeah,they were saying things to the attorneys which oftentimes resulted in threats back against them from accident injury for business disparagement.
but the problem is and where they perpetuate this fraud is it really does matter what you,the allstate adjuster,thinks.and i put this as a person behind glass banging on the wall because if these claims are not resolved,these liability claims in which an allstate insured has caused an accident unfortunately,probably fault,did mean it,but they are going to have a claim pursued against them,and ultimately if the claim does settle,be filed into lawsuit by these attorneys 
and,as i say,the allstate person in the background banging on the glass,but you got to see the whole picture,what the allstate people are relying upon and we know they are going to do is,regardless of what happens,they are going to carry this fraud over into the state courthouse and they are going to give untruthful testimony.and they do rely upon that.and the insureds going to have to come down and sit through trial as a defendant the insurance is going to lose that income and be through that inconvenience litigation costs are going to be associated with that and,most importantly,which is allstate obligation to protect its insured,could be subjected to an excess judgment.
in their closing argument as well,the insurance companies emphasized their lack of alternatives to paying on claims 
in regard to i think whether they were relied upon and acted upon,obviously if there is an alternative on these,these claims would not be paid.they make an issue,it seems like,well,you just do pay these claims.this is a situation where there are many parties involved and many responsibilities.
first of all,until vest really started to develop this information by mid and then continuing forward,there was no knowledge and there was large payments,as vest said,you know,reliance of that package.the driver on these personal injury claims is that amount of medical specials that can be generated,that were being generated through these packages.
actually,with the encompass entities,it was even known until rocha really got involved talked to vest in.
but even after that no question about the reliance 
first,they have no argument that there was no reliance before the investigation was conducted in 
what we relied upon once we learned,is you do know the whole picture,you just seeing this much,you think this person needed this treatment and these mris you know,or,you do see it all because this evidence ca come in,and they come down misrepresent that.
moreover,on appeal,insurers allstate and encompass continue to focus on their lack of an alternative to paying to resolve the claim files at issue.in the subsection of their main brief discussing actual reliance,allstate and encompass fail to provide any citation to the record that would support its assertion that allstate relied on the representations as to the amount claimed,and which would be asserted in litigation rather,the only related proposition for which the insurers provided record citations is its assertion that a ppellants had no practical alternative to relying on the chiropractic claims in the short run.for this proposition,the insurance companies cite to the testimony of siu analyst vest,who made clear that allstate primary obligation is to its insureds.vest elaborated 
t he problem for our insureds is that in texas,many of our policy owners only have over coverage.if they are we presented with meds to the tune of,then the demand from the plaintiff attorney is going to quite often far exceed the amount of coverage within the policy.then the adjusters in the claims department is forced with a dilemma.either fight it and risk going to trial and then risk exposing our insurer to an excess verdict,that means excess over their policy limits,in which they would personally be liable for it.
so we always conscious of that.our first responsibility is protect our policyholder.
allstate also cites the portion of vest testimony where he stated,we settle these cases because we see that it in our best interests of our insureds to do so.similarly,vest testified,we settling these cases because it in the best interests of our insureds and that all parties apparently are agreeing to it because the attorney is agreeing to it.finally,the insurers cite to rocha testimony that there was some indication that claim representatives were relying on submitted billings,but as discussed above,rocha himself never participated in the adjustment of any of the claims in the files at issue.
further,other testimony at trial tended to negate the idea that allstate or encompass adjusters relied on representations.siu analyst vest,who became allstate siu analyst for northern texas where the vast majority of the underlying claims arose and the defendants challenged conduct occurred in january,testified that upon taking charge of the northern texas area,he visited with some folks in a meeting and the question was raised,what are causing us the most problems and concerns.vest stated that the first time he heard mentioned was at that meeting,and that,in relation to,initially,it was brought to my attention that we were seeing a lot in the way of excessive treatment,pattern of treatment modalities,extensive billing,and heavy use of diagnostics,and just a repeated use of same modalities.further,vest testified that allstate designation of as a provider on hold meant that 
t he bills as they came in that were associated with a tax identification numbers for a particular provider would be flagged when the bills were input into our computer system.and and flagged means that it would draw attention to the adjuster or processor who was inputting the bills,and then they would be given directions as to what to do regarding whatever flag it was that they were seeing.
in the case of provider on hold,their instructions were to contact the special investigative unit or contact me.
vest stated that he put on status in and around may of,but that he made the status retroactive to october,in order to capture claims as they came into the allstate system that would go back to that date.vest stated that he wanted to get claims to begin coming into siu so that we could begin our investigation and see what was going on.vest described the designation significance for the claims adjuster 
the significance to the claims adjuster out in the field,not in siu,was that siu was looking at this particular provider and it would simply flag,be a red flag or a flag for the adjuster who is handling the claim at the time they are inputting bills to either look at the narrative contact siu or they could take it upon themselves and simply override code issue payment.
alternatively,vest noted that the claims adjuster could notify siu and then override the code and continue the adjusting process.this testimony suggests that allstate was at least suspicious of billings,and may even imply that allstate in fact did not rely on any representation.
in order to succeed on their texas common law fraud claim,allstate and encompass needed to present legally sufficient evidence of actual reliance.see,brittan commc ns int l sw.bell,cir.dep t of ins.chase bank of,cir under texas law,reliance is an element of fraud or misrepresentation.roberts united bank at roswell,cir.but the insurance companies failed to do so.for example,they could have,but did not,introduce the testimony of adjusters or other similar agent or employee who in fact worked on some significant number of the claim files at issue,to say that they relied on the medical claims submitted in deciding to settle a claim 
we are sympathetic with the position that allstate and encompass frequently emphasized throughout trial.we are also deeply shocked and saddened at the dishonest practices of many of the defendants as reflected by the evidence,as well,apparently,as of the lawyers with whom they worked.but it remains this court responsibility to require those plaintiffs bringing a texas common law fraud claim under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction to prove the elements of common law fraud as the state of texas has determined them.it is not within our discretion to create a new texas cause of some blend of extortion and fraud.it is up to the texas courts,or legislature,to address that.see cimino raymark,cir we have long followed the principle that we will not create innovative theories of recovery or defense under local law,but will rather merely apply it as it currently exists.quoting johnson sawyer,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.
on the evidence that was introduced at trial,a reasonable jury could not have found that allstate actually relied on any misrepresentation by.as such,the district court should not have submitted the texas common law fraud claim to the jury.see love king,cir a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury.
even if we were to accept allstate and encompass contention that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict on fraud,we would still be unable to affirm the district court judgment.the evidence does not support the damages award.
we begin our analysis of the damages award by noting that challenge against the award is first,asserts that the measure of damages inappropriate for a texas common law fraud action and,second,that the damages award was not properly limited to what obtained as a result of was based on evidence impermissibly mixing medically necessary and unnecessary services,and improperly included amounts paid pursuant to judgments as well as amounts paid to entities other than that were not alter egos.we agree that it is questionable whether disgorgement is an appropriate measure of damages in an action alleging texas common law fraud see formosa plastics.usa presidio eng rs contractors,texas recognizes two measures of direct damages for fraud the measure and the measure.the measure computes the difference between the value paid and the value received,while the measure computes the difference between the value as represented and the value received.internal citations omitted.but see robertson adj,pet.struck noting that disgorgement of profits has long been recognized as an appropriate remedy for fraud and for breach of fiduciary duty,but then stating that t he measure of damages for fraud may either consist of the difference between the value paid and the value received or the difference between the value parted with and the value received.we assume,however,arguendo only,that the disgorgement damages measure was proper,and we find that,because there was no evidence introduced regarding what the obtained through fraud as opposed to their legitimate provision of health care,the amount of the award could only be based on mere conjecture or speculation.thus,it can not be sustained.
question number four submitted to the jury called for it to answer in dollars and cents for damages,if any,for disgorgement of revenue obtained by by fraud.the jury answered by awarding allstate and encompass in damages for fraud committed by,for a total of.
disgorgement wrests gains from the hands of a wrongdoer.it is an equitable remedy meant to prevent the wrongdoer from enriching himself by his wrongs.sec huffman,cir.because disgorgement is meant to be remedial and not punitive,it is limited to property causally related to the wrongdoing at issue.sec first city fin.accordingly,the party seeking disgorgement must distinguish between that which has been legally and illegally obtained.id.in actions brought by the sec involving a securities violation,disgorgement need only be a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the violation.id.however,in a private action,the party seeking monetary compensation may have a greater burden to prove its claim to the amount requested.id.at.still,in the instant case we need not determine whether a more onerous burden of proof should be used since we find that allstate and encompass have not satisfied the lower threshold of providing a reasonable approximation of what the illegally obtained.
allstate and encompass state in their brief that,in the claim files at issue in this case,allstate paid and encompass paid in settlements.this information,alone,does not indicate what amount the defendants actually received from such settlements.as both brief and the brief of allstate and encompass acknowledge,plaintiff exhibit tabulated the revenue obtained by the various defendants in the claim files at issue,and this amount was at least.allstate and encompass point to the fact that the jury total damages award,was less than the amount defendants acknowledged they had received from the insurers for the contested claim files.however,the jury verdict still needed to be supported by evidence showing that defendants obtained this money by fraud there is no evidence demonstrating what portion of the revenue obtained was a result of improper billing.
allstate and encompass imply in their main brief on appeal that the evidence they presented
