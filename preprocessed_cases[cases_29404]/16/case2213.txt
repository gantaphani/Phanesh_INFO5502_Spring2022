plaintiff,wonderland shopping center venture limited partnership wonderland,appeals from the district court order denying plaintiff motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment,and granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,cdc mortgage capital,cdc depositor trust st i,lasalle national bank,and cdc depositor trust st i commercial mortgage pass through certificates series st i,on plaintiff claim for breach of contract under michigan law and defendants counterclaim requesting declaratory judgment of the parties rights and liabilities under a contract.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
on january,plaintiff and,macomb mall associates macomb mall,and columbus mall associates columbus mall,filed suit against defendants,cdc mortgage capital,cdc depositor trust st i,and cdc depositor trust st i commercial mortgage pass through certificates st i,for breach of three loan agreements pursuant to michigan law.in their answer filed on february,defendants asserted counterclaims requesting a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under a contractual provision common to all three loan agreements.on march,plaintiff and the filed an amended complaint,joining defendant lasalle national bank lasalle,and adding a request for an injunction of a mortgage foreclosure announced by defendants.
pursuant to the district court expedited scheduling order,on april,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with regard to the breach of contract claims.plaintiff opposed defendants motion,filing a for summary judgment and a motion for a preliminary injunction against a foreclosure sale on april.macomb mall and columbus mall subsequently settled their claims against defendants and,on april,the district court dismissed their claims.
the district court held a hearing on the summary judgment motions and plaintiff motion for preliminary injunction on may.two days later,on may,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiff motion for summary judgment and preliminary injunction.the district court accepted defendants construction of a key,disputed contract provision,and thus concluded a preliminary injunction was unnecessary because plaintiff could not show likelihood of success on the merits.even though the district court rejected plaintiff request for a preliminary injunction,the district court concluded that a security bond of million would have been appropriate pursuant to.c if a preliminary injunction had issued.
on may,the sheriff of wayne county,michigan conducted a mortgage foreclosure sale on the property subject to the loan agreement.defendant lasalle purchased the property.
plaintiff wonderland is a michigan limited partnership with its principal place of business in southfield,michigan.plaintiff owns and operates a shopping mall in livonia,michigan.on december,nomura asset capital corporation nacc loaned plaintiff pursuant to a loan agreement the agreement or the contract and promissory note the note.in early,nacc transferred the loan to its affiliate nomura depositor trust st i nomura depositor,which subsequently assigned this and other loans to a trust,nomura depositor trust st i commercial pass through certificates series st i the trust.defendant lasalle,a nationally chartered bank with its principal place of business in chicago,illinois,was the trustee for the trust.
on august,defendant cdc mortgage capital,cmci,a new york corporation with its principal place of business in new york city,acquired the loans from nacc,including all of nacc rights,obligations,and liabilities under the loan agreement between nacc and plaintiff.with this acquisition,the trust became known as cdc depositor trust st i commercial mortgage pass through certificates series st i.the trust is the holder of the loans,and cmci affiliate,defendant cdc depositor st i,is the directing holder of the trust with the right to take certain actions with regard to the loans in the trust.lasalle remained trustee for the trust.
the loan extended to plaintiff is called a reverse earn out loan,a type of loan secured on properties with currently unstable cash flows,expected to experience improvement in the future.in recognition of this expected improvement,the original loan amount was based on plaintiff anticipated net operating income noi.during the first three years of the loan,the loan agreement obligated plaintiff to make interest payments only but set performance goals for plaintiff.plaintiff stated goal,in the language of the loan agreement,was a stabilization noi that produces a debt service coverage ratio of greater than to.at.in other words,the loan agreement gave plaintiff three years to attain net operating income sufficient to cover of its debt.
if,after three years,plaintiff had not attained this goal,then the loan agreement provides a mechanism for resizing,or reducing,the loan amount to a level sufficient to allow plaintiff to cover of its debt.section b of the note and section of the agreement address matters pertaining to this resizing mechanism.section b of the note provides 
if the stabilization noi produces a debt service coverage ratio based upon the original principal amount and the debt service constant of less than to,payee shall have the option,in its sole and absolute discretion,to decrease the principal amount of the loan the resizing in order to achieve a minimum debt service coverage ratio of to,based upon such reduced principal balance the resized principal balance and the debt service constant,by requiring plaintiff to repay a portion of the loan without premium or penalty equal to the difference difference between i the original principal amount and ii the resized principal balance.the resized principal balance shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with section d below plaintiff shall repay the difference,together with all accrued and unpaid interest through the end of the interest calculation period in which the repayment is made,on the date the conversion date which is the eleventh day of the first calendar month following the calendar month in which payee notifies plaintiff of payee determination of the difference.plaintiff may only repay the difference from a the fee payable to plaintiff under section d,b cash from plaintiff which does not result in a lien on the loan proceeds or the mortgaged property,or c the proceeds of the mezzanine financing described in the loan agreement.
at footnote added.section of the agreement,headed mezzanine financing,provides 
if the stabilization noi produces a debt service coverage ratio of less than and and plaintiff does not i elect to repay the difference in cash pursuant to its rights under the note or ii prepay the loan in accordance with the provisions of section,borrower shall repay the senior mezzanine loan amount with the proceeds of senior mezzanine financing which shall be provided by lender on the following terms and conditions 
at footnote added.sections and proceed to describe mezzanine financing,a series of unsecured loans for the excess,unresized loan principal repayable only from available cash but convertible by defendants or a successor into equity interests in plaintiff.
in an affidavit submitted in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment,david schostak schostak,president of plaintiff general partner,discussed the negotiations leading to the loan agreement.schostak stated that nacc officials 
all told me that the loans would be pooled with other loans so that the rights to the principal and interest from all of these pooled loans could be sold to investors in a securities offering the loan resizing feature functioned as a workout provision,thus preventing a default or foreclosure of the loans and thereby facilitating the securities offering the lender was required to resize each loan if a borrower did not achieve the required noi so as to avoid a default that would impair the securities offering and the securities offering was enhanced by the resizing feature that reduced the amount of the secured loan to a level where the borrower would not be in default.
on september,nomura depositor released an offering circular as part of an effort to issue over billion in securities the offering circular.the offering circular identified and described the trust mortgage assets,including reverse earn out loans,and specifically discussed the loan to plaintiff.concerning this loan,the circular explained,the wonderland mall loan is a reverse earn out loan which will be resized to a debt service coverage ratio of based on a debt service constant.at.
on november,nacc successor,defendant cmci,wrote to schostak.the letter stated,based on our review of the most recent financial reports for each of the properties securing the loans,cdc anticipates that each borrower will be required to pay down a significant portion of its loan on the conversion date january.at.the letter then requested,i n connection with our determination of the loan amounts,certain information regarding the property subject to the loan agreement.at.the letter also provided a name and phone number for questions regarding the pending loan process.at.
plaintiff received a second letter from defendants on december.in this letter,defendants explained they were,pursuant to of the note,electing not to reduce the loan amount principal balance.the letter further explained 
this election produces a difference of zero and therefor the borrower will not be obligated to prepay any portion of the loan or to enter into the mezzanine loans contemplated in section of the loan agreement.the loan servicer will be notified of this determination and shall be instructed to begin amortizing the loan on the conversion date in accordance with the loan documents.
at.the same day,defendants notified macomb mall and columbus mall of their election to resize similar loans extended to macomb mall and columbus mall.
plaintiff,believing the loan agreement obligated defendants to resize,calculated the amount due if the loan agreement required resizing.plaintiff then sent payment to defendants loan servicer for the amount of principal and interest due for the resized amount as of january.defendants responded by notifying plaintiff it had failed to make full payment,an event it considered an event of default.defendants required plaintiff to cure the monetary default by making a principal and interest payment on the unresized loan by january.when plaintiff did not make a curative payment,defendants,on february,declared a cash trap event under the loan agreement requiring plaintiff bank to transfer to lasalle all rents received by plaintiff.on march,defendants attorney notified plaintiff that due to the event of default on january,defendant was accelerating the debt secured by the loan agreement and would foreclose on the mortgage.lasalle purchased the wonderland mall property at a may,mortgage foreclosure sale conducted by the sheriff of wayne county.
discussion 
breach of contract claima.the loan agreement 
the key area of dispute between the parties is whether the loan agreement imposed a mandatory or discretionary obligation on defendants to resize the loan amount.plaintiff argues the mezzanine financing provision of of the loan agreement controlled over other provisions of the contract and required defendants to resize.defendants disagree with plaintiff interpretation of the contract,arguing that the contract incorporated b of the note,and that b explicitly made resizing a matter for defendants discretion.the district court construed the contract as endowing defendants with the discretionary authority to resize the loan,and granted summary judgment in defendants favor on the breach of contract claim.this court reviews the district court order granting summary judgment de novo.white consol,westinghouse,cir.

in addition to these general rules of michigan contract construction,the loan agreement prescribes some construction rules of its own.pertinent to this appeal are the prescriptions contained in,entitled exhibits incorporated,and,entitled conflict construction of documents.section incorporates attached exhibits into the agreement,with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.at.several exhibits are attached to the loan agreement,including exhibit b,a sample mortgage promissory note documenting a loan of to plaintiff.exhibit b and the note executed by plaintiff on december,are identical.section describes the treatment of a conflict between the agreement and a separate document executed in connection with the loan.this section provides 
in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this agreement and any of the other loan documents,the provisions of this agreement shall control.the parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by counsel in connection with the negotiation and drafting of the loan documents and that such loan documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party which drafted same.
at.the note,mortgage,and agreement are among various materials identified as loan documents.
defendants argue that as an incorporated part of the agreement,the provisions of the note have the same effect as matters contained in the agreement.because b of the note gives defendants the option,in their sole and absolute discretion,to resize the loan,then the agreement permitted,but did not require,defendants to reduce the principal through resizing.defendants argue they elected not to resize and thus complied with their contractual obligations.plaintiff argues that as a provision of the loan agreement rather than a separate loan document,of the loan agreement is superior to any provision of the note and thus should govern in the case of a conflict.section does not frame mezzanine financing,one of the mechanisms for repaying the excess principal after resizing,in discretionary terms.instead,states if plaintiff has failed to reach its operating income and debt coverage goals,and plaintiff does not prepay the loan amount or repay the difference in cash,plaintiff shall repay according to mezzanine financing.for this reason,plaintiff argues b of the note,containing discretionary language,and of the agreement,containing no discretionary language,are in conflict.plaintiff contends that is a part of the loan agreement,and is thus superior to a conflicting part of any loan document,such as the note.
given its incorporation into the agreement via,the note is a part of the agreement and the court must attempt to harmonize its terms with others contained the contract.fresard,at.see also union inv.fid.deposit of,cir a contract will not be construed so as to reject any words as surplusage if they reasonably can be given meaning.citing vary shea,wl.plaintiff argues harmonizing the discretionary language of the note with of the agreement is not reasonably possible.according to plaintiff,if the contract made resizing a matter for defendants discretion,the provisions of the note would lead to the absurd and illogical result of obligating plaintiff to make monthly interest payments,but never to make payments of principal.the absurd result plaintiff predicts arises out of plaintiff interpretation of a key term in the note.
the note obligates plaintiff to make payments until the conversion date,and principal payments thereafter.plaintiff understands the note to define the conversion date as either the eleventh day of the month after defendants resize,or the eleventh day of the month after plaintiff achieves the target debt service coverage ratio.if,according to plaintiff,defendants are not obligated to resize and if plaintiff can not reach the target net operating income,then a conversion date would never occur and plaintiff would never owe principal payments to defendants.
plaintiff definition of the conversion date is at odds with the definition in the note.the note defines the conversion date as the eleventh day of the first calendar month following the calendar month in which payee notifies maker of payee determination of the difference.at.although b of the note and of the loan agreement both address the difference,and plaintiff method of repaying it,only b defines the difference.pursuant to b of the note,the difference equals the difference between the original principal amount of the loan and the resized principal balance.in other words,the difference amounts to the reduction in the original principal due to resizing.repayment of the difference becomes due on the conversion date the date defendants notify plaintiff of their determination of how much they will reduce the loan principal.
contrary to plaintiff definition,the note does not explicitly mandate resizing to trigger the conversion date.instead,the note requires defendants to make a determination of the difference,the amount of reduction in the principal,and notify plaintiff of that determination.the conversion date occurs on the eleventh day of the next month.
defendants notified plaintiff of their determination of the difference in a letter dated december.on that date,defendants informed plaintiff of their decision against resizing the loan.because defendants chose not to resize,they did not reduce the original principal at all,producing a difference reduction in original principal through resizing of zero.defendants specifically notified plaintiff of this difference determination in the december letter.pursuant to the terms of the note,then,january,the eleventh day of the month following defendants providing notice of the difference determination,was the conversion date.although until the conversion date,plaintiff had only interest payment obligations,after the conversion date the note alters plaintiff obligations.after the conversion date,the note requires a constant payment based on the applicable interest rate a specified amortization schedule and the original principal amount or,if a resizing as such term is hereafter defined in section b is effected pursuant to section b,the resized principal amount.at emphasis added.
although plaintiff contends that the difference can not equal zero and that declaring a difference of zero would be inconsistent with the resizing mechanism,we envision nothing inconsistent with requiring defendants to declare a difference before plaintiff becomes obligated to make principal and interest payments on the loan.before defendants can receive principal payments,defendants must consider the advisability of lowering the principal amount of the loan in exchange for equity interests of plaintiff.defendants could determine,as they did with the macomb mall and columbus mall loans,resizing was appropriate,determine an amount by which to reduce the loan determining the difference,and proceed with the terms of b of the note and of the loan agreement.on the other hand,defendants could examine the circumstances surrounding plaintiff loan and determine that lowering the principal amount was not in the interests of the loan transaction.the note payment formula favors this construction by basing plaintiff date payments on,in addition to an amortization term and interest,either the original principal amount or the resized principal amount,if defendants decide to undertake resizing.instead of producing the absurd or illogical result plaintiff portends,defendant election against resizing and declaring a difference of zero leads to principal payment obligations according to the arrangement provided in the note.
granting defendants the sole and absolute discretion to resize does not conflict with other terms of the loan agreement.this absence of conflict requires,under michigan law and the contract itself,the enforcement of b on equal footing with other provisions of the contract.defendants properly carried out their obligations under the contract by electing against resizing.
plaintiff extrinsic evidence 
the extrinsic evidence plaintiff offers in support of its competing interpretation of the nature of the resizing mechanism does not affect our analysis of the contract or resolution of this appeal.plaintiff extrinsic evidence consists of schostak affidavit describing representations made by nacc officials during loan negotiations in and nomura depositor offering circular.michigan law permits consideration of neither of these items of extrinsic evidence.
michigan parol evidence rule bars the use of extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of a written contract intended to be the final and complete expression of the contracting parties agreement.cook little caesar,cir.even though extrinsic evidence of contemporaneous or prior negotiations is admissible to show the parties did not intend the written agreement to be final and complete,an integration clause in a written contract conclusively establishes that the parties intended the written contract to be the complete expression of their agreement.id.citing nag,all state,uaw gm human res.ctr.ksl recreation.
section of the loan agreement,entitled prior agreements,declares 
this agreement and the other loan documents contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,and all prior agreements among or between such parties,whether oral or written,are superseded by the terms of this agreement and the other loan documents.
at.under michigan law,this integration language conclusively establishes the finality and completeness of the written agreement.see cook,at.
schostak affidavit seeks to show an understanding that the resizing mechanism was mandatory,rather than discretionary.this assertion,describing statements contemporaneous with contract negotiations,contradicts the sole and absolute discretion language of b of the note.the district court properly refused to consider schostak affidavit pursuant to the parol evidence rule.
plaintiff urges the court to consider schostak affidavit and the offering circular under a different theory.according to plaintiff,the note sole and absolute discretion language is ambiguous.because of this ambiguity,plaintiff contends schostak affidavit and the offering circular should be admissible to explain the meaning of the loan agreement and the parties interpretation of it.
michigan permits the use of extrinsic evidence to dispose of a potential ambiguity,to prove the existence of a potential ambiguity,or to indicate the actual intent of the parties where an actual ambiguity exists.am.anodco,reynolds metals,cir.whether an ambiguity exists in a written contract is a question of law for the court resolution.sault marie tribe of chippewa indians engler,cir.a contract or term is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.raska farm bureau mut.ins.of.at the same time,a court does not have the right to make a different contract for the parties or to look to extrinsic testimony to determine their intent when the words used by them are clear and unambiguous and have a definite meaning.chandelier morse.
