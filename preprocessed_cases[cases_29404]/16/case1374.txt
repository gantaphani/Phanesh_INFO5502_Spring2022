niels jensen,a successful software salesman for ibm corporation,commenced this breach of contract action against ibm for million in additional commissions that jensen claims he earned in under ibm software sales incentive plan.the district court concluded that the plan did not create an enforceable contract obligating ibm to pay the commissions and granted summary judgment to ibm.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
ibm hired jensen in as a software sales representative.he was hired as an employee whose employment at ibm could be ended by the employee or ibm at any time with or without cause.his compensation consisted of base pay plus variable pay,commissions,awards,and other forms of earnings designed to attract,retain and motivate employees.
in,ibm announced the software sales incentive plan the sales incentive plan,a unified compensation plan for all of its sales employees,and presented the plan to its employees at university,an instructional conference for ibm employees.jensen attended the conference with over a thousand other salesmen and there received a glossy brochure,entitled welcome to the fabulous world of your software sales incentive plan,which outlined the sales incentive plan.the brochure trumpeted the simplicity and advantages of the new plan under which a salesman commissions turn on his success in attaining his sales quota,instead of being calculated as a straight percentage of sales,as they had been before.announcing its function,the brochure stated this booklet explains the basic principles that guided design of the new plan,and provides information to help you understand how the plan works for you and for ibm.describing the concept of incentives,the brochure stated b ecause your sales plan is based on a model,there are no caps to your earnings the more you sell,the more revenue and incremental profit for ibm and the more earnings for you.the brochure described how the plan worked,set forth some rates,and provided a full example of how the income for a hypothetical software account manager is to be computed.it cautioned,however 
disclaimer this example is provided for illustration purposes only.actual sales incentive payments will be different than the numbers displayed here.in cases of conflict between what is shown in this booklet and local documentation,local plan documentation prevails.
the brochure directed employees to visit the sales incentives section of ibm corporate intranet for lots of useful content that helps you focus on big payout opportunities,and easily calculate your earnings.
the sales incentive section of ibm corporate intranet contained various documents,including one entitled ibm software group sales incentive plan management guide commonly referred to as the playbook and one entitled field management guidance software sales incentive plan.the latter provided in much detail the way in which the sales incentive plan operates and was to be managed.explaining that it is a companion piece to the software sales incentives plan booklet,the field management guidance described the implementation and management of the plan under headings such as implementing the incentive plan,determining eligibility,setting,evaluating performance and paying incentives,and achieving a competitive distribution of earnings.the field management guidance concluded with references to additional materials for further information.
the sales incentive plan allowed ibm separate divisions to individualize a salesman sales targets and balance his salary and commissions.accordingly,doug martin,jensen manager,provided jensen with an employee quota letter tailoring the sales incentive plan to jensen.jensen quota letter identified his sales territory and outlined the structure of the incentive plan as it was applicable to him.the employee quota letter placed jensen in the incentive pay.as the letter explained,jensen would earn as salary and,if he attained of his sales was fixed at million for the year would earn as incentive pay,split between in commissions and in bonus pay.at the bottom of the letter,in bold italics,ibm wrote 
right to modify or cancel while ibm intent is to pay employees covered by this program according to its provisions,this program does not constitute a promise by ibm to make any distributions under it.ibm reserves the right to adjust the program terms or to cancel or otherwise modify the program at any time during the program period,or up until actual payment has been made under the program.modification or cancellation may be applicable to all persons covered by the program,or to any subset as defined by management.even though you may be given progress reports regarding plan achievement during the year,no one becomes entitled to any payment in advance of his or her receipt of the payment.
on september,jensen closed an exceptionally large transaction with the irs that he determined was worth over million to ibm.jensen calculated that he would receive approximately million in commissions from this transaction.in reaching this figure,jensen relied on the figures included in the glossy brochure and on the practice that ibm had followed in calculating his commissions during the previous months.the glossy brochure showed that for sales constituting up to of his sales quota,he would receive for sales amounting to to of his quota,he would receive and for sales above of his quota,he would receive.in addition,jensen applied to the sale a reduction,carving out from the gross sale value an amount for maintenance costs that ibm would have to book and incur over the life of the contract.according to jensen,for other sales that he had made during the previous of which were small by comparison with the irs deducted as a maintenance carve.thus,in estimating his commissions,jensen reduced the million contract by to million,and to that number,he applied the commission rates given in the brochure describing the sales incentive plan.jensen asserts that these calculations resulted in a figure of million.
when ibm paid jensen,however,it awarded him less than on the irs transaction.first,because of the size and complexity of the irs contract and the requirements of general accounting principles,ibm valued the deal at less than million jensen attributes this to ibm booking a maintenance carve.also,ibm applied a rule,also known as the large opportunities clause,which the field management guidance explained as follows 
occasionally,a sales employee will be involved in a very unique transaction that is significantly larger than anything anticipated,such as when a rep with a quota has a single transaction that is.due to the unusual size of these types of transactions compared with the quota assigned,ibm management reserves the right to review any single transaction that results in attainment of quota or greater.management will decide if an adjustment to the payment is appropriate based on the contribution of the sales employee to that transaction,therefore,managers should fully understand the sales employee involvement in the transaction.managers are encouraged to discuss these situations with employees as soon as they are identified,preferably prior to the opportunity closing.
the rule was also described in the playbook.in the playbook more particularized description of the rule,ibm stated that a commission would be paid for that portion of a single sale that exceeds of the salesman annual quota.below the level,however,the percentages identified in the glossy sales brochure applied.
jensen was not aware of the rule,nor were some of his immediate colleagues,including managers.he was both shocked and angered by ibm calculation,which amounted to a commission far smaller than he had anticipated.he claimed that he did not become aware of the rule until october,roughly two weeks after he closed the irs sale.when ibm first alerted jensen it was planning on paying him only,he conducted a lengthy search on the ibm corporate intranet and only then discovered the documents describing the rule.
jensen commenced this action for breach of contract,alleging that once he closed the irs transaction,he became entitled to a commission,which he computed usin
