on october,instone filed a breach of contract suit against isp in the judicial district court of harris county,texas.isp removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of instone,finding that the plain terms of the agreement obligated isp to reimburse instone for the tickets.isp appeals the district court grant of summary judgment,and instone the district court refusal to grant attorneys fees to fund a defense of this appeal.

agency immunity 
it is well established that an agent acting for a disclosed principal is not liable for claims arising out of contracts executed by the agent on behalf of its principal it is equally evident,however,that the parties to a contract may alter this general rule by agreement so that the agent will be liable on the contract the mere fact that an agency relationship exists does not preclude the imposition of personal liability on an express contract with a third party,even though the contract is primarily for the benefit of the principal.united states gissel,aff,cir.where upon a construction of the contract it is determined that the agent has substituted his own responsibility for that of his principal,or has pledged his own responsibility in addition to that of his principal,he will be bound accordingly.his liability is not predicated upon his agency,but upon his contract obligations.vincent murphy chevrolet auto auction,quoting american bank american loan mortgage.comm app,and citing numerous texas court of civil appeals cases.see eppler,guerin turner,kasmir,richards group,stone container,wl not designated for publication.jur d.

do the terms of the agreement obligate isp to reimburse instone for purchases it made on behalf of vessel owners 
instone maintains that the district court correctly concluded that the express terms of the contract unambiguously obligate isp to pay for the purchases that it made on behalf of vessel owners.isp,in response,maintains that such an interpretation fails to give effect to provision x,where instone acknowledged that isp is acting as an agent for vessel owners.provision x,it maintains,unambiguously releases isp from liability.
from within the four corners of the contract,it appears that isp did indeed agree to be held liable for the goods and services it ordered from instone.the contract is entitled credit agreement,and the entire agreement is concerned with establishing the parameters by which an account,in the name of isp,is to be managed.the agreement makes reference to the client isp credit application,the establishment of the client credit limit,the requirement that the client remit payment within fourteen days of each statement date,and the method by which refunds and service charges are to be added and deducted from the client account.the first provision of the contract contains a blank for the name of the client.international shipping partners,is written in the blank.there is no language regarding credit applications,credit limits,or the management of accounts for isp principals.furthermore,provision,labeled representations and warranties of client,states,client acknowledges that it is unconditionally obligated to pay contractor for each ticket or document issued to client hereunder.it is thus evident from the agreement that instone intended isp to be obligated to pay for the goods and services that it ordered 
isp contends that despite its acceptance of liability in provision,the fact that it does so in the midst of a provision that discusses instone status as an agent for airlines and other transportation vendors,and instone unconditional obligation to pay its vendors,mitigates the phrase import.while it would appear,given its placement,that instone included the phrase requiring its clients isp to accept liability for services rendered to guard against the possibility that a client would claim that it did not need to pay for tickets that were unused,lost,or issued for travel on carriers who subsequently halted service.
the phrase,however,was not modified by any statements that limited its applicability to such scenarios.instone standard contract simply does not contemplate that a signatory would claim,after ordering and consuming the provided services,that it was not the party from whom instone should seek payment.in the end,although the phrase client acknowledges that it is unconditionally obligated to pay contractor may have been included in the agreement in order to prevent a client from wriggling out of the duty to pay for the goods that it ordered for reasons other than those claimed by isp,this is not a sufficient ground to disregard the clear import of the phrase.
provision x 
isp contends that the district court grant of summary judgment holding it liable under the agreement ignores the impact of provision x,and thus violates the rule of construction that requires each provision of a contract to be given effect.see in re el paso refinery,lp,cir int l turbine,at.
isp argues that provision x,which states,contractor acknowledges that client is acting as agent for an sic on behalf of certain vessels,vessel owners charterers,effectively substituted international shipping,as agent for its principals for the term client everywhere that client appears in the agreement.in doing so,continues isp,provision x clarified that isp would not only purchase services from instone as an agent for vessel owners,but also signed the agreement itself in its capacity as an agent for vessel owners.thus,isp concludes,the vessel owners on whose behalf it signed the agreement are bound by its isp.
isp interpretation of provision x,however,requires two cognitive leaps that stretch the plain meaning of the provision a bit too far.first,if isp intended the term client to mean,isp,as agent for its principals,then why did it not simply redefine the meaning of client in provision x instead of cryptically stating contractor acknowledges that client is acting as agent alternatively,why did isp not insert as agent for its principals next to its name in the blank that defines the meaning of client in the first sentence of the agreement 
second,isp contention that instone acknowledgment of its status as an agent releases it from liability presupposes that an agent is necessarily not liable on a contract where the other party is aware that it is acting as an agent.the case law does not support such an argument.jur d an agent may be personally liable on contracts made for the benefit of his or her principal even where the principal is disclosed.see nagle duncan,holding attorney liable for fees due court reporter despite court reporter knowledge that the transcript had been ordered for the client that the attorney represented mediacomp,capital cities communication,holding media buyer liable to radio station for airtime purchased on behalf of disclosed client kaiser aluminum chemical zephyros,wl,rejecting agent argument that as a disclosed agent,it was not liable for the debts of its principal.as previously noted,the general rule that an agent is not liable for those contracts that it enters on behalf of a disclosed principal is overcome when the agent expressly or implicitly accepts liability.see infra at.there is thus nothing inconsistent about the district court decision to hold isp liable under the agreement in the face of provision x clear statement of isp status as an agent.see kaiser aluminum chemical zephyros,wl,rejecting agent argument that as a disclosed agent,it did not become a party to the contract for services that were provided at its request for the principal.holding isp liable on the agreement does not deny that isp entered the agreement as an agent for vessel owners,and thus does not render provision x meaningless.
while we applaud isp for its creativity,we do not find its interpretation of provision x persuasive.had isp intended to sign the agreement on behalf of its clients,there were myriad other,more direct methods of doing so than through the language of provision isp status as an agent,alone,is insufficient to override the indicia of liability that pervade the agreement.the district court did not err in finding that isp bound itself in the agreement to reimburse instone for the tickets that it purchased on behalf of premier.
is the contract ambiguous 
isp contends that because its interpretations of provisions.and x are reasonable,the agreement was ambiguous regarding its liability,and summary judgment was inappropriate see in re el paso refinery,lp,at noting that if a contract is ambiguous,a fact issue remains regarding the parties intent.instone responds that summary judgment was properly granted because the district court interpretation of the provisions,and its ultimate conclusion that the agreement requires isp to reimburse instone,was the only reasonable interpretation in the absence of inadmissible parol evidence.
whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered into.in re el paso refinery,lp,at cir friendswood development mcdade.if the contract terms are susceptible to only one reasonable construction,the contract is unambiguous and will be enforced as written.guaranty nat.ins.azrock industries,cir.a contract is ambiguous only when the application of the applicable rules of interpretation to the instrument leave it genuinely uncertain which one of the two meanings is the proper meaning.r p enterprises laguarta,gavrel kirk.a contract is not ambiguous because it suffers from mere uncertainty or lack of clarity.madera prod.atlantic richfield,wl.the failure to include more express language of the parties intent does not create an ambiguity when only one reasonable interpretation exists.columbia gas transmission new ulm gas.
we find that the district court interpretation of provisions.and x is the only plausible interpretation.the first two pages of the agreement between instone and isp are concerned with ensuring that the client isp account is and properly managed.in the final provision of the contract,provision x,the contractor acknowledges that the client is acting as an agent.these provisions are unambiguous on their face.any claimed ambiguity in the document must therefore be latent.see constitution state ins,at explaining the difference between patent and latent ambiguities.a latent ambiguity must become evident when the contract is applied to the surrounding circumstances.national union fire ins.cbi,wl.parol evidence of intent may not be admitted to create an ambiguity.id constitution state ins,cir.
isp points to the following as circumstances surrounding the contract execution that support the reasonableness of its interpretation,and thus the ambiguity of the contract with respect to its liability prior to contract execution,isp notified instone that instone would not receive payment until isp received payment from the vessel owners instone asked for,and isp provided,a list of the shipowners who would be paying the invoices in prior dealings,isp had instructed instone that it acted as an agent and did not advance money or guarantee payments on behalf of its principals and instone representative acknowledged that he understood that isp did not advance money or guarantee payments on behalf of its principals these are not circumstances surrounding the contract execution,but parol evidence.see,columbia gas transmission new ulm gas,noting that the fact that a huge volume of gas would be deregulated on a particular date was a circumstance of the contract that could be properly considered in determining whether a gas contract was ambiguous.
parol evidence is defined as evidence given orally.black law dictionary ed.seeing that isp has not provided the court with any written documentation regarding the asserted circumstances,we presume that they relate to oral exchanges between the parties.these assertions should therefore not be considered in determining whether the contract is ambiguous with respect to isp liability.see.jur d absent fraud,accident,or mistake,the intent of the parties to a written agreement that is clear and unambiguous on i
