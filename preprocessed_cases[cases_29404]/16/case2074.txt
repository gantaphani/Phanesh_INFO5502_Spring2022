plaintiff is a kentucky corporation that sells petroleum products.defendant is a tennessee corporation that specializes in the construction of large underground utility and treatment plant projects.at.on june,defendant acquired hall oil company,hall,a tennessee corporation that sells petroleum products in middle tennessee.
plaintiff held a chevron lubrication marketer agreement for an region in middle tennessee.in,hall was looking to acquire a small lubricants company with an existing customer base to increase its lubricants business.hall took particular interest in plaintiff middle tennessee operations.in,rusty mcdonald mcdonald,the president of hall,contacted phil russo russo,vice president of sales and marketing of plaintiff,to discuss a possible purchase of plaintiff middle tennessee operations.during negotiations,mcdonald,russo,and james bryant bryant,corporate secretary and treasurer of defendant,executed a memorandum of understanding on september.the memorandum expressed an understanding that plaintiff would sell its middle tennessee operation to hall,with the primary consequence being hall ability to sell chevron lubricants in that area.
chevron,however,was unwilling to completely switch its business from plaintiff to hall.chevron had a long history of successful business dealings with plaintiff,but it had no experience in dealing with hall.chevron wanted some assurance of consistent performance in the transition from plaintiff to hall,and chevron insisted that plaintiff stay on in a transitional role.as a result,plaintiff and hall agreed to form a new company,hailey oil services,llc hailey oil services.plaintiff would have a membership interest in hailey oil services,and hall would have a interest in the company.
on november,plaintiff and hall executed an operating agreement for hailey oil services.in relevant part,the agreement stated 
definitions.
c cash flow of the company shall mean the company taxable income for federal tax purposes,increased by i amortization,depreciation and other noncash charges taken into account in computing taxable income,ii any nontaxable income or proceeds from any refinancing of the company indebtedness other than capital contributions and iii the net proceeds from the sale of any of the company assets,and reduced by iv principal payments on company indebtedness,v any other cash expenditures which have not been deducted in determining the taxable income of the company and vi any amount that the board of governors determines to be reasonably required to maintain sufficient working capital and a reasonable reserve for operating expenses.the cash flow of the company shall be determined separately for each fiscal year and not cumulatively.

purchase price.in exchange for the membership interest of max arnold,hall shall pay to max arnold an amount equal to one hundred thousand dollars less all distributions from the company to max arnold pursuant to section.
at.in short,the operating agreement created two separate obligations to plaintiff.under section,hailey oil services was required to pay cash flow distributions to plaintiff.under sections and,hall was required to pay plaintiff,less any cash flow distributions,one year after the execution of the operating agreement,november,if hailey oil services had a lubricants contract with chevron at that time.
on the same day,plaintiff and defendant entered into a guaranty agreement.in relevant part,the guaranty agreement stated 
now,therefore,in consideration of the mutual promises and benefits to be derived by parties hereto from the operation of the business known as hailey oil services,llc,hailey company,hereby guarantees the prompt and full payment of any financial obligation which is due and payable to max arnold sons,llc pursuant to that certain operating agreement dated the day of november,of hailey oil services,llc.
by the execution of this agreement,hailey company,specifically guarantees the payment of the distributions of cash flow to max arnold sons,llc,as set forth in section of said operating agreement and the purchase of the membership interest of max arnold sons,llc by hall as set forth in section of the operating agreement.
at.on the same day,plaintiff and hailey oil services entered into a agreement.
on december,chevron executed a marketing distribution agreement with hailey oil services.the relationship between the parties seemed to be running smoothly.on march,hailey oil services paid plaintiff,which included for the first calendar quarter cash flow distribution check under section of the operating agreement,as well as additional money for equipment and inventory.
after the initial payment,hailey oil services failed to pay plaintiff cash flow distributions however,there is no evidence in the record that hailey oil services generated a positive cash flow in the remaining three calendar quarters.moreover,on or about april,chevron notified hailey oil services of its intent to cancel the lubricants distribution agreement with hailey oil services.the cancellation became effective on june.bryant,now a former officer of defendant,stated in an affidavit that hall,after receiving plaintiff customer lists pursuant to the operating agreement for hailey oil services,began selling brands to many of plaintiff former customers who had been purchasing chevron products.
plaintiff demanded payment under the operating agreement from both hailey oil services and hall,and both refused to pay.plaintiff then demanded payment under the guaranty agreement from defendant,and defendant refused to pay.plaintiff followed with the instant suit.
ii.discussion 
plaintiff motion for summary.standard of review 
this court reviews the district court decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo.turner city of taylor,cir citation omitted.the moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.t he burden on the moving party may be discharged by showing that is,pointing out to the district there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d.the court must view the facts and all of the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d citation omitted.
the district court erred in granting plaintiff motion for summary judgment.the operating agreement does not create an obligation of absolute payment from hailey oil services to plaintiff under section instead,it only creates an obligation to pay plaintiff cash flow distributions.because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that hailey oil services had a positive cash flow for the remaining three calendar quarters,and because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that hailey oil services had a positive cash flow in any subsequent calendar quarters,plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that hailey services breached section of the operating agreement.therefore,plaintiff has failed to meet its burden on summary judgment in demonstrating that defendant should be held liable under the guaranty agreement.
tennessee law 
a guaranty is a promise to answer for the payment of some debt,or the performance of some duty,in case of the failure of another who is liable in the first instance.black law dictionary ed.thus,the basic definition of guaranty contemplates a failure by the primary party,a failure for which the guarantor is then responsible.both plaintiff and defendant agree that tennessee law governs the instant case under tennessee law,
guaranties,by their very nature,are conditional promises to pay because guarantors promise to pay only on the condition that the principal debtor fails to pay.likewise,guaranties,even ones containing a limitation on the guarantor liability,do not involve a sum certain because the amount of the guarantor liability can not be determined solely from the instrument itself without reference to an outside source.finally,a guaranty is not payable at a definite time or on demand since it is payable only when the principal debtor defaults.
guarantor partners huff.thus,the primary party must default before the guarantor may be held liable.
application to this case 
the district court erred in finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact that hailey oil services failed to fulfill its obligations under the operating agreement,rendering defendant liable to plaintiff under the guaranty agreement.we agree with the district court that hall was not obligated to purchase plaintiff membership interest in hailey oil services at the lapse of one year from the execution of the operating agreement,november,under sections and.the condition precedent to this purchase,the existence of a contract with chevron at that point in time,had not been met we disagree,however,with the district court holding that hailey oil services was obligated to pay plaintiff under section.that section states 
distribution of cash flow.subject to the provisions of the act,cash flow generated from company operations shall be distributed to the members within days of the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with the percentage interests of the members,except that,to the extent max arnold share of cash flow for any of the first four calendar quarters of operation is less than,hall share of cash flow shall be reduced and max arnold shall receive cash flow equal to.to the extent that cash flow for any of the first four calendar quarters of operation is less than,max arnold share of cash flow for the following calendar quarter s shall be increased until such time that max arnold share of cash flow for each of the first four calendar quarters of operation is equal to per quarter.
the district court interpreted this section to mean that hailey oil services was obligated to pay plaintiff per calendar quarter for the first year 
section,in unambiguous language,states that plaintiff shall receive quarterly payments in cash flow distribution totaling.there is no condition precedent to these payments.in fact,the contract states that the quarterly payments to plaintiff shall take priority over any cash flow payments to hall.these payments are due to plaintiff under the express terms of the contract.thus,under the operating agreement,there is no question that plaintiff is owed cash flow payments of.
we agree with the district court that there is no question that plaintiff is owed cash flow payments of.there is a logical disconnect,however,between this statement and the district court order awarding plaintiff judgment in the amount of,which is less the first calendar quarter distribution made by hailey oil services under section,hailey oil services is obligated to make cash flow distributions to plaintiff.a condition precedent to these distributions is that hailey oil services actually must have positive cash flow to distribute.in other words,section does not guarantee an absolute payment of per calendar quarter for the first four quarters it only guarantees that plaintiff will receive cash flow payments of per calendar quarter for the first four quarters if there is sufficient cash flow,or,in the case that plaintiff receives less than that amount due to insufficient cash flow,plaintiff has priority in receiving cash flow distributions in subsequent quarters.the only way in which plaintiff can demonstrate that hailey oil services failed in its obligations under section is if hailey oil services failed to make cash flow payments as required under that section.
section contemplates three levels of cash flow.if hailey oil services quarterly cash flow was greater than or equal to then plaintiff would take a simple distribution of that cash flow and hall would take.if the quarterly cash flow was between and,then plaintiff would take and hall would take the remainder.if the quarterly cash flow was less than,then plaintiff would take all of it,and the difference between and the actual amount would be paid from the subsequent quarter.thus,plaintiff would have priority payment in the situation where it was paid less than for a calendar quarter.
in this case,hailey oil services made the following cash flow distributions to plaintiff for the first four calendar quarters.this distribution would be correct if the cash flow of hailey oil services was between and for the first quarter,and or negative for the remaining three quarters,as well as or negative for any subsequent quarters.in order to show a breach of section,plaintiff must demonstrate that in fact hailey oil services had cash flow greater than these amounts in these quarters.plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact that hailey oil services generated such cash flow.plaintiff argues,the guaranty agreement executed by hailey is unconditional and specifically guarantees the money owed to max arnold under section.while we concede that this statement is correct,plaintiff fails to adequately prove on summary judgment that in fact plaintiff is owed any money under section.
we emphasize that the structure of section did not guarantee that plaintiff would absolutely receive per calendar quarter for the first four calendar quarters.the section guaranteed that plaintiff would receive per calendar quarter if adequate cash flow was available.if adequate cash flow was not available,the section unambiguously gave plaintiff only one source of relief hailey oil services cash flow in subsequent quarters.absent a factual showing that hailey oil services wrongfully withheld cash flow from plaintiff plaintiff fails to prove that hailey oil services breached its obligations under section.because plaintiff fails to make such a showing to the threshold of proving that there is no genuine issue of material fact,plaintiff has not adequately proved a breach on the part of hailey oil services.because plaintiff fails to adequately prove such a breach,plaintiff also fails to adequately prove that defendant breached the guaranty agreement.plaintiff fails to meet its burden under the summary judgment standard therefore,the district court decision granting plaintiff motion for summary judgment was error.
defendant motion for summary judgment 
standard of review 
defendant originally filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.that rule,however,states,
if,on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by rule.
c.in this case,matters outside the pleadings were presented to and not excluded by the district court specifically,plaintiff presented two affidavits and a statement of undisputed material facts,while defendant presented one affidavit.
the question then becomes whether this evidence was introduced on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or on plaintiff summary judgment motion.plaintiff did not respond to defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings with a simple response instead,plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.plaintiff memorandum in support of the motion was entitled,memorandum of law by plaintiff in support of its motion for summary judgment and in opposition to defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings.at.in the memorandum,plaintiff referred to the affidavit of bryant in the parol evidence context plaintiff stated that to the extent the district court found the guaranty agreement to be ambiguous,the district court could rely on the parol evidence of bryant affidavit.plaintiff reference was made under the subheading,in relevant part,the affidavit of james bryant establishes that the defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied and that plaintiff motion for summary judgment should be granted.we therefore find that plaintiff in part submitted the affidavit in connection with defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings.likewise,plaintiff submitted the affidavit of russo in part to refute a contention made by defendant in its memorandum in support of its motion for judgment on the pleadings.as for plaintiff statement of undisputed material facts,we are uncertain whether plaintiff submitted this statement in connection with defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings,inasmuch as plaintiff does not refer to the statement in its memorandum.defendant submitted an affidavit in response to plaintiff motion for summary judgment,not in its reply to plaintiff response to the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
at a minimum,plaintiff presented to the district court two affidavits on defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings,and the district court did not exclude these affidavits.the question then becomes whether,under these facts,the district court should have converted defendant c motion to a motion for summary judgment.the courts have been imprecise and inconsistent as to what action of the district court triggers the obligation to convert a motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment.some courts have held that a court may accept and consider matters outside the pleadings for a motion for judgment on the pleadings,so long as the court does not rely on those matters in its decision on the motion.see,alexander oklahoma,cir analyzing the requirements under rule b,which has language identical to that in rule c homart dev.sigman,cir.other courts have held that if a court accepts and considers those matters outside the pleadings,the motion for judgment on the pleadings should be converted to a motion for summary judgment.see,northern indiana gun outdoor shows,city of south bend,cir noting that while the district court accepted various documents outside of the pleadings,it did not consider those documents.still other courts have found that the mere acceptance of those outside materials is sufficient to trigger the conversion of a motion for judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment.see,dempsey atchison,topeka,santa fe ry,cir.
in our view,rule c requires only one action by the district court for the conversion to a summary judgment motion to occur failure to exclude presented outside evidence.we therefore agree with the third line of cases,as exemplified by dempsey.this court has found that the mere presentation of evidence outside of the pleadings,absent the district court rejection of such evidence,is sufficient to trigger the conversion of a rule c motion to a motion for summary judgment.see moody united states,cir although the government motion in bawgus was for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to.c,it is clear that matters outside the pleadings were presented we,therefore,consider the court decision as if entered on a motion for summary judgment.although we have found that consideration or reliance on matters outside the pleadings is sufficient to trigger conversion under rule c,see,thompson v.the budd,cir consideration swallows barnes noble book stores,cir reliance,we have never held that consideration or reliance was required under rule c for conversion to a motion for summary judgment.we therefore disagree with those cases that require the district court to further consider or rely upon these outside matters before the obligation to convert is triggered the plain language of rule c does not require these additional steps it only requires the presentation of matters outside the pleadings and the district court failure to exclude such matters.see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.a district court could consider evidence outside the pleadings on a motion under rule c,and,upon acceptance of that material,would regard the motion as one for summary judgment the district court remains free to refuse to accept materials outside the pleadings in order to keep the motion under rule c emphasis supplied.
because plaintiff presented matters outside of the pleadings with respect to defendant rule c motion,and because the district court did not exclude these matters,the district court should have converted the rule c motion to a motion for summary judgment.this court therefore construes the district court denial of defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings as a denial of defendant motion for summary judgment.see united of carpenters and joiners,dresden local ohio carpenters health and welfare fund,cir as an appellate court,we are not bound to adhere to the label attached to the trial court disposition of the case and may treat it as a summary judgment.citation omitted.downing kunzig,cir construing the district court grant of a rule b motion as a grant of summary judgment,based on language identical to that in rule c.
because the district court effectively converted defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment,it should have given both of the parties notice of such conversion and pr
