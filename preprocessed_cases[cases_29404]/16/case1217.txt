opinion of the court 
ffe transportation services,ffe appeals from the judgment of the district court finding ffe liable to beta spawn,for the value of a shipment of mushroom spawn damaged during transport.ffe contends that the district court erred in finding that beta spawn established a prima facie case under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,that ffe tariff was not applicable to the shipment at issue and that ffe had agreed to maintain the temperature of its trailer at degrees fahrenheit when transporting the spawn.because we hold that the district court ruled correctly on all three issues,we affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of beta spawn on its claim for damages and against ffe on its counter claim to recover freight charges.
background 
beta spawn,a pennsylvania corporation,supplies mushroom spawn to the mushroom industry at all times relevant to this case,beta spawn has been the exclusive distributor of a variety of spawn from italy known as italspawn.ffe is a common carrier hired by beta spawn to transport a shipment of italspawn from camarillo,california to beta spawn facility in pennsylvania.
according to the district court findings,mushroom spawn are living,breathing organisms that must be maintained at a temperature of approximately degrees.harry testa,of beta spawn,testified that when spawn are exposed to higher temperatures,they begin to generate their own heat and to ferment.spawn that have begun to ferment are damaged and lose their viability.once spawn are exposed to heat,attempts to the spawn will not be successful.because spawn are fragile,they must breathe filtered air to avoid contamination.for that reason,spawn are packaged in clear,plastic bags with air filters on each bag.condensation and yellow discoloration are signs of contaminated spawn.damaged spawn also have a characteristic odor similar to that of vinegar.
in june,beta spawn sold a truckload shipment of italspawn the june shipment to peterson ranch in camarillo,california louis peterson,an officer and director of mushrooms,who received the shipment in california,testified that some of the boxes containing the spawn were torn and crushed at the time of arrival.nevertheless,peterson used spawn out of those damaged boxes to grow his first crop of mushrooms.
in september,peterson agreed to sell units of the italspawn back to beta spawn.these spawn had been stored for three months in a facility that was nearby,but not on,the farm premises and,according to peterson,had remained refrigerated the entire time.peterson testified that about three weeks after the spawn were shipped to beta spawn,he used a remaining portion of the june shipment to grow a successful crop of mushrooms.that portion,however,was not stored in the same facility as the spawn sold to beta spawn.
on behalf of beta spawn,testa contacted michael conn of ffe to arrange for the shipment of the spawn from california to beta spawn facility in pennsylvania.during their conversation,testa and conn verbally agreed that ffe would transport the spawn at a temperature of approximately degrees.ffe had shipped spawn for beta spawn before and had always transported the spawn in a trailer maintained at degrees.
on september,ffe entered into a bill of lading contract of carriage with mushrooms,of california for the transportation of the spawn to pennsylvania.mushrooms,requested that ffe provide it with ltl,chilled service.beta spawn,as consignee,agreed to pay ffe for the shipment upon delivery.the bill of lading,prepared by peterson ranch,called for the transport of units of spawn,packed in boxes.the spawn were packed in clear plastic bags,three bags to a box,separated by cardboard dividers.each cardboard box contained holes to permit air circulation.peterson loaded the boxes into ffe refrigerated trailer on pallets,boxes to a pallet.initially,the boxes were only secured to the pallets with clear plastic tape,but after the pallets were loaded onto the truck,william forbito,the driver for ffe,the boxes to prevent their falling over during transport.
forbito testified that when he picked up the spawn,he asked peterson at what temperature he was to maintain the shipment.after peterson responded it goes chilled,forbito recorded the word chill on the bill of lading.forbito also wrote the words temp.degrees on the bill of lading.at trial,forbito explained that when he accepted the spawn in california,he took the temperature inside one of the boxes and found it to be degrees.
forbito also gave testimony regarding the condition of the boxes.he stated that the bottom two layers of boxes on every pallet were bubbled out like they getting ready to bust open.the boxes was sic torn,they were crushed.and boxes open.forbito did not recall seeing any actual torn bags of spawn.after observing the damaged condition of the boxes,forbito called his dispatcher and was told he could accept the load as long as he noted the damage on the bill of lading.forbito then took exception to the condition of the entire load by writing on the bill of lading.
peterson testified that before the boxes were loaded onto ffe trailer,he opened one of the boxes and removed a bag of spawn for inspection.peterson inspection of that bag consisted of a visual examination of the spawn coloring and a sniff test through the air filter on the bag for the odor of spawn fermentation.based on these tests,peterson determined that the spawn were in good condition because there was no yellowish tint and no odor.peterson also looked through cracks of the torn boxes in order to see whether the bags in those boxes were ripped or open.peterson testified that he saw no open bags.
forbito set the temperature of the trailer at degrees and transported the shipment of spawn to cudahy,california,where he loaded it onto another trailer that was also set at degrees.a different driver then carried the shipment from california to chicago.when the driver arrived in chicago,approximately boxes were crushed,but the temperature of the product was degrees.in chicago,boxes were removed from the truck,placed in a warehouse and later reloaded onto another truck bound for pennsylvania.when the boxes left chicago,approximately of the boxes had leaking product exposed.
the shipment of spawn arrived at beta spawn facility in pennsylvania on september.testa,who was present when it arrived,described the shipment as a big mess.specifically,he stated that the bags were broke sic on quite a few boxes and that t here were sic a distinct odor that the spawn had started to sour.testa checked the temperature of the spawn in approximately boxes and found it to be between and degrees,which meant the spawn were no longer viable.thus,testa refused to accept delivery and notified ffe of beta spawn claim for damages.
beta spawn originally brought its claim against ffe for damage to its freight in the court of common pleas of delaware county,pennsylvania.ffe removed the case to federal court and filed a counterclaim for its freight charges.the district court held a bench trial and granted judgment in favor of beta spawn.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
this court has plenary review over the district court choice and interpretation of legal standards and its application of those standards to the facts of the case.see louis epstein family partnership kmart,cir polselli nationwide mut.fire ins,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.see country floors,partnership of gepner and ford,cir citing.a.
iii.discussion 
beta spawn prima facie case 
to establish a prima facie case against a common carrier under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,a plaintiff must prove the following three elements delivery of the goods to the initial carrier in good condition,damage of the goods before delivery to their final destination,and the amount of damages.conair old dominion freight line,cir citation omitted see also missouri pacific elmore stahl,d.after a bench trial,the district court found that beta spawn succeeded in establishing each of these elements.
ffe main argument on appeal is that there was no competent evidence for the trial court to find that the spawn were delivered to ffe in good condition specifically,ffe contends that under the law of this circuit,a shipper must prove by direct evidence that the merchandise was in good condition when tendered to the carrier if such merchandise was not visible or open to inspection at the time it was tendered.in support of its contention,ffe points to blue bird food prods.baltimore ohio,cir blue bird i appeal after remand,cir blue bird ii.we believe that ffe reliance on blue bird is misplaced.
blue bird i involved a shipper who relied solely upon a bill of lading,which represented that the carrier had received the shipment in apparent good order,in order to prove that the goods had been tendered in good condition.see blue bird i,at.the district court found such proof insufficient to establish the condition of the goods because the goods were in a sealed trailer and therefore not open for inspection.bluebird food prods.baltimore and ohio,vacated cir.the district court stated rather broadly,however,that w here merchandise is sealed in a trailer,and the contents are not open and visible,the plaintiff must establish by direct evidence that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good order.id.after initially remanding the case for the district court to determine whether the trailer was indeed sealed,we affirmed the district court finding that a bill of lading was insufficient to prove the condition of goods which had been in a sealed container.see blue bird ii,at.nevertheless,because the shipper in blue bird exclusively relied on the bill of lading,this court never reached the issue of what type of addition to a clean bill of establish that the merchandise had been delivered in good condition 
other courts,apparently focusing on the direct evidence requirement in the district court opinion,have cited blue bird for the proposition that where goods are not open and visible,a shipper may present only direct evidence,as opposed to circumstantial evidence,in order to establish the condition of its goods.see,apparel roadway express,cir in fact,where the contents of the shipment are not visible or open for inspection,additional direct and affirmative proof is necessary to show that the cloth was in good condition when delivered to roadway.citing,inter alia,blue bird i,at see also ed miniat,baltimore and ohio,under section of the carmack amendment,the burden of establishing the condition of the beef when entrusted to the railroad clearly lies on the shipper and discharging this burden requires some direct evidence of this condition.citations omitted.
in our view,however,the holding in blue bird,and even the must establish direct evidence language in the district court opinion,were simply directed at making shippers produce evidence,other than a clean bill of lading,to establish the condition of goods which were not open and visible for the carrier inspection.accordingly,we reject the view that blue bird renders all circumstantial evidence irrelevant where the goods are not open and visible see fine foliage of,bowman,cir we find no support for the carrier assertion that a judge may not rely on circumstantial evidence to establish the original condition of goods when that evidence is substantial and reliable.although a bill of lading,by itself,is not sufficient to establish the condition of goods that were neither visible nor open to inspection,a shipper may rely on other reliable or is sufficient to establish by a preponderance of all the evidence the condition of the goods upon delivery.pillsbury,at cir.thus,even assuming that the shipment in the present case was not open and visible the only difference between beta spawn evidentiary burden here,as opposed to in a case where goods are open and visible,is that beta spawn can not rely solely on the bill of lading to establish the spawn condition.
unlike the plaintiff in blue bird,beta spawn does not rely on the bill of lading as proof that it tendered the spawn to ffe in good condition.instead,it mainly relies upon the testimony of peterson,an officer and director of mushrooms.peterson testified that he successfully used a portion of the remaining italspawn from the original june shipment three weeks after the units of spawn were shipped to pennsylvania.although we recognize that peterson success is not conclusive proof as to the condition of the spawn at issue because the two portions of spawn were kept in separate facilities,it does carry some weight in that all the spawn were stored under similar conditions.peterson testified that the on and off the refrigerated for the entire summer and never removed from the coolers.further more,the cooler in which the spawn at issue were stored had a backup generator in case of power outage.peterson visited the facilities where the spawn were stored every three to four days.
peterson assertion that he maintained the spawn at a proper temperature during the summer was corroborated to some degree by forbito testimony that when he received the spawn,the temperature inside the boxes was degrees and by evidence that the temperature was at degrees when the truck reached chicago.as testa testified,once spawn is exposed to heat,an attempt to the spawn will not be successful.therefore,the fact that the boxes were at degrees on the day they were tendered to ffe and on the day they reached chicago tends to show that the spawn previously had been stored at the proper temperature and were in good condition when tendered to ffe.
in addition,peterson personally examined one of the bags of spawn before it was loaded onto ffe trailer.there was no characteristic odor of spawn fermentation nor did the bag have a yellowish tint which signifies damaged spawn.peterson testimony that the bag contained good product was direct evidence only as to the condition of the spawn in that particular bag,but was circumstantial evidence of the spawn condition in the other bags,as the bags had all been stored and loaded together.ffe asserts that there was insufficient proof that the spawn were in good condition in light of the fact that forbito took exception to all four hundred boxes on the bill of lading and testified that the bottom two layers of boxes on every pallet were crushed,torn or open.peterson testified,however,that he looked through the cracks where the boxes were torn and did not see any ripped bags.in addition,peterson testified that even if boxes were torn,it was still possible for the spawn to remain undamaged.in fact,when peterson initially received the june shipment from beta spawn,he successfully used spawn which had arrived in torn boxes to grow his first crop of mushrooms.
thus,considering all the evidence presented to the district court,we hold that the court did not err in finding that beta spawn met its burden of proof that the spawn were delivered to ffe in good condition.
applicability of ffe tariff 
once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case under the carmack amendment,the burden shifts to the carrier to prove that it was free from negligence and that the damage was caused solely by a the act of god b the public enemy c the act of the shipper himself d public authority e or the inherent vice or nature of the goods.missouri pacific elmore stahl,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found that no such proof was offered at trial.ffe does not directly challenge that finding,but in an apparent attempt to rebutt beta spawn prima facie case and to recover its freight charges,argues that its tariff regulated the temperature at which the trailer was to be maintained.see city of new orleans scrap material,a tariff confers rights and imposes duties as a matter of law.carriers,shippers,and consignees are bound by the provisions of a tariff duly filed by the carrier.citations omitted.
according to the record,ffe publishes a tariff that sets regulations for,inter alia,goods that are shipped with protective services.section c of the tariff provides that an ltl shipment,shipped cooler and so stated on the bill of lading by the shipper,must be maintained at an air temperature of between and degrees.the temperature inside the boxe
