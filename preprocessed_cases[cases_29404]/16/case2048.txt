jatinder sabhlok,defendant and,appeals from the entry of a declaratory judgment in favor of his former employer,plaintiff and the kellogg company.the district court found,on for summary judgment,that the separation agreement and release of claims form and the subsequent amendment thereto unambiguously released and barred the breach of contract and age discrimination claims that sabhlok threatened to bring against kellogg.kellogg from the district court further finding that sabhlok was not liable under the terms of the agreements for attorney fees and costs that kellogg incurred in this litigation.after review of the record and the arguments presented on appeal,we affirm the district court in all respects.
when jatinder sabhlok was hired by kellogg in,he had years of experience with major food and beverage manufacturers and retailers ten years in international markets.over the next four years,sabhlok received favorable performance reviews and was promoted three times by three different supervisors.sabhlok was of the international research and development group and the business partner for the territory when he learned in july that kellogg planned to restructure his group at the end of september.the group was disbanded,more than employees were moved to other positions,and several sabhlok were eliminated.sabhlok turned years old in september.
sometime between july and september,kellogg asked sabhlok to extend his employment for a period to assist in decentralizing research and development and establishing laboratories in asia and australia.according to sabhlok,he was induced to stay by oral assurances from his supervisor,donna both before and after the reduction in force was finalized on september,a permanent position would be found for him at kellogg.
kellogg offered the affected employees a standard or an enhanced severance package,but the latter required that the employee accept the terms of the separation agreement and release of claims form.sabhlok executed the separation agreement on november,and continued to work through september,
during the retention period,sabhlok spent nearly of his working time traveling to asia and australia.several permanent positions became available during that year,and sabhlok asked to be considered for each of them.despite repeated assurances that a permanent position would be found,sabhlok was not selected for any of the openings.in fact,sabhlok alleged that kellogg selected a younger,less qualified employee over him in each case.on one occasion,sabhlok was even told that he did not get the position because as you can see we are bringing up the younger people.
after the retention period expired and sabhlok employment ended,sabhlok and kellogg executed the amendment of separation agreement and release of claims form.sabhlok contends that by this time,kellogg had reconstituted the r d group,returned all but three employees from other positions,and selected a younger,less qualified employee to be its director.the amendment,signed by sabhlok on october,included an agreement that sabhlok would abide by a broad noncompete clause and that kellogg would provide sabhlok with an additional six weeks of severance pay and a bonus for the year.
beginning in early,sabhlok,through counsel,wrote to kellogg threatening to sue.kellogg chose to preempt the suit and filed this declaratory judgment action on september.sabhlok filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking declaration that the separation agreement and amendment did not release,waive,or discharge claims for breach of contract or age discrimination that arose after september.no discovery was conducted,and the parties filed for summary judgment in reliance on the pleadings and written agreements.for the reasons set forth in its opinion of september,the district court granted kellogg and denied sabhlok motions for summary judgment denied kellogg request for attorney fees and costs and entered judgment in favor of kellogg declaring that sabhlok proposed claims were barred by the separation agreement and amendment.judgment was entered accordingly,and these appeals followed.
summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.our review of the district court decision in this case is de novo.johnson karnes,cir see also mcmullen meijer,cir when denial of summary judgment is based on legal grounds,review is de novo.
there is no dispute that michigan law governs the interpretation of the settlement agreement and amendment.the district court succinctly summarized the applicable law as follows 
the scope of a release is controlled by the language of the release.adair state,citing batshon contractors.if the language of the release is unambiguous,it must be construed as written.id.a contract is ambiguous only if its language is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.cole ladbroke racing michigan,citing rinke automotive moulding.the fact that the parties dispute the meaning of a release does not,in itself,establish an ambiguity.id.at,citing gortney norfolk western.when a release is challenged,the party seeking to avoid the release must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the release should be set aside.binard carrington.
