this appeal concerns the interpretation of a contingency fee contract under texas law.the appellant claims that the district court erred in entering judgment for the appellees on its breach of contract claims,conspiracy claim,and claim for recovery in quantum meruit.
background 
appellant leasehold expense recovery,ler is in the business of reviewing retail leases for overcharges.appellees mothers work,and mothers work collectively mothers sell maternity clothing from retail stores operating from shopping malls throughout the country.on march,ler entered into a contingent fee contract the contract with a pea in the pod apip,which thereafter merged with mothers,who assumed apip rights and responsibilities under the contract.under the contract drafted by ler,ler agreed to review of apip leases with shopping malls to determine whether landlords were overcharging for rent and operating expenses.the contract authorized ler to negotiate and collect upon a settlement regarding overcharges with each landlord,within certain limitations,and described the terms of ler compensation.the contract also included a provision regarding termination.
in,ler reviewed leases and found more than in potential overcharges.mothers eventually authorized ler to proceed with thirteen of the audits.from to,ler contacted landlords and attempted to recoup alleged overcharges on behalf of mothers.however,all thirteen of the landlords refused to deal with ler without an authorization letter from mothers.ler maintains that although mothers repeatedly promised that such authorizations would be forthcoming,they were never provided.ler believes that mothers used the knowledge of past overcharges to negotiate new,more favorable leases with its landlords on its own.mothers refused to pay ler for its work,on the grounds that ler was not entitled to compensation under the terms of the contract.
on january,ler sued mothers in texas state court for breach of contract,fraud,negligence,grossly negligent misrepresentation,and conspiracy.mothers removed the claim to federal court,which has diversity jurisdiction.mothers moved for summary judgment as to all of ler causes of action.the magistrate judge prepared a report and order on april,recommending that the motion be granted in part and denied in part.the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be denied only with respect to ler breach of contract claims concerning three stores.on july,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendations in full.on august,the district court rejected ler motion to reconsider the july,order.following a short bench trial on ler remaining claims,the district court awarded mothers judgment as a matter of law,save a award concerning an amount that was uncontested.

under the contract,is ler entitled to compensation for overcharges discovered,but not recovered 
substantive claim 
ler contends that,by the plain terms of the contract,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to mothers regarding eighteen stores,and judgment as a matter of law following a bench trial regarding three stores,with respect to overpaid charges that it discovered regarding all of the stores.ler contends that the plain terms of the contract entitle it to compensation for discovered overcharges,regardless of whether mothers actually recovered any of the overpayments.mothers responds that the district court properly held that the contract unambiguously assigns ler a interest only in those overpaid charges that are actually recovered.two sections of the contract are particularly relevant to this dispute 
article,section,fees.in consideration of the services rendered and to be rendered to the client by ler,the client does hereby assign,transfer and convey to ler as compensation herein,a fifty percent undivided interest in all overpaid charges relating to each and every lease,including any other amounts recovered relating thereto,that 
a are actually recovered in cash,check or the like by client 
b are recovered in the form of a credit to client account with any landlord pursuant to any lease and,
c are otherwise recovered by client.
all compensation herein as stated in sections a through c shall herein together constitute ler fees.ler fees shall be paid to ler by client within ten days of client receipt of overpaid charges on any lease,or the credit thereof.
article,section,termination.ler or client may terminate this agreement upon fifteen days prior written notice by delivering said notice to client.said termination shall not affect the right of ler to collect ler fees for any overpaid charges either discovered or recovered as of the date of termination of this agreement.under all circumstances ler right to collect ler fees shall survive the expiration or termination of this agreement.
the terms of the contract unambiguously entitle ler to compensation only for those overpayments discovered by ler that mothers actually recovers.while article,section hereinafter compensation provision states that ler is entitled to a fifty percent interest in all overpaid charges,that right is subject to the satisfaction of subsections a,b,or c,each of which require the charges to be recovered.we find without merit ler contention that the three subsections were intended to relate solely to the phrase including any other amounts recovered relating thereto,particularly given the placement of a comma inserted by ler itself,as the drafter,following the word thereto.the presence of the comma indicates that both the phrase including any other amounts recovered relating thereto and the earlier phrase all overpaid charges relating to each and every lease are subject to the condition of recovery noted in subsections a,b and c.
nor does article ii,section hereinafter termination provision,support ler argument that it is entitled to compensation for charges that mothers has not recovered.the termination provision was clearly intended to preserve ler right to compensation as described in the compensation provision,as reflected by its use of the term ler fees.the compensation provision unambiguously requires that mothers actually recover on the discovered overpayments.by implication,the parties intended the termination provision to protect ler right to compensation upon termination to the same degree.the phrase discovered or recovered in the termination provision was merely intended to protect ler entitlement to compensation for overpaid charges that it discovered before termination,but were not recovered until after termination.ler proposed interpretation of the termination provision,which would entitle it to compensation upon termination for overcharges merely discovered or recovered,is not only contrary to the plain meaning of the contract,but would create a perverse incentive for ler to prematurely terminate the contract in order to avoid the recovery requirement under the compensation provision.the district court properly granted mothers judgment on this issue 
procedural claim 
ler contends that the district court decision to enter summary judgment on its breach of contract claims regarding eighteen stores was based on improperly considered evidence.the magistrate judge struck the appendix that mothers attached to its reply brief to ler response to mothers motion for summary judgment as an impermissible attempt to introduce new evidence at the reply stage.the magistrate judge also struck the declaration of eric stahl for failure to include a date,as required by.ler argues that the district court improperly relied upon this excluded evidence in granting summary judgment for mothers.
ler assertion is groundless.following the district court grant of summary judgment,ler,by motion,asked the district court to reconsider its judgment on the grounds that the district court had improperly taken into account the excluded evidence.judge solis,in denying the motion,stated that his decision did not implicitly or explicitly rely upon the excluded appendix or affidavit,and reemphasized that with or without the excluded evidence,ler failed to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact that any savings on the stores in question met the criteria for recovery set out in the contract.given this unequivocal denial and the ample support in the record for his conclusion in the absence of the excluded evidence,we see no reason to further question judge solis ability to properly consider evidence.
under the contract,is ler entitled to compensation for future savings 
ler argued at trial that it was entitled under the contract to be compensated for prospective overcharges that its efforts enabled mothers to avoid in relation to three of its stores.ler argument is premised upon a portion of the compensation provision,specifically article,section c,which entitles ler to a fifty percent interest in all overpaid charges relating to each and every lease,including any other amounts recovered relating thereto,that c are otherwise recovered by client.ler contends that this language can reasonably be interpreted as entitling ler to compensation for future overcharges that its efforts prevented.ler contends that the district court determination that the contract unambiguously did not provide for compensation for such savings was erroneous,and parol evidence should not have been permitted to clear up the ambiguity in the contract.
mothers argued,and the district court agreed,that the compensation provision entitles ler to recover only when two things occur mothers actually overpaid a charge to the landlord and the overpaid charge was recovered.we agree that this the only reasonable interpretation of the contract.
a contract is ambiguous only when the application of the applicable rules of interpretation to the instrument leave it genuinely uncertain which one of the two meanings is the proper meaning.r p enterprises laguarta,gavrel kirk.while ler concedes that the phrase overpaid charges does not encompass future savings on rent or other charges,it contends that future savings are nonetheless recoverable as other amounts relating thereto.such an interpretation,however,ignores the requirement of subsections a,b,and c,all of which require other amounts to be recovered.a landlord decision to charge mothers the proper amount of rent in the future does not constitute a recovery for prior overcharges paid.if a landlord were to give mothers a discount on the proper amount of rent,or provide free utilities for a year as repayment for the prior overcharges,this would constitute a recovery,and ler would be entitled to of the value of the discount.
the contract simply does not contemplate the situation where mothers may be unable to recover past overpayments,but benefits from ler work nonetheless in the sense that it does not overpay in the future.the failure to include more express language of the parties intent does not create an ambiguity when only one reasonable interpretation exists.columbia gas transmission new ulm gas.nor is parol evidence of the parties intent permitted to create an ambiguity.constitution state ins,cir.read as a whole,the compensation provision clearly entitles ler to compensation only for charges that mothers overpaid and actually recovered.this is the only reasonable interpretation of the contract,as the district court correctly found.
c.did mothers breach the contract by settling overcharges with the landlords without the knowledge of ler 
ler contends that with respect to eight store locations where overcharges were discovered,mothers engaged in secret side deals with each landlord by executing lease amendments by which it recovered the overcharges in the form of credits and lower future rents.ler alleges that mothers engaged in these quid pro quo settlements in explicit violation of article i,section which bars settlements in the absence of ler consent,in an attempt to avoid compensating ler under the contract.
mothers does not dispute that if it had entered into the settlements alleged by ler,it would indeed have breached the contract.however,it contends,and we agree,that in order to prove that a lease amendment was executed as a form of quid pro quo transaction,ler needs to demonstrate two things that the new lease terms were more favorable to mothers than the previous terms and that the new,more favorable terms were obtained in exchange for the release of an overcharge claim.in other words,ler,to prevail on any one of its eight quid pro quo claims,needs demonstrate that mothers successfully used knowledge of overcharges,obtained as a result of ler efforts,as leverage to negotiate improved lease terms with a landlord.
ler evidence on appeal suffers from the same defect as that noted by the magistrate judge 
with respect to most of these leases,ler has done nothing more than include the amendments in its appendix.there is no evidence that the terms of the amendments are more favorable to mothers work than those of the prior leases.the court is neither required nor inclined to come sic through ler page appendix in search of evidence to support these claims.
though equally disinclined to comb through the disorganized and ill explained documents provided by ler,a thorough review of the record reveals that the evidence submitted regarding the stores located in beverly hills,california,pasadena,california,palo alto,california,dallas,texas,buffalo,new york,and syracuse,new york,do not create an issue of material fact regarding whether the amended terms are more favorable to mothers than those that preceded them.we are simply not provided with any standard of comparison that would allow us to determine that the above mentioned leases were either modified or terminated to mothers benefit.
moreover,we are unable to link any benefits that mothers may have gained through modifications or terminations to any of the leases to a promise on the part of mothers to relinquish an overcharge claim discovered by ler.ler bald assertion that mothers must have used overcharge information gleaned from ler reviews as leverage to obtain better lease terms is insufficient to withstand judgment as a matter of law.the district court therefore correctly granted mothers summary judgment on ler quid pro quo claims.
d.did mothers have an implied duty to cooperate under the contract 
next,ler contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its claim that mothers violated an implied duty in the contract to cooperate.specifically,ler asserts that after it made initial contact with thirteen landlords,pursuant to mothers approval,these landlords refused to negotia
