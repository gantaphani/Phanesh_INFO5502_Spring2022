north american catholic educational programming foundation,north american appeals from the district court judgment the judgment dismissed its fourth stemming from its failed business relationship with clearwire holdings,clearwire for lack of personal jurisdiction.north american is a nonprofit organization,incorporated and having its principal place of business in rhode island,whose mission is to provide educational and religious programming.
we take the facts primarily from the complaint.clearwire was formed in the as a company aiming to develop a national wireless data network providing internet access.it was principally financed by the investment bank goldman sachs,which initially controlled most of its voting stock.clearwire in turn controlled a number of other entities that were expected to manage and operate the wireless data network that clearwire aimed to develop starting in or around the year.
at that time,the cellular telephone network could not handle the data transmitted by internet users.for this purpose,carriers like sprint and worldcom were seeking to use spectrum,thought to be especially suitable,already allocated for use in the instruction television fixed service itfs licenses for itfs spectrum were held predominantly by educational entities,including north american.in march,north american joined with two other holders of itfs spectrum licenses to form the itfs spectrum development alliance the alliance to develop this opportunity.
as existing short term leases already granted by alliance members to third parties expired,the alliance members proposed to license their spectrum for use in a wireless data network but they also aimed to own an equity interest in the new network.the alliance began negotiations with goldman sachs,represented by gerry cardinale and rob gheewalla,later joined by jack daly.all three men were employed by affiliates of goldman sachs,reside in new york and later served as directors of clearwire.
on june,cardinale sent a memorandum,addressed to the alliance and the heads of its three members,on behalf of what he termed the goldman sachs team,setting out a proposal to use alliance spectrum,allow the alliance to retain an equity interest in the network and provide an cash payment.later in the year,goldman affiliate gs capital partners iii sent a term sheet to the alliance members outlining the terms of an agreement in principle,and a master agreement was signed by the alliance members and clearwire in march.
under the master agreement,alliance members would,as their existing leases expired,lease their spectrum to clearwire and the goldman sachs entities agreed to invest million in clearwire.in addition,cardinale,daly and gheewalla were appointed to clearwire board where,under the agreement,goldman sachs representatives could cast a vote.the alliance members obtained in turn an initial small stake in clearwire.
in june,worldcom collapsed,which threatened to free up a large amount of spectrum.soon after,clearwire began to negotiate with members of the alliance,seeking to be relieved of its obligations to use alliance spectrum.the negotiations initially proved fruitless,and on september,clearwire board passed a resolution saying that it would breach the master agreement by failing to make promised payments to alliance members.
on february,clearwire board discussed a reorganization plan which,north american alleges,would have eradicated alliance members claims against clearwire.the other two alliance partners then settled their claims against clearwire in exchange for reduced payments.north american says that during this time,daly,apparently acting on behalf of clearwire,met with north american president to discuss a possible settlement,but that north american refused.
all the while,clearwire financial position was growing more perilous as it spent money developing its network but lacked any meaningful source of revenue.in may,clearwire told its shareholders that it was running out of capital and,during the summer,it made an offer of preferred stock to its shareholders to obtain bridge financing,saying that it was negotiating either for more financing or a sale of the company.north american did not acquire more stock.in november,clearwire effectively sold itself to another company,headed by noted telecom investor craig mccaw,on terms benefitting those shareholders who had bought additional preferred stock to supply bridge financing.
since that time,north american has brought a succession of law suits against the various parties involved in its relationship with clearwire.first,north american sued clearwire itself in delaware superior court,claiming breaches of the master agreement,but north american withdrew the action early in.am.catholic educ.programming,clearwire holdings,rrc.
then,north american brought another suit in delaware superior court against cardinale,gheewalla and daly,asserting various counts of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty after being withdrawn and then in delaware chancery court,the complaint was dismissed,the fiduciary duty claim on substantive grounds and the others for lack of personal jurisdiction and the dismissal was affirmed on appeal.am.catholic educ.programming,gheewalla.
finally,on november,north american filed the present action in the federal district court in rhode island,again asserting wrongful conduct related to the master agreement and the bridge financing.the individual defendants were again cardinale,gheewalla and daly also named as defendants were goldman sachs group,gs group,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york,and various affiliated entities 
defendants moved to dismiss the suit under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction,under rule b on statute of limitations grounds and under rule b for failure to state a claim.the district court dismissed the case on the first ground and north american has now appealed.the appellees defend the district court judgment but urge,in the alternative,other defects with the suit including failure to state a claim.the issues raised on appeal are primarily questions of law which we review de novo.
the central basis urged by north american for personal jurisdiction rests,as explained more fully below,upon specific rather than general jurisdiction.thus,to affirm on the ground adopted by the district court,we would have to determine separately potential jurisdiction not only as to each defendant but also separately for each such entity under each count of the complaint.phillips exeter acad.howard phillips fund,cir.
however,where an appeal presents a difficult jurisdictional issue,yet the substantive merits underlying the issue are facilely resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction,the jurisdictional inquiry may be avoided.kotler am.tobacco,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.here,we first sweep away the hopeless claims and then focus on personal jurisdiction only as to what remains.so examined,the complaint is fatally insufficient save as to one pair of related allegations that form only part of the final four counts.
the sufficiency of the claims stated is properly before us.the defendants brief in this court argued that the dismissal should,in the alternative,be upheld under rule b.north american has declined to respond to this alternative argument in its reply brief,saying that the district court did not resolve the issue under rule b instead,north american refers us to its opposition to the rule b motion below and asks to file a further brief if we propose to address the issue.
an appellee may defend the judgment below on any valid ground,mcguire reilly,cir,cert.denied,d,so it does not matter that the district court did not need to decide the rule b objection.nor is a cross reference to a brief filed below an adequate response and forfeiture by north american could be urged.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.yet,north american district court opposition is readily available,and we address its position on the merits 
north american might have argued but has not that the rule b objection,if sustained,is not exactly an alternative ground because a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is ordinarily without prejudice.but no practical difference may be present here if the personal jurisdiction dismissal were upheld,the statute of limitations would arguably preclude a new filing in new the sole venue where personal jurisdiction could readily be secured over defendants.
turning then to count i,it purportedly asserts a claim for fraudulent inducement,allowable under rhode island law,guzman cleaning,but it fails on its face to meet the requirement that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b.rule b heightened pleading standard applies to state law fraud claims asserted in federal court.universal commc,lycos,cir.
rule b requires not only specifying the false statements and by whom they were made but also identifying the basis for inferring scienter.although the rule itself is not pellucid,precedent in this circuit,as in a number of others,is clear 
the courts have uniformly held inadequate a complaint general averment of the defendant knowledge of material falsity,unless the complaint also sets forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading.
greenstone cambex,cir breyer,citations omitted,superseded by statute on other grounds,private securities litigation reform act of,stat.see also romani shearson lehman hutton,cir,similarly superceded by statute on other grounds.
north american provides no information in the complaint to suggest that the defendants feigned their original expressed intention to use the alliance spectrum.the complaint says that goldman sachs never intended to follow its business plan but the assertion is not itself supported with particulars that suggest scienter and so just pushes the pleading deficiency back one stage no particulars are pleaded which would suggest the elements of fraud in the inducement.
count ii is also a fraud claim,and so also subject to rule b particularity requirement,but is a jumble of different claims the count says that the defendants fraudulently induced north american to continue its business that they misused clearwire assets and that they engaged in self dealing.nothing in the count remotely describes facts from which an inference of fraudulent intent may be drawn.a search of the rest of the complaint,cross referenced generally by the count,similarly fails to fill the deficiency.
counts iii and iv of the complaint allege that the defendants tortiously interfered with prospective business opportunities of north american.rhode island law recognizes a roughly similar tort,mesolella providence,and arguably rule b does not apply except so far as fraud is specifically alleged as an ingredient of the claim.but each of the elements of the claim still has to be adequately alleged.glassman computervision,cir.they are 
the existence of a business relationship or expectancy,knowledge by the interferor of the relationship or expectancy,an intentional act of interference,proof that the interference caused the harm sustained,and damages to the plaintiff.
mesolella,at.
count iii claims that clearwire asserted rights to use north american spectrum during a period when it could have been offered by north american to others and so interfered with north american prospective business opportunities.even assuming that clearwire assertion of rights was unjustified,there are no facts even specific show that defendants were aware of north american desire at that time to dispose of the rights to third parties or possessed the scienter needed to establish intentionality under mesolella.
count iv is also framed as an interference count but explicitly asserts fraudulent conduct and misrepresentations.it says that the defendants falsely represented to north american two alliance partners that clearwire faced imminent bankruptcy,thereby fragmenting the alliance by forcing the other two members to settle.the count alleges that this reduced the alliance leverage in the market and interfered with north american ability to acquire additional spectrum in the market,which it was ready,willing and able to do.
this looks primarily like a claim suitable,if at all,to the other two members.in all events,given that fraudulent misrepresentation is the lynchpin,this claim too triggers rule b.rodi new.eng.sch.of law,cir.no basis is suggested for believing that if made,the predictions of imminent collapse were knowingly false when made.nor is it alleged that the defendants were aware of any effort or of any desire by north american to acquire additional spectrum.
north american says that rhode island does not require proof of a prospective business opportunity at the pleading stage of a tortious interference claim but federal law governs the specificity requirements for pleadings in federal courts even in diversity actions.universal commc,at.the defects in this instance are not ones of proof but of pleading facts that,if true,would satisfy the specific elements of a claim as defined by state law.thus count iv also fails.
the remaining through to focus upon clearwire offer in to let existing shareholders acquire preferred shares in aid of bridge financing.north american did not take up the opportunity,and it says so far as we can tell that this was because defendants failed to reveal that clearwire was well along in negotiating a sale of assets to mccaw.further,it is suggested that some defendants or those connected to them did acquire such shares.
we say appear and so far as we can tell because several of the last four counts are vague and each purports to incorporate all prior paragraphs of description.however,each count concerns the bridge financing,and the use of four counts reflects the different legal theories offered to create liability based on the underlying events breach of a fiduciary duty of loyalty and care count v and of disclosure vi,unjust enrichment vii and fraud and misrepresentation viii 
rule b pertains to these allegations.rule b applies most clearly to the claim of fraud in count viii and its use in count vii so far as the tort underpinning the claim is fraud one might think that negligent misrepresentation and fiduciary duty were not on their face subject to rule b,but the case law here and in other circuits reads rule b expansively to cover associated claims where the core allegations effectively charge fraud 
the ascertainable core of the four counts,we think,is the prospect of a sale to the mccaw group.the complaint itself alleges that by spring clearwire was hemorrhaging cash and trying hard to raise new funds.so,if clearwire were on the edge of completing a deal with mccaw,then one might argue that there was a duty to disclose more least a duty of management insiders not to increase their own stake in clearwire based on knowledge not shared with other stockholders.
the latter one of more plausible because both case law and common sense cabin a company obligation to disclose ongoing negotiations that have not yet led to an agreement and might easily fail.bershad,citing cases.apart from the risks of prejudicing negotiations,disclosure could itself be the basis for claims by stock purchasers if the trumpeted negotiations eventually failed some cases even purport to establish per se rules against such disclosure claims based merely on negotiations 
north american does not allege that in august clearwire had reached an agreement with mccaw,and it appears that no such agreement was reached until november.so there is no obvious inference that in august a deal with mccaw was on the edge of completion.further,the august letter offering rights in preferred shares did disclose that clearwire was in discussion with unnamed others about the possible sale of the company or its assets,and the letter offered to supply more information on request.
admittedly,north american may not know even how far discussions with mccaw had gone and the defendants brief sheds no light on the matter.but rule b is intended to set a higher than normal threshold of specificity in factual allegations before the discovery machinery can be set in motion,doyle hasbro,cir
