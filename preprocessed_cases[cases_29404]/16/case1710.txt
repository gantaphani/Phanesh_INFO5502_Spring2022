bonneville power administration bpa appeals the district court affirmance of two orders entered by the bankruptcy court.debtor mirant corporation and related entities filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,triggering a dispute between the parties regarding the ability of bpa to terminate an executory contract for the future purchase of electric power.on the one hand,the bankruptcy code automatic stay,effective upon the filing of a chapter petition,precludes any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the estate.see a.on the other hand,in an executory contract related to the future call of energy purchase by bpa,see generally,the parties agreed to an ipso facto clause that provided for default and a termination payment in the event of a bankruptcy filing,see e bpa argues that the bankruptcy code or the code permits it to terminate the executory contract pursuant to the contract ipso facto clause.see e a.the parties now dispute the priority of the two chapter provisions the automatic stay and the termination arguably permitted by the combined effect of the ipso facto clause and e a.
this appeal requires us to address the intersection of three relevant statutory provisions a the automatic bankruptcy stay e a permitting a nondebtor party to an executory contract to terminate or modify such contract when applicable law excuses the nondebtor from accepting or rendering performance to the trustee or an assignee and the act or the act,prohibiting transfer of contracts to which the united states is a party.
concluding that the bankruptcy stay precedes any termination permitted by either the act or the agreement of the parties,we affirm the district court order declaring bpa to have violated the automatic stay.finding no abuse of discretion in the court determination that cause was not shown where the act is not an applicable law under e a,we affirm also the denial of bpa motion to lift or modify the stay.
background 
factual background 
mirant corporation is an international energy company that produces and sells electricity in the united states and abroad.appellee mirant americas energy marketing,mirant is a subsidiary of mirant corporation and engages in asset risk management,including commodities,energy,and financial product trading.mirant is responsible for procuring fuel and selling power for mirant corporation operating facilities.
bpa is a federal power marketing agency within the united states department of energy.bpa was created in by congress to market hydroelectric power generated by a series of federal dams along the columbia river in the pacific northwest.see generally bonneville project act of.originally,bpa marketed the energy produced for the benefit of the public,particularly domestic and rural customers,giving preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives.see a.for some time,surplus in energy production meant bpa could market freely to all who desired to purchase in the area.in,increasing demands upon the supply triggered,in part,congress enactment of the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act,which required bpa to offer new contracts to its customers.see aluminum of am.cent.lincoln people util,d.thereafter,bpa was authorized to acquire additional resources in order to increase the supply of federal power.see a.accordingly,bpa entered certain contracts related to the marketing of federal power.see f.
bpa and mirant are parties to the western systems power pool agreement the wsppa,a contract the parties agree is standard for electric power sales.the wsppa is an umbrella agreement governing electric power transactions.subject to the wsppa,bpa and mirant predecessor in interest southern company energy marketing,entered two agreements the agreement to enable future purchases,sales,and exchanges of power and other services the enabling agreement and an option contract though which bpa purchased a call option for the future purchase of a set amount of firm power from mirant over a period commencing in the confirmation agreement.
together,the wsppa,the enabling agreement,and the confirmation agreement collectively,the agreement form the sum of the parties contractual rights and obligations under the terms of the agreement,bpa owed no obligation to exercise its option,and if it did not do so,the option expired on the strike date provided,december.the parties agree,and the lower courts noted,that bpa did not exercise and,in practical terms,would not have exercised its option because the option price bargained for in the agreement exceeded the market price of energy during the relevant period of the agreement.
the agreement includes a default provision,or ipso facto clause,that authorizes bpa to terminate the contract and claim liquidated damages if mirant petitioned for bankruptcy before the option period expired.the agreement provides that default by the institution of a bankruptcy proceeding triggers the party right to terminate all transactions between the parties under this agreement upon written notice and the party right to a termination payment.upon termination,the party may liquidate all transactions with the debtor and demand a termination payment equal to the cost of replacing the option contract the agreement also provides that all transactions under the agreement are forward contracts and that the parties are forward contract merchants as defined by the bankruptcy code.see.
on july,bpa wrote to mirant requesting,pursuant to the agreement,adequate assurances of mirant ability to perform.mirant responded by letter on july,stating its willingness to wire assurance but disputing the reasonable estimate of the amount of assurance.on july,mirant wired to bpa as adequate assurance of its ability to perform.
procedural background 
on july,mirant corporation and of its direct and indirect subsidiaries,including mirant,filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions.that day,the court held a hearing and entered an interim order authorizing the debtors to comply with the terms of prepetition trading contracts and to enter into postpetition trading contracts in the normal course of business and setting a final hearing for the entry of a final order of authorization.the bankruptcy court also approved the joint administration of the debtors cases 
under the code,mirant as a debtor remains in possession of its estate.see mirant continues to conduct its business in the ordinary course.on july,the bankruptcy court ordered the parties,specifically including all governmental units,to comply with the code automatic stay provision,and its provision regarding executory contracts and unexpired leases,the order to comply the order to comply enjoined bpa from multiple acts affecting mirant or the debtor estate,including interference in any way with any and all of the property of any of the debtors.the order to comply expressed that it had no effect upon any exceptions to the automatic stay,based upon any section of the bankruptcy code,or upon the right of any party to seek relief from the automatic stay according to d.
bpa terminated its confirmation agreement with mirant shortly thereafter,and mirant characterizes this termination as a violation of the bankruptcy court order and stay.on july,bpa notified mirant in writing that the chapter petition constituted default under the parties agreement and that accordingly,bpa terminated all transactions with mirant.bpa stated that under the terms of the agreement,both parties were forward contract merchants and that the agreement was a forward contract for purposes of.bpa also demanded a termination payment from mirant under the agreement of and set forth terms for the payment of that amount in light of the assurance mirant had already provided and the amount bpa yet owed mirant under the agreement.bpa requested payment of the remaining amount allegedly owed by mirant,within three days of receipt of the july letter 
in response to bpa termination letter and termination payment demand,mirant wrote to bpa on august,challenging bpa status as a forward contract merchant under the code,describing bpa purported termination of the agreement as a violation of and of chapter,and demanding that bpa immediately withdraw its purported termination of the agreement and perform.bpa later responded by letter,notifying mirant of bpa refusal to withdraw the termination letter.
on august,the bankruptcy court entered its final authorization order to debtors,permitting compliance with prepetition trading contracts and entrance into trading contracts in the ordinary course of business,providing credit support for trading contracts,and authorizing assumption of prepetition trading contracts.this final authorization order contemplated the possible future event of a creditor,such as bpa,demanding acceptance or rejection of a trading option contract.
before the bankruptcy court,on october,mirant filed a motion to enforce the automatic stay and for contempt,arguing that the transmission of bpa july termination letter violated the automatic stay,a,because the act constituted an attempt to obtain possession of property of the estate and to exercise control over the estate and that bpa,as an entity of a government agency,can not be a forward contract merchant under the code definition the motion to enforce.bpa responded that under the code,it was a forward contract merchant and that the act,bars any assignment of the agreement,thus permitting bpa termination of the agreement consistent with e a.the bankruptcy court heard argument on november,ruled that bpa had violated the stay,and offered bpa an option either to rescind its termination or to return for a continued hearing on the motion for contempt related to that violation 
on november,the court entered an order,to which the parties had agreed in the interim,declaring that bpa had violated the automatic stay,denying the relief sought by bpa,ordering bpa to rescind its termination of the confirmation agreement,and returning the parties to the status quo that existed immediately prior to the delivery of the termination letter the stay violation order bpa appealed the stay violation order to the district court.during this period,other creditors,aside from bpa,filed motions for modification of the stay and motions to require mirant assumption and assignment or rejection of various trading contracts,and they received bankruptcy court rulings on those motions.
on december,bpa filed a motion to modify the automatic stay retroactively to permit termination of the confirmation agreement the motion to modify stay.at that time,the option of the confirmation agreement was soon to expire on december.the bankruptcy court held a december hearing on the motion and responses,and the court subsequently denied the motion to modify stay.in its memorandum opinion,the bankruptcy court cited the ninth circuit in holding that the stay applies to prevent unilateral termination even if a contract is unassumable and contains a valid ipso facto clause and the stay must be modified before the ipso facto clause may be invoked.see computer commc ns,codex in re computer commc ns,cir collier on bankruptcy f ed.the bankruptcy court clarified that its refusal to modify the stay stemmed from bpa failure to make a sufficient showing of cause as required by d.bpa could not,according to the court holding,show cause in the absence of mirant default and even if the ipso facto clause could be enforced to trigger default,bpa failed to demonstrate cause for relief where bpa would suffer no harm by the continued enforcement of the stay.
bpa appealed the order denying the motion to modify stay,and the district court consolidated bpa appeals of the two bankruptcy court orders.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court stay violation order and denial of bpa motion to modify stay on august.bpa timely appealed to this court.

b.the parties arguments 
the parties agree that the confirmation agreement here is an executory contract under the bankruptcy code and that therefore the code provision for executory contracts applies.see generally,e of the code bars the enforcement of ipso facto clauses in executory contracts,such as the ipso facto clause in the agreement here.e however,an exception to this general rule appears in subsection e a,
paragraph of this subsection does not apply to an executory contract,if 
a i applicable law excuses a party,other than the debtor,to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to the trustee or to an assignee of such contract or lease,whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties and 
ii such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment 
e a emphasis added.
bpa argues that the subsection e a exception applies to this case,permitting the agreement ipso facto clause to have effect,terminating the agreement as of mirant chapter filing,and precluding any review by the bankruptcy court.according to bpa,the exception applies because the act is an applicable law under the text of e a that excuses bpa from accepting performance from or rendering performance to the trustee or to an assignee of the agreement.e a.
the act provides,
no contract or order,or any interest therein,shall be transferred by the party to whom such contract or order is given to any other party,and any such transfer shall cause the annulment of the contract or order transferred,so far as the united states is concerned.
bpa explains the act application to this agreement as follows.bpa argues that e a carves out a class of executory contracts whose ipso facto clauses may be given effect when nonbankruptcy,applicable law renders the contract unassignable in the abstract as opposed to upon a factual showing to the trustee or an assignee without consent of the nondebtor party.this agreement is such an executory contract,according to bpa,because the act excuses the united states from accepting performance from an assignee.in this vein,bpa asks this court to join other circuits that have held that e a creates a hypothetical test,under which a debtor is precluded from assuming or assigning an executory contract even if the applicable law would not bar assignment in the actual circumstances before the court but does bar assignment to a hypothetical third party,under the applicable law,could the government refuse performance from an assignee.see in re west,cir see also perlman catapult entm t,in re catapult entm t,cir 
bpa asks this court to hold that under a hypothetical test,e permits automatic termination of the agreement prior to judicial review and prior to the entry of automatic stay,or in the alternative,that e requires a bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay in order for the ipso facto clause to be enforced.accordingly,bpa challenges both the bankruptcy court entry of automatic stay and denial of a modification to the stay because the ipso facto clause and the act permit bpa to terminate the agreement automatically upon mirant chapter filing prior to any review by or approval of the bankruptcy court under e a.
mirant responds that the automatic stay provision,a,is violated by bpa termination of the agreement,that is,bpa attempt to exercise control of property of the estate without the oversight of the bankruptcy court.mirant argues the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in entering the stay because the stay is automatic and either the act does not apply because there was no transfer or,even if the act does apply,the stay automatic entry precedes any termination permitted by the combined effect of the act,e a,and the ipso facto clause of the agreement.mirant also argues the bankruptcy court did not err in denying bpa motion to modify the stay because bpa failed to show the cause required under d.in support,mirant urges this court to adopt an actual,or,analysis to determine whether the act applies to this case and to conclude that it does not thereby foreclosing termination via the ipso facto clause because no assignment occurred here.
hypothetical actual test 
we begin by addressing the question that affects each of the issues raised by bpa,that is,whether this circuit adopts the actual or hypothetical approach to the text of e a.the hypothetical test was first announced and adopted in the sole circuit opinion to address the conjunctive effect of and the act.west,at.in west,a divided panel addressed similar facts and held the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying a lift of the chapter stay,which had the effect of preventing the government from terminating an executory contract under the two statutes.at.addressing c as opposed to e at issue here,the west majority created a hypothetical test for the determination of whether the act was an applicable law such that the government could refuse performance under the act.the west majority rejected an determination of whether assignment had occurred under the act.id.concluding that hypothetically speaking the act was an applicable law because it made the contract generally unassignable,the majority in west held that c foreclosed the debtor ability to assume the contract.id.at.the majority reasoned 
we think that by including the words or the debtor in possession in c congress anticipated an argument like the one here made and wanted that section to reflect its judgment that in the context of the assumption and assignment of executory contracts,a solvent contractor and an insolvent debtor in possession going through bankruptcy are materially distinct entities.while the relevant case law is very sparse,it supports our understanding of the interplay between c and.
id.footnote omitted.
in other words,under the third circuit hypothetical approach,which rested on language in c that does not appear in e a,a court must ask whether bpa could refuse to accept performance of the agreement from any assignee because the act makes the agreement unassignable as a matter of law.if so,then irrelevant is the fact that the debtor did not actually assign,intend to assign,or attempt to assign the contract,and consequently the executory contract is terminable by its ipso facto provision under c.see see also rci tech.sunterra in re sunterra,cir addressing c and copyright law catapult,at addressing c and federal patent law city of jamestown james cable partners,in re james cable partners,cir addressing c and a municipal ordinance regarding franchise rights.
in contrast,the west dissent believed that congress did not intend for a solvent contractor and an insolvent debtor in possession going through bankruptcy to be different entities for the purposes of the act.west,at higginbotham,dissenting in part citation omitted.likewise,those courts that have rejected west hypothetical analysis adopt an actual test to determine a law applicability under.see summit inv.dev.leroux,cir see also cajun members comm.mabey in re cajun power,in re lil things,texaco.land exploration,concluding the west hypothetical test is incorrect for three primary reasons in re hartec,stating that the west hypothetical test does not fulfill the purposes of the statutes it seeks to enforce,creates inherent inconsistencies in the language of the code,and fails to adequately account for amendments to the code,vacated by settlement.
the actual or determination of whether a law is applicable under c and e a was first adopted by the first circuit.summit,at.the actual test requires on a basis a showing that the nondebtor party contract will actually be assigned or that the nondebtor party will in fact be asked to accept performance from or render performance to a the than the party with whom it originally contracted.id.at.the actual test contemplates that in a case where no assignment has taken place,e a exception is not available and,as such,an ipso facto clause is invalidated.see see also institut pasteur cambridge biotech,cir,abrogated on other grounds by hardemon city of boston,cir in re cardinal indus.
although this circuit has addressed c,we have yet to address e or to name the test we apply to the determination of whether a nonbankruptcy law applies under either c or e a.see stumpf mcgee in re,cir pension benefit guar.braniff airways,in re braniff airways,cir.review of this circuit law,however,reveals that our adoption today of the actual test,in resolving the availability of e a exception,is consistent with prior caselaw.in,a panel of this court determined that a louisiana statute regarding partnership was an applicable law under c and engaged in an analysis to determine whether an exception to the general rule applied to the case at hand to permit the assumption of the executory contract.at concluding that the exception was not applicable and declaring the contract unassumable.in braniff,a nondebtor objected to the district court order that authorized the debtor in possession to assign its lease agreements with the united states for use of space at washington national airport to a different airline under the version of c that existed prior to the amendment.at.reversing the district court and prohibiting the assignment of the lease,the panel concluded that the broad language of c was not limited in application solely to personal service contracts.id.at.the braniff court held that the code of the district of columbia and a federal regulation enacted pursuant to that code were applicable law under c,which prevented the lease assignment because,in fact,the assignment had been attempted and ordered by the district court and the assignee airline had not been approved to perform by the agency vested with the authority for such approval.id.at.braniff did not address the hypothetical approach indeed,the split between actual and hypothetical approaches had not yet emerged nor had any court yet approved a hypothetical approach to the determination of whether a law is applicable.instead,braniff addressed the language of c prior to its amendment in.however,the language of c more closely tracks the current language of e a than it does the current form of c thus,the approach taken in braniff informs our approach to e a on this record,even in light of the statutory amendment to c and the development of a split between the hypothetical and actual tests.
the plain text of e a requires an actual test for determining whether a law is applicable under the exception,permitting enforcement of an ipso facto clause.according to the statute plain language,an executory contract ipso facto clause may be enforced if applicable law excuses a nondebtor party from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an assignee of such contract and that party does not consent to such assumption or assignment.e a.congress might have chosen the exception to apply if any law prohibited the assignment,but instead congress tethered the exception to applicable law that excuses a party.it is axiomatic that an applicable law must apply to a set of circumstances bpa creates smoke and erects mirrors when it argues that a contract not assignable as a matter of law,even if no such assignment existed in fact and no excuse existed in fact for the nondebtor party to refuse acceptance or performance in a particular situation,satisfies the language chosen by congress in drafting the e a exception.the law that releases a nondebtor from the general rule foreclosing the enforcement of an ipso facto clause must apply to something and must excuse the nondebtor from some specific performance or acceptance,see e a thus,if the debtor demonstrates that no application exists or that no excuse obtains on a given record,then the congressional language announces such a circumstance is material,making the e a exception unavailable.the applicability of the law under e a is determined not in the abstract but on the record at hand.see cajun,at lil things,at texaco,at cardinal,at.
that applicability is determined based upon the case is supported also by the congressional choice to structure the exception as a test,the second portion of which requires a showing.see e a i ii.subsection ii provides that the e a exception lies only where such nondebtor party does not consent to such assumption or assignment.e a ii.the combination of the plain text and the overall structure of the test that must be met in order for the exception to arise communicates that congress intended e a to apply to a given factual situation rather than to a class of executory contracts as bpa urges.
bpa argues that the use of the adjective such merely refers to the assumption and assignment provided in the preceding subsection and does not demand that congress intended an actual test would determine the exception availability.we are not persuaded that standing alone,congress use of the adjective such to modify assignment in e a ii mandates the use of an actual test.the modifier such references the assignments provided in the preceding subsection and does not,on its own,require an approach to the determination of whether a law applies to permit an ipso facto clause enforcement.however,in combination with the other factors that demand a inquiry into whether a nonbankruptcy law applies to permit termination by ipso facto clause,we can not agree with so broad an analysis as permitted by the entirely theoretical approach countenanced by those courts adopting the hypothetical approach.
finally,the plain text of the law proffered by bpa as applicable here,the act,cuts against the broad application advanced by bpa.in theory,a law of such general applicability might exist to merit application in most if not all circumstances under e a,but the act is,by its own terms,not so broadly applicable.subsection a of the act provides a general rule for annulment of a public contract upon a transfer by a party other than the united states.a.subsection b,though,limits the application of the general rule,and the limitation applies on the basis of specific facts.the provisions of subsection a of this section shall not apply in any case in which the moneys due or to become due from the united states under a contract providing for payments aggregating or more,are assigned to a bank,trust company,or other financing institution given other circumstances.b emphasis added.both the text of the act and the text of e a require a inquiry into the application of the act to the executory contract or lease at issue in the bankruptcy proceeding.as such,we hold that with respect to e a and the act,the actual test must be used to determine the act applicability to a given case when the law to be applied to a e a determination can not apply to the case and the record before the bankruptcy court in fact or law,then e a exception can not give effect to an ipso facto clause.
automatic stay 
given that the actual test applies based upon the plain language of e a,we next conclude that the automatic stay must precede any enforcement of an ipso facto clause ultimately permitted by a bankruptcy court under e a.
section provides for an automatic but not permanent stay against any act to obtain possession of property of the estate from which a party may seek relief for cause,including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property.a,d cueva,at see also computer commc ns,at.the code itself requires that the stay effect be automatically triggered upon the filing of a petition for bankruptcy.see a cueva,at.section c provides that a debtor estate includes the debtor interest in property that becomes property of the estate notwithstanding any provision in an agreement,transfer instrument,or applicable nonbankruptcy law that is conditioned upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case.c.recently,chief judge jones explained the principle at issue,
sweeping all of the debtor property into the bankruptcy estate created at filing is the means by which the code achieves effective and equitable bankruptcy administration.only through a comprehensive administration of the debtor property,wherever located and by whomever controlled,can the court shield the property from creditors unauthorized grasp prevent harassment of debtors and ultimately ensure equal distribution among creditors.
burgess sikes in re burgess,wl,at cir,jones,dissenting.
furthermore,this court has recognized the automatic stay broad application and noted that such breadth reflects a congressional intent that courts will presume protection of property when faced with uncertainty or ambiguity.brown chesnut in re chesnut,cir.likewise,the bankruptcy court discretion to grant a modification or lift of the automatic stay is broad.cueva,at.
here,mirant interest in the agreement,even if it were ultimately terminable,became property of the estate upon mirant filing on july.accordingly,the agreement was subject to review by the bankruptcy court,and a party with an interest in an executory contract or lease must come before the bankruptcy court to move for a modification or lift of the stay under d in order to effect the terms of an ipso facto clause under e a.
the bankruptcy code,which must be read and must function as a whole,demands this conclusion.the ninth circuit has noted three compelling reasons to read the code in this manner.see computer commc ns,at citing wegner farms merchants bonding in re wegner farms.first,b provides particular exceptions to the entry of automatic stay,but no exception is provided in the case of executory contracts.see also b.second,elsewhere in the bankruptcy code,congress expressly overrode the stay provision but did not do so in and finally not exempting this brand of executory contracts is consistent with the purposes and policies underlying the staying of actions against a debtor postpetition.computer commc ns,at internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,on this record,the interplay of the bankruptcy code and the act in particular comports with the conclusion that the automatic stay must precede any termination permitted by an ipso facto clause and e a.while the bankruptcy code and this court caselaw interpreting it require that the initiation of the broad automatic stay is immediate upon filing,such automatic triggering is absent from the text of the act and caselaw interpreting the act.according to bpa,the termination permitted by e a and the ipso facto clause of the agreement here is automatic upon mirant filing for relief under the bankruptcy code and precedes the entry of automatic stay.we disagree.the act,instead,provides the government with an option to rescind its contracts upon transfer.the act permits the united states to elect its response to the transfer of a contract to which it is a party.the united states may either waive its rights under the act and continue performance,or it may terminate the contract.see tuftco united states,permitting the united states to waive the act prohibition of transfer where the government was aware of,assented in writing to,and recognized the assignment see also nrg united states.thus,the act does not provide for automatic recision of the public contract upon transfer annulment of the contract at issue requires a response by the united states.the act,and its effect on a given executory contract,may be raised by the government after the entry of a bankruptcy court automatic stay under,at a minimum,the provision for stay modification.see d.
accordingly,the automatic stay prohibited bpa from terminating the agreement.even when e a will ultimately permit a nondebtor party to terminate an executory contract by virtue of the combined effect of e a,applicable law,and an ipso facto clause,the nondebtor party must seek relief from the stay before the bankruptcy court under d.therefore,we affirm the bankruptcy court stay violation order.
the denial of modification to stay 
we next address bpa contention that the lower courts erred in failing to lift or modify the stay under d.based upon our conclusion that the act has no application on this record,we can not say the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying bpa motion to modify stay
