opinion of the court 
in these consolidated declaratory judgment actions,we are presented with disputes concerning two contracts an indemnification agreement between a contractor and a subcontractor,and a subsequent insurance contract between the contractor and an insurance company.on appeal,there are three primary issues whether nps energy services is obligated to defend jacobs constructors,pursuant to their subcontract,in a declaratory judgment action in which a third party,pennzoil products company,is seeking contractual indemnification from jacobs for injuries and deaths whether nps energy fulfilled its contractual obligation to name jacobs as an additional insured on the national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh insurance agreement and whether the insurance agreement between national union and jacobs,which covers jacobs as an additional insured,requires national union to indemnify and defend jacobs in the declaratory judgment action between pennzoil and jacobs.
the district court partially granted for summary judgment,holding that nps energy is obligated to provide an interim defense on behalf of jacobs.the district court also held that nps energy fulfilled its obligation to name jacobs as an additional insured on the national union policy.finally,the court held that national union insurance policy does not provide coverage for liability that an additional insured assumes pursuant to an indemnity agreement.for the reasons discussed below,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
facts and procedure 
this case arises out of a fire and explosion that occurred on october,at pennzoil oil refinery in rouseville,pennsylvania.before the explosion,pennzoil hired jacobs to construct an addition to the refinery known as the specialty wax project.under the terms of their contract,jacobs agreed to indemnify pennzoil for liability and defense costs for all claims arising from the personal injury or death of subcontractor employees,regardless of the cause.jacobs indemnity obligations,however,did not extend to damage or loss resulting from pennzoil willful misconduct or gross negligence.
jacobs,in turn,hired nps energy to perform the mechanical services work at the specialty wax project.like the general contract between jacobs and pennzoil,the subcontract contained an indemnity clause,requiring nps energy to indemnify jacobs.it also required nps energy to procure commercial general liability coverage of at least five million dollars for each occurrence and five million dollars in the aggregate.as a result,nps energy obtained a general liability policy primary policy and an umbrella policy with national union.under both policies,nps energy was covered as a named insured and pennzoil and jacobs were covered as additional insureds.the terms of both the indemnification agreement and the umbrella insurance policy are contested.
the fire and explosion occurred near the portion of the pennzoil refinery where jacobs and nps energy were working.the explosion seriously injured and killed several individuals,including employees of nps energy.subsequently,the injured and representatives of deceased nps energy employees brought personal injury and wrongful death actions against pennzoil.neither nps energy nor jacobs were joined in these actions.pennzoil,however,sought to enforce its respective indemnification agreements with jacobs and nps energy.both denied liability and refused pennzoil tender.pennzoil also brought claims against national union.national union declined coverage contending that the lawsuits arose out of pennzoil negligence.
pennzoil filed a declaratory judgment action against jacobs in the district court of harris county,texas.it sought a declaration that jacobs was obligated to defend against the nps energy employee suits.pennzoil eventually added a breach of contract claim.jacobs denied liability,arguing that pennzoil caused the fire through its gross negligence willful misconduct.
thereafter,nps energy,national union,and pennzoil entered into a settlement agreement and release.as part of the agreement,national union agreed to tender the full value of its one million dollar primary policy,as well as four million dollars under the umbrella policy,so pennzoil could settle the employee claims.the agreement also required pennzoil to release nps energy and national union from any further liability.pennzoil,however,reserved the right to seek indemnity from jacobs.as such,it continued to pursue its declaratory judgment action in texas in order to recover the additional cost of resolving the employee suits not covered by the national union settlement,approximately five million dollars.
in response to pennzoil action in texas,jacobs filed a declaratory judgment action in the western district court of pennsylvania against nps energy.it requested the following declaration jacobs is entitled to indemnification from nps energy for any payments it may be required to make to pennzoil nps energy is obligated to defend jacobs the subcontract between nps energy and jacobs required nps energy to name jacobs as an additional insured in the national union insurance policy and nps energy is not entitled to indemnification from jacobs for payments it made or may make to pennzoil.nps energy filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the case was not ripe for decision given the pendency of the texas action.the district court granted the motion in part.first,it held that jacobs requested indemnification from nps energy was not ripe because additional fact finding was necessary and could interfere with the texas action.second,the court held that the question of whether nps energy was obligated to defend jacobs was ripe,but only to the extent that jacobs sought an interim defense in the texas action.finally,the court denied nps energy motion with respect to naming jacobs as an additional insured and jacobs obligation to indemnify nps energy because the record was not sufficiently developed on either issue.
jacobs also filed a declaratory judgment action against national union.in it,jacobs requested a declaration stating that national union must indemnify jacobs for payments that jacobs is obligated to make to pennzoil as a result of the texas action and national union must defend jacobs in the texas action.the district court consolidated jacobs action against both nps energy and national union.thereafter,all three parties filed motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted jacobs summary judgment motion concerning nps energy interim duty of defense in the texas action.it held that the subcontract with jacobs does not contain any language that limits the scope of nps energy duty to defend to tort claims or claims brought directly by plaintiffs who suffered personal injury or property damage.the district court also granted nps energy summary judgment motion.it held that nps energy was required to name jacobs as an additional insured on the national union insurance policies but nonetheless had satisfied that contractual requirement.in addition,the district court declined to issue a declaration regarding whether nps energy was entitled to indemnification from jacobs for any payments it made or may make to pennzoil.it reasoned that jacobs failed to produce any evidence that nps energy made payments to pennzoil or that nps energy sought indemnification from jacobs.finally,the district court granted national union summary judgment motion.the court held that national union indemnity obligations to jacobs were not ripe and that national union umbrella policy did not provide jacobs a defense in the texas action because it listed jacobs only as an additional insured.
jacobs appeals the court judgment that nps energy fulfilled its obligation to name jacobs as an additional insured on the national union insurance agreement and that the national union umbrella policy does not require national union to provide jacobs with indemnification or a defense in the texas action.nps energy,arguing that,per the terms of its subcontract,it is not obligated to provide jacobs with a defense in the texas action

iii.discussion 
we will first address jacobs requested declarations against nps energy.for purposes of this appeal,jacobs claims that nps energy has an interim duty to defend it in the texas declaratory judgment action with pennzoil,and that nps energy has an obligation to list it as an additional insured on the national union insurance policy.then,we will consider jacobs claim that national union has an obligation to indemnify and defend it in the texas action.
nps energy duty to defend 
jacobs demand for nps energy to defend it in the texas declaratory judgment action against pennzoil is premised on indemnity provisions found in sections and of its subcontract with nps energy.sections and state in pertinent part 
to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to the work covered by the subcontract,subcontractor agrees to defend,indemnify,save and hold harmless,the owner and contractor,and all their affiliates,parents,subsidiaries,divisions,directors,officers,agents,heirs,assigns,representatives and employees indemnitees,from and against the following all claims,liabilities,demands,damages,losses,costs and expenses,including reasonable attorneys fees,awards,fines and judgments,in law or in equity,of every kind and nature whatsoever claims,arising by reason of personal injury,the death of or bodily injury to persons including employees of the subcontractor,design defects if design originated from subcontractor,damages or destruction of property or the loss of use thereof,arising out of or alleged to have arisen out of in whole or in part by,or in connection with,subcontractor operations to be performed under this subcontract,but excluding the sole negligence and exclusive negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnitees.
c.in the event of injury to or death of any person or loss of or damage to property or the loss of use thereof,arising as described in subparagraphs below,it shall be assumed,as between contractor and subcontractor and until it has been finally determined otherwise,that the indemnitees are entitled to be defended and indemnified by subcontractor pursuant to the provisions hereof and,in such event,subcontractor and its insurer,irrespective of any allegations in the pleadings,shall defend any lawsuit or litigation brought against any of the indemnitees with respect to any such injury,death,loss,or damage 
where such injury,death,loss or damage occurred to any employee of subcontractor or of its of any tier 
the indemnitees shall be entitled at their expense to retain their own attorneys to assist and monitor counsel hired by subcontractor and its insurer to defend the indemnitees pursuant hereto.
at emphasis added.
the district court concluded that section only applies after there is a final determination of who will ultimately pay for jacobs defense.thus,because the texas action was not resolved at the time jacobs sought its declarations,the district court focused solely on section,which contains an interim cost shifting feature.the court held that section obligates nps energy to provide jacobs with an interim defense against pennzoil.it reasoned that section does not contain any language that limits the scope of the duty to defend to tort claims or claims brought directly by plaintiffs who suffered personal injury or property damage.the court construed the phrase any lawsuit or litigation brought against any of the indemnitees with respect to any such injury,death,loss or damage as meaning any type of suit relating to a personal injury.thus,it held that section could apply to contractual indemnity arising out of a personal injury claim.
nps energy argues that the district court erroneously focused upon whether section expressly excludes contractual indemnity claims.under pennsylvania law,it is that indemnification for a party own negligence will not be inferred and must be stated expressly,clearly,and unequivocally in an indemnity clause.nps energy argues that this principle also applies to the indemnification and defense of a party contractual liability.thus,it contends that the district court should have examined whether section expressly includes,rather than excludes,such obligations.although this a difficult question,we agree with nps energy.
the pennsylvania supreme court has not addressed whether an indemnity provision can extend to an indemnitee independent contractual liability to indemnify and defend a third party,where such obligation is not expressed in unequivocal terms.thus,we are required by controlling precedent to predict how the pennsylvania supreme court would decide this issue.hon stroh brewery,cir.
we begin with general indemnity principles.the construction of an indemnity contract is a question of law for the court to decide.see hutchison sunbeam coal.under pennsylvania law,the court must strictly construe the scope of an indemnity contract against the party seeking indemnification.see brown moore,cir,disapproved on other grounds.as with any other contract,the court must determine the intentions of the parties.see metzger clifford realty,citation omitted.if the indemnity clause is clear and unambiguous,then the intentions of the parties should be ascertained primarily by looking to the language used in the agreement.see fallon,v.the cincinnati ins,cir.only where the court finds ambiguity may it consider the circumstances under which the contract was signed.see east crossroads.the mere fact that the parties do not agree upon the proper interpretation of an indemnity clause does not necessarily render the clause ambiguous.see metzger.at,at.
it is in pennsylvania that an indemnity agreement that covers loss due to the indemnitee own negligence must be clear and unequivocal.the pennsylvania supreme court first set forth this principle in,in perry payne.in that case,the court stated 
we think it clear,on reason and authority,that a contract of indemnity against personal injuries,should not be construed to indemnify against the negligence of the indemnitees,unless it is so expressed in unequivocal terms.the liability on such indemnity is so hazardous,and the character of the indemnity so unusual and extraordinary,that there can be no presumption that the indemnitor intended to assume the responsibility unless the contract puts it beyond doubt by express stipulation.no inference from words of general import can establish it.
the pennsylvania supreme court reinvigorated the perry rule in,in ruzzi butler petroleum.ruzzi concerned an agreement whereby a property owner would indemnify a contractor from any and all liability for claims for loss,damage,injury or other casualty to persons or property caused by a renovation operation.in light of perry,the court held that the clause was not specific enough to require indemnification for the contractor own negligence.in so ruling,the ruzzi court stated 
we conclude that the only intent that can be gleaned from this document is that the parties did not intend to indemnify for acts of the indemnitee negligence,since words of general import are used.we can discern no reason to abandon the perry rule of contract interpretation which is still a valuable rule of construction,rooted in reason and authority and reject butler petroleum contrary arguments.
we believe that the pennsylvania supreme court would hold that the doctrine applies to indemnity claims for losses contractually assumed by the indemnitee.we reach this conclusion for several reasons.first,the policy underlying the doctrine applies with equal force to indemnification for contractual liability to a third party.similar to a contract to indemnify another for his own negligence,an agreement to indemnify another for his contractual liability to a third party imposes an obligation,regardless of the fault of the indemnitor.further,the extent of such an obligation is uncertain and indefinite,and entirely in the hands of the indemnitee.see perry,at,at.therefore,such indemnification imposes an unusual and extraordinary obligation in the same manner as indemnification for one own negligence.thus,such an obligation must be stated plainly,in clear and unequivocal language.
the fifth circuit decision in foreman exxon,cir,which addressed the same issue,supports our rationale.in foreman,exxon,the owner of an oil platform,agreed to indemnify diamond,the owner of a drilling rig on the platform,for any personal injury suit brought against it by invitees on the platform.offshore,the corporation in charge of drilling operations on the platform,agreed to indemnify exxon for any personal injury claims brought by offshore employees.an offshore employee was injured while working on the platform and sued exxon and diamond diamond sought indemnity for its liability from exxon under the indemnification agreement.in turn,exxon sought indemnity from offshore,including amounts that it owed to diamond see foreman,at.
the fifth circuit held that offshore indemnity obligation to exxon did not cover exxon contractual liability to diamond m.the court held that the situation was analogous to a party seeking indemnity for its own negligence 
a contract to indemnify another for his own negligence imposes an extraordinary obligation.thus an indemnitor is entitled to express notice that under his agreement,and through no fault of his own,he may be called upon to pay damages caused solely by the negligence of the indemnitee.for the same reasons express notice is required where a party seeks to shift his contractual liability to indemnify a third party.
id.at quoting corbitt diamond drilling,cir emphasis added.thus,indemnity for contractually assumed liability may arise only from the plainly expressed intentions of the parties,spelled out in unambiguous terms.id.at.
next,our position is consistent with the principle in pennsylvania that an indemnity clause is to be construed against the party seeking indemnification.indeed,because the nature and purpose of any indemnity agreement involves the shifting and voluntary assumption of legal obligations,they are to be narrowly construed.as a general rule,parties must use clear,unambiguous language to ensure their enforcement.it follows that the enforcement of the duty to indemnify for contractual liability should hinge on the same criteria.
having concluded that applies where a party seeks indemnification for its independent contractual liabilities,our next task is to apply it to the present case.the agreement at issue here does not unequivocally require nps energy to defend jacobs in an indemnification suit brought by a third party.rather,section of the agreement simply provides that 
in the event of injury to or death of any person or loss of or damage to property or the loss of use thereof it shall be assumed that the indemnitees are entitled to be defended and indemnified by the subcontractor and,in such event,subcontractor and its insurer,irrespective of any allegations in the pleadings,shall defend any lawsuit or litigation brought against any of the indemnitees with respect to any such injury,death,loss,or damage 
absent express language to the contrary,we believe that the phrase lawsuit or litigation brought with respect to any such injury,death,loss,or damage should be interpreted more narrowly.rather than covering any lawsuit related to a personal injury or death,we believe the phrase extends only to nps energy direct liability to jacobs.in other words,nps energy is liable only for claims brought directly against jacobs.therefore,pennzoil personal injury claims against jacobs are too attenuated.nps energy simply did not have ample notice of its obligation to defend jacobs in such suits.
nonetheless,jacobs argues that the language irrespective of any allegations in the pleadings clarifies the breadth of nps energy potential liability.however,jacobs fails to read this language in context.it is immediately followed by the phrase shall defend any lawsuit or litigation brought against any of the indemnitees with respect to any such injury,death,loss or damage we read this phrase narrowly in accordance with its plain meaning and conclude that it refers only to allegations relating to injury,death,loss,or damage.similarly,section does not contain any agreement by nps energy to defend jacobs in its disputes with pennzoil over contractually assumed liability section states only that nps energy 
agrees to defend,indemnify,save and hold harmless,the owner and contractor from and against the following all claims arising by reason of personal injury,the death of or bodily injury to persons including employees of the subcontractor,design defects if designed originated from subcontractor,damages or destruction of property 
at.applying the doctrine,we interpret the phrase all claims arising by reason of personal injury to mean tort claims.like the text contained in section,this broad language is simply not specific enough to require defending against contractual liability,even if triggered by personal injuries.
in addition to the agreement itself,the record indicates that nps energy was unaware of its alleged duty to defend jacobs in suits arising from contractual obligations.for example,jacobs did not disclose to nps energy the nature or extent of its broad indemnification obligations to pennzoil.in fact,jacobs subcontract negotiators were unaware of the substance of jacobs contract with pennzoil.thus,nps energy had no way of knowing the broad and scope of its alleged indemnification duties.additionally,jacobs offered the contract to nps energy on a take it or leave it basis.jacobs required its subcontractors to adhere to a written form subcontract,with little or no alterations.at.accordingly,the negotiations failed to provide nps energy with additional information regarding its contractual duties.
consistent with the policy of the pennsylvania supreme court as demonstrated in the doctrine,we will not endorse the silent shifting or involuntary assumption of obligations that an indemnitor ordinarily would not likely undertake.to do otherwise would be to transform definitive indemnification agreements into guarantees in the nature of insurance policies.in sum,we conclude that the pennsylvania supreme court would apply the doctrine to indemnity claims for losses contractually assumed by an indemnitee.as such,nps energy duty to defend jacobs in contractual indemnity suits may arise only from the plainly expressed intention of the parties,spelled out in unambiguous terms.given the absence of such specific language in section and,we hold that nps energy was not obligated to defend jacobs against contractual indemnity claims.
nps energy obligation to list jacobs as an additional insured 
it is undisputed that nps energy maintained insurance in the requisite amounts and named jacobs as an additional insured.jacobs,however,argues that the district court erred by finding that nps energy satisfied its contractual obligation to name jacobs as an additional insured on the national union policy,and yet nonetheless concluded that jacobs is not entitled to coverage.according to jacobs,the district court rulings are mutually exclusive.it contends that if nps energy had performed its obligation to procure insurance under the subcontract,then the national union policies would have covered jacobs for all the contractual liabilities assumed by nps energy.we disagree and conclude that the district court was correct in all respects.
the agreed upon insurance obligations undertaken by nps energy are set for
