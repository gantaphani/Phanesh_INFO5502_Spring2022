rollins,appeals from a jury verdict in favor of dp solutions,dps awarding dps damages for breach of contract and tortious interference with contract.rollins originally hired dps to develop a new computer system.in july the parties signed the professional services agreement,the contract governing the overall relationship between the parties.this contract provided that the parties would sign engagement agreements at a later date to govern the actual work that rollins wanted dps to perform.the first phase of the agreement was for dps to assess rollins business and determine what capabilities rollins needed in a new computer system.
after this initial analysis phase,in october,rollins engaged dps to actually develop the new computer system.rollins chose not to enter into a fixed price engagement agreement where specifications for the new system would be determined before development began.instead,rollins chose to retain more control over the development phase,and signed an engagement agreement where it would pay dps a monthly fee in exchange for the provision of personnel proficient in the use of a specific software writing tool.the development of the new system proved more complex than the parties originally anticipated,and therefore took longer to complete.the parties signed the final engagement agreement in june.this agreement named the personnel dps would provide and the specific fee for each remaining month in.the parties deviated from this written engagement agreement,and the personnel dps provided along with the monthly rate it charged remained at the july level for the rest of that year.
in the months leading up to december,rollins fell behind in its payments to dps.dps contacted rollins concerning these past due payments.on friday,december,rollins informed dps that rollins would make no further payments,but that rollins expected dps to complete the development of the system.the parties agree that rollins had paid around seven million dollars in fees and expenses to dps up to that point for the computer system,which was still incomplete.in response to rollins refusal to pay its bills,dps removed its personnel from the project site on monday,december.dps performed no additional work on the project after that date.dps then filed the original complaint in this lawsuit in federal district court based upon diversity jurisdiction.
after january,rollins discussed employment opportunities with two former dps employees who had worked on the development project.dps spent approximately in attorneys fees to prevent these employees from working for rollins in violation of the employees agreements with dps.dps then amended its complaint to include a tortious interference claim against rollins.rollins response to the amended complaint claimed that dps breached the contract,that dps committed fraud on rollins,that dps performance under the contract was so deficient that it excused rollins from further performance,and that rollins was privileged to interfere with dps relationship with its former employees.this case was eventually tried before a jury.
the jury found that rollins breached its contract with dps and awarded dps in damages for the months of november and december.the jury also found that rollins failed to comply with the notice requirement for termination included in the contract,and awarded dps in damages for the month of january.the jury awarded dps in damages for rollins tortious interference with dps agreements.the jury found that dps did not breach the contract and that dps did not commit fraud.finally,the jury found that dps performance under the contract did not excuse rollins from its performance,and that rollins was not justified in interfering with dps agreements with its former employees.the jury awarded no damages to rollins.
after the verdict,rollins renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.b regarding dps breach of contract and tortious interference claims.rollins also filed a motion for a new trial under.alleging the closing argument by dps was prejudicial and invalidated the jury award.the district court denied both motions.the district judge then awarded dps in attorneys fees under state law and in costs,as well as interest at ten percent and interest at percent.this appeal followed.
on appeal,rollins raises eight claims.these claims break down as follows four claims concern the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury breach of contract damages award one claim regarding the tortious interference damage award one claim that dps closing argument was prejudicial a claim that the attorneys fee award to dps was improper and a claim that the award of costs to dps was improper.dps raises four additional claims on.these claims concern the district court interpretation of the order the prejudgment and postjudgment interest rates awarded by the district court the award of attorneys fees to dps for this appeal and the district court modification of dps attorneys fee award to account for the jury award to dps for tortious interference damages.
rollins raises four issues regarding the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the breach of contract damages the documents governing the parties relationship terminated by their own terms on december,the notice period included in the contract was discretionary rather than mandatory the judgment includes an award that exceeds the proper amount for a notice of cancellation provision and dps failed to present legally sufficient evidence regarding the proper measure for the breach of contract damages.rollins claims the proper damage measure for a breach of contract is net damages and that dps failed to present evidence of expenses it avoided.
we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,using the same standard the district court used.ford cimarron,cir.judgment as a matter of law is proper after a party has been fully heard by the jury on a given issue,and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.foreman babcock wilcox,cir quoting fed.civ.a.when evaluating the denial of rollins motion for judgment as a matter of law,we must consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to dps,drawing all factual inferences in favor of dps,while leaving credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts to the jury.foreman,at citing anderson liberty lobby,d.however,a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury and there must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question.foreman,at citing boeing shipman,cir en banc.federal courts apply state substantive law in diversity jurisdiction cases,but apply federal procedural law.hall ge plastic pac.pte,cir.
rollins claims that the contract terminated by its own terms on december.however,the evidence supported a finding that dps and rollins departed from the written terms of the june engagement agreement.rollins requested,and dps agreed,to continue the project staffing levels at the july level rather than decreasing them as provided in the agreement.the parties also agreed to maintain the monthly fee at the july level rather than decreasing it according to the schedule included in the june agreement.dps presented testimony that rollins agreed to extend the duration of the contract at the ongoing monthly rate into january.the jury could infer support for this testimony from a voicemail dps received from rollins prior to december where rollins arguably assumed the relationship would continue into january.this is more than a scintilla of evidence,and with all factual inferences drawn in favor of dps,the testimony is sufficient to support the jury determination that rollins extended its contract with dps into january.thus,rollins first claim fails.
next,rollins claims the jury finding that rollins violated the notice provision in the contract was improper because this notice period was a discretionary means for terminating the contract.the language of the original contract between the parties supports the jury finding that rollins violated the notice period rollins contends that the contract language may terminate by providing days notice means it is discretionary whether notice is given at all.however,another reasonable inference,supporting the jury findings,is that rollins has the discretion to terminate the contract,but once rollins chooses to terminate,it must give thirty days notice.when reviewing a judgment as a matter of law,we must allow the jury to make reasonable inferences.see foreman,at.thus,the jury finding that rollins violated the notice period is supported by the evidence,and rollins second issue concerning the breach of contract claim fails.
rollins third claim on appeal regarding the breach of contract damages is that the meeting between rollins and dps on friday,december,was sufficient to trigger the start of the notice period,and that any damages awarded for the period after january,are not supported by legally sufficient evidence.however,the jury found that rollins breached the contract on or about december.both parties stipulated that dps removed its employees from the rollins project on monday,december,and provided no further services to rollins after that date.in light of this jury finding and the stipulated evidence,we must conclude that dps received notice of contract termination from rollins no later than december.because notice was received by december,any jury damages for breach of contract after the expiration of the notice period on january,are not supported by legally sufficient evidence.the portion of the jury damages award relating to the period from january until january,should,therefore,be vacated.
finally,rollins claims that the jury damage awards are unsupported by legally sufficient evidence.state substantive law governs the measure of damages in this breach of contract diversity case.kona tech.southern pac.transp,cir citing erie tompkins.neither party disputes that texas state substantive law governs this contractual relationship.under texas law,the proper damages award for a breach of contract is the amount necessary to put the party in the same economic position in which it would have been had the contract not been breached.cdb software,kroll,dist,pet.denied.generally,the measure of damages meeting this standard is net profit.specifically,the gross amount the party would have received if the contract had been fulfilled should normally be reduced by any unpaid costs the party would have to incur to complete performance of the contract.see farris smith erectors,dist,no writ holding that a construction contractor is entitled to recover profits upon breach of a partially performed contract,but not the same amount as if the contract were completed because that amount must be reduced by the cost of completion wattinger moore,no writ holding that one method of computing damages for a breach of contract is the contract price less the reasonable cost of completion.the burden is on the plaintiff to provide evidence of any costs avoided to allow the jury to properly calculate net damages.see farris,at.however,this general rule does not apply in situations where the breach of contract occurs in such a manner that the party does not have the opportunity to reduce its expenses.see houston chronicle publ g mcnair trucklease,dist,writ ref holding that if the defendant breach does not permit the plaintiff to reduce its overhead then defendant is not entitled to a reduction in the damages awarded against it.
we must analyze the jury award for the breach of contract claim in three distinct time periods to determine whether the evidence is legally sufficient the damages awarded for november and the portion of december prior to the removal of dps personnel from the rollins project on december,the period from december,until january,and the award for the period from january,through the end of that month.with regard to the first time period,both parties agree that dps provided services under the rollins contract until december.dps bore its full costs of performance during this time frame,and therefore full payment is necessary for dps to be in the same economic position as it would be absent the breach.see cdb software,at.the jury award of the gross contract amount for this time period is proper.
rollins claims the evidence supporting the damage award for the period after december,is not legally sufficient.rollins argues dps did not fulfill its burden to provide evidence of the costs that dps was able to avoid during this period,thus preventing the jury from determining the net profit lost by dps as a result of the breach.see farris,at burden is on party to provide evidence from which net profits can be calculated.for the period from december,until january,there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury award of damages to dps.the jury could reasonably find that dps was unable to avoid any of its expenses during this period.when the party can not avoid its expenses,the general damages rule does not apply and an award of gross profit and not net profit is appropriate.houston chronicle,at.
the jury gross profit award was appropriate because the contract itself supports a jury inference that rollins was required to reimburse all expenses incurred by dps on the project.paragraph of the professional services agreement provides rollins will be provided a detailed invoice for services and expenses in providing services under this agreement.emphasis added.in addition,dps presented actual invoices requesting reimbursement of its expenses from rollins.finally,the jury heard testimony that the only expense dps bore without reimbursement was the salary cost of its employees.this testimony also described the notice period included in dps contracts with its employees and that dps honored these clauses.therefore,the jury could reasonably conclude based on the evidence that dps was unable to avoid any of its costs during the notice period.thus,the jury award for the gross monthly fee for the period from december,until january,is proper.
rollins elicited testimony that dps was able to avoid paying salaries to its employees after january.as discussed above,the notice period expired on january terminating the contract,thus we need not address rollins claim regarding the evidence of costs that dps avoided from january through january.rollins claims regarding the impropriety of a gross rather than a net damage award fails for the period from november until december.this claim also fails for the notice period ending january,and is moot for the portion of january outside the notice period.
rollins fifth claim is that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to the jury award for tortious interference.to prove tortious interference a party must show an existing contract subject to interference,the interference was willful or intentional,the interference was the proximate cause of the damage,and actual damage or loss resulted from the interference.holloway skinner.rollins challenges the jury award on two grounds.first,rollins claims the contact with the dps employees occurred after they had left the employ of dps.however,the evidence established that these employees still had agreements with dps,therefore the jury could find there was an existing contract subject to interference.
second,rollins argues that dps did not prove any actual damages.the only evidence the trial court submitted to the jury supporting the damage award for tortious interference was the attorneys fees dps incurred to prevent its former employees from working for rollins.rollins argues that attorneys fees are legally insufficient to show actual damages because texas law does not permit a party prevailing on a claim of tortious interference to recover attorneys fees.see marcus,stowell beye gov t,jefferson inv,cir discussing texas rule prohibiting recovery of attorneys fees in tortious interference suits.although jefferson investment represents the general texas rule that attorneys fees are not damages for purposes of tortious interference,a number of the texas courts of appeals have adopted equitable exceptions to this general rule.see womack,dist,pet.denied listing examples of circuits adopting equitable exceptions to the general rule of of attorneys fees in tort cases.
when the highest state court is silent on an issue we must make an erie guess.mcavey lee,cir.we must conscientiously determine how that court would decide the issue before us,looking to the sources of the intermediate appellate court decisions of that the highest state court would look to for persuasive authority.id.one of the equitable exceptions to the general rule on attorneys fees adopted by a texas court of appeals allows recovery of attorneys fees in tortious interference cases.see texas beef cattle green,rev on other grounds,at including the texas beef cattle allowance of recovery of attorneys fees in tortious interference cases in its list of equitable exceptions.we hold that texas beef cattle is the appropriate texas precedent to apply in this diversity case.texas beef cattle held that necessary and reasonable attorneys fees and costs even though expended and incurred in previous litigation can be recovered as proper damages in a later suit based on tortious interference of contract.texas beef cattle,at.this exception is limited to situations where the natural and proximate results and consequences of prior wrongful acts had been to involve a plaintiff in litigation with and against third parties and other parties.id.dps presented evidence regarding the attorneys fees it incurred to enforce its underlying agreements with two former employees resulting from rollins contact with these employees.the evidence supports the jury finding of tortious interference,and under texas beef cattle,the attorneys fees from the previous litigation can be recovered as damages.rollins is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the tortious interference award.
rollins sixth claim is that it is entitled to a new trial because the jury result was influenced by passion and prejudice caused by the closing remarks of dps counsel.the district court denied rollins motion for a new trial on this issue.r eview of the denial of a new trial motion is more limited than when one is granted.whitehead food max of,cir.our standard of review in this situation is more deferential than our review of the denial of a motion for a judgment as a matter of law.hidden oaks city of austin,cir.we must affirm the district court denial of rollins motion for a new trial absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.id.the propriety of an argument is a matter of federal trial procedure,and,therefore,in a diversity case,subject to federal rather than state law.whitehead,at internal citations omitted.
to support this claim,rollins relies upon whitehead,where we held that awards influenced by passion and prejudice are the antithesis of a fair trial,and remanded the case for a new trial on damages.whitehead,at.although the closing argument in this case was theatrical and had repeated references to historical and literary figures associated with texas it simply is not the type of argument addressed in whitehead.whitehead was a civil liability case stemming from the kidnaping of a mother and her daughter from the parking lot of a national retail store and the subsequent rape of the mother.this court noted the emotional nature of that case made it a fertile ground for the bias associated with passion and prejudice.id.at.furthermore,the counsel in whitehead made repeated arguments designed to inflame the passions of the jury in violation of the instructions of the trial judge the whitehead counsel also played to local prejudice finally,unlike this case,the counsel in whitehead engaged in a golden rule argument by asking the jurors to place themselves in the position of the rape victim when reaching their verdict 
in addition,rollins never objected to the argument at trial.but whitehead,at noting that a t least a few pertinent objections were made during the prejudicial closing argument.the counsel in whitehead twice disregarded the district court instructions to avoid certain objectionable arguments,and was eventually sanctioned by the district court.whitehead,at.in contrast,here the district judge specifically praised the performance of dps counsel during closing argument we are most cognizant of the fact that the trial judge is in a far,far better position than we to gauge the effect of closing arguments he is present and hears the statements,while we are limited to the cold record.whitehead,at.
finally,this court has recognized that jury verdicts improperly influenced by passion and prejudice can be indicated by their size.whitehead,at without deciding that the awards are excessive,we note that,at the very least,they are at the high end of the spectrum for such damages.see also westbrook tire rubber,cir finding a large verdict accompanied by a prejudicial closing argument can lead to the conclusion that the argument had an influential impact upon the jury deliberations.the jury verdict in this case is not inconsistent with reasonable deliberations on the evidence of the contractual relationship presented to the jury.when considered together,the facts that rollins made no objection at trial the district court judge praised the skill of the closing argument and the jury award is not wholly inconsistent with reasonable deliberation on the evidence buttress this court conclusion that the closing argument by dps counsel was not prejudicial.rollins sixth claim fails.
the seventh issue on appeal is a challenge to the district judge award of attorneys fees to dps texas state law governs the attorneys fee award in this case,and the standard of review for an award of attorneys fees is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making the award.mathis exxon,cir state law controls both the award of and the reasonableness of fees awarded where state law supplies the rule of decision.under texas law,there is discretion to determine the amount of the attorneys fee award,but an award of reasonable fees is mandatory if a party prevails in a breach of contract case and there is proof of reasonable fees.mathis,at citing world help leisure lifestyles,worth,pet.denied.a trial court award is unreasonable only if the court acted without reference to any guiding rules and principles.city of austin janowski,no writ.rollins makes two claims regarding the attorneys fee award.first,rollins claims that the trial court did not adequately scrutinize the records when calculating the attorneys fees.second,rollins claims that dps is not allowed to recover for the attorneys time spent defending against rollins counterclaims at trial.see,ventana invs,finding that the texas attorney fee statute does not include a provision allowing recovery for successful defense of a contractual lawsuit.
rollins claim that the district court failed to adequately scrutinize the record fails.the district court withheld judgment on the attorneys fees award until it received all of the billing records from the dps attorneys.rollins challenged a number of the billing entries of the lead dps attorney before the district court,claiming that certain billings represented inefficiency or time spent on unsuccessful motions.the district court considered the requirements set forth in johnson georgia highway express,cir,when determining the lodestar amounts.see dillard dep t stores,gonzales,paso,pet.denied adopting the johnson factors for texas attorneys fee calculations conducted using the lodestar method.in addition,the claims rollins raises on appeal are virtually identical to those made before the district court.the district court considered those claims and found the hours billed by the lead dps attorney reasonable in light of his relative inexperience,the relative complexity of the case,and the vigorous defensive hurdles rollins presented.the court took the relative inexperience of the lead dps attorney into account when it decreased his billing rate from the per hour requested to per hour.the trial court also considered the hours billed and the hourly rate for the rest of the attorneys for dps,adjusting both amounts to reflect the levels the court found reasonable in light of their representation of dps at tria
