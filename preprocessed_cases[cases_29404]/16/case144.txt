chapter debtor redondo construction corporation redondo brought an adversary proceeding against the puerto rico highway and transportation authority authority in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of puerto rico,claiming amounts due for work performed on five construction projects.following a lengthy trial,the bankruptcy court awarded redondo a total of nearly in damages,plus interest at per annum from the payment due date for each project.the district court affirmed the judgment in all respects.the crux of the authority claim before this court concerns the award of interest.
procedural history 
after filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code,redondo commenced an adversary proceeding against the authority to collect monies that the authority allegedly owed redondo for work performed on five construction projects redondo claimed that the authority failed to compensate it for additional work redondo had to perform on each project due to unanticipated problems,including unforeseen site conditions and flawed design plans.the complaint was tried before the bankruptcy court.
in its brief,redondo argued that it was entitled to prejudgment interest under article of the puerto rico civil code as damages for contractual delay.see laws ann.tit.in the alternative,redondo sought prejudgment interest under rule b of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure on the basis of the authority alleged obstinacy in the course of the litigation.see laws ann.tit,app.iii,b.
the bankruptcy court entered judgment in redondo favor and awarded interest on all damages at the rate of per annum from the payment due date for each project in its summary of redondo claims,the court noted that redondo sought interest for contractual delay pursuant to article.in awarding interest,however,the court quoted the language of rule b and,without further reasoning,concluded that redondo was entitled to the current legal interest of.
the authority challenged the bankruptcy court decision in the district court,see a,arguing that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding redondo damages on some of the claims and in assessing interest under rule b.the district court affirmed the judgment in all respects,without elaborating its reasons for affirming the award of interest.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the authority presents three claims of error.first,the authority argues that,to the extent that the interest award represents postjudgment interest,the rate instead should be in accordance with.second,it argues that no prejudgment interest was owed because the court did not make a finding that the authority had engaged in obstinate conduct in the course of the litigation,as rule b of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure requires.finally,it argues that the court erroneously awarded redondo an excess amount for its patent and excise taxes claim for one project.

postjudgment interest 
the parties agree that governs any postjudgment interest award in this case.see cummings standard register,cir federal law governs postjudgment interest on a federal court judgment even in an action otherwise governed by state law.section provides that i nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court and is to be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment at a rate fixed in the statute.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d.postjudgment interest is mandatory and the prevailing party is entitled to it even if the district court made no provision for its payment.cordero de jesus mendez,cir.
the interest awarded in this case was not intended to be postjudgment interest.the judgment provides that interest at per annum began to accrue from specified dates when the authority was required to pay redondo claims for each project,well before the entry of judgment in redondo favor.although the judgment does not specify the end date for the accrual of interest,there is nothing to suggest that it would extend beyond the date of entry of the judgment.
the issue of postjudgment interest nonetheless remains.the authority deposited the amount of the judgment with the clerk of the district court on february,stalling the accrual of postjudgment interest as of that date.see cordero,at postjudgment interest ceases to accrue as of the date of deposit of funds with the court.because the judgment had been entered on september,redondo is entitled to postjudgment interest for the period between the entry of judgment and the date of deposit.the authority suggests that the amount that it deposited includes interest at a rate of for that time period,rather than the lower statutory rate.accordingly,we remand for assessment of postjudgment interest from september,to february,at the rate provided in section.
prejudgment interest 
when claims such as the contract claims at issue here are adjudicated by a federal court,prejudgment interest is normally a matter of state law.in re redondo constr,cir.here,the law of puerto rico supplies the rule of decision concerning prejudgment interest.see id.
the bankruptcy court awarded redondo prejudgment interest on all damages at the rate of per annum from the payment due date for each project.the parties disagree whether the interest was assessed as a sanction under rule b of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure or as damages for contractual delay under article of the puerto rico civil code.the authority maintains that prejudgment interest was awarded pursuant to rule b but erroneously so because the court failed to make the requisite finding that the authority was obstinate in litigating the case.redondo concedes that the lack of a finding of obstinacy precludes assessment of interest pursuant to rule,but argues that the court awarded interest pursuant to article,not pursuant to rule.
rule b provides for prejudgment interest at a specified rate when the court determines that the losing party was obstinate in the course of the litigation laws ann.tit,app.iii,b dopp pritzker,cir.a finding of obstinacy requires that the court determine a litigant to have been unreasonably adamant or stubbornly litigious,beyond the acceptable demands of the litigation,thereby wasting time and causing the court and the other litigants unnecessary expense and delay.dopp,at internal quotation marks omitted.the bankruptcy court cited rule b as the basis for the interest award.but the court made no finding of obstinacy,precluding the assessment of interest pursuant to rule b.see in re redondo constr,at rejecting the argument that rule b provided the basis for prejudgment interest award in a different adversary proceeding between the same parties because the court made no finding regarding the authority temerity or obstinance.
to salvage the interest award,redondo argues that the bankruptcy court did not mean what it said.redondo maintains that the court in fact awarded interest for contractual delay pursuant to article but instead cited to rule b either in error or to indicate its inapplicability we can not indulge such speculation.the bankruptcy court did acknowledge that one basis for redondo interest claim was article.nothing in the opinion,however,indicates that the court awarded interest on this basis.
nor can we determine from the record before us that redondo is entitled to the prejudgment interest award pursuant to article unless parties agree otherwise,when a contract obliges a party to pay a sum of money,article provides for payment of interest as an indemnity for damages,by way of penalty,for default in payment.rivera crescioni,accord am.ins.superior court of.default in payment occurs as of the date in which judicial or extrajudicial demand was made for payment.widow of vázquez vázquez cintrón,citing laws ann.tit.we can not determine when such demands were made in this case and whether they correspond to the dates that the bankruptcy court designated
