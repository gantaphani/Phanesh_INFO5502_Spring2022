background 
in the summer of,ronald sexton entered the final stages of purchasing a potential real estate development,known as cedar point,in polk county,texas the seller was bluebonnet savings bank bluebonnet.sexton and bluebonnet agreed to a purchase price of,for which bluebonnet would convey to sexton cedar point,of the stock in the utility company that served cedar point,and performing promissory notes.in preparation for his purchase,sexton incorporated cpdc,to serve as the owner and developer of cedar point.
when sexton was apparently unable to secure a loan in time for the purchase of cedar point,he entered into negotiations with for financing,a resident of california,was,with his wife,and president of a company selling security services and equipment.in late july,sexton negotiated a highly profitable arrangement with for a loan of to sexton,stood to gain between in profit within a few months.
before sexton and executed their agreement,however,attorney,marvin leon,received word from a texas lawyer,john hollyfield,that the arrangement ran afoul of the texas usury laws.the parties scuttled their original agreement and sought to create a financing arrangement.on august,they signed a new financing agreement.pursuant to the financing agreement 
sexton executed a promissory note for,plus interest,payable to.as security for this note,received a first lien on cedar point.the funds from this note were used to purchase cedar point,and sexton company,cpdc,became the successor borrower.
sexton executed another secured promissory note for,plus interest,payable to.the security for this note was a security agreement,covering the stock of the utility company that served cedar point.sexton used the funds from this note to purchase the utility company that served cedar point.
paid sexton for the performing promissory notes.
ideal systems and cpdc executed a consulting agreement,whereby cpdc would pay to ideal systems company for a security system and related services at cedar point for two years.
the promissory notes and the deed of trust all contained usury savings clauses in which disavowed any intent to charge or receive interest in excess of the amount permitted by law.
several weeks after the financing agreement was executed,leon informed that the interest charged on the promissory notes was usurious under texas law.accordingly,in late august,sexton and modified the agreement to retroactively reduce the interest on the promissory notes from to,release any claims by sexton and cpdc against for the prior inclusion of a higher interest rate,and reiterate their intent to enter into a financing agreement.they did not modify the consulting agreement,because leon did not tell that this part of the financing agreement was usurious under texas law.
in early september,cpdc was unable to make its first payments due under the promissory notes and consulting agreement.refused to extend the due date.when cpdc failed to make its second payment,and ideal systems notified cpdc that it was now in default under the consulting agreement.on november,demanded that cpdc pay the installment due under the promissory note when no payment was received,he accelerated the loan and demanded payment of the principal,accrued interest,and attorneys fees.posted cedar point for foreclosure.
sexton and then embarked on extended workout negotiations.on april,new attorney,john nabors,sent sexton a letter renouncing right to receive any interest under the notes that could be construed as usurious,and ideal waived its right to compensation under the consulting services agreement.in early may,culminating the impasse that had been reached,attempted foreclosure on cedar point and cpdc filed for bankruptcy.
a year later,ben floyd was appointed a chapter trustee for cpdc by the bankruptcy court.subsequently,gary frankford,an unsecured creditor of cpdc,filed on the debtor behalf an adversary complaint against and ideal systems,alleging usury,equitable subordination,and avoidance of transfers.floyd,as trustee,intervened.the parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment,and and ideal systems also moved to dismiss frankford for lack of standing.the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of frankford and cpdc.the court held that because the consulting agreement constituted usurious interest on the loans,and ideal rights under all of the parties notes and agreements were extinguished.the court further ordered a trial to quantify the amount of usurious interest by determining the value of the consulting agreement 
the jury valued the consulting agreement at,not the specified by sexton and.the bankruptcy court also accepted the conclusions of an affidavit submitted by the cpdc expert,which stated that the performing promissory notes were undervalued by approximately.thus,the bankruptcy court entered final judgment on february,ordering and ideal systems to pay nearly million in damages and over in attorneys fees and court costs.
and ideal appealed the judgment to the district court.following its de novo review,the district court held that frankford lacked standing to sue and ideal systems,and ideal timely cured any usury violations in the financing agreement by means of the august renegotiation of the promissory notes and the april renunciation letter,and the bankruptcy court erred in accepting cpdc expert evidence concerning the alleged value of the performing promissory notes.consequently,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court judgment.frankford and cpdc timely filed a notice of appeal.

cpdc argues that the district court erred in holding that and ideal,by means of their april,letter,cured any violation of the texas usury statute based upon the fees owed under the consulting agreement between cpdc and ideal.the error,cpdc contends,is that and ideal did not cure the usury violation within sixty days of actually discovering the violation.we disagree.
