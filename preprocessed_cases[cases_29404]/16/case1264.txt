in this appeal,we address a question of first impression in this circuit whether,absent a federal tariff,federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over a motor carrier breach of contract claim against a shipper for unpaid freight charges.for the reasons that follow,we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute,and we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.accordingly,we vacate the district court opinion and remand with instructions to dismiss.
appellants are federally licensed motor carriers motor carriers who transport goods in interstate commerce.appellee,klaussner furniture industries,klaussner,is a furniture company headquartered in asheboro,north carolina.the parties,with the exception of appellant graham trucking enterprises,are incorporated under north carolina law.
prior to the summer of,klaussner contracted directly with the motor carriers to deliver its furniture to corporate customers,including furniture retailers and renters,both in and outside of north carolina.the motor carriers would submit quoted rates directly to klaussner who would then pick amongst the bids for each shipment.
then,in august,klaussner contracted with a broker,salem logistics traffic services,llc salem,to coordinate all shipping logistics.salem charged klaussner a uniform rate that was generally higher than the motor carriers individual bids.in return,salem promised to reduce costs and improve customer service by coordinating stops to multiple klaussner customers for each scheduled shipment.salem was expected to deduct its commission,and then pay the motor carriers.
doyle vaughn,a klaussner employee,personally notified the motor carriers that they would begin working directly with salem.shortly thereafter,salem hired vaughn,who continued to work from the same desk at klaussner.vaughn notified the motor carriers of his change in employment.
the motor carriers also received a series of documents,several of which bore both klaussner and salem logos,explaining salem new role.salem vice president of logistics,ralph raymond,sent a letter explaining that salem would manage all freight payment responsibilities.the motor carriers were sent a fuel surcharge addendum,a mutual non disclosure agreement,and instructions from salem on submitting quotes.finally,klaussner vice president of supply chain,chuck miller,sent instructions to submit freight bills designated as third party payment to klaussner furniture salem logistics and then listed salem address.
each furniture delivery the motor carriers undertook required three documents a confirmation of contract carrier verbal rate agreement agreement a carrier pickup and delivery schedule schedule and a bill of lading.the agreement memorialized the rate agreed upon by salem and the chosen motor carrier,and included the total freight charge for the load.a freight charge includes the agreed upon rate and standardized fees,such as a fuel charge.the agreement was signed by the motor carrier and does not mention klaussner.the schedule listed the location as klaussner furniture and the destination address.salem address is listed under the bill to contact information section.
the bills of lading executed by klaussner and the motor carriers contained standardized provisions generally used in the trucking industry.each bill of lading listed a motor carrier,a consignor,and a consignee.the party shipping the goods is the consignor.the party who recieves the goods is the consignee.here,klaussner was the consignor,and klaussner customer was the consignee.the bills of lading contained the statement freight charges are prepaid unless marked otherwise,and three options prepaid,collect,and party.most of the relevant bills of lading were marked prepaid.
the bills of lading contained an executed provision that stated 
subject to section of conditions,if this shipment is to be delivered to the consignee without recourse on the consignor,the consignor shall sign the following statement 
the carrier shall not make delivery of this shipment without payment of freight and all other lawful charges.
klaussner furniture industries.by cam smith 
this language was repeated,but not executed,in small print at the bottom of the bills of lading.
after initially making payments to the motor carriers,salem defaulted on its obligations and ultimately went out of business.the motor carriers filed this action in the middle district of north carolina under b of the interstate commerce commission termination act against klaussner and on april,to recover the in freight charges salem had failed to pay.in the alternative,the motor carriers sought to recover based on theories of unjust enrichment and equitable estoppel.after discovery,the motor carriers and klaussner filed for summary judgment.
at the summary judgment hearing,the motor carriers first argued that,as a matter of law,when a bill of lading is designated prepaid,the shipper is always liable for the freight charges,even when there is also a provision or a broker is involved klaussner countered that a prepaid designation on a bill of lading means only that the consignee will not be liable for the freight charges.klaussner argued that a provision protects a shipper from liability for any charges above what it agreed to pay.in this case,klaussner claimed it fulfilled its contractual obligations by paying salem.
the district court granted klaussner motion for summary judgment on this issue,finding that the provision protected klaussner from double payment as a matter of law.the district court agreed with klaussner that under illinois steel baltimore,a provision continues to protect shippers from any liability beyond its contractual obligations even when a bill of lading is also designated prepaid.the district court acknowledged that the designation of prepaid instead of party on the bills of lading introduced some doubt as to whether the motor carriers should have expected a broker to pay shipping charges.however,the court found that,given vaughn verbal explanation of salem role and the multiple confirming documents,the motor carriers were on notice to expect payment from salem.
the motor carriers also sought to establish klaussner liability under actual and apparent agency theories.the district court held,however,that the motor carriers agency arguments failed to create a triable issue of fact.the district court found that the only fact on the record to support the motor carriers actual agency argument was that vaughn continued to work from the same desk at klaussner after salem hired him.standing alone,this continuity failed to indicate klaussner retained the right to control salem.hylton koontz,internal citations omitted.the district court held that the motor carriers apparent agency argument failed because the documents with the dual logos,upon which the motor carriers argument relied,were insufficient to suggest that klaussner led the motor carriers to reasonably believe salem was its agent.this appeal followed.
in a somewhat unusual twist,it was klaussner,the prevailing party below,that argued for the first time on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction over this dispute.the timing,of course,does not affect our obligation to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction.
a challenge to a federal court jurisdiction can never be forfeited or waived because it concerns our very power to hear a case.united states beasley,cir quoting united states cotton,d.in fact,we have an independent obligation to assess our jurisdiction in every case,whether or not it is challenged.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.
the party seeking to adjudicate a matter in federal court must allege and,when challenged,must demonstrate the federal court jurisdiction over the matter.strawn v.at t mobility llc,cir.the motor carriers first argue that congress granted federal courts jurisdiction over their claim under the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta.alternatively,they contend that the iccta preempts their state law breach of contract claim.the motor carriers argue,therefore,that we should create a cause of action under federal common law or they will have no forum in which to adjudicate this dispute.
issues of subject matter jurisdiction are questions of law which we review de novo.dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc.were we to reach the merits,we would review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see leblanc cahill,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.a.
our jurisdiction in this case depends upon whether,absent a federal tariff,congress intended federal courts to adjudicate motor carriers claims for unpaid freight charges under the iccta.within constitutional bounds,congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider.bowles russell,d.as a court of limited jurisdiction,we will guard against reading congress grant of authority to the federal courts more broadly than intended.see kokkonen guardian life.ins.of,d.
the issues before us have their genesis in the deregulation of the trucking industry congress effected by passing the iccta.therefore,a brief history of the scope of federal regulation of the trucking industry is useful at the outset.
in,congress passed the motor carrier act,which extended to motor carriers the tariff system that banned price competition between railroads under the interstate commerce act ica.see munitions carriers conference,united states,f d.motor carriers were required to file a tariff that included their prices and conditions with the interstate commerce commission.see a repealed.motor carriers could charge each shipper only the rate in the filed tariff and could not give any shipper preferential treatment.see a,a repealed.
in thurston motor lines,jordan rand,d,the supreme court affirmed louisville nashville rice.where it squarely held that jurisdiction existed over a suit to recover unpaid freight charges.thurston,at a carrier claim is,of necessity,predicated on the an understanding with the shipper.see also illinois steel baltimore.in these cases,the parties mut ies and obligation s depend ed upon the federally filed tariff.thurston,at quoting louisville,at.thus,the tariff was the act of congress regulating commerce under which we had federal question jurisdiction pursuant to a.
after motor carriers operated under the regime for sixty years,congress determined that the trucking industry had become a mature,highly competitive industry where competition disciplines rates far better than tariff filing and regulatory intervention,at.thus,congress passed the iccta because pervasive regulation of the industry had outlived its usefulness.id.
when the iccta went into effect on january,it repealed price controls for all but two specialized areas of the trucking industry.motor carriers transporting household goods or engaged in noncontiguous domestic remained subject to the requirement.see a a b.in these two areas,congress determined that price regulation was still in the public interest.consumers and small shippers contracting to ship household goods would continue to be shielded from potential abuses.see,at.the tariff requirement in the area of noncontiguous domestic trade would facilitate intermodal transport.id.at.all other tariffs on file were automatically voided by the iccta.see a.
congress did not,however,abandon all federal regulation of the motor carriers that were freed to engage in price competition.the surface transportation board stb maintained jurisdiction over all motor carriers who transport goods in interstate commerce and between the united states and its territories or a foreign country.a e.all motor carriers subject to the stb jurisdiction must satisfy licensing requirements by meeting safety,employment,and accessibility standards.a.congress goal in passing the iccta was to strike a good balance between deregulation and preserving very important safety and economic regulatory powers to protect shippers against abuses that will not be remedied by competition.cong.rec.see also,at 
against this framework,we must determine whether congress intended to grant federal courts jurisdiction over federally licensed motor carriers claims for unpaid freight charges when they were not required to file a tariff.we turn now to the question of whether the iccta provides such authority.
we begin by examining b,which authorizes federally licensed motor carriers to enter into private contracts with shippers.the motor carriers argue that this authorization alone is sufficient to establish our jurisdiction over their claim.
as in any case of statutory interpretation,we begin with an analysis of the statutory language.chris tenet,cir citing landreth timber landreth.the meaning of a statutory provision is not to be determined in isolation we look not only to the particular statutory language,but to the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.crandon united states,d internal citations omitted.
section b provides 
in general.a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter may enter into a contract with a shipper,other than for the movement of household goods described in section a,to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions 
this section of the iccta authorizes motor carriers to privately negotiate their rates with shippers,replacing the prior requirement.in fact,this section authorizes one of the two categories of motor carriers still subject to the requirement,carriers involved in noncontiguous domestic trade,to contract around the federal rate schedule.see b.section b only excludes motor carriers transporting household goods.
if a party to a contract authorized by b wants to sue for breach of contract,b provides 
the exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this subsection shall be an action in an appropriate state court or united states district court,unless the parties otherwise agree.
the mere fact that congress authorized motor carriers to privately negotiate rates in b does not imply that congress intended b to federalize every resulting breach of contract claim.section b more accurately reflects congress goal of reducing federal involvement in motor carriers private contracts.the fact that the exclusive remedy for breach of contract in b is judicial,rather than administrative,gains significance in contrast to the remedies available to motor carriers operating under a tariff.when their rates are based on a federal tariff,motor carriers can petition the stb for administrative remedies.see b.when their rates are based on a private contract,however,the motor carriers can only sue in an appropriate court.
of course,for a federal court to be the appropriate forum to adjudicate a dispute,the aggrieved party must establish a basis for our jurisdiction.see united states ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir ruckelshaus sierra club,d defining appropriate as specially suitable fit,proper.for example,although not satisfied in this case,the requirements for diversity jurisdiction are likely often met when motor carriers contract with shippers to transport goods given the interstate nature of the trucking industry.see the motor carriers have established that they are subject to the stb jurisdiction because they transport goods in interstate commerce.as a result,their contract with klaussner was authorized by b.however,this authorization alone does not provide us with jurisdiction over their breach of contract claim.
comparing d to b also helps to clarify the limited scope of the latter.section a l provides that motor carriers are liable for goods damaged in transit.section d authorizes parties seeking damages against a motor carrier to file suit in a united states district court or in a state court.d.in every case brought under a,federal jurisdiction is established because the claimant is enforcing a federal statutory right.thus,the limiting word appropriate does not appear in d.section b,by contrast,authorizes motor carriers and shippers to enter into private contracts.it does not provide either the motor carrier or the shipper with a federal statutory right to enforce in a routine breac
