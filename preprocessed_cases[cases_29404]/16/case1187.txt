opinion of the court 
this case concerns various pennsylvania state law claims arising out of a business dispute.it reaches us after a jury returned a verdict in appellee favor and the district court denied appellant request for relief.among other things,we are obliged to interpret some of the contours of the tort of interference with contractual relations under pennsylvania law.
jurisdiction in the district court was based on a,governing an action between diverse citizens involving a claim for more than.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,as this is an appeal from a final order of the district court.we will affirm in part and reverse in part,remanding for a redetermination of punitive damages and further action in conformity with this opinion.
this case has been characterized by its contentious history.not surprisingly,the relevant facts are somewhat in dispute.as both the party prevailing before the jury and the in the motion for judgment as a matter of law,appellee is entitled to have all reasonable inferences drawn in its favor.see johnson campbell,cir becton dickinson and wolckenhauer,cir.we summarize the facts accordingly.
cgb occupational therapy,cgb is a provider of rehabilitation therapy services in care and facilities.during the relevant time period,cgb contracted with nursing home facilities for the provision of therapeutic services and,once under contract,provided each facility with trained therapists and technicians.
defendant,owned two nursing home facilities,one in west chester,pennsylvania pembrooke facility and one in prospect park,pennsylvania prospect facility at all times relevant to this litigation,those facilities were managed by one or more of appellants sunrise assisted living,sunrise assisted sunrise assisted living management,sunrise management,collectively with sunrise assisted,sunrise or their predecessor entities the management agreement provided for sunrise to be managing agent.the agreement also stated that 
manager sunrise shall on behalf of owner manage all aspects of the operation of the facilities in connection with its management of the operations of the facilities,manager shall use its best efforts to perform the following services 
contract for all necessary services for the account of owner,except that any service contract providing for payments in excess of shall be subject to prior approval of owner,and monitor the performance of the suppliers of all contracted services and,in owner name,terminate such contracts when deemed by manager to be in the best interests of owner 
a further provision stated 
manager shall be responsible for the coordination of such ancillary services,including but not limited to speech therapy,occupational therapy,inhalation therapy,physical therapy,and rental of equipment,as manager may deem reasonable,necessary or desirable in connection with the operation of the facilities and use such consultants in connection therewith as manager shall elect 
on january,cgb entered into a contract with to provide therapy services physical,occupational,and speech to the pembrooke facility.a similar agreement was executed on october,whereby cgb would provide therapy services to the prospect facility.the agreements each contained an clause,promising that in the event that cgb were terminated as the provider of therapy services,the pembrooke and prospect facilities would not seek to employ or contract with cgb therapists who were,independent contractors for a period of twelve months.the agreement with the prospect facility also stated that the cgb contract could be terminated for cause only upon ninety days written notification specifying the cause upon which termination was based.further,the contract provided cgb an opportunity to cure any defects in its performance.if cured before the termination date,the contract was to continue in full force and effect.
changes to the federal medicare program in altered the way was reimbursed for therapy services provided to residents.the changes made it difficult for and its pembrooke and prospect facilities to pay cgb,and the facilities stopped paying cgb on june.that same day,sunrise sent cgb termination notices for both the pembrooke and prospect facilities.each letter stated that the termination was to be effective on september,and was due to the facilities evaluation of cgb services in light of changes in the medicare reimbursement system 
under an agreement executed by sunrise on behalf of on july,symphony health services,symphony was retained as the new therapy service provider at the prospect facility effective october,a similar agreement was executed between sunrise and symphony on july,for provision of services to the pembrooke facility.
on july,despite a direct admonition by against doing so,sunrise prospect park administrator,marjorie tomes,met with certain cgb therapists.during that meeting,tomes informed the therapists that cgb had been terminated,that symphony would be the replacement therapy contractor,and that there was the possibility of employment opportunities with symphony.tomes also polled the therapists for their interest in pursuing employment with symphony and wrote down the names of those who replied in the affirmative.
on august,cgb lawyer sent a letter to tomes addressing her meeting with the therapists.the letter acknowledged the fact of tomes meeting with cgb therapists and referred to her actions as appear ing to have constituted tortious interference.
also in august,through its lawyer,sent a letter to cgb restating the reasons for termination and stating that the decision to terminate was irrevocable.the letter was in response to a series of letters and telephone messages from cgb president to various and sunrise executives seeking a specific statement of cause for termination,opportunity to cure,and reinstatement of the contract.on september,cgb sent a final letter to sunrise,stating that it had yet to receive notice of adequate cause for termination.the letter also attempted to resolve the therapist recruitment issue 
at various times in september,several of cgb therapists signed contracts with symphony.the therapists continued working for cgb,however,until symphony officially began providing services at the pembrooke and prospect facilities.on september,terminated cgb.on october,symphony began providing therapy services at the pembrooke and prospect facilities.on that same day,those among cgb therapists that had signed contracts with symphony officially left their posts as therapists with cgb and began working for symphony.
two two,on september,cgb,a citizen of pennsylvania,sued sunrise assisted,a delaware corporation having its principal place of business in virginia rha health,a north carolina corporation having its principal place of business in georgia symphony,a delaware corporation having its principal place of business in maryland and,a georgia corporation on december,pursuant to leave granted by the district court,cgb filed an amended complaint adding sunrise management,a virginia corporation having its principal place of business in virginia.cgb brought suit in the eastern district of pennsylvania,based on diversity jurisdiction,alleging tortious interference with cgb contractual relations with tortious interference with cgb relationship with its therapists breach of contract and conversion.in addition,cgb sought to pierce the corporate veil separating sunrise assisted from sunrise management,its subsidiary,asserting that any distinction between the two was a fiction.
by the time the case was tried over a year later,the only parties adverse to cgb in the district court case were the sunrise defendants the case was tried to a jury from june,to june.the jury unanimously found that sunrise tortiously interfered with the contracts between cgb and the pembrooke and prospect facilities.the verdict returned compensatory damages for that interference in the amount of.the jury verdict also specified that each of the sunrise defendants tortiously interfered with the contracts between cgb and cgb own therapists.the verdict returned compensation for that interference in the amount of.the jury awarded cgb punitive damages in the amount of,but the verdict form did not specify how the punitive damages award was allocated between the two instances of interference.
on june,sunrise moved for relief.sunrise requested that the district court enter judgment as a matter of law on its behalf,notwithstanding the jury verdicts.sunrise alternatively contended that it was entitled to a new trial due to alleged juror misconduct and the district court denial of its motion for a continuance.the district court denied sunrise motions and entered a final order on november.sunrise timely appealed.
on appeal,sunrise contends that the case should have been dismissed because the applicable two year statute of limitations ran before cgb filed the action the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law because cgb failed to establish several necessary elements of both claims of tortious interference the jury verdict with respect to punitive damages should be overturned because without the tortious interference claims cgb contentions are reduced to mere breach of contract claims,for which punitive damages are not available it is entitled to a new trial because the district court wrongly refused to grant its request for a continuance in light of the unavailability of one of its witnesses and the district court erred when it declined to grant a new trial in light of allegations that one juror violated court instructions by relying on information outside the record during deliberations.
we exercise plenary review over a district court denial of judgment as a matter of law.johnson campbell,cir.in conducting our review,we apply pennsylvania law,see erie tompkins,and ask whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference,there is sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.realty northern ins.of new york,cir.we afford de novo review to the district court conclusions of law,but review factual findings to determine whether the evidence and justifiable inferences most favorable to the afford any rational basis for the verdict.barber csx distrib,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.although judgment as a matter of law should be granted sparingly,more than a scintilla of evidence is needed to sustain a verdict.accordingly,we will grant judgment as a matter of law where the record is critically deficient of the minimum quantum of evidence in support of the verdict.johnson,at internal quotations and citations omitted.see also foster national fuel gas,cir.
pennsylvania courts apply the two year statute of limitations of.to tortious interference with contractual relations claims.see,bednar marino.the statute of limitations begins to run when the underlying cause of action accrues.bohus beloff,cir citing pocono int l raceway,pocono produce.
according to sunrise,cgb action was untimely because under pennsylvania law the appropriate accrual date for tortious interference claims is the date on which the tort victim receives notice of the allegedly interfering conduct.because cgb was notified of intent to terminate the therapy contract and of tomes recruiting conversation with cgb therapists before september,more than two years prior to the filing of the action,sunrise argues,cgb claims are beyond the limitations period.sunrise dismisses the fact that the contract at issue and the employment relationships were not actually terminated until september.
the pennsylvania supreme court and this court have repeatedly admonished,however,that a statute of limitations begins to run only once a plaintiff can assert and maintain an action.see,pocono int l raceway,at bohus,at.in other words,a claim under pennsylvania law accrues at the occurrence of the final significant event necessary to make the claim suable.barnes american tobacco,cir internal citation omitted.
under pennsylvania law,a cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations has the following elements 
the existence of a contractual,or prospective contractual relation between the complainant and a third party purposeful action on the part of the defendant,specifically intended to harm the existing relation,or to prevent a prospective relation from occurring the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the defendant and the occasioning of actual legal damage as a result of the defendant conduct.
crivelli general motors,cir see also pawlowski smorto.thus a tortious interference claim does not accrue until,at least,the plaintiff suffers injury,actual legal damage as a result of the defendant conduct.
here,cgb did not suffer actual legal damage until the termination of its contract with became effective on september.even though the allegedly interfering acts were launched before that notified cgb of its intent to terminate the contract on june,for tort was not consummated until the contract was terminated on september,and legal damage was sustained.until that time,the existing contract was in full force and effect,and any termination was revocable.
likewise,cgb did not suffer legal damage when sunrise met with cgb therapists and encouraged them to leave cgb to join symphony.that certain of cgb therapists subjectively decided to seek other employment did not legally damage cgb.it was only their departure from the rolls of cgb that occasioned legal damage.and until september,there was no exodus of therapists from cgb.
the cases cited by sunrise to support its position that the mere notice of termination triggered the claim and the limitations period are inapposite.they flow from the discovery rule,whereby the inability of the injured,despite the exercise of due diligence,to know of the injury or its cause tolls the running of the statute of limitations until such time as the plaintiff discovers,or reasonably should have discovered the injury.pocono int l raceway,at.but sunrise attempts to take that unremarkable the statute of limitations should be postponed where the victim is unaware of the reverse it,so as to mandate that the statute of limitations accelerates when the victim becomes aware that he will suffer injury in the future.that is logically fallacious.the discovery rule has nothing to do with this case 
sunrise contends that cgb did not establish an actual injury in fact as a result of sunrise alleged interference with the contract between cgb and sunrise termination and replacement of cgb as therapy provider was within the scope of its authority as agent and therefore privileged against a claim of tortious interference and cgb failed to prove that sunrise acted with tortiously culpable intent in recruiting cgb therapists.
we can quickly dispose of sunrise first agree with the district court and find that there was adequate evidence that cgb sustained actual injury in fact as a result of the allegedly interfering acts sunrise remaining two arguments require further analysis.
as noted above,in order to make out a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations,a plaintiff must show the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the defendant.crivelli,at.the actions of a principal agent are afforded a qualified privilege from liability for tortious interference with the principal contract.see maier maretti,daniel adams assocs.rimbach,laird clearfield mahoning,court of common pleas,clearfield county see also labalokie capital area intermediate unit.
the reason for this privilege is that holding an agent liable would be like holding the principal itself liable for the tort of interfering with its own contract,instead of holding the principal liable for breach of contract.the agent privilege is qualified,however,because it applies only when the agent is acting within the scope of its authority.maier,at daniel adams,at labalokie.at.conversely,an agent may be liable for tortious interference,just as if the agent were an outside third party,if the allegedly interfering acts were conducted outside the scope of the agent authority.labalokie.at.
at trial and in this court,cgb argued that sunrise acted outside the scope of its authority in interfering in cgb contract with in three ways 
first,cgb asserts that sunrise exceeded its authority when it recommended that terminate cgb as therapy provider.cgb argues that expressly authorized sunrise to do only two things physically send the termination letters to cgb and discuss the termination letters with cgb president before those letters were sent.cgb contends,therefore,that,unless sunrise received direct and explicit authorization from to recommend termination of the cgb contract,sunrise actions exceeded the scope of its authority.
cgb claim rests on an overly restrictive reading of sunrise authority as an agent of.the agreement between sunrise and which,as cgb concedes,governs the scope of sunrise agency as follows 
manager shall be responsible for the coordination of physical therapy,and use such consultants in connection therewith as manager shall elect.
manager shall on behalf of owner monitor the performance of the suppliers of all contracted services and,in owner name,terminate such contracts when deemed by manager to be in the best interests of owner 
emphasis added.this plain language unequivocally granted sunrise the express authority to terminate therapy contracts on behalf of without prior approval where termination is in interest.it is absurd to suggest that the management agreement provided sunrise the power to unilaterally terminate,but not the implicit authority to recommend termination.an agent is entitled to act under implicit,as well as express,authority.see bolus united penn bank,see also restatement second of agency cmt.c.implied authority,under pennsylvania law,is authority to bind the principal to those acts of the agent that are necessary,proper and usual in the exercise of the agent express authority.bolus,at.here,the authority to recommend termination was surely necessary,proper and usual in the exercise of the express authority to terminate.
furthermore,the agreement also imposed on sunrise an affirmative duty to be responsible for the coordination of physical therapy and monitor the performance of the suppliers of all contracted services.implicit in sunrise express authority to coordinate physical therapy and monitor suppliers performance is the authority to recommend the termination of therapy contractors if sunrise felt termination to be in interest.had sunrise failed to do so,it would likely have violated its fiduciary obligations to its principal.
cgb could only rebut sunrise explicit and implicit authority to terminate by presenting some evidence that sunrise was acting for an interest adverse to its principal.cgb did not do so.we must conclude that sunrise was privileged when it recommended to that cgb be terminated.
second,cgb argues that sunrise acted outside its authority because it did not allow cgb an opportunity to cure its performance.to support its contention,cgb asserts that specifically directed sunrise to provide cgb with an opportunity to cure any failure of performance,and that sunrise failed to comply.appellee br.at.cgb concludes that by failing to follow express mandate,sunrise acted outside the scope of its authority.
an agent disregard of his principal instructions does not necessarily place his actions outside the scope of his authority.see restatement second of agency but we need not decide in this case whether deviation from a principal instructions can rise to the degree that actually exceeds the scope of an agent authority.for here,there is simply no evidence sunrise violated a specific instruction from to provide cgb with an opportunity to cure.all did instruct was that tomes handle the termination of cgb appropriately.nothing in the record establishes that tomes or any other member of sunrise was specifically directed,by john west or by anyone else,to provide cgb an opportunity to cure.absent such a direction,the instruction to handle the termination appropriately actually recapitulates the delegation to sunrise of general agency authority to manage all aspects of the operation of the facilities and terminate such contracts when deemed by manager to be in the best interests of owner.
third,cgb asserts that sunrise exceeded the scope of its agency when it signed two contracts with symphony as a replacement therapy contracting company.cgb highlights portions of the management agreement that require approval if sunrise seeks to bind to new contracts for more than.
to the extent that cgb complains that sunrise negotiation of the symphony contracts constituted action outside the scope of its authority,cgb is again defeated by the language of the agency agreement itself.the agreement grants sunrise the broad authority to contract for all necessary services for the account of owner,with the only limitation being that any service contract providing for payments in excess of shall be subject to prior approval of owner.the quoted language authorized sunrise to negotiate for a replacement for cgb,withholding only final approval authority for the new contracts 
on the other hand,insofar as sunrise actually signed the symphony contracts,cgb is correct that sunrise exceeded its authority.but sunrise execution of the new contracts did not amount to interference with the separate contracts between cgb and.under its management contract with,sunrise had the unrestricted authority to terminate cgb,which was separate and distinct from sunrise authority to negotiate new contracts.at item.the only action by sunrise arguably not within the scope of any authority was the actual signing of the new contracts with symphony.if sunrise was acting outside the scope of its authority in executing the new agreements,that fact does not vitiate its distinct authority to terminate the former agreements.moreover,later approved the symphony contracts,thereby ratifying sunrise signature.and,most important,sunrise signing of the new contracts did not cause cgb termination.sunrise execution of the contract for cgb replacement is simply legally irrelevant to its authority to terminate cgb.
the verdict on this claim must therefore be reversed.
sunrise contends that cgb failed to prove that sunrise acted with tortiously culpable intent when it recruited cgb therapists for cgb replacement therapy provider.
cgb claim,of course,asserts that sunrise interfered in the relationship between cgb and the cgb employees.therefore,no issue of agency privilege arises because sunrise was not cgb agent.the question presented,instead,is whether intermeddling by a third party sunrise in the relationship between an employer and its employees is an actionable tort.in pennsylvania 
offering employment to another company employee is not actionable in and of itself.albee homes,caddie homes.however,systematically inducing employees to leave their present employment is actionable when the purpose of such enticement is to cripple and destroy an integral part of a competitive business organization rather than to obtain the services of particularly gifted or skilled employees,at quoting morgan home equipment martucci.further,when the inducement is made for the purpose of having the employees commit wrongs,such as disclosing their former employer trade secrets or enticing away his customers,the injured employer is entitled to protection.albee homes,at citation omitted.
reading radio,fink.additionally,section of the second restatement of torts states,in relevant part 
one who intentionally causes a third person not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other relation if 
a the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and 
b the actor does not employ wrongful means and 
c his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and 
d his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other.
restatement second of torts.thus,with respect to sunrise interference with cgb therapists,the issue is not whether sunrise actions were outside the scope of its authority as agent,but rather whether its actions were wrongful.
in defining wrongful means,the comment to section provides t he predatory means discussed in,comment c,physical violence,fraud,civil suits and criminal prosecutions,are all wrongful in the situation covered by this section.id.at cmt.c ourts,relying partly on comment e of section,have interpreted the wrongful means element of to require independently actionable conduct on the part of the defendant.brokerage concepts,healthcare,cir citing,v.at t global information solutions,cir.under this standard,wrongful means are those that are themselves capable of forming the basis of liability for the defendant.id.in national data payment systems meridian bank,cir,we recognized that the pennsylvania courts have adopted the approach set forth in section of the second restatement of torts.we noted that the pennsylvania courts have yet to adopt a definition for wrongful means,but predicted that the pennsylvania courts would adopt a meaning that included conduct that was independently actionable.see id.at.the pennsylvania courts have yet to disagree.
here,sunrise breached its fiduciary duty to when it disobeyed direct order not to recruit cgb therapists.that breach of fiduciary duty is independently actionable conduct,although the cause of action would belong to the principal and not a third party cgb.but that does not matter.even though cgb has no standing to sue sunrise for sunrise breach of fiduciary duty to,sunrise breach still meets the test of conduct that is independently actionable.conduct that is independently actionable by anyone is sufficiently wrongful to satisfy the requirements of the tort of interference.
we so held in national data.in that case,national data payment systems,ndps sued meridian bank and corestates financial group for interference with,and breach of,a contract for ndps to purchase meridian merchant credit card business.id.at.the action arose when meridian repudiated the deal with ndps after their negotiation contract expired,and then sold the same merchant credit card business to corestates.id.in part,meridian based its decision to sell to corestates,rather than ndps,on statements made by corestates to meridian regarding the prospective depth and strength of corestates merchant credit card business.id.at.ndps alleged that corestates statements were fraudulent and that its actions constituted interference.id.at.
we first determined that the lapsed contract to negotiate had become a contract terminable.national data,at.we then applied restatement section as adopted by the pennsylvania courts,and concluded that the pennsylvania courts would adopt a view of wrongful conduct that included independently actionable conduct.id.at.ultimately,we weighed corestates allegedly fraudulent statement to meridian to determine whether it was independently actionable and therefore wrongful,thus exposing corestates to liability to ndps for interference with the contract between ndps and meridian.id.at.to be sure,we determined that corestates statements did not meet the requirements of pennsylvania tort of fraud.but implicit in our analysis was the understanding that a finding of fraudulent statements by corestates to meridian would be sufficient wrongful conduct to sustain a tortious interference action by a,ndps.id.in short,we interpret the wrongful means test to be satisfied by conduct sufficiently wrongful to be actionable by someone,even if not by the party claiming tortious interference 
sunrise recruitment of cgb therapists was in breach of sunrise fiduciary duty to and independently actionable by.accordingly,it was wrongful within the meaning of restatement section.with clean hands,sunrise may have been entitled to approach cgb therapists.but when sunrise breached the fiduciary duty it owed to in order to do so,it became subject to liability for tortious interference with the contract between cgb and cgb therapists.
the jury was entitled to find,therefore,that sunrise actions were wrongful and tortious.accordingly,the district court properly refused to grant judgment notwithstanding the jury verdict on the claim against sunrise for tortious interference with the contract between cgb and its therapists.
the jury awarded cgb punitive damages for sunrise interference.but while the verdict form makes it clear that the jury found that sunrise tortiously interfered with both the contract between cgb and and the contracts between cgb and its therapists,the form did not differentiate among these acts of interference for purposes of punitive damages.thus,it is impossible to determine how punitive damages should be allocated in light of our determination that sunrise could not have interfered with the contract between cgb and.consequently,we must reverse the punitive damage determination and remand to the district court for a redetermination of punitive damages in accordance with this opinion.see rush scott specialty gases,cir woodson amf leisureland centers,cir.
on the second day of trial,the district court denied sunrise request for a continuance.the basis for sunrise request was the sudden consequent one of sunrise key witnesses,tomes.appellants contend that it was a prejudicial abuse of the district court discretion to deny that continuance.
in gaspar kassm,cir,we determined that the district court had abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance where the defendant was shown to be ill and unavailable.we stated 
it is customary to grant a continuance on the ground of illness of a party.we conclude that kassm testimony was necessary for the defense of his case,that the granting of a continuance would not have unduly prejudiced the other parties,and that the continuance motion was not motivated by procrastination,bad planning or bad faith on the part of kassm or his counsel.it is the law that where none of the foregoing appear,the denial of a continuance for illness is abuse of discretion.
id.at.appellants make much of the last sentence and suggest that we intended to establish a per se rule the absence of evidence of procrastination,bad faith,or bad district court must grant a continuance lest it abuse its discretion.we hesitate to read our holding in gaspar as a per se rule,in part,because the holding speaks in terms of discretion 
in any case,the district court did not abuse its discretion even under the broadest reading of gaspar.the district court observed that sunrise was required,as per the district court pretrial trial procedure as well as various orders,to have tomes available in court and ready to testify on the morning of june,but that,without explanation,sunrise did not do so.cgb occupational therapy,rha health servs,order dated november,at.the district court questioned whether sunrise planned to prevent cgb from calling tomes during its case in chief.id the district court then observed that,had tomes been made available on june,as was required,her testimony would have concluded before she became too ill to testify.faced with these facts,the district court concluded that sunrise motion was clearly the product of bad planning and,most likely,bad faith.id.at.the district court was well situated to determine these fact and questions and did not abuse its discretion.
sunrise motion for relief included an allegation that,on the eve of juror deliberations,juror number circumvented the district court repeated admonitions and conducted independent factfinding related to the case.specifically,sunrise alleged that the juror used the internet to conduct research into sunrise financial stability and that,during deliberations,he relied on the fruits of that research in determining a punitive damages amount.although sunrise motion,dated june,marked the first time the district court was made aware of such allegations,sunrise asserted that juror number personally admitted to his misconduct immediately after trial and in the presence of counsel for both cgb and sunrise.
the district court,mindful of the time lag between the verdict and the allegation,the problem of proving such allegations,and the circumspection appropriate in juror misconduct inquiries declined to subpoena the jury or declare a mistrial.instead,the district court assumed sunrise allegations to be true and concluded that the alleged misconduct did not taint the results of the verdic
