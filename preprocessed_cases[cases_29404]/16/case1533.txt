state,a company in the business of selling specialty chemicals,employed thomas gene hayden as a sales representative until hayden voluntarily resigned in.while employed by state,hayden signed an agreement prohibiting him from using confidential customer information acquired in the course of his employment for a period of eighteen months after his employment ended.approximately two months after his resignation,state sued hayden in federal court for allegedly breaching the terms of the agreement by selling competitive products to his former state customers.state and hayden agreed to settle the suit,and in june the district judge entered a consent judgment and order barring hayden from using confidential customer information acquired during his employment with state for an period beginning in june.
also in june,hayden began working for beta as a sales representative.like state,beta is in the business of selling specialty chemicals.in september,state moved to hold hayden in contempt for allegedly violating the terms of the june consent judgment and order.state and hayden settled the dispute,and the district judge entered a second consent judgment and order with the same terms as the previous judgment,with the period beginning in september.in june,state filed a second contempt motion against hayden,claiming to have recently learned that hayden violated the prior consent judgments with beta help and knowledge.this claim was ultimately dismissed when hayden agreed to resume employment with state.
in february,state filed the instant action against beta.state alleged that beta knew of the settlements between state and hayden,but failed to monitor hayden sales or otherwise attempt to insure that he was complying with the consent judgments.state further alleged that beta,in an attempt to circumvent the orders and agreements,directed other employees to solicit purchases from the state customers that hayden was prohibited from contacting.based on these allegations,state sought compensatory and punitive damages on claims of contempt of consent judgment and order,conspiracy to breach contract,tortious interference with business contracts,tortious interference with advantageous economic relations,misappropriation of confidential information,violations of the mississippi trade secret statute,and spoliation of evidence.beta asserted counterclaims of tortious interference with business contracts and employment relationships.these counterclaims were based in part on allegations that state offered hayden financial incentives in exchange for favorable testimony against beta in this lawsuit and as inducement for hayden to terminate his employment with beta and return to state.
beta and state for summary judgment.in june,the district court granted beta motion,finding that beta was entitled to summary judgment on all of the claims alleged by state.specifically,the district court found that the business tort claims were barred by the statute of limitations,and the contempt claim could not be brought against beta because beta was not a party to the consent judgments the district court also granted state motion for summary judgment on beta counterclaims.state now appeals.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.fabela socorro indep.sch,cir.we view all facts in the light most favorable to the,and affirm only when the evidence show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c see also coury moss,cir.
we first consider whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment on the business tort claims.the district court determined that these claims were barred by the statute of limitations because they accrued in.the district court further concluded that ann,known as the discovery rule,is not applicable to this case because the claims do not involve latent injury.state argues that this was erroneous because the alleged wrongful conduct continued from to,with much of it occurring within three years prior to its filing suit.further,state argues that the district court ruling on the discovery rule is erroneous because it failed to consider that the discovery rule is not applicable only to negligence or products liability cases.for the following reasons,we agree with the district court.
the parties agree that the business tort claims are governed by a statute of limitations.see ann.stating that a ll actions for which no other period of limitation is prescribed shall be commenced within three years next after the cause of such action accrued,and not after ann.stating that a n action under the mississippi trade secret statute for misappropriation must be brought within three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.as we have found,in mississippi,the statute of limitations runs from the time of the injury,not from its discovery.commercial servs.of perry,fdic,cir citing wilson retail credit,and central trust meridian light,so,noting that the time limited is to be computed from the day upon which the plaintiff might have commenced an action for the recovery of his demand.however,in situations involving latent injury or disease,the discovery rule tolls the limitations period until the injury could have reasonably been discovered in actions for which no other period of limitation is prescribed and which involve latent injury or disease,the cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff has discovered,or by reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury.ann.importantly,under,the cause of action accrues once a party discovers its of whether the party has also discovered the cause of the injury.see barnes koppers,cir.
accordingly,we must first determine whether the discovery rule applies to toll the limitations period until the injury was discovered or should reasonably have been discovered.as the mississippi supreme court has held,this discovery rule only applies if a latent injury is present.see archer nissan motor acceptance,cir.under mississippi law,a latent injury is one where the plaintiff will be precluded from discovering harm or injury because of the secretive or inherently undiscoverable nature of the wrongdoing in question or when it is unrealistic to expect a layman to perceive the injury at the time of the wrongful act.see ppg architectural finishes,lowery,so d,internal quotation and citation omitted.there is no rule,but f or an injury to be latent it must be undiscoverable by reasonable methods such as through personal observation or experience.id.at citations omitted.
we conclude that the discovery rule does not toll the limitations period in this case because beta allegedly unlawful actions were not undiscoverable by reasonable methods.it is clear from the undisputed record that state was capable of ascertaining whether beta,through hayden,was misappropriating confidential client information.state corporate representative testified that learning the identities of companies selling competing products to state customers was not difficult.state knew in that hayden,on behalf of beta,was contracting with his former state clients for the sale of beta products.this shows that state indeed of beta allegedly wrongful act
