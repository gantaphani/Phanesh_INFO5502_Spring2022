opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from the district court partial denial of defendants motion after a jury verdict against the city of philadelphia based on its decision to halt repairs on houses rebuilt in the aftermath of the move bombing.defendants are the city,the city redevelopment authority,and three former city officials mayor john street,former licenses and inspections commissioner edward mclaughlin,and redevelopment authority executive director herbert wetzel.plaintiffs are of the homeowners whose houses were destroyed in a fire caused by the move bombing.in,the city agreed to rebuild plaintiffs houses and to repair defects for up to ten years.after having spent million over years,the city decided in july it would make no further repairs to the houses.a federal jury rendered a partial verdict for plaintiffs.defendants filed motions,which the district court granted in part,reducing the jury award.both parties appealed.we will affirm in part and reverse in part.we will remand for an analysis of the substantive due process claim and.waiver and,if the issue has not been waived,for a determination of whether each plaintiff proved causation and damages.
this case arises from the city bombing during the administration of mayor wilson goode mayoral term of a home occupied by move,a group formed in the as part of a back to nature movement.in,the city attempted to execute an eviction order on move members living in a home in the powelton village neighborhood of philadelphia.move members resisted with gunfire,killing one police officer and wounding other officers and firefighters.nine move members were convicted and sentenced for the officer murder.
by,at least thirteen move members had relocated to a single family home at osage avenue in west philadelphia.disrupting the neighborhood with loudspeakers,move members made violent and profane threats to neighbors,police,and city officials.according to a police probable cause affidavit submitted to support arrest and search warrants,move members carried weapons,blocked the windows of their house with wooden slats,constructed a bunker on the roof,and threatened to blow up the entire neighborhood.arrest and search warrants were issued on may.on may,the police evacuated residents from the surrounding neighborhood,anticipating a raid on the move house.
in the early morning of may,police officers and firefighters surrounded the move residence.at,with a bullhorn,police announced they had arrest warrants for four move members and gave them fifteen minutes to surrender.the move members resisted,shouting back threats that they were prepared for a gun battle.after fifteen minutes,police fired tear gas and smoke projectiles at the house.firefighters sprayed the house with water to provide cover for advancing police officers.some minutes later,the police came under fire from gunshots fired from inside the house.muzzle flashes were seen coming from the rooftop bunker.
a massive gun battle ensued.police were unable to enter the house because the walls of the house were fortified.police retreated,and considered other methods to breach the defenses move had erected.later that afternoon,a police helicopter dropped a bomb on the roof of the move residence.the bomb detonation ignited several barrels of gasoline,starting a fire that killed eleven of the thirteen residents.houses on the pine and osage blocks were consumed in the blaze.the bombing,the resultant deaths,and the destruction of neighbors homes were viewed as a national tragedy.
this case involves the owners of houses on the pine and osage blocks.in the fire aftermath,the city engaged in extensive negotiations with the owners of the destroyed houses.in june,the city asked the redevelopment authority to use its eminent domain authority to acquire the damaged area for develop ment as a redevelopment project.the homeowners filed objections to the eminent plan.in april,the philadelphia city council enacted ordinance,obligating the city to rebuild the houses destroyed in the conflagration.the city also agreed to provide a warranty for certain defects from the day each homeowner moved into home.
in september,the parties entered into an agreement the agreement,in which the city agreed to build and warrant new houses in compliance with all applicable philadelphia codes,as required by ordinance,and plaintiffs agreed to waive damages claims in the eminent domain proceeding.the city enlisted the redevelopment authority,which selected a developer,edwards harper,a corporation specifically formed to rebuild the houses.the city allocated million to edwards harper through the urban local development corporation to finance the rebuilding project.edwards harper hired a general contractor,ebony construction company,of which ernest edwards was a director.
edwards misappropriated funds and was prosecuted and convicted of theft.see commonwealth edwards.edwards harper failed to complete the project.the city and the redevelopment authority hired another general contractor to complete the houses.in february,when edwards companies defaulted,the new general contractor was left with over one million dollars of unpaid costs.
for two years,plaintiffs lived in substitute housing at the city expense.in,plaintiffs moved into their newly constructed homes.but the houses were defective.within weeks of moving in,several homeowners experienced problems including leaking roofs,defective bathroom and kitchen plumbing,improper or inadequate flooring,nails popping out of walls,bursting pipes,defective electrical wiring,flooded basements and backyards,and appliances.in june,the city amended ordinance to authorize the city to hire the redevelopment authority to warrant the houses against construction,design and related defects.in january,the city and the redevelopment authority entered into a new agreement the agreement the redevelopment authority agreed to perform the city repair obligations and the city agreed to compensate the redevelopment authority.
between and,when the warranties were set to expire,the redevelopment authority conducted piecemeal repairs of reported problems,replacing roofs,stoves,dishwashers,and garbage disposals.the record suggests a continuous flow of money into the project,but does not present a clear picture of the total expenditures during that time in,the redevelopment authority estimated it would cost million to repair the original defective construction.
the city and the redevelopment authority hired the united states army corps of engineers to evaluate the cost of the remaining repairs.in,the corps issued a comprehensive report outlining the remaining necessary repairs,estimating it would cost the city and the redevelopment authority million to fulfill their warranty obligations and to bring each house into compliance with city building codes.the corps determined that repairs to the building roofing,bricks,sliding doors,siding,and account for seventy percent of the total projected remaining cost.
in,the city,the redevelopment authority,and the corps designed a solicitation for bids from private contractors to complete the repair work.on august,the redevelopment authority entered into a contract with the successful bidder,allied construction company the redevelopment construction agreement.the city allocated million to pay allied construction for the repairs.shortly thereafter,allied construction workers uncovered several other problems hidden from view until discovered in the course of conducting repairs.the redevelopment authority subsequently authorized payment of an additional.but by the end of,the estimated cost for modifications rose from to between million and million,an increase attributable to items not covered under the work original scope changed window types,brick wall modifications and window sill replacements,additional framing,and modifications to interior walls none of these additional costs had been included in allied construction original estimate.accordingly,the redevelopment authority requested another million from the city to satisfy allied construction requests and to comply with the warranty obligations.
on december,outgoing mayor edward rendell sent a letter the rendell letter to the homeowners reaffirming the city intent to complete the necessary repairs.but after mayor john street took office in january,city officials balked at the redevelopment authority request for the additional million.in a memorandum dated january,the city audit manager estimated the final cost of each warranty at for each of the houses,for a total cost of.on february,the city controller reported that the city had already incurred almost million for warranty repairs,or per house.in march,the city estimated the additional cost would range between million and million.in the agreement,the city determined the value of the houses as of may,to be approximately per house,or total.at trial,plaintiffs expert report estimated that as of march,plaintiffs would need to be reimbursed in the neighborhood of for each house in order to relocate to a similar house in another philadelphia neighborhood.
in,the city department of licenses and inspections inspected the houses and reported that no defects rendered the houses imminently dangerous.but the report noted a problem with air original construction defect that could potentially draw carbon monoxide into the houses.none of the residents had reported any carbon monoxide problems,but the city commerce director prepared a plan for relocating all of the residents.city officials soon concluded the problem rendered the houses imminently dangerous and that the houses should be treated as a blighted area.on july,plaintiffs were summoned to a meeting with the mayor at city hall.at that meeting,mayor john street presented plaintiffs with a letter informing them that the city would pay per house,plus for relocation expenses,but that the parties would be required to vacate their premises no later than september.the residents were told that if they did not move,their homes would be taken through eminent domain.of the sets of residents accepted this or a subsequent lower offer the remaining rejected the offer,and later initiated this suit.
shortly thereafter,philadelphia gas works began to plaintiffs houses,the first step in terminating gas service.plaintiffs obtained an injunction in state court against philadelphia gas works to continue service and against the city to refrain from demolishing plaintiffs houses without a court order or until the conclusion of the eminent domain proceeding.coles philadelphia,philadelphia county.comm.pl,order granting injunction.
on october,plaintiffs filed suit in state court and defendants removed to federal court.at a federal jury trial,plaintiffs sought to prove claims based on breach of contract,substantive due process,the takings clause,conspiracy,equal protection,and specific performance.on the contract claim,the jury was instructed to decide liability and damages for breach of contract on three alleged contracts the agreement the redevelopment construction agreement,and the rendell letter.
the jury found the city and the redevelopment authority liable for breach of two agreement and the rendell letter,but not the redevelopment construction agreement.the jury awarded per plaintiff in contract damages,consisting of in expectation damages against the city and the redevelopment authority and in emotional distress damages against the city million total.the jury awarded per plaintiff for substantive due process violations,consisting of per plaintiff in compensatory damages against mayor john street,in compensatory damages against the city,and in punitive damages against mayor john street in his individual capacity million total.for the takings clause claims,the jury awarded per plaintiff against the city million total.the jury also awarded per plaintiff in conspiracy damages against defendants,consisting of in compensatory damages against the mayor,in compensatory damages against the city,each in compensatory damages against wetzel,mclaughlin,and the redevelopment authority,in punitive damages against the city,and in punitive damages against the mayor million total.the district court entered judgment against defendants for a total of million,with each of the plaintiffs receiving an aggregate award of.
the case was tried before judge clarence newcomer,who died after the jury verdict.defendants filed motions.newly assigned judge john fullam granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the takings,civil conspiracy,and punitive damages claims,but rejected defendants motion for a new trial.see chainey philadelphia,no,wl.the court upheld liability on claims for breach of contract under both the agreement and the rendell letter and substantive due process.id.at.on breach of contract,the court upheld the jury award of per plaintiff in repair damages million total and per plaintiff for emotional distress million total.id.at.although the court upheld the substantive due process verdict against the city and against mayor john street in his official capacity,it awarded no recovery because plaintiffs sought only emotional distress damages for this claim.id.the court found an unacceptable overlap between the million contractual emotional distress award and the identical award for substantive due process violations.id.moreover,the court found that any award in excess of per plaintiff for emotional distress damages,caused by either breach of contract or substantive due process violations,was excessive.id.
accordingly,the district court entered judgment for breach of contract against the city and judgment for substantive due process against the city and against mayor john street in his official capacity.the aggregate award for each plaintiff was reduced to for a total of million 
all parties have appealed.defendants contend the district court erred by denying judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claims and substantive due process claims,and by denying their motion for a new trial.plaintiffs contend the district court erred by overturning the takings clause verdict and the punitive damage award against mayor john street.
breach of contract claims 
the district court declined to disturb the jury damage award based on breach of contract under both the agreement and the rendell letter.chainey,wl,at.the court held defendants waived their statute of limitations defense against the contract claims based on the agreement by failing to raise the defense until motions.id.at.it also rejected defendants argument that mayor rendell was not authorized to bind the city,concluding he had apparent authority.id.at.
we will affirm liability under the agreement,but not under the rendell letter.accordingly,we will affirm the award of contractual expectation damages based upon the agreement and reverse the award of contractual emotional distress damages based on the rendell letter.
statute of limitations 
defendants contend that pennsylvania statute of limitations for written contracts bars recovery under the agreement.a.defendants maintain the agreement expired no later than november,requiring plaintiffs to assert their claims by november.the district court found defendants waived the statute of limitations defense by failing to timely raise it.we agree.
affirmative defenses should be asserted in the appropriate responsive pleadings.c.failure to raise an affirmative defense by responsive pleading or by appropriate motion generally results in the waiver of that defense.charpentier godsil,cir although a statute of limitations defense does not necessarily have to be raised in the answer,it does not follow that a limitations defense can be raised at any time.robinson johnson,cir.in this case,it was raised too late.a statute of limitations defense,raised for the first time in a motion,is generally waived.see ernst whinney,cir finding statute of limitations defense waived when raised in the answer but never pursued until motions see also united states big d enterprises,cir finding statute of limitations defense waived when a ppellants failed to raise the statute of limitations argument until their posttrial sic motion for remittitur.
defendants first raised the statute of limitations defense to the agreement in motions.they justify their failure to plead it earlier by contending the agreement was never pleaded nor did it become an articulated theory of recovery until mentioned in the district court jury instructions.but in their amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that d efendants breached the express and implied terms and conditions of the settlement agreement,the allied construction contract,and their other legal obligations and that a s a direct and proximate result of defendants breaches of the settlement agreement,mayor rendell december,letter,the allied construction contract and related contractual obligations,plaintiffs were injured although it should have been specifically pleaded,the reference to related contractual obligations covers the related contractual obligation in the agreement.furthermore,the proposed jury instructions expressly referenced the warranty agreement as a theory of recovery.defendants raised no objection.
in ernst whinney,we found a statute of limitations defense waived where,even though pleaded in the answer,it was not pursued before or at the trial.at defendant did not file a motion or present argument before the district court on the statute of limitations issue at any time before or at the trial.after the jury verdict,defendant raised its statute of limitations arguments in motions.we found it would be grossly unfair to allow a plaintiff to go to the expense of trying a case only to be met by a new defense after trial.id.at.defendants here never raised the statute of limitations defense to the agreement until after trial.they have waived the statute of limitations defense.
defendants cite eddy virgin islands water power,cir,as authority to amend at the stage.in eddy,we held the defense of qualified immunity is not necessarily waived by a defendant who fails to raise it until the summary judgment stage.id.at.eddy is inapposite.
b.the city liability 
defendants contend plaintiffs can not recover against the city as a matter of law because the contractual obligations in the agreement ran only between the redevelopment authority and the city.contending only the redevelopment authority promised to repair plaintiffs homes,defendants argue the redevelopment authority was the only party responsible to plaintiffs under the agreement but the city assumed responsibility to repair plaintiffs houses in the agreement.it then delegated that duty to the redevelopment authority in the agreement,and promised to fund the repairs.before payment,the redevelopment authority was required to provide the city with bills and vouchers.plaintiffs were beneficiaries of the agreement,and may properly assert claims based on the agreement against both the city and the redevelopment authority.accordingly,we agree with the district court that the agreement was a valid basis for the jury contract award against the city.
the rendell letter 
defendants contend the rendell letter was not a binding contract because it lacked the approval of the city law department and finance department as required by the philadelphia home rule charter.see c plaintiffs presented no evidence that the city law department or finance department prepared or approved the rendell letter.nonetheless,plaintiffs contend defendants bore the burden and failed to put forth evidence to show the letter was not approved in accordance with the philadelphia home rule charter.plaintiffs are incorrect.under pennsylvania law,the party asserting the validity of a contract bears the burden of proof.linn employers reins,hazleton area sch.dist.krasnoff.
at issue is whether mayor rendell had actual or apparent authority to contract for the city,absent the approval of the city law and finance departments.the philadelphia home rule charter provides the city law department shall prepare or approve all contracts c.furthermore,b efore any contract shall be effective,the city director of finance shall approve it as to the availability of appropriated funds.under pennsylvania decisional law,government officials can not bind the government without the necessary statutory approval.see city of scranton heffler,radetich saitta,llp,where a municipality must execute a contract in a particular manner under legislative pronouncement,failure to comply with the pronouncement renders the contract unenforceable.quoting alco parking public parking auth.of pittsburgh,pittsburgh baseball,stadium auth.of pittsburgh,finding an oral contract with a city mayor was not binding on the city see also innes sch.dist.of nanticoke,persons contracting with a governmental agency must,at their peril,know the extent of the power of its officers making the contract.quoting charleroi lumber sch.dist.of bentleyville.
in scranton,the commonwealth court considered whether the city of scranton could be liable for the mayor written promise to pay plaintiff to audit medical claims paid by the city insurance carrier.after plaintiff submitted invoices for several months of auditing services,the city refused to pay.finding the statutory requirements for execution of municipal contracts mandatory,the court held there was no legally binding contract.scranton,at.the city of scranton administrative code provided all contracts must be reviewed and approved by the city solicitor and signed by the mayor and the controller or their designated substitutes and attested to by the city clerk.id.because these requirements had not been met,the court found no valid contract.id.
similarly in pittsburgh baseball,plaintiff was attempting to enforce an alleged oral promise by the mayor of the city of pittsburgh to contribute million towards the purchase and operation of the pittsburgh pirates baseball franchise.the commonwealth court held the alleged oral contract with the mayor was not binding on the city where the relevant city code required all contracts with the city to be in writing and to be signed by the mayor and appropriate department head and where the philadelphia home rule charter required that all contracts involving city affairs be authorized by resolution of the city council.pittsburgh baseball,at.construing the plain language of the statute,the philadelphia home rule charter,and pennsylvania decisional law,we find the rendell letter lacked actual authority to bind the city.
even if lacking actual authority,the district court held the mayor had apparent authority to bind the city it may well be that the mayor lacked actual authority,but he certainly had apparent authority chainey,wl,at.to establish apparent authority,a third party must demonstrate that he reasonably relied on his agent alleged appearance of authority.revere press,blumberg.citing william tanner,wioo,cir,plaintiffs assert they reasonably believed the mayor,as the city chief executive,had the power to contractually bind the city.in tanner,an agent of a radio station who held himself out as a general manager entered into contracts on behalf of the radio station.we held that a reasonable person might believe the radio station gave the agent authority.id.at.but that case did not involve apparent authority where a statute,ordinance,or in this case,a statute and a city home rule charter dictated the approval necessary to bind the city.
where a statute gives public notice of the required procedures for governmental contract approval,pennsylvania courts have held there is no apparent authority for contracting government agents who are not authorized by the statute.see berkheimer associates norco motors,krasnoff,at.in norco,the commonwealth court refused to enforce a settlement agreement between a local tax collector and a taxpayer over township and school district delinquent taxes because it was not approved by a majority vote of the school board,as required by the public school code for contracts exceeding.the taxpayer contended the tax collector had apparent authority to settle,citing case law holding that a lawyer may sometimes have apparent authority to settle a case on behalf of the client even absent express authority.norco,at.in rejecting this argument,the court found,the cases relied on by norco and the trial court do not involve a school district where a statute puts all persons dealing with it on notice that contracts over require approval of the school board.id.at.
similarly in krasnoff,the commonwealth court rejected the argument that school board members had apparent authority to contract absent approval by a majority vote of the school board.in krasnoff,an architect contracted with the school district to perform renovations.after meeting with individual school board members,the architect provided services beyond the scope of his original contract.the commonwealth court determined the public school code required approval by an affirmative vote of the school board to create a binding contract for the additional services krasnoff,at citing matevish sch.dist.of ramey.consistent with these cases,the rendell letter can not constitute a binding contract as the mayor lacked both actual and apparent authority under the philadelphia home rule charter to enter into such a contract.see c.
alternatively,plaintiffs contend defendants ratified the rendell letter.it is well settled that a municipal corporation may ratify contracts which are within its corporate powers and made by its officers without authority,or in excess of their authority.eckert pierotti.a municipality may waive an irregularity of a municipal contract and ratify that contract.scranton,at citing eckert,at.ratification may consist of affirmative action by the proper officials or by other action or inaction that amounts to approval of the contract under the circumstances.id.but where a previously unauthorized contract is retroactively ratified by approval,such ratification must be approved by everyone whose approval was previously required under applicable law.see also pittsburgh baseball,at finding no ratification eckert,at holding ratification existed based upon formal approval of the contract at issue.in scranton,where the court found the alleged contract lacked the required approval of the city solicitor,among others,the court also held that there was no ratification because the evidence reveal ed no approval of the city solicitor between the time of the contract and the alleged ratification.scranton,at.similarly here,plaintiffs presented no evidence of approval from either the city law department or finance department,so they can not establish ratification.
contractual damages 
defendants contend the award of contractual emotional distress damages should be overturned.the trial court explained to the jury i instruct you that only the rendell letter is eligible for emotional distress damages the jury awarded per plaintiff in emotional distress damages.in denying the motion for a new trial,the district court declined to overturn the award of emotional distress damages totaling million because the rendell letter was not a valid contract,this award must be overturned as well.
the district court declined to overturn the jury award of in expectation damages based on the rendell letter and the agreement.the trial court instructed the jury they could award expectation damages for a breach of any of the three contracts.the trial court instructed that the parties had stipulated that expectation damages should be the same whether the jury found that one or all of the potential contracts had been breached i f you find that there were three contracts,and all three of them were breached,your award would be the same as if there was but one contract breached.the jury found the city breached two of the contracts,the agreement and the rendell letter.accordingly,the breach of the agreement supports the jury award of expectation damages.we will affirm the jury award of contractual expectation damages.
substantive due process 
the jury awarded per plaintiff for substantive due process violations,consisting of per plaintiff in compensatory damages against mayor john street,per plaintiff in compensatory damages against the city,and per plaintiff in punitive damages against mayor john street in his individual capacity million total.the district court reduced this award to million,striking the punitive damages,and awarded this amount based on both the emotional distress claims and the substantive due process claims,finding the jury awards on these claims duplicative.chainey,wl,at.
plaintiffs contend the jury substantive due process verdict was grounded in evidence the city made inadequate repairs and then used tactics to remove plaintiffs from their defective homes mayor john street took office in january,as work on the homes stalled.over the next few months,city agencies decided the continuing cost of repairs would exceed allied construction estimates.during this time,mayor john street met with homeowners on at least two occasions.according to several homeowners,he initially gave the impression that the repair work would resume.at a meeting in april,he stated that the city would inspect all houses.
in june,after inspecting the homes,the department of licenses and inspection noted an original construction defect involving certain air vents through which carbon monoxide could possibly enter the homes.but the department of licenses and inspection concluded this defect did not render the homes imminently dangerous.less than one month later,in july,the mayor sent the homeowners a letter asking them to come to city hall on july.
homeowners testified they expected mayor john street to explain how the city would restart repairs.instead,the mayor handed each of them a letter stating that their homes were imminently dangerous because of possible carbon monoxide problems with the air vents.the letter gave the homeowners ten days to accept from the city in exchange for leaving their homes within days,by september,the letter explained that if an owner did not accept the offer,the city will have no choice but to take your property by eminent domain proceedings.
there was evidence presented at trial that the city and mayor john street manufactured the imminently dangerous designation to pressure the homeowners to accept the city offer and move out.the air vents were installed in,but every homeowner who testified about the of whom had detectors in their they experienced no problems with carbon monoxide in august,some of the homeowners hired a private contractor who tested twelve homes and found no signs of carbon monoxide.according to one city official,it would have taken only about one month to replace the heaters if the city had chosen to remedy the air vent issue rather than declare the homes imminently dangerous.significantly,just weeks before the july meeting,the department of licenses and inspection concluded that the homes were not imminently dangerous.even defendants accept on appeal that the jury could have found mayor street july letter was at least partly pretextual,and that the various declarations were motivated at least in part to force p laintiffs to accept the mayor offer.brief for defendants at.but defendants also assert that these improper motives were not legally cognizable because the amount offered for the homes was reasonable and the mayor actions were not for personal gain.
homeowners,the plaintiffs in this suit,rejected the city offer.according to their testimony,they were upset by how the city had treated them for years,they believed they had been lied to by mayor john street,they did not think the city financial offer was fair,and they simply did not want to move soon after deciding to reject the mayor offer,plaintiffs obtained injunctive relief in state court.but the city allegedly continued to pressure them to move out.in august,the city gas agency turned off gas and water heaters in the homes because of an unsafe condition and them,meaning they could not be used.by october,a state court enjoined the city from demolishing the homes without conducting full eminent domain proceedings and ordered the city to pay for replacement heaters.
in declining to overturn the substantive due process damages award,judge fullam held that n ot without some difficulty,i conclude that reasonable minds could well differ as to whether the defendants actions in this case were sufficiently egregious to constitute a violation of substantive due process.chainey,wl,at.but the court noted that the issue is not of crucial importance,since i conclude that most,if not all,of the damages attributable to the substantive due process violation would also be recoverable under some of plaintiffs other theories id.holding that overlapping damages were awarded for the emotional distress and substantive due process claims,the court molded the verdict.id.at.as noted,we will overturn the emotional distress claim.therefore the million damage award will depend entirely on the viability of the substantive due process claim.
the trial court instructed the jury that plaintiffs could recover damages for substantive due process violations based upon physical pain,emotional pain and suffering,mental anguish,discomfort,inconvenience,loss of enjoyment of life,distress,embarrassment,and humiliation.the bases for the substantive due process claim,instructed the trial court,were the city alleged failure to repair the houses,the of houses in the neighborhood,the offer to purchase plaintiffs houses,the threat to seize the houses through eminent domain,and the charge that the houses were imminently dangerous.the jury instructions limited the relevant conduct to the city actions between july,and the present.
defendants contend plaintiffs can not recover on a substantive due process claim because plaintiffs never properly proved damages for emotional distress.in order to recover compensatory damages for mental distress,a plaintiff must present evidence of actual injury.gunby pennsylvania,cir citing carey piphus,d spence bd.of educ.of christina sch,cir.in gunby,we held that testimony of a disappointed job applicant that he was very upset was insufficient to support an award for emotional distress.at.in carey,the supreme court noted that a lthough essentially subjective,genuine injury may be evidenced by one conduct and observed by others.at.competent evidence is required to support a damage award for an injury.id.citing gertz robert welch,d.defendants contend the testimony of several plaintiffs fails to demonstrate that the failure to properly repair the houses caused emotional distress damages.
defendants point to varying testimony on injury and damages from the plaintiffs,breaking down their testimony into five categories.first,some plaintiffs testified they suffered no harm.see,trial tr.at,q and campbell,have you suffered,had any type of that.have you suffered in any way because of this incident a no.second,some plaintiffs failed to testify that they suffered any emotional distress.third,some plaintiffs claimed emotional harm,but testified the harm was caused by the move bombing,rather than by the city later actions

q alzheimer 
trial tr.at.fifth,some plaintiffs gave vague testimony about suffering because of this incident or not being secure because of this situation.see,trial tr.at.defendants contend this testimony is insufficient to support recovery for emotional distress and could relate either to the move bombing or the city later actions.
at the same time,some plaintiffs testified they suffered damages from the city actions.one resident testified she developed high blood pressure,lost weight,and could not sleep after the july meeting with mayor john street.trial tr.at.some residents sent the city a letter in august indicating they needed stress counseling,and others testified to the indignity of living in a neighborhood filled with houses.see,trial tr.at.
judge fullam faced a difficult and sensitive task.inheriting a case tried by another judge,he was obliged to sort through some contradictory rulings and jury instructions.as a consequence,he did not reach or address defendants sufficiency of the evidence argument.nor did he analyze the substantive due process claim because the issue is not of crucial importance,since i conclude that most,if not all,of the damages attributable to the substantive due process violation would also be recoverable under some of plaintiffs other theories chainey,wl,at.but as noted supra,these damages are not recoverable under the rendell letter.thus,an analysis of the substantive due process claim is now crucial.
in addition,the court erroneously relied upon a fictitious stipulation that if plaintiffs were entitled to recover damages for emotional distress each set of plaintiffs should be awarded the same amount of money id.at.the court held,as a result,counsel must be deemed to have stipulated that each set of plaintiffs was to be awarded the same amount of damages,if damages were found to be recoverable.id.but no such stipulation exists,we directed all parties to identify the record citation for the purported stipulation,or if written,to provide a copy.in letter brief responses,neither party was able to identify it.defendants asserted that we are not aware of such a stipulation.the only stipulation identified by plaintiffs was that damages for breach of one contract would be the same regardless of how many contracts were breached.
this is not a class action suit each plaintiff must prove he or she is entitled to damages.there are sets of plaintiffs owning separate homes and presenting different and at times contrasting views of the events in question,including causation and damages.even in the class action context,the ability of each plaintiff to prove damages is often a key issue.see newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir the ability to calculate the aggregate amount of damages does not absolve plaintiffs from the duty to prove each investor was harmed by the defendants practice.by relying upon the erroneous stipulation,the court reviewed the sufficiency of the substantive due process award collectively instead of individually 
also,the court failed to address waiver with respect to both plaintiffs and defendants on the sufficiency of the evidence issue.a defendant failure to raise an issue in a rule a motion with sufficient specificity to put the plaintiffs on notice waives the defendant right to raise the issue in their rule b motion.williams runyon,cir.but if a plaintiff does not object to a defendant rule b motion specifically on the grounds that the issue was waived by an inadequate rule a motion,the plaintiff right to object on that basis is itself waived.id.at.
judge newcomer,in an august,order,directed the parties to supplement their motions with briefing on whether defendants have properly maintained a portion of their rule motion.both parties briefed this issue for the trial court.but the court opinion neither decides nor refers to the rule waiver motions.
for understandable reasons,the district court did not address the substantive due process claim,which is now critical on appeal.furthermore,the erroneous reliance on a stipulation never agreed to and the absence of analysis on important procedural issues weigh in favor of a remand.accordingly,we do not reach the merits of the defendants contentions,but instead will remand to the district court for a substantive due process and.waiver analysis and,if the issue has not been waived,a determination of whether each plaintiff can establish causation and prove damages.
defendants contend there are more fundamental problems with the substantive due process verdict.section provides remedies for deprivations of rights established by the constitution,including substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment.kaucher county of bucks,cir.to state a claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant,acting under color of state law,deprived plaintiff of a right secured by the constitution or the laws of the united states.kaucher,at citing american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.accordingly,t he first step in evaluating a section claim is to identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated and to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.nicini morra,cir en banc quoting county of sacramento lewis,d.furthermore,the core of the concept of due process is protection against arbitrary action and only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense.lewis,at.see also united artists theatre circuit,twp.of warrington,cir.the supreme court has consistently spoken of the cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that which shocks the conscience.lewis,at.see also united artists,at.
to establish a substantive due process claim,a plaintiff must prove the particular interest at issue is protected by the substantive due process clause and the government deprivation of that protected interest shocks the conscience.united artists,at.for example,we have held ownership is a property interest worthy of substantive due process protection.deblasio zoning bd.of adjustment for twp.of amwell,cir overruled on other grounds by united artists,at.in other words,here,plaintiffs must have been deprived of a fundamental property interest under the constitution.see gikas washington sch,cir.
as noted,plaintiffs contend the city deprived them of the peaceful enjoyment of their residences caused by the failure to repair the houses resulting in poor conditions,the of their houses,the declaration of eminent domain,the city determination that the houses were imminently dangerous,and the undue pressure applied by mayor john street to accept the offer to purchase their houses.the crux of plaintiffs claim is that the city falsely declared their homes imminently dangerous as a pretext to avoid completing the promised repairs.because plaintiffs remained in their houses at all times,defendants contend no deprivation occurred.in response,plaintiffs claim that courts can find a deprivation of substantive due process without an actual property loss.
further,defendants contend the relevant conduct after july,does not shock the conscience.deprivation violates due process only when it shocks the conscience,which encompasses only the most egregious official conduct.united artists,at quoting lewis,at.applying the shocks the conscience standard prevents us from being cast in the role of a zoning board of appeals.id.at quoting creative environments,estabrook,cir quoting village of belle terre boraas,d marshall,dissenting.while the meaning of the standard varies depending upon factual context,merely alleging an improper motive is insufficient,even where the motive is unrelated to the merits of the underlying decision.id.at.in eichenlaub twp.of indiana,cir,we applied the shocks the conscience standard in a zoning dispute.plaintiffs alleged that the township maligned and muzzled them,applied standards not applied to similar properties,delayed permits and approvals,improperly increased tax assessments,and pursued unannounced and unnecessary enforcement actions in denying zoning requests.id.at.but in affirming the trial court finding that the alleged conduct did not shock the conscience,we noted there were no allegations of corruption,bias against an ethnic group,or additional facts that suggested behavior.id.
we do not address these issues at this time because the trial court did not analyze the substantive due process claim or the rule waiver issue and erred in not requiring individual proof of causation and damages.we will remand for an analysis of the substantive due process claim and.waiver and,if the issue has not been waived,a determination of whether each plaintiff has adequately proven causation and damages.
new trial based on trial court questioning of mayor john street 
in motions,defendants contended judge fullam should have ordered a new trial based on judge newcomer prejudicial questioning of mayor john street defendants contend these questions demonstrated animosity toward mayor john street and defendants counsel,and suggested to the jury an answer to the ultimate issue before them.defendants maintain the trial judge misunderstood the difference between the acceptance of responsibility for the original move incident and for the current repairs,contending the jury was either left with the mistaken impression that mayor john street did not accept responsibility for the move bombing or that the court believed that the city was legally responsible for the repairs.
judge fullam characterized these questions by the trial judge as expressing surprise that mayor john street could not recall key occurrences and suggesting the mayor should have been more solicitous of the welfare of his citizens.chainey,wl,at.but as judge fullam noted,the trial judge immediately issued a curative instruction to the jury after the third exchange.id.moreover,judge fullam noted the questions might have influenced only the punitive damages award against the mayor,which he overturned.id.because the evidence on the breach of contract claims likely entitled plaintiffs to judgment as a matter of law,said judge fullam,any error would be harmless.id.
we review for abuse of discretion.adedoyin,at citing.b.evidence rule b provides that the court may interrogate witnesses.id.this has been an important and longstanding practice on the part of trial judges and should not be discouraged.see riley goodman,cir we have long abandoned the adversary system of litigation which regards opposing lawyers as players and the judge as a mere umpire whose only duty is to determine whether infractions of the rules of the game have been committed.of course,a judge must not abandon his or her proper role and assume that of an advocate.united states green,cir.but the abuse of discretion standard is a deferential one and in order to meet the standard the conduct of a trial judge must be inimical and partisan,clearly evident and prejudicial.riley,at.in making this determination,e ach case must be viewed in its own setting.id.at.
the trial judge instructed the jury that his questioning of mayor john street was directed toward the city acceptance of responsibility for the move bombing itself,not the city responsibility to warranty the rebuilt houses,the central issue in this case furthermore,we fail to see prejudice.see united states beaty,cir we must determine whether the trial judge conduct was so prejudicial as to deprive defendant of a fair,as opposed to a perfect,trial.citations omitted.
defendants also contend the trial judge questions affected their ability to disclaim responsibility for the repairs.but insofar as the jury awarded contractual expectation damages,they were based on the agreement and the expectations of the homeowners,not the testimony of mayor john street.we agree with judge fullam that the trial judge questioning did not affect the outcome.accordingly,we will affirm the denial of a new trial on this ground.
takings clause verdict 
the jury entered a verdict for plaintiffs on their takings clause claims and awarded per plaintiff.the district court reversed this verdict,finding no takings occurred because at all times plaintiffs continued to reside in their homes.hence,there was no deprivation.the district court noted that if a taking had occurred plaintiffs would have been entitled to pursue remedies under the state eminent domain statute chainey,wl,at.plaintiffs contend we should reinstate both the verdict and the damage award because they proved defendants deprived them of all economically viable uses of their property.they contend they have no remedy under the state eminent domain code because the city actions poisoned the mark
