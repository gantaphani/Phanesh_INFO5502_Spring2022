tig insurance company has sued its broker,aon re,for failing to provide complete information to a reinsurer with whom tig negotiated a reinsurance treaty.the treaty was rescinded as a result of the incomplete information,and tig asserts causes of action against aon re for negligence,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,and indemnity.tig appeals the district court summary judgment that tig take nothing.we affirm.
in recounting the summary judgment evidence,the facts will be stated in the light most favorable to tig tig provided workers compensation insurance policies to employers nationwide,and it reinsured policies issued by other insurance companies,which included reinsurance business assumed from virginia surety company.tig general practice was to retain liability for individual workers compensation claims up to a cap of million and to purchase excess loss reinsurance to cover claims exceeding that amount.
tig retained aon re,to act as its agent or intermediary in soliciting and negotiating proposals for reinsurance.tig provided aon re with information regarding tig workers compensation business,including the relevant virginia surety historical loss data.aon re used this information to prepare a package of underwriting information to send to representatives of various reinsurance companies.in may,aon re sent an information packet to web management llc,an underwriter that was acting as an agent for united states life insurance.in aon re may,cover letter to web,aon re stated that the claims diskette contained virginia surety loss data since.in accordance with tig policies,aon re provided a copy of the packet to tig for its files in may.it is disputed whether this packet included the diskettes.
in june,aon re representatives met with tig representatives to discuss quotes aon re had received.tig expressed interest in web quote on behalf of life as well as in proposals received from reinsurer swiss re,with whom tig was dealing directly.at this time,concerns were expressed by tig representatives that the data aon re had received from tig and had sent to the reinsurance market was incomplete.tig vice president in charge of its workers compensation division reviewed a may,letter from tig actuary criticizing the quality of aon re reinsurance submission,and specifically commented in an email on june,that he want ed to make sure the data aon sent to the market was good because web quote was out of line on the low side compared to the swiss re quote and quotes from other reinsurers.
regardless of these concerns,tig accepted life bid on june,and coverage was bound effective april.the reinsurance treaty subsequently signed by tig on october,and by web on life behalf on november,applied to losses occurring in the three year period commencing april,subject to the treaty being cancelled at any time by tig.tig cancelled the reinsurance treaty on january,prospectively,but the treaty continued in force to cover claims arising out of losses that occurred between april,and january.
life stopped paying claims under the reinsurance treaty in the summer of because an audit of tig operations had not been completed and tig had not provided requested information.tig demanded arbitration under the terms of the treaty,claiming outstanding payments in the amount of nearly million were due,and proceedings commenced.aon re was not a party to the arbitration.
on february,in its preliminary position statement in the arbitration,life stated for the first time that it had the right to rescind the reinsurance treaty because aon re had provided it with materially incomplete loss data by omitting the loss data for the entire virginia surety segment,which comprised a significant portion of tig insurance business.tig disputed the assertions that the data was missing and that it was material,but the arbitration panel found in favor of life and specifically stated in its findings of fact that aon re,as tig agent,had omitted the information regarding the virginia surety historical loss data.
the arbitrators determined that life was entitled to rescind the treaty with regard to the virginia surety segment of tig business,that the treaty was void ab initio to that extent,but the remainder was valid and enforceable.the arbitration panel issued a final award that directed tig to return to life plus interest of,for claims that life had previously paid for virginia surety claims,and life was required to return to tig a premium of plus of interest.therefore,because of the rescission of the virginia portion of the reinsurance treaty,tig owed life and life owed tig,with the net result that life paid tig.
tig filed the instant lawsuit against aon re on june,claiming negligence,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,and seeking indemnity.tig also sought declaratory relief contending that aon re was obligated to reimburse and indemnify tig for unreinsured liability.tig also requested attorneys fees.tig filed a partial summary judgment motion asserting that aon re should be collaterally estopped from litigating issues resolved in the arbitration proceeding.aon re filed a summary judgment motion contending that tig negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary claims were barred by statutes of limitations the discovery rule does not apply to defer accrual of these causes of action and tig indemnity claim fails as a matter of law.the district court denied tig partial summary judgment motion on the collateral estoppel issue and granted aon re summary judgment motion on the statute of limitations,discovery rule,and common law indemnity issues.the district court determined that it was unnecessary to address the other issues presented in the motions,and the court entered judgment that tig take nothing.
tig now appeals the denial of its partial summary judgment motion and the summary judgment in aon re favor.because we affirm the district court summary judgment on the statute of limitations,discovery rule,and indemnity issues,we do not reach the other issues.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,discovery,admissions,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
we first consider limitations.both parties agree that texas law governs this issue.negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims must be brought not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues,and breach of fiduciary duty claims must be brought not later than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.as we have noted,tig filed this suit on june.
under texas law,the question of when a cause of action accrues is a matter of law for the court to decide and a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes some legal injury,even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later,and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred.the supreme court of texas has also said that a cause of action generally accrues,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when facts come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy.
tig contends that it did not suffer a legal injury and could not seek a judicial remedy against aon re until the arbitration decision rescinded the reinsurance treaty with regard to the virginia surety claims,which occurred on may.tig contends in the alternative that its causes of action accrued in february,when life first asserted a right to rescind the treaty based on aon re misrepresentations.aon re contends,and the district court found,that tig causes of action accrued in june,when tig and life consummated the reinsurance treaty.
the texas supreme court decision in murphy is dispositive.in that case,an accounting firm gave faulty tax advice to its client.the texas court held that a person suffers legal injury from faulty professional advice when the advice is taken.although the court in that case applied the discovery rule,as we will discuss below,it concluded that a cause of action accrues,even when the discovery rule applies,as soon as the claimant knows or is put on notice that the advice is faulty,which may be well before a third party takes any adverse action against the plaintiff.the texas court said,a taxpayer may know his advice was faulty long before he receives a deficiency notice.for example,if a taxpayer sought other opinions upon receipt of an audit notice,or even earlier,the information obtained might put him on notice that the advice he received was wrong.in that case the cause of action accrued at the latest when the irs sent a deficiency notice accordingly,limitations could commence to run well before the irs notified the taxpayer of its contention that additional tax was owed.
tig acted on aon re representations that complete data regarding virginia security had been provided to life agent when tig accepted life proposal and entered into the reinsurance treaty.life similarly relied on aon re representations to it that the historical loss data was complete when in fact aon re omitted the virginia security data.a legal injury to tig occurred on the date the treaty with life became binding because that agreement was impaired from the outset by aon re misrepresentations.life had the right to rescind because of those misrepresentations.additionally,tig liabilities for claims made under virginia surety policies were accruing from the date the treaty was consummated,but because of aon re conduct,the treaty afforded tig inadequate coverage for those claims,and they remained tig obligations.
tig argues that if it had sued aon re before life sought to rescind the reinsurance treaty,aon re would have contended there were no damages,and therefore,tig would have had no meaningful judicial remedy.the supreme court of texas expressly rejected a similar argument in murphy campbell one of the dissenters in that case had contended that t here is no need for an accountant to be subject to a malpractice claim if the tax court concludes that his client does not owe additional taxes and the accountant advice was sound.the court held otherwise,reasoning,w hen alleged malpractice claims are not brought within a reasonable period after they are discovered or should have been discovered,accountants are severely prejudiced in mounting their defense witnesses often can not be located or have forgotten critical facts and documents frequently are misplaced or destroyed.the court concluded that if accrual of a cause of action were deferred for prolonged and indeterminate periods of time,the policy of repose underlying the statute of limitations is undermined.the proper course,the texas court explained in murphy campbell,is to abate the claimant negligence suit until any proceedings involving third parties are commenced and resolved the court recognized that it may take a considerable period of time for a plaintiff to resolve issues with third parties.but requiring a plaintiff to sue when its cause of action accrued will foreclose the specter of litigating.
the texas court thus held that even in cases in which the discovery rule applies,as it did in murphy campbell,a cause of action accrues when the alleged wrong has caused a legal injury,however slight.in the present case,tig could have sued aon re at any time from june and simultaneously pursued a declaratory judgment or other action against life to clarify or determine the validity or extent of coverage of the treaty.tig was legally injured because of the impairment of the treaty.
the texas supreme court decision in johnson higgins of texas,kenneco energy,is not inconsistent with murphy campbell the issue in that case was whether,in a suit by an insured against its agent for negligent breach of the agent duty to obtain insurance,the event was the denial of coverage by the insurance company,or the final resolution of the coverage dispute by the courts.the court held that the earlier date obtained.there was no contention in that case,however,that the plaintiff suit against its agent accrued when the agent made misrepresentations to the plaintiff and the plaintiff entered into a contract in reliance on those misrepresentations.
the district court did not err in holding that tig causes of action for negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty accrued in june.
tig contends that the discovery rule applies to its negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary claims.as a preliminary matter,aon re argues that tig waived this issue by not pleading it.while texas state procedure may require specific reference to the discovery rule in pleadings,federal law governs the pleading requirements of a case in federal court.the discovery rule need not be specifically pleaded in federal court u nder rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,it is enough that the plaintiff plead sufficient facts to put the defense on notice of the theories on which the complaint is based.the facts pleaded by tig gave sufficient notice to aon re that tig might assert that the discovery rule applies.
under texas law,the discovery rule is an exception to the general rule that a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes some legal injury when applied,the discovery rule defer s accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff knew or,exercising reasonable diligence,should have known of the facts giving rise to a cause of action.the determination of whether the discovery rule applies to a particular cause of action is a question of law 
prior to the texas supreme court decisions in computer associates international,altai,and the reasoning that supported the texas courts decisions to apply the discovery rule in particular cases was diverse,somewhat inconsistent,and often overly broad.the texas supreme court attempted to bring predictability and consistency to its jurisprudence in this area in altai and the court articulated two unifying principles that generally apply in discovery rule cases.they are that the nature of the injury must be inherently undiscoverable and that the injury itself must be objectively verifiable.
importantly,the texas court explained that whether the discovery rule applies is determined categorically 
the supreme court of texas explained in altai that the applicability of the discovery rule is determined categorically.although the particular injury in altai may not have been discovered,it was the type of injury that generally is discoverable by the exercise of reasonable diligence while some trade secret misappropriations might not be quickly discovered,this isolated fact does not alter the reality that,in most cases,trade secret misappropriation generally is capable of detection within the time allotted for bringing such suits.
that is because s tatutes of limitations are not directed to the merits of any individual case they are a result of legislative assessment of the merits of cases in general.
an injury is inherently undiscoverable if it is by nature unlikely to be discovered within the prescribed limitations period despite due diligence.the injury in this case,the consummation of an agreement between tig and life that was based on incomplete underwriting data,is not inherently undiscoverable because it is the type of injury that could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence an entity in tig circumstances has numerous sources from which it could determine whether accurate information was sent to one with whom it was negotiating a contract.a starting point is the company own files.another source is the party with whom it is about to contract.inquiry could be made to determine or confirm the facts and assumptions on which the bargain was to be based.
in the present case,there was summary judgment evidence that tig vice president in charge of its workers compensation division sent an internal email before accepting life bid,stating,i want to make sure the data aon sent to the market is good.a red flag had been raised because life bid was so low.the tig claims that he instructed an employee in tig actuarial department to follow up on this concern,but washburn testified that he did not recall that conversation.while fact questions exist as to exactly what
