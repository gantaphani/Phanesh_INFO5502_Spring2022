this declaratory judgment action concerns a dispute over royalty payments on a highly profitable natural gas well located on property owned by jim wingate and subleased to hs resources,hsr following a hearing on opposing dispositive motions,the district court entered final judgment.it denied wingate motion to dismiss and granted hsr motion for partial summary judgment,declaring that hsr could pool wingate leased land with neighboring acreage and pay wingate royalties on a pooled basis.acting sua sponte,the court also held that hsr past payments to wingate calculated on a basis had been made voluntarily and therefore could not be recaptured.it subsequently denied hsr motions to amend the judgment and award attorney fees.both parties appealed.we now affirm the district court final judgment in part,reverse it in part,and vacate it in part.we further vacate the court denial of hsr motion for attorney fees.finally,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

among other terms,paragraph of the lease expressly grants the lessee the right to pool the leased land with adjacent tracts to form one or more drilling or production units 
subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth,lessee is hereby given the power and right,without lessor joinder or further consent,to at any time pool and unitize the leasehold estate with the rights of the third parties,if any,in all of the land described herein and with any other land whether owned by lessee or some other person,firm or corporation,so as to create by such pooling and unitization one or more drilling or production units,when to do so would,in the sole judgment of the lessee,promote the conservation of oil,gas or other liquid hydrocarbons.
this right to pool is subject to a requirement that the lessee pool all leased land 
lessee shall not be granted the right to pool any of the leased premises for the drilling of or production from any well located on the leased premises which is anticipated to be classified,or ultimately classified,as a gas well by the governmental entity having jurisdiction over same unless all of the leased premises is located either within the pooled unit for such well or within a unit for another gas well producing in commercially paying quantities from the same formation.
this paragraph also limits pooled units to acres in size

on march,hsr completed drilling a well the wingate well on wingate property.on march,hsr filed a unit declaration creating a pooled area described as the hs et.unit unit for the purpose of gas production from the wingate well the unit consists of five tracts of land encompassing acres.the declaration shows that the five tracts consist of,and acres.the record evidence shows that wingate owns of the gas rights in the and acre tracts of the gas rights in the tract,net acres of the gas rights in the tract,net acres and of the acre tract.thus,although he owns acres of the land included in the unit,his contribution to the unit amounts to only net acres when his gas rights in those acres are considered.in other words,wingate controls only of the gas produced by the unit 
on march,wingate objected to the formation of the unit,claiming it violated the terms of the lease because it did not incorporate all his leased property.the wingate well began producing gas on april.on may,hsr,aspect,and esenjay filed a release of all land leased from wingate that was not included in the unit.on the same day,hsr filed a supplemental unit declaration confirming the unit.
on may,wingate sued hsr in texas state court state lawsuit,asserting that the formation of the unit was invalid under the terms of the lease.after he filed the state lawsuit,but not as a part of it,wingate demanded hsr pay him royalties on the wingate well as if the well were not part of a pooled unit.the difference in the calculation of royalties is significant payment on a basis amounts to of the market value of all the gas produced by the well,whereas payment on a pooled basis amounts to of the gas attributed to his stake in the unit.wingate threatened to terminate the lease if hsr refused to pay him on a basis.faced with this threat,hsr sent wingate a check for,which included royalties calculated on a basis plus interest.a letter accompanying the check clearly stated that hsr was paying the amount under protest and reserved its right to sue for overpayment if the lease was determined to allow pooling wingate subsequently entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with aspect and esenjay.wingate voluntarily dismissed the state lawsuit on january.
hsr thereafter paid wingate royalties on a basis as to its interest and on a pooled basis as to aspect and esenjay interests.wingate again threatened to terminate the lease if he was not paid solely on a basis.hsr then began to pay royalties,again under protest,on a basis as to the entire lease.
on may,hsr sued wingate in federal court,seeking a declaration that pooling was proper under the terms of the lease,the recapture of its past payments to wingate in excess of royalties calculated on a pooled basis,and attorney fees.in response to hsr complaint,and instead of filing an answer,wingate moved to dismiss pursuant to rule b,and of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that hsr had failed to join the other parties with property interests in the unit.hsr moved for partial summary judgment on the limited question of whether the lease allowed pooling.wingate responded to hsr motion but still did not file an answer.hsr also moved for a preliminary injunction ordering wingate to set aside the money at issue in the recapture claim.
the district court heard arguments on the parties dispositive motions but not on hsr motion for a preliminary injunction.it subsequently denied wingate motion to dismiss,concluding that the other members of the wingate unit do not have a stake in this litigation,and the plaintiff is not required to join them.it simultaneously granted hsr motion for partial summary judgment,holding that the lease allowed for pooling and payment of royalties on a pooled basis.acting on its own initiative,the court also held that hsr payment was voluntary and could not be recaptured.finally,it dismissed hsr preliminary injunction motion as moot based on its recapture ruling.
hsr moved the district court to amend the judgment as to its recapture claim,offering evidence supporting its argument that its payments on a basis had been made under protest and were not voluntary.hsr also moved for in attorney fees.wingate untimely moved the court to amend the judgment.the district court denied hsr motions without discussion.it altogether ignored wingate motion.these appeals followed.
we face three issues.first,wingate challenges the district court denial of his motion to dismiss.next,both parties challenge different aspects of the court summary judgment decision.finally,hsr challenges the court denial of its motion for attorney fees.
wingate moved pursuant to rule b to dismiss hsr lawsuit for failure to join the other owners of land and gas interests in the unit royalty owners.rule b allows dismissal for failure to join a party under rule.rule provides for the joinder of all parties whose presence in a lawsuit is required for the fair and complete resolution of the dispute at issue it further provides for the dismissal of litigation that should not proceed in the absence of parties that can not be joined we review a district court decision to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party under rule under an standard.we therefore review the district court denial of wingate rule b motion for abuse of discretion.
rule b analysis entails two inquiries under rule.the court must first determine under rule a whether a person should be joined to the lawsuit.if joinder is warranted,then the person will be brought into the lawsuit.but if such joinder would destroy the court jurisdiction,then the court must determine under rule b whether to press forward without the person or to dismiss the litigation factors to consider under rule b include prejudice to an absent party or others in the lawsuit from a judgment whether the shaping of relief can lessen prejudice to absent parties whether adequate relief can be given without participation of the party and whether the plaintiff has another effective forum if the suit is dismissed.
in this case,the district court correctly determined that the other royalty owners need not be joined.in the context of litigation over one lessor contribution to a pooled unit,the presence of the other lessors is not required unless the judgment effectively precludes them from enforcing their rights and they are injuriously affected by the judgment.in this case,joinder of the other royalty owners was not warranted because the leases they entered into with interstate required that they be paid royalties on a pooled basis regardless of whether the unit was determined to be valid or invalid as to any other owner.our review of these leases,which are included in the record,supports the district court conclusion.accordingly,we agree that the outcome of this litigation will not alone adversely rights of other royalty owners the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying wingate motion to dismiss 
both parties challenge aspects of the district court grant of summary judgment.wingate contends that the ruling was premature and,in any event,improperly concluded that the unit was valid under the lease and that hsr owed royalties only on a pooled basis.hsr argues that the court improperly found that its prior payments of royalties to wingate calculated on a basis were voluntary and could not be recaptured.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as below summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law we likewise review matters of contract interpretation de novo we will not set aside a district court factual findings,unless they are clearly erroneous.
as we stated above,wingate moved to dismiss in lieu of filing an answer to hsr complaint.wingate complains that the district court simultaneous denial of his motion and grant of summary judgment for hsr on the contract interpretation issue prevented him from filing an answer to hsr complaint.in essence,he contends that the court denied him notice before entering final judgment.this claim of error is meritless.rule permits a motion for summary judgment to be made at any time after the expiration of days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment.hence,an answer is not a prerequisite to the consideration of a motion for summary judgment furthermore,the record shows that wingate responded to hsr motion for partial summary judgment and appeared at the hearing on the parties respective motions.given these facts,wingate had clearly made an appearance in the suit and therefore was not denied notice or an opportunity to be heard before the entry of final judgment accordingly,the district court did not err in deciding hsr motion for partial summary judgment at the same time it disposed of wingate motion to dismiss.
hsr raises a somewhat similar complaint,arguing that the district court deprived it of an opportunity to be heard before granting summary judgment for wingate on the question of whether it could recapture the royalty payments it had made on a basis.unlike wingate complaint,however,hsr complaint concerns the court resolution of an issue that neither party had yet asked it to resolve.
a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte so long as the losing party has notice and an opportunity to come forward with evidence this requirement follows from the rule that a motion for summary judgment shall be served at least days before the time fixed for the hearing.the purpose of such a requirement is it enables the to place all the evidence supporting its position into the record so that a reviewing court can decide whether the has demonstrated the existence of a genuine dispute regarding a material fact.we have stated that any reasonable doubts about whether a received notice must be resolved in favor of that party 
in this case,the record clearly shows that hsr had neither notice nor an opportunity to present evidence before the district court held that it had voluntarily made the disputed royalty payments and that it could not recapture anything from wingate.the first time the specter of the voluntariness of hsr payment arose was during the hearing on the parties dispositive motions,and even then it was mentioned only in passing by the court.we find that the court fleeting comment did not provide sufficient notice to hsr that it intended to dispose of the recapture issue.more to the point,the court afforded hsr no opportunity to present evidence on the recapture issue before it ruled.accordingly,we hold that the district court recapture ruling was erroneous.
in order to smooth the way on remand,we turn briefly to the law controlling the issue of whether hsr payments to wingate were voluntary.the district court ruling rested on an incomplete statement of this law.it is true that money voluntarily paid can not be recovered in the absence of fraud,duress,or compulsion it is also true that this rule applies even though the payor protests at the time against his liability.but what constitutes a voluntary payment depends upon whether the facts in a particular case indicate an intention on the part of the payor to waive his rights.for example,a payment made with a reservation of the right to bring suit for recovery is not a voluntary payment.accordingly,it would appear that hsr payments to wingate may be recoverable as having been involuntarily made whether hsr intended to waive its overpayment claim,however,is a question best left to be answered on remand 
as we explained above,the district court declared that the lease allowed hsr to pool wingate land with that of adjacent property owners to create the unit.wingate attacks this ruling from two angles.first,he argues that it is contrary to the express terms of the lease.second,he argues that the unit was formed in bad faith.we reject both arguments.
under texas law,oil and gas leases are interpreted like other c
