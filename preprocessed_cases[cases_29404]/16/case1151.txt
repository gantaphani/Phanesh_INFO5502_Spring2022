discussion 
appellants attack the ordinance and appellees conduct preceding the passing of that ordinance with four federal claims a facial fifth amendment just compensation takings claim,a facial sdp claim against the ordinance,a sdp claim against appellees conduct,and a facial epc claim against the ordinance.the district court only evaluated the ripeness of the just compensation takings claim.neither the parties nor the district court questioned whether the sdp or epc claims were ripe.we asked the parties to address this issue at oral argument because considerations of ripeness are sufficiently important that we are required to raise the issue sua sponte even though the parties do not.felmeister office of attorney ethics,cir.
the ripeness doctrine serves to determine whether a party has brought an action prematurely and counsels abstention until such time as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional and prudential requirements of the doctrine.khodara,blakey,cir quoting peachlum city of york,cir.in williamson county regional planning com.hamilton bank,d,the supreme court held that an fifth amendment just compensation takings claim against a municipality enforcement of a zoning ordinance is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue the finality rule,and the plaintiff has unsuccessfully exhausted the state procedures for seeking just compensation,so long as the procedures provided by the state were adequate.
williamson prong one the finality rule 
we have said that williamson s finality rule bars not only just compensation takings claims,but also substantive due process and equal protection claims by property owners or tenants who have challenged the denial of a permit by an initial but failed to take advantage of available,subsequent procedures.lauderbaugh hopewell,cir see also taylor,upper darby,cir barring plaintiff sdp and epc claims against municipal land use decision as unripe.only once a decision maker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue has a property owner been inflicted with an actual,concrete injury.williamson,at.this rule does not apply,however,to facial attacks on a zoning ordinance,a claim that the mere enactment of a regulation either constitutes a taking without just compensation,or a substantive violation of due process or equal protection.see,taylor,at final decision not necessary for facial sdp and epc claims sinclair oil county of santa barbara,cir final decision not necessary for facial takings claims.a final decision is not necessary in that context because when a landowner makes a facial challenge,he or she argues that any application of the regulation is unconstitutional for an challenge,the landowner is only attacking the decision that applied the regulation to his or her property,not the regulation in general.eide sarasota county,cir.we will apply the finality rule to each of appellants constitutional claims in turn.
fifth amendment just compensation takings claim 
the fifth amendment,made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment,proscribes the taking of private property for public use without just compensation.const.amend.v,xiv cowell palmer,cir.count three of the complaint alleges that the ordinance and other actions of the defendants regulated appellants property into a state of economic inutility without just compensation in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the district court dismissed this claim on ripeness grounds because appellants failed to comply with both prongs of the williamson ripeness test.
appellants correctly argue that the finality rule only applies to takings claims,and that they only challenge the ordinance on its face.in williamson,the plaintiff landowner alleged that a local planning commission rejection of its development plat under local regulations was a fifth amendment taking without just compensation because the decision denied the plaintiff all economically viable uses of its property.at.in contrast here,appellants do not challenge any particular decision of the township or planning board applying the ordinance to their property instead,they allege that the mere enactment of the ordinance has denied them all economically viable use of their property,a facial attack on the ordinance.thus,their facial fifth amendment just compensation takings claim need not comply with the finality rule.see suitum tahoe reg l planning agency,d f acial challenges to regulation are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed,but face an uphill battle,since it is difficult to demonstrate that mere enactment of a piece of legislation deprived the owner of economically viable use of his property.internal citations and quotations omitted.
the complaint also alleges that appellees other actions,in addition to the passage of the ordinance,violated the takings clause.the district court only addressed the takings allegations with regard to a facial attack on the ordinance,and this has not been challenged by appellants.any argument they might make at this point has been waived.
substantive due process claims 
the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.to prevail on a substantive due process claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that an arbitrary and capricious act deprived them of a protected property interest.taylor,at.although the district court only recognized one sdp claim,we read the complaint as alleging two the first addressed to the face of the ordinance,and the second addressed to appellees allegedly obstructive conduct during the time preceding the ordinance enactment.
sdp claim as to the ordinance 
in taylor investment,we held that williamson s finality rule applies to due process and equal protection challenges to the application of a ordinance.at.in that case,the plaintiff landowner brought sdp and epc challenges against a township and its officials after a township zoning officer revoked a tenant use permit for allegedly supplying false or misleading information in his permit application.the plaintiff claims were not ripe under the finality rule,we held,because plaintiff failed to appeal the zoning officer decision to the zoning hearing board,which had the exclusive authority to render a final adjudication under the terms of the pennsylvania municipal planning code.only a decision by the board could represent a final revocation of the plaintiff permit and until then the impact of the zoning ordinances on plaintiff property would not be clear.id.at.
appellees claim that appellants were similarly required to seek a variance under stat.ann.for their use before their sdp and epc claims would be ripe under taylor investment.just as with their just compensation takings claim,however,appellants attack the ordinance facially,they allege that,in all of its possible applications the ordinance lack s any legitimate reason and is arbitrary,capricious,and not rationally related to any legitimate government interest.app.we stated in taylor investment that williamson s finality rule only applies to challenges,such as the one asserted in that case,and not to facial due process claims.at.other courts have also held that seeking a variance,complying with williamson s finality test is not a prerequisite to a plaintiff claim that the enactment of a zoning ordinance,in and of itself,violates the due process clause.see,pearson grand blanc,cir executive,martin county,cir so.pacific transp.los angeles,cir eide sarasota,cir smithfield concerned citizens town of smithfield,cir.
appellants seize upon taylor investment s distinction,and argue that their attack on the ordinance is a facial one only and that we should hold that a facial substantive due process challenge to a zoning on the theory that the law as a whole is arbitrary,capricious and ripe even if the plaintiff did not seek a variance from the zoning ordinance.we so hold.
ii.sdp claim as to appellees conduct 
appellants argue that the district court gave an unduly narrow construction to their sdp and epc claims by interpreting them only as attacks on the ordinance,because they have also alleged that the defendants abused the zoning process in the township of roxbury to deprive the plaintiffs of lawful use of their property,out of impermissible personal and political animus.appellants letter br.appellants claim that this other conduct does not have to comply with williamson s finality rule under our decision in blanche road bensalem,cir.
in blanche road,we held that a plaintiff landowner need not comply with the finality rule where,instead of appealing from an adverse decision on a permit application,the plaintiff claimed that the defendant township officers deliberately and improperly interfered with the process by which the township issued permits,in order to block or to delay the issuance of plaintiff permits,and that defendants did so for reasons unrelated to the merits to the application for the permits.at.it was asserted by the plaintiff that the township engaged in a campaign of harassment designed to force it to abandon its development of an industrial park.id.at.we explained that this type of sdp claim is substantively different from that presented in the ripeness cases and that s uch actions,if proven,are sufficient to establish a sdp violation,actionable under,even if the ultimate outcome of plaintiff permit applications was favorable.id.at.thus,no further appeals were necessary in order to have a ripe,final determination for a federal court to review.
appellants applied to the planning board in for approval to merge two tracts in order to extend their sand and gravel extraction operations.they allege in their complaint that appellees attempted to impose unreasonable and unlawful restrictions on their use of their property in violation of a agreement,to condition approval of their application on terms in violation of the agreement,to defeat their application by erroneously attributing environmental contamination from other sources to their extraction operations,and made false public accusations against appellants during the application process.additionally,they claim that the bodolsky investigation and his subsequent letter to the township made false accusations about appellants extraction operations in order to restrict and impede soil extraction and related activity which previously had been agreed,approved,requested by roxbury.
these allegations are similar to those asserted by the plaintiff in blanche road.as we held in that case,such claims are sufficient to establish a ripe sdp claim,regardless of the outcome of subsequent appeals for relief to municipal zoning boards.thus,appellants claim that appellees course of conduct,separate and apart from the enactment of the ordinance,violated their sdp rights is ripe for federal adjudication.
equal protection claim 
the fourteenth amendment prohibits a state from deny ing to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend xiv.in count two,appellants allege that the enactment of the ordinance was discriminatory,arbitrary,capricious,unreasonable,malicious,improperly motivated and,and sought to deprive the plaintiffs of the use of their property,whereas other proximate similarly situated properties were not rezoned in the same manner,in violation of the equal protection clause.app.
these allegations constitute a facial challenge to the ordinance,and,accordingly,appellants epc claim is ripe.the essence of this claim is that the mere enactment of the ordinance violates the equal protection clause because it arbitrarily treats appellants differently than other similarly situated property owners.this is not a case where a municipality has enacted a general ordinance and a homeowner objects to the application of the ordinance to his or her property.here,the township knew exactly how appellants intended to use their land and passed the ordinance specifically tailored to prevent that use.williamson s finality rule responds to the high degree of discretion characteristically possessed by boards in softening the strictures of the general regulations they administer.suitum,at.it has no application where,as here,there is no question about how the regulations at issue apply to the particular land in question.id.at.quoting williamson,at.see also palazzolo rhode island,d while a landowner must give a authority an opportunity to exercise its discretion,once it becomes clear that the agency lacks the discretion to permit any development,or the permissible uses of the property are known to a reasonable degree of certainty,a takings claim is likely to have ripened.it would be an exercise in futility to require appellants to seek a variance from an ordinance specifically directed at their properties.accordingly,their facial challenge is ripe.see hacienda valley mobile morgan hill,cir facial challenges are exempt from the first prong of the williamson ripeness analysis because a facial challenge by its nature does not involve a decision applying the statute or regulation.
williamson prong two exhaustion of just compensation procedures 
the second prong of the williamson ripeness test states that if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the plaintiff must have exhausted this procedure in order for his or her takings claim to be ripe for federal adjudication.williamson,at.of course,there is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a action.id.at.citing patsy board of regents of the state of florida,d.instead of being a true exhaustion of state remedies requirement,however,the second prong of williamson s ripeness test merely addresses a unique aspect of just compensation takings claims.because the fifth amendment bars not just the taking of property,but the taking of property without just compensation,a plaintiff can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until he or she has exhausted a state procedure for seeking just compensation.id.at.only then can a takings claimant allege that he or she has actually been denied just compensation,and,thus,only then is his or her takings claim ripe.id.at.we,therefore,will apply the second prong of williamson ripeness test to appellants various constitutional claims.
fifth amendment just compensation takings claim 
as stated above,the district court erroneously found that appellants takings claim failed to satisfy the finality rule.it correctly held,however,at the time of the motion to dismiss,that the takings claim was nevertheless unripe because appellants failed to exhaust state just compensation procedures.app.while the fact that appellants allege a facial just compensation takings claim against the ordinance may save them from the finality rule,it does not relieve them from the duty to seek just compensation from the state before claiming that their right to just compensation under the fifth amendment has been violated.this is true regardless of whether a claims that he was deprived of all of his property economically viable uses by the mere enactment of a zoning ordinance,or by a municipality application of a zoning ordinance to that land.see sinclair oil county of santa barbara,cir.
although the district court correctly determined that the facial just compensation takings claim failed to satisfy the second williamson prong at the time of the motion to dismiss,the supreme court of new jersey denied review of appellants state court appeal while this appeal was pending before us.see county concrete township of roxbury.accordingly,the second williamson prong no longer prevents appellants from asserting that the mere enactment of the ordinance deprived them of the economically viable use of their property,and,thus,we will reverse the district court conclusion that the claim was unripe 
substantive due process claim and equal protection claim 
in contrast to a just compensation takings claim,the remedies for a successful substantive due process or equal protection claim as to the face of a zoning ordinance are the invalidation of the regulation and actual damages.the absence of just compensation is not part of a due process or equal protection injury.see williamson,at.thus,given that the exhaustion of just compensation procedures requirement only exists due to the special nature of the just compensation clause,it is inapplicable to appellants facial sdp and epc claims.because both claims satisfy the finality rule,they are ripe for adjudication.id.at.
merits of the substantive due process claims 
sdp claim as to the ordinance 
the district court dismissed appellants sdp facial challenge to the ordinance on the ground that s electing a recognized use of land and setting lot sizes of three acres on the face of a zoning ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate state interest,and is not egregious governmental abuse or official conduct against liberty or property rights that shock the conscience.app.
the facial challenge being ripe,we first reject appellees contention,with which the district court agreed,that under united artists theatre circuit,twp.of warrington,cir,government action does not violate substantive due process when merely motivated by an improper motive,as we had formerly held,but now must rise to the higher level of shock ing the conscience,a standard,appellees allege,with the same practical effect as a taking.appellees letter br.but united artists did not apply the shocks the conscience standard to legislative action rather,we clearly held in united artists that executive action violates substantive due process only when it shocks the conscience.united artists,at emphasis added.there is a distinction in the standard of review for legislative and executive acts that allegedly violate substantive due process.as judge,now justice,alito explained in nicholas pennsylvania state,cir,typically,a legislative act will withstand substantive due process challenge if the government identifies the legitimate state interest that the legislature could rationally conclude was served by the statute.id.citation omitted.on the other hand,state action violates substantive due process if arbitrary,irrational,or tainted by improper motive,or if so egregious that it shocks the conscience.id.citations omitted 
when a municipal body in new jersey acts to either recommend or vot e for a change in the permitted uses in a zoning district,the act is legislative in character.see timber properties chester,see also bow arrow manor,west orange,it is fundamental that zoning is a municipal legislative function.f ederal judicial interference with a state zoning board decisions,like invalidation of legislation for irrationality or arbitrariness,is proper only if the governmental body could have had no legitimate reason for its decision.phillips borough of keyport,cir alito,concurring and dissenting quoting pace resources,shrewsbury,cir emphasis added in pace see also nicholas,at.thus,for appellants facial substantive due process challenge to the ordinance to be successful,they must allege facts that would support a finding of arbitrary or irrational legislative action by the township.pace,at.
in pace,we affirmed the dismissal of a landowner sdp challenge to the facial validity of a zoning ordinance because the complaint fail ed to make any factual allegations that indicate d irrationality,and merely alleged that the zoning change in question did not conform to the spirit and general guidelines of the comprehensive plan which encouraged industrial development.id.we explained that such an allegation only indicated that political compromise and difference of opinion were motivating the zoning ordinance.things would have been different,we suggested,had the plaintiff present ed a case involving actions aimed at this developer for reasons unrelated to land use planning.id.
appellants have alleged facts that indicate irrationality and arbitrariness,and present a case involving actions aimed at appellants for reasons unrelated to land use planning.see id.the complaint charges appellees with attempting to impede appellants sand and gravel extraction operations on one tract,and their attempts to expand to another tract,through false accusations,verbal disparagement and the imposition of illegal conditions and restrictions on their business in violation a agreement.on the heels of this alleged animus,the township enacted the ordinance,which rezoned appellants land from industrial to either rural residential or open space.while the land in question is of an industrial nature and has been zoned for industrial uses for close to fifty years,the new designations only permit detached dwellings and a minimum lot size of three acres.allegedly,this action was taken knowing that it violated appellants legal and contractual rights.there is nothing in the complaint that would indicate any possible motivation for the enactment of the ordinance other than a desire to prevent appellants from continuing to operate and expand their extraction business.such animus is not a legitimate reason for enacting a zoning ordinance,see brady town of colchester,cir,and is unrelated to land use planning.see pace,at.thus,appellants have alleged facts which,if true,state a claim that the ordinance,on its face,violates substantive due process.while their claim may be ultimately unsuccessful if the township is able to demonstrate a legitimate reason for the ordinance,there was no basis for a rule b dismissal.
sdp claim as to appellees conduct 
as we noted above,appellants argue that the district court reduced count one to bald allegations of a substantive due process violation for enacting a zoning ordinance,but that the ir complaint undeniably entails much more than this.we agreed with that characterization,and discussed blanche road,where the sdp claim was that the defendant township officers engaged in a campaign of harassment designed to force it to abandon its development of an industrial park.at.in blanche road,we reject ed defendants argument that the plaintiff failed to assert a constitutional claim because it has no vested property right that could be subject to a due process violation,inasmuch as the plaintiff had the right to be free from harassment in its land development efforts.id.at.appellants have leveled similar allegations of harassment and obstruction and have,therefore,stated a substantive due process claim.
merits of the equal protection claim 
the district court dismissed appellants equal protection challenge to the ordinance,summarily holding that roxbury changes to the zoning ordinance do not present a basis for an equal protection claim.app.appellants argue that the district court erred because e ven though the ordinance does classify by race,alienage or national origin,it is unreasonable,arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a permissible state objective.appellants br.
unlike a substantive due process challenge,where the question is whether it was irrational for a township to have passed a zoning law at all,in an equal protection challenge the question is whether the township has irrationally distinguished between similarly situated classes.rogin bensalem,cir.thus,the first inquiry a court must make in an equal protection challenge to a zoning ordinance is to examine whether the complaining party is similarly situated to other uses that are either permitted as of right,or by special permit,in a certain zone.congregation kol ami abington,cir.if the entities are similarly situated,then the township must justify its different treatment of the two,by demonstrating that the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.rogin,at.
the complaint charges appellees with taking discriminatory actions,and with seeking to deprive the plaintiffs of the use of their property,whereas other proximate similarly situated properties were not rezoned in the manner of the plaintiffs property nor were they accorded the treatment suffered by the plaintiffs and complained of herein.app.these conclusory allegations do not suggest what similarly situated property was not rezoned in the same manner,nor do they offer any facts demonstrating how those properties were similarly situated.see ventura mobilehome cmtys.owners ass city of san buenaventura,cir dismissing facial epc claim against zoning ordinance,in part,because the plaintiff conclusory allegations of being singled out,from all property owners in defendant city did not identif y other similarly situated property owners or alleged how they are treated differently.to state a claim,the complaint must allege facts supporting a finding of irrational or arbitrary legislative action by the township.see pace,at.without any facts,we have no way of determining whether the ordinance discriminated against appellants properties,and if so,whether there was a possible rational basis for that discrimination.see,congregation kol ami,at analyzing whether country clubs,which were exempted from a zoning ordinance,are similarly situated to plaintiff synagogue,which was denied an exemption.the complaint is similarly bereft of any indication of how appellees other conduct violated appellants equal protection rights.we will affirm the district court dismissal of count two.at least as currently pled,it does not state a claim.
legislative immunity 
in addition to dismissing appellants sdp,epc and takings claims in counts one,two and three for lack of ripeness failure to state a claim,the district court dismissed those claims against all seventeen individual defendants on the ground of absolute legislative immunity.it dismissed appellants claim for tortious interference with contractual rights and prospective economic damage in count four on this ground as well as to all individual defendants except bodolsky.the district court simply concluded that the ordinance was adopted by the defendants following the defendant planning board preparation of a master plan thus all of the defendants were involved in the local legislative process in adoption of zoning ordinances of which plaintiffs complain app.as for bodolsky,the district court wrongly assume d that he is a member of the township legislative body app.
members of local legislative bodies,such as municipal planning boards,are entitled to absolute legislative immunity for actions taken in a purely legislative capacity.acierno cloutier,cir en banc.to determine whether actions are legislative for immunity purposes,we have set out a test the action must be substantively legislative,which requires that it involve a policymaking or decision and the action must be procedurally legislative,which requires that it be undertaken through established legislative procedures.id.at citation omitted.
as to the first prong of the test,we have explained that,when zoning officials are enacting or amending zoning legislation,their acts are substantively legislative,and when they are enforcing already existing zoning laws,their acts are administrative,executive,or ministerial.id.at.aiding this analysis should be an evaluation of how many people are affected by the official conduct.acts affecting the entire community tend to be substantively legislative,while acts affecting only one or a small number of individuals implicate executive or administrative action.id.
appellants argue that the rezoning aims solely and discriminatorily at the plaintiffs property in the subject neighborhood.appellants br.in acierno,we held that where a county council enacted an ordinance rezoning the plaintiffs property pursuant to legislative powers delegated under state law,and where that rezoning was performed via the ordinance procedure,the action was substantively legislative,even where the rezoning was directed at one particular parcel of property.at.
it is not clear from the face of the complaint that the ordinance only affects appellants property appellants alleged that the ordinance changed the zoning of their tracts of land,but did not claim that this was all that it did.this seems unlikely,since,according to the complaint,the ordinance repealed and revised roxbury township entire land development ordinance.app,para.in any event,even if the ordinance only affected appellants tracts of land,the township action was the enactment of a zoning ordinance as opposed to the enforcement of an already existing zoning law and,thus,the action was substantively legislative.
under the second prong of the test for determining whether an action is legislative in nature,the ordinance was procedurally legislative if it was undertaken through established legislative procedures.acierno,at.appellants have not alleged that the ordinance was enacted in a manner contrary to statutory procedures specified for such action,see,either in their complaint or now on appeal.
thus,under the test we announced in acierno,the enactment of the ordinance was a legislative act,which entitles those defendants who enacted it to absolute legislative immunity for the act.it surely does not entitle the individual defendants who were not involved in enacting the ordinance to immunity,but the district court made no finding as to who was and who was not involved,instead lumping all defendants together in some sort of amorphous legislative process.this was simply not enough.
we will vacate the dismissals of counts one,two,three,and four on the ground of absolute legislative immunity and remand for a determination of which of the many individual defendants,if any,are entitled to legislative immunity.if there are to be dismissals on this ground,the district court must also determine whether the dismissals are in the defendant or defendants individual or official capacities.see bass attardi,cir 
implicit in the foregoing is the fact that the individual defendants would not be immune for their conduct from the time of county concrete application for subdivision and site plan approval until the ordinance was enacted in.in carver foerster,we stated that the doctrine of absolute immunity,as it pertains to local legislators,does not shield executive officials from liability for a course of conduct taken prior to and independent of legislative action,even if those officials were simultaneously members of the local legislative body that ratified the conduct,cir.additionally,a n unconstitutional or illegal course of conduct by county government does not fall within the doctrine of absolute immunity merely because it is connected to or followed by a vote of a county board.id.at.thus,we found in carver that a county commissioner was not absolutely immune in a action for his alleged harassment,threats,and retaliation designed to persuade county department heads to fire the plaintiffs from their jobs even though those acts preceded his legislative act of voting as a member of the county salary board to ultimately eliminate plaintiffs positions.that the defendant was a member of the county salary board was not dispositive.his actions were executive or administrative in nature and,thus,he was not entitled to absolute immunity in an action for damages.id.at.
