this matter is before us for the second time.in kashner davidson securities mscisz,cir,we held that the arbitration award at issue in this case must be vacated because the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard of the law.we did not specify what,if anything,the district court should do after vacating the award.on remand,the district court entered an order vacating the arbitration award and remanding the matter to the arbitral body for further proceedings.it then denied the appellants motion under federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the remand order.the appellants now challenge both the remand order and the order denying their rule b motion,arguing that both contravene our mandate.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decision of the district court to issue the remand order.however,we also direct the district court to clarify its position on whether the arbitration should proceed before the same panel of arbitrators or a newly constituted panel.
the background facts are recounted in detail in our previous opinion.see kashner davidson,at.in,the underlying dispute between appellants steven mscisz,mark mscisz,and lynda mscisz the customers and appellee kashner davidson securities kashner davidson was submitted to arbitration before the national association of securities dealers nasd.a panel of three arbitrators found the customers jointly and severally liable to kashner davidson for in compensatory damages,attorneys fees,and costs.the panel also dismissed the customers counterclaims and claims with prejudice as a sanction for the customers failure to comply with a discovery order.
the district court confirmed that award,and the customers appealed to this court.we held that the arbitration panel improperly dismissed the customers counterclaims and claims as a sanction of first resort rather than a sanction of last resort,noting that the nasd code of arbitration procedure provides for dismissal of a claim or defense as a sanction only when lesser sanctions have proven ineffective.kashner davidson,at.we concluded that the dismissal reflected the arbitration panel intentional and willful disregard of the clear and unequivocal language of the nasd rules,which under our circuit precedent was sufficient to justify vacatur of the award.id.at.consequently,we reverse d the decision of the district court and remand ed the case for entry of an order vacating the arbitration award.id.
after we filed our opinion,but before the mandate issued,counsel for kashner davidson sent a letter to the district court judge.referring to the financial industry regulatory authority finra,the successor organization to the nasd,counsel requested that the court remand the matter to finra and direct finra to reconstitute the original arbitration panel for further proceedings consistent with the court of appeals decision.there is no indication in the record that the district court took any immediate steps in response to the letter.once our mandate had issued,the district court entered an order vacating the arbitration award and remanding the matter to finra for further proceedings consistent with the first circuit opinion.the district court remand order did not address whether the original arbitration panel should be reconstituted.
the customers then filed a brief motion in which they argued that a remand to finra was inappropriate because the judgment on appeal did not mention such a remand.treating the customers motion as one for relief from an order pursuant to.b kashner davidson argued that the customers perfunctory motion did not demonstrate an entitlement to relief under the exacting requirements of that rule.it requested that the district court allow the parties to work towards reaching a final resolution of this dispute before the original finra arbitrators by allowing finra to hold further proceedings consistent with the first circuit decision.in a reply brief,the customers added that even if a remand to finra were appropriate,established case law mandates the composition of a new panel when,as here,the initial panel manifestly disregarded the law.
the district court denied the customers motion in a brief electronic order essentially for the reasons stated in kashner davidson opposition,this motion is hereby denied.the customers then initiated the present appeal,which challenges both the district court remand order and its electronic order denying the customers rule b motion.
we have jurisdiction to review the district court orders under section of the federal arbitration act.see a e bull hn info.hutson,cir.
before turning to the customers arguments,we address an issue raised in the appellees brief.kashner davidson argues that a recent supreme court decision,hall street assocs.mattel,d,undermines our earlier mandate in this case.in hall street,the supreme court held that the grounds for prompt vacatur or modification of an arbitral award enumerated in the federal arbitration act,are exclusive and may not be supplemented by contract.at.kashner davidson contends that our holding in the first the award must be vacated because the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the in conflict with hall street because manifest disregard of the law is not explicitly listed as a ground for vacatur in section of the faa.
the continued vitality of the manifest disregard doctrine in faa proceedings is a difficult and important issue that the courts have only begun to resolve.see,citigroup global,bacon,cir manifest disregard of the law is no longer an independent,nonstatutory ground for setting aside an arbitration award comedy club,improv west,cir manifest disregard of the law remains a valid ground for vacatur of an arbitration award under a of the federal arbitration act sa animalfeeds int l,cir manifest disregard doctrine is a judicial gloss on the specific grounds for vacatur enumerated in section of the faa,cert.granted on other grounds,d.we have referred to the issue in dicta,see united parcel,cir,but have not squarely determined whether our manifest disregard case law can be reconciled with hall street.
in an effort to have us decide that issue now,kashner davidson has asked us to take the unusual step of recalling our earlier mandate we will not oblige.the power to recall a mandate is one of last resort,to be held in reserve against grave,unforeseen contingencies.calderon thompson,d.we have exercised that power sparingly over the course of many years,recalling mandates in only the most extraordinary circumstances 
kashner davidson current predicament is hardly extraordinary.the company failed to take advantage of numerous earlier opportunities to raise the hall street argument through ordinary procedures most immediately,it could have in this proceeding from the district court remand order and urged us to revisit our previous decision under ordinary law of the case principles.see nkihtaqmikon impson,cir we could revisit our own earlier decision if the appellant could show that controlling legal authority has changed dramatically proffer significant new evidence,not earlier obtainable in the exercise of due diligence or convince the court that a blatant error in the prior decision will,if uncorrected,result in a serious injustice.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.kashner davidson did not do so,and now it is faced with the rule that an appellee who fails to file a may urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record but may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary.el paso natural gas neztsosie,d quoting united states am.ry.express.see also greenlaw united states,d.
considering the circumstances,we can not say that we are faced with the sort of grave,unforeseen contingenc y that would justify the recall of a mandate.thompson,at.by strategic choice or through lack of diligence,kashner davidson waited until the last possible moment to raise its hall street argument.it can not now circumvent the rule by invoking a remedy reserved for extraordinary situations.kashner davidson request is denied.
the customers advance two arguments on appeal.first,they argue that the district court remand order contravenes our mandate because we did not direct the district court to remand the matter to finra second,they argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying the rule b motion.although the second argument is primarily a reformulation of the first argument,we address it separately because the parties have raised distinct concerns about the scope of the district court rule b order.
remand order 
the applicable legal principles are straightforward.subject to a few narrow exceptions not implicated here,a n appellate court mandate controls all issues that were actually considered and decided by the appellate court,or as were necessarily inferred from the disposition on appeal.nlrb goodless,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.at the same time,issues that were not decided by the appellate court are not affected by the mandate.de rodr√≠guez,cir.
when we decided the first appeal,we instructed the district court to enter an order vacating the arbitration award.kashner davidson,at.we did not say what,if anything,the district court should do after that.id.the customers seize on that silence,arguing that the district court impermissibly exceed ed the scope of the mandate by issuing a remand order in the absence of any language directing it to do so.their argument rests on a faulty premise,however.the district court was not constrained to perform only those actions that we specifically listed in the mandate.although the mandate of an appellate court forecloses the lower court from reconsidering matters determined in the appellate court,it leaves to the lower court any issue not expressly or impliedly disposed of on appeal.biggins hazen paper,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also sprague ticonic bank.while a mandate is controlling as to matters within its compass,on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.
the dispositive question is thus whether we explicitly or implicitly decided that a remand to finra was inappropriate.there is no serious contention that we did so explicitly our mandate simply did not address the subject.nor did we decide the issue by necessary implication.as the customers acknowledged below,the faa provides that a district court may,in its discretion,direct a rehearing by the arbitrators after an award is vacated.b.in the closely related context of labor arbitration,the supreme court has indicated that remand will often be the appropriate remedy following vacatur of an award.major league baseball players ass garvey,d per curiam emphasis added see also united paperworkers int l union misco,d.nothing in our mandate touched on these background rules,let alone abrogated them.
the customers contend that remand is incompatible with our holding that the entire arbitration award must be vacated in light of the arbitrators actions.on their view,fresh arbitration proceedings must be initiated because a fair proceeding before the same panel of arbitrators is not possible.as the customers conceded at oral argument,however,the question of whether a new panel of arbitrators should be constituted on remand is distinct from the question of whether a remand is appropriate at all.we address the issue of panel composition below.there is no suggestion that finra itself is biased or incapable of providing a fair arbitration proceeding.
because our mandate did not explicitly or implicitly prohibit the district court from remanding this matter to finra for further proceedings,we reject the customers argument that the remand order contravened the mandate.
rule b order 
the customers discussion of the rule b order is,for the most part,a reformulation of their argument regarding the remand order.one ancillary issue deserves attention,however.the district court denied the customers rule b motion e ssentially for the reasons stated in kashner davidson opposition.the customers suggest that this language could be read as tacit approval of kashner davidson argument that the district court intended to remand the matter to the original arbitration panel.kashner davidson did take this position in its opposition to the customers rule b motion.kashner davidson goes further,flatly stating that the district court remanded this arbitration dispute back to finra original arbitration panel for further proceedings finra was also confused by the original remand order,stating in a letter that counsel will need to seek clarification from the district court on the remand issue before finra will proceed with this case.
although we have decided to affirm the remand order of the district court,we are also going to remand this matter to the district court so that it can consider the parties arguments and then specify whether a new arbitration panel should be constituted,the original arbitration panel should be reconstituted,or finra should decide the issue in the first instance according to its own practices and procedures.the resolution of that issue lies within the sound discretion of the district court.see aircraft braking.local,united,aerospace agric.implement workers,cir martin domke et,domke on commercial arbitration ed.supp thomas oehmke,commercial arbitration ed.supp.
this matter is remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of clarifying the terms of its remand order,as described in this opinion.in all other respects,the district court remand order and order denying the customers rule b motion are affirmed.each party shall bear its own costs.
so ordered.
our judgment was phrased in materially identical language.kashner davidson has suggested that our mandate left the money damages portion of the arbitration award untouched.that is not correct.we instructed the district court to vacate the entire award,which it did.
the customers styled their motion as a motion for reconsideration under federal rule of civil procedure b and district of massachusetts local rule,which are general rules governing motion practice.in its opposition,kashner davidson construed the motion as one for relief from an order under rule b.the customers adopted that characterization in their reply brief.nothing in this appeal turns on the precise grounding of the motion in the rules for clarity,we will refer to it as a rule b motion.
we note that the recall of a mandate is ordinarily requested by motion.see james moore et,moore federal practice ed.contrary to the usual practice,kashner davidson raised the issue for the first and only time in its brief on appeal.we do not intend our discussion to suggest approval of the manner in which the argument was raised.

the supreme court decided hall street on march,we heard oral argument in the first appeal but before we issued our decision.kashner davidson could have submitted a letter bringing hall street to our attention while the first appeal was pending.see fed.j.once the appeal was decided,it could have requested panel rehearing rehearing en banc.see fed.it could have petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari.see.on remand,it could have attempted to show that exceptional circumstances justified deviation from our mandate.united states wallace,cir.
we note that this is an odd position for the customers to take.they specifically asked for a remand in the district court and in the first appeal.
