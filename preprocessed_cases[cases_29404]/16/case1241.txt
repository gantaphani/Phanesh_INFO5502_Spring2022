perdue holdings,appeals the district court dismissal of its breach of contract action against brf for lack of personal jurisdiction.perdue contends that brf purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in maryland,and thus that personal jurisdiction over brf properly lies in the united states district court for the district of maryland.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
perdue,a wholly owned subsidiary of a international food producer headquartered in maryland,sells poultry using the mark perdue.brf,an international food company and exporter of poultry meats headquartered in brazil,sells poultry using the mark perdix.brf sole connection to maryland is its relationship with perdue.
in,perdue became concerned about potential consumer confusion between the similar perdue and perdix trademarks.perdue contacted brf predecessor,perdigão agroindustrial,and the parties negotiated remotely a worldwide coexistence agreement and a later addendum hereafter collectively the agreement.brf executed the agreement in brazil and perdue executed it in maryland.
in the agreement,the parties stated that they sought to avoid any and all confusion between their respective marks and to resolve all pending and future possible controversies regarding the marks.to that end,perdue agreed to refrain from registering its perdue mark in brazil,and brf agreed to abandon a version of its perdix mark worldwide.the parties also agreed to withdraw opposition worldwide to each other marks that complied with the agreement.the agreement states that it will remain in force for the life of the respective trademarks.it contains a maryland clause.
from to,perdue bought an aggregate pounds of chicken valued at approximately from brf.perdue sent purchase orders from maryland and brf sent invoices to maryland for the orders,but at perdue direction brf shipped the chicken from brazil to tanzania.
later in,perdue brought this action against brf in federal court in the district of maryland.perdue alleged that brf breached the agreement by pursuing new applications for trademark registrations in argentina,morocco,são tomé príncipe,and uruguay and by refusing to abandon existing trademark registrations in canada,china,hong kong,kuwait,lebanon,argentina,bolivia,paraguay,and uruguay hereafter,foreign countries refers to these two groups of countries collectively.
pursuant to.b,brf moved to dismiss perdue suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court held that perdue had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that brf had the requisite minimum contacts with maryland.accordingly,the court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over brf and granted brf motion to dismiss.perdue filed this timely appeal.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court had personal jurisdiction over brf.we review a judgment dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.consulting eng rs geometric,cir.where,as here,the district court decides jurisdiction on the motion papers alone,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of a sufficient jurisdictional basis to prevail.combs bakker,cir.
when a federal court sits in diversity,it has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if an applicable state statute confers jurisdiction and the assertion of that jurisdiction is consistent with constitutional due process.nichols searle,cir.the reach of maryland statute is coextensive with the reach of the due process clause of the united states constitution,so the statutory inquiry merges with the constitutional examination.beyond,realtime gaming holding,llc.
a court may exercise general or specific personal jurisdiction.general personal jurisdiction requires continuous and systemic contacts with the forum state.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.perdue does not claim that brf has such contacts with maryland and does not assert that the district court had general personal jurisdiction over brf.what perdue does claim is that the district court had specific personal jurisdiction over brf arising from brf contacts with perdue.
for a court to have specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the defendant must have purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum state such that it should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.burger king rudzewicz,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this analysis is not mechanical,id.at a court must weigh the totality of the facts before it,universal leather,llc koro ar,cir.to determine whether specific jurisdiction lies in the forum state,we consider the extent to which the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the state whether the plaintiffs claims arise out of those activities directed at the state and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff must prevail on each prong.consulting eng rs,at.
perdue contention that a federal court in maryland has personal jurisdiction over brf falters on the first prong.under that prong,we consider numerous nonexclusive factors to assess a party purposeful availment.consulting eng rs,at.in the business context,these factors includewhether the defendant maintains offices or agents in the forum state owns property in the forum state reached into the forum state to solicit or initiate business deliberately engaged in significant or business activities in the forum state or made contact with the resident of the forum in the forum state regarding the business relationship.id.we also consider whether the parties contractually agreed that the law of the forum state would govern disputes whether the performance of contractual duties was to occur within the forum and the nature,quality and extent of the parties communications about the business being transacted.id.
perdue has alleged few facts to satisfy its prima facie burden in support of personal jurisdiction.indeed,the only fact that it alleges that indisputably weighs in favor of jurisdiction is that the agreement includes a maryland clause.
many undisputed facts indicate that a maryland court does not have personal jurisdiction over brf.the company employs no maryland officers or agents and owns no property in the state.brf did not initiate the negotiations that led to the agreement,and no brf employee traveled to maryland in connection with the agreement.brf conducts no business in maryland it does not import any products into or sell or ship products to any clients in maryland,and it has no contract with any entity in maryland other than perdue.brf alleged breach of the agreement occurred not in maryland,but in the foreign countries 
further,the agreement does not even require perdue to perform any contractual duties in maryland.if brf had entered a contract that required perdue to perform significant contractual duties in maryland,personal jurisdiction over brf might lie in maryland.see peanut of am.hollywood brands,cir.but although perdue executives may decide global trademark strategy in maryland,the agreement does not require those decisions to take place in maryland.
nor can perdue establish that brf deliberately engaged in significant or business activities in the forum state.consulting eng rs,at.of course,such a showing could provide a basis for personal jurisdiction over a defendant,as it did in burger king.moreover,a plaintiff may be able to make such a showing through a single contract because often a contract is but an intermediate step serving to tie up prior business negotiations with future consequences which themselves are the real object of the business transaction.burger king,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,specific personal jurisdiction can arise from one contract where the defendant deliberately has engaged in significant activities within a state,or has created continuing obligations between it self and residents of the forum.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in burger king,the court held that,although the defendant lacked other contacts with the forum state,a single contract provi
