in this diversity action we are asked to determine whether,under michigan law,the guarantor of a land contract is liable to the seller for any deficiency once the seller has elected forfeiture as his remedy.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that a judgment for possession after forfeiture extinguishes the land contract,leaving no legal basis to pursue further claims against the guarantor.therefore,in this case,the guarantor is not liable,and we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment for the guarantor.
background 
roi and dyan young,a husband and wife,moved to michigan in so that roi young could work with richard mazur.in august of that year,the youngs found a vacation home in perrinton,michigan the property that they wanted to purchase.their efforts were frustrated,however,when roi young could find financing only at an interest rate that he believed was too high.when roi young shared his problem with mazur,mazur indicated that he could buy the property at an unbelievably low rate and just sell it back to roi young.joint appendix at roi young dep.at.in september,mazur bought the property for roi young contributed the down payment,and mazur took out a mortgage on the property for the remaining.
the youngs apparently did not want to own the property in their name because roi young worked in a litigious business.at.accordingly,in december,the parties agreed that mazur would sell the property not to the youngs,but to equitable benefit insurance services,ebis,a california corporation of which roi young was the sole shareholder.under the terms of the land contract,ebis was to pay mazur according to the payment terms of the mortgage.additionally,roi and dyan young entered into a guaranty contract with mazur that unconditionally guarantee d to mazur the full and complete performance of all of ebis covenants and obligations under the land contract to the same extent and with the same force and effect as though the undersigned was the primary debtor under the land contract.at guaranty of land contract a.
sometime during the summer of,ebis stopped making payments on the land contract,and the youngs stopped using the property.eventually,mazur changed the locks and,in december of that year,he tried to sell the property.mazur,however,was unable to sell the property because ebis held the title.
to reclaim the title,in february,mazur served ebis and the youngs with a notice of forfeiture.mazur filed for possession,and on february,mazur and ebis entered into a consent judgment wherein mazur took possession of the property,ebis agreed that the land contract had been forfeited,and ebis waived redemption rights.at.on april,the state trial court dismissed without prejudice roi and dyan young as defendants in the action because of a lack of progress in the case.
according to mazur,for the next two years he continued to pay installments on the mortgage,utility bills,property taxes,and general maintenance and housekeeping costs.on march,mazur sold the property for.mazur claims that the sale price did not fully satisfy the cost of sale,outstanding property taxes,and the outstanding debt on the mortgage,costing him.
to recover that deficiency and other losses,mazur sued the youngs in the gratiot county circuit court for,alleging that ebis had breached its land contract with mazur and that the youngs were liable as guarantors for all damages that resulted from the breach.on the basis of federal diversity jurisdiction,the youngs removed the case to the federal district court.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,and on march,the district court granted the youngs motion and denied mazur.mazur now appeals the district court judgment.

we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment.himmel ford motor,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.c.
because this is a diversity case,we must apply the rules and substantive law of michigan,the forum state.himmel,at.if we confront an issue that has not yet been resolved by the michigan courts,we must attempt to predict what the michigan supreme court would do if confronted with the same question.id.in such circumstances,we consider decisions of the michigan court of appeals as well as relevant michigan supreme court dicta,restatements of law,commentaries,and the rules adopted by other jurisdictions.garden city osteopathic hosp.hbe,cir.
default guaranty rules 
before considering the specific contract provisions at issue in this case,we briefly review the default rules that govern guaranties and land contracts under michigan law.except where the specific terms of the agreement between mazur and the youngs override,we apply the default rules.see restatement second of contracts cmt.b much contract law consists of rules which may be varied by agreement of the parties.
when a seller of property seeks redress against a recalcitrant buyer,the seller must make an election of remedies.the seller can choose to pursue either foreclosure or forfeiture,but not both.see.bank cote,if the plaintiff prefers to have money damages under the contract,he should be required to elect that remedy or to foreclose in the circuit court where the defendant will receive credit for the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.quoting.law revision comm n,annual report emphasis removed.
in a foreclosure action under michigan law,the court has the power to order a sale of the premises which are the subject of the land contract,or of that part of the premises which is sufficient to discharge the amount due on the land contract plus costs.comp.laws.the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are applied toward paying down the debt,and the can keep any surplus that might remain.comp.laws.of particular importance for this case,if a foreclosure sale is insufficient to cover the entirety of the debt,the clerk of the court shall issue execution for the amount of the deficiency against either the defendant.comp.laws,or against any other party liable for the deficiency.comp.laws.thus,when a seller chooses to pursue foreclosure,the can keep neither the property nor any surplus from the sale,but the defendant,as well as the guarantor,remains liable for any deficiency that remains after the sale of the property.see.comp.laws united states leslie,cir.
in contrast,a seller may instead elect to pursue forfeiture.if the seller opts for forfeiture and prevails,the seller receives full possession of the premises.comp.laws.at that point,the seller can keep the property,sell the property,or do with it whatever the seller pleases.what the victorious seller can not do,however,is continue to pursue the buyer for any deficiency a judgment for possession after forfeiture of an executory contract for the purchase of premises shall merge and bar any claim for money payments due or in arrears under the contract at the time of trial.comp.laws emphasis added see also cote,at this section is,in effect,a with the rule that the forfeiture of an executory contract for purchase of land constitutes an election of remedies,precluding the vendor from later seeking damages for breach of contract.citation omitted durda chembar dev,it is clear that once the vendor has elected the remedy of forfeiture and proceeded to the point of issuance of a writ of restitution,he can not recover a deficiency judgment for money due under the contract.
because forfeiture discharges the buyer from liability for the debt,even if there is a deficiency,judgment for possession after forfeiture has important consequences for guarantors.as a general rule,the guarantor is released from liability if some act or omission on the part of the creditor discharges the principal debtor of the principal obligation by a rule of law,even if the principal obligation has not been paid.d guaranty see also wilson leasing seaway pharmacal,any material alteration of a principal debt or obligation operates to completely discharge any guaranty of that debt or obligation,unless the guarantor consented to the alteration.citations omitted.thus,as a general rule,a judgment for possession after forfeiture releases a guarantor from liability.
c.the effect of the guaranty agreement 
if we simply applied the general rule to the facts of this case,we could reach no other conclusion than that reached by the district court mazur choice to pursue forfeiture and discharge the buyer,ebis,also discharged the youngs as guarantors.we can not,however,simply apply the general rule.instead,we must first consider whether the guaranty contract altered the default relationship of the parties.see first bank of ypsilanti redford chevrolet,in construing a contract of guaranty,the intention of the parties should govern.where the language of the writing is not ambiguous the construction is a question of law for the court,on a consideration of the entire instrument.internal quotation marks omitted.although we look to the language of the contract,we will not read expansively a guaranty contract.see bandit,hobbs int l,t he courts will not assume such an obligation to take on another debts in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to do so.
mazur asserts that the guaranty contract overrides the default contract rules.first,mazur argues that a guaranty is by its very nature a separate and distinct obligation under which the youngs remained liable for ebis default under the land contract,despite the fact that ebis was no longer liable under the land contract.appellant reply br.at.second,mazur argues that even if the guaranty agreement does not create continuing liability by its own independent existence,the youngs accepted liability above and beyond that of a normal guarantor and agreed to remain bound regardless of what happened to ebis.
we conclude that these arguments are without merit.
a guaranty agreement continuing liability 
mazur argues that a guaranty is a separate obligation,distinct from the land contract,and the guarantor thus remains liable under the guaranty regardless of the principal liability under the land contract.if this were true,then our default rule would not be much of a default rule at all the guaranty agreement would leave the guarantor responsible for any deficiency regardless of the remedy the seller elects.that is not to say that mazur assertion is totally inaccurate,because a guaranty is an independent,collateral agreement by which the guarantor undertakes to pay the obligation if the primary payor fails to do so.first bank trust of ann arbor dolph,quoting bedford kelley,emphasis added.furthermore,mazur is correct that we have observed that t he guaranty is an obligation separate from the mortgage note and concluded that,under michigan law,a creditor may simultaneously proceed against a guarantor and foreclose on a mortgaged property.leslie,at.
mazur argument fails because of an important difference between leslie and the instant case leslie was decided in the context of a foreclosure action,not a forfeiture action.that a guaranty agreement is an independent,collateral agreement is what allows a seller to proceed against a guarantor without having first exhausted the foreclosure remedy against the buyer.allowing a seller to proceed against a guarantor in the foreclosure context is simply expeditious,because the guarantor will still be liable for any deficiency that remains after that is not true following forfeiture.see cote,at.
although not raised by mazur,judge shadur dissent makes a compelling argument that a recent,unpublished opinion of the court of appeals of michigan holds that a guaranty contract provides an independent basis for liability even after a forfeiture action.in richard fair,wl,unpublished opinion,the court held that,which bars collection of a deficiency from a buyer after forfeiture,was no defense for a guarantor because the plaintiff claims arose under the the wholly separate and discrete guaranty contract and was not for money payments due or in arrears under the land contract that are barred by.id.at quoting.comp.laws.
we conclude that richard is distinguishable from the case at hand.in richard,the seller was seeking money from the guarantor due to the plaintiff under a pocket consent judgment that the buyer and seller agreed to during the forfeiture action.id.at.accordingly,would not have protected the buyer,let alone the guarantor,because that liability arose out of the forfeiture proceeding,rather than a separate,subsequent action for amounts due under the land contract.id.at.because of the nature of the consent judgment,richard was actually more like a foreclosure action in that liability continued for the buyer even after the seller received judgment for possession after forfeiture.in mazur case,however,there is no dispute that would be a defense for ebis.thus,while richard asked whether a guarantor is liable when the buyer is also still liable,we face the much different question of whether a guarantor is liable when the buyer has been discharged of all liability.in any event,richard is an unpublished decision,which is not binding under michigan court rules.see.c.
we conclude that,although a guaranty agreement is an independent contract,that fact alone does not create liability for the guarantor after the buyer is discharged.
the youngs obligations under this guaranty agreement 
the guarantor,through explicit language in the guaranty agreement,can assume additional and lasting obligations to the seller that continue past forfeiture.see davis yellow acceptance,cir applying michigan law and concluding that the appellant was not released from an obligation by discharge of the principal because the obligation was independent of and additional to his guarantee of the buyer performance of the conditional sale contract.the question before us,and the locus of our principal disagreement with judge shadur,is whether the youngs assumed such a lasting obligation.we conclude that they did not.
at issue is paragraph d of the guaranty agreement.the relevant portion of paragraph d reads 
the undersigned obligations hereunder shall remain fully binding although seller may have waived one or more defaults by buyer,extended the term of performance by buyer,released,returned or misapplied other collateral at any time given as additional security including other guarantees,released buyer from the performance of its obligations under such land contract.
at guaranty d.if forfeiture is simply a fancy word for release,then paragraph d would apply and would trump the default contract rules that would leave the youngs liable to mazur despite the release of ebis.it is our determination,however,that forfeiture did far more than simply release ebis from the performance of its obligations under the land contract forfeiture extinguished the land contract altogether,meaning that the youngs as guarantors can not be held liable for damages due to breach of the contract.
as discussed earlier,when a seller elects to seek forfeiture under michigan law,the seller retakes possession of the property as full satisfaction for the debt and no further obligations remain on either side.thus,f undamentally,forfeiture is rescission.orzechowski kolodziejski.at the conclusion of a summary proceeding for possession after forfeiture,the seller recovers possession of the land,and the contract is effectively rescinded.there can be no liability for breach of contract under a contract that has been rescinded see restatement second of contracts.in other words,forfeiture is a full and complete remedy.cote,at.
mazur has not identified any precedent to the contrary.in united states beardslee,cir,cert.denied,d,and leslie,we considered the liabilities of guarantors in the context of foreclosure actions,not forfeiture actions,see beardslee,at leslie,at,which,as explained above,is a dispositive distinction.in davis,we concluded that the contract at issue in that case,unlike the contract at issue here,in clear terms imposed an obligation upon the appellant beyond a guaranty,specifically to repurchase the trucks in the event of default by the buyer and repossession by the seller.davis,at.because we determine paragraph d to be inapplicable,the general rule applies,and the guarantor can not be liable for a principal breach of a contract that has been rescinded.
judge shadur,in his dissent,claims that our reading of paragraph d essentially renders paragraphs a and b as dead letter he claims that we are erroneously reading paragraphs a and b as establishing the guarantor obligations.he is only partly correct while we do conclude that a guarantor has no obligations,we read paragraphs a and b to establish obligations.we need not adopt a reading of paragraphs a and b for them to have meaning,as they will have effect when the seller opts for release or foreclosure instead of forfeiture.therefore,paragraphs a and b are quite forceful and they apply only when the seller has elected a remedy that is less than a full and complete remedy.
the inapplicability of paragraph d is further evident from a plain reading of its terms.paragraph d maintains the guarantor liability when the seller releases the buyer from the performance of its obligations under such land contract.at emphasis added guaranty d.from the moment that ebis and mazur executed the land contract,ebis held title over the property.thus,a simple release of the buyer from its obligations would merely allow ebis to stop paying while retaining title over the property.forfeiture,in contrast,is far more than a simple release from obligations.
judge shadur,it is necessary for his argument to the youngs undert ook a greater liability than the buyer under the land contract.dissent at.we respectfully disagree.paragraph a,by a plain reading,says the exact opposite the guarantor does hereby unconditionally guarantee to seller the full and complete performance of all of the buyer covenants and obligations under such land contract to the same extent and with the same force and effect as though the undersigned was the primary debtor under the land contract.at emphasis added guaranty a.in light of michigan precedent establishing that guaranty contracts shall be read narrowly and by only their plain meaning,bandit,at declaring that courts should apply the principle of strict interpretation to the construction of a guaranty contract dillon denooyer chevrolet geo,contractual language is construed according to its plain and ordinary meaning,and technical or constrained constructions are to be avoided,we can not conclude that the youngs guaranty contract created any additional liability that would survive forfeiture.
although a judgment for possession after forfeiture normally discharges a guarantor from liability for a principal breach of a land contract,a guarantor might not be discharged if the guarantor consents to the discharge of the principal debtor.see wilson leasing,at any material alteration of a principal debt or obligation operates to completely discharge any guaranty of that debt or obligation,unless the guarantor consented to the alteration.citations omitted emphasis added.mazur argues that the youngs accepted additional liability because they consented to the discharge of ebis.mazur asserts that the same attorney represented ebis and the youngs in the forfeiture action the consent judgment for possession after forfeiture was signed by that attorney,so mazur argues that,because an attorney representing both ebis and the youngs signed the consent judgment,the youngs consented to the discharge of ebis as the principal debtor.the judgment,however,listed only ebis as a defendant,and the youngs were later dismissed as defendants due to lack of progress in the case.
we need not resolve the question of whether the youngs consented.the consent judgment at issue was a judgment for possession after forfeiture,which effectively rescinded the contract.thus,the most that can be said is that the youngs consented to forfeiture of the contract,which,as explained above,extinguished any liability of both ebis and the youngs for damages for breach of the land contract.it would be bizarre to construe the consent judgment as both extinguishing the youngs liability and simultaneously acting as consent for greater liability.
iii.fairness 
the soundness of our conclusion that a judgment for possession after forfeiture extinguishes a guarantor liability is underscored by considerations of fairness.judge shadur suggests that today decision is inherently unfair to mazur,who accommodated the youngs by agreeing to let them interpose ebis between mazur and the youngs for purposes.mazur,however,does not lose because of the corporate structure the youngs used rather,mazur loses because he made a choice of remedy that he now regrets.had mazur opted instead to use foreclosure,it would not have mattered whether ebis or the youngs signed the land contract,because both parties would still be liable for any deficiency.
judge shadur would prefer that we allow a seller to pursue forfeiture and then,if the seller can not find a buyer willing to pay enough,allow the seller to seek damages for the deficiency.to do this would be to give mazur a third type of remedy foreclosure plus.this new remedy would allow the seller to play the market.just like forfeiture,the seller could keep the property,and if the value increases the seller could keep the surplus.and just like foreclosure,if the value declines the seller could seek the remainder from the buyer or guarantor.creating this new remedy would contradict michigan law a land contract seller may not take possession of the property and attempt to sell it and,if unable to do so,seek then to foreclose.gruskin fisher.
furthermore,the dissent conclusion that a guarantor is still liable following judgment for possession after forfeiture would create an opportunity for sellers to take advantage of unsophisticated guarantors.such a rule would leave parents,relatives,and other unsophisticated guarantors with a surprising liability,even when the seller chooses not to pursue foreclosure,and even when the buyer returns the property and relinquishes any claim to payments already made under the land contract.under such a rule,the guarantors would still be liable if the seller was unsatisfied with a later sale of the if the sale was years later.instead,we conclude that,should sellers wish to establish such lasting and pervasive liability,they can not claim that it exists as a default,but must instead explicitly negotiate it with the buyers and the guarantors.
iv.conclusion 
because we conclude as explained above that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment,we need not address the district court alternate ruling that mazur claim was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
with regret,i believe that the majority opinion has mistakenly looked to a generalized legal doctrine as somehow overriding the specific language of the contract between the exaltation of form over substance.because there is of course no contention that the guaranty executed by roi and dyan young youngs is somehow contrary to public policy so as to render it unenforceable,i submit that no basis exists for such a failure to hold youngs to the unambiguous language of their commitment under the guaranty.hence i respectfully dissent.
most troubling is that,as the majority opinion would have it,not all of the provisions in the binding guaranty contract between mazur and the youngs are given effect.that result is particularly problematic,given the principles that govern the interpretation of such a contract,under which the general rules of contract construction must be applied first bank redford chevrolet.as was explained there,quoting even earlier caselaw 
in construing a contract of guaranty the intention of the parties should govern.where the language of the writing is not ambiguous the construction is a question of law for the court,on a consideration of the entire instrument.
for that purpose,of course,the courts will not assume such an obligation to assume another debts in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to do so bandit,hobbs.
but before parsing out the terms of the guaranty contract that should be given their full force,it is critical to look at mazur position equitable benefit.it is undisputed that under michigan law a land contract vendor who finds himself in mazur position,confronting a purchaser in default,must choose between two enforcement options against the purchaser foreclose on the contract,sell the property and,after applying the proceeds,proceed against the purchaser for any deficiency.comp.laws or commence a summary proceeding in the district court for forfeiture of the land contract,obtain possession of the property and retain all payments made to date section.that second alternative brings into play section 
the remedy provided by summary proceedings is in addition to,and not exclusive of,other remedies,either legal,equitable or statutory.a judgment for possession under this chapter does not merge or bar any other claim for relief,except that a judgment for possession after forfeiture of an executory contract for the purchase of premises shall merge and bar any claim for money payments due or in arrears under the contract at the time of trial and that a judgment for possession after forfeiture of such an executory contract which results in the issuance of a writ of restitution shall also bar any claim for money payments which would have become due under the contract subsequent to the time of issuance of the writ.
and that,of course,meant that mazur pursuit of that remedy let equitable benefit off the hook for any monetary liability,whether past or future.according to the majority opinion,letting equitable benefit off the hook also released the youngs from any further obligation under the generalized theory that a land contract vendor in mazur position must elect his remedies,in spite of the fact that the parties and the clearly and unambiguously expressed their contrary intentions each other in the language of their separate and enforceable guaranty contract.
as the michigan court of appeals rearticulated last year in richard fair,wl,at.per curiam,quoting from.bank cote,but with brackets inserted by the richard opinion 
section is,in effect,a modified codification of the rule that the forfeiture of an executory contract for purchase of land constitutes an election of remedies,precluding the vendor from later seeking damages for breach of contract.
like the guarantor in richard,the youngs contend that mazur claim under their guaranty constitutes a claim for money payments due or in arrears under the contract at the time of trial as contemplated by section,so that mazur claim under the guaranty was barred by his election to pursue forfeiture proceedings against the land contract purchaser.
but like the guarantor in richard,the youngs are wrong.to find in favor of the youngs,both the district court and the majority opinions impermissibly conflate the land contract and the guaranty contract.as was held to be the case in richard,mazur claim against the youngs stems from their obligations under the quite separate albeit related guaranty contract and thus is simply not a claim for money payments due or in arrears under the land contract richard,wl,at,quoting section.and as united states leslie,cir has emphasized in the similar context of a guaranteed mortgage,t he guaranty is an obligation separate from the mortgage note t he obligation of guaranty is distinct from the debt under the mortgage.
it should be remembered that the youngs were not themselves parties to the land contract.but they expressly entered into the separate guaranty contract,under which they obligated themselves to unconditionally guarantee to seller the full and complete performance of all of the buyer covenants and obligations under such land contract.
indeed,there is a special perhaps a special degree of nerviness in the youngs effort to take advantage of a release of their corporation from liability to benefit themselves personally.after all,the original transaction was structured as it was solely at their behest,not mazur,because they wanted to shoehorn equitable benefit into the picture to insulate themselves against potential personal liability to unknown future litigants by not taking title in their own names.mazur accommodated their desire and now faces their effort to avoid liability to him.truly no good deed goes unpunished.
what seems more remarkable is the refusal of the youngs and regrettably the failure of both the district court and the majority to parse the guaranty of land contract to see the basic illogic of the youngs position.here are paragraph a and the opening sentence of paragraph b of that guaranty contract 
a.the undersigned,in consideration of and to induce the seller to enter into said land contract with the buyer,does hereby unconditionally guarantee to seller the full and complete performance of all of the buyer covenants and obligations under such land contract to the same extent and with the same force and effect as though the undersigned was the primary debtor under the land contract.the liability hereunder of the undersigned to seller shall be direct and absolute,and shall not be conditional upon the pursuit by seller of whatsoever remedies that may at any time be available to seller against buyer.
by way of illustration,but without limitation,the undersigned hereby unconditionally guarantees to seller the full and timely payment of the rent and all other charges to be paid by buyer pursuant to the provisions of said land contract.
as the youngs would have it,the forfeiture proceeding meant that the buyer equitable benefit no longer had any obligation to make any payments or perform any other land contract obligations true enough,but they then go on to contend that result deprives the quoted language from paragraphs a and b of any further force.
but that position begs the question,for it rests on a premise that the guaranty language of paragraphs a and b speaks in terms of the buyer lack of forfeiture.and that premise is of course false,because it is flatly contradicted by this provision of paragraph d of the guaranty that expressly provides for the youngs continuing obligations emphasis added 
the undersigned obligations hereunder shall remain fully binding although seller may have waived one or more defaults by buyer,extended the term of performance by buyer,released,returned or misapplied other collateral at any time given as additional security including other guarantees,released buyer from the performance of its obligations under such land contract.
once the seller has so released the buyer,by definition the latter no longer has any land contract what obligations of the guarantor can then remain fully binding in the youngs and the majority eyes,none.but that would render meaningless the guaranty provisions of paragraphs a and b.it is obvious,then,that those latter provisions speak of what the buyer obligations originally were under the land contract itself,unaffected by the later release of the buyer that paragraph d says does not diminish the guarantor obligations.and that identical meaning of paragraphs a and b plainly applies to a release of the buyer through a forfeiture proceeding,just as it does to any other release.
in that respect the majority seeks to perform a feat worthy of a not,i submit,of persuasive legal analysis.it begins innocently enough by identifying a default rule a proposition that by definition and as the label expressly denotes operates only in the absence of an agreement between the parties.but then having done so,it impermissibly proceeds to use the default rule which,it will be remembered,operates only in a contractual trump the clear meaning and thrust of the agreement that the parties have arrived at.to me that attempted transmutation is somewhat reminiscent of the imaginary philosophers stone by which the alchemists of the middle ages hoped to transmute base metal into gold.
in fact,the distinction set out in this dissent is directly fortified by a look at what the forfeiture and what it does not say.it says that a judgment for possession or writ of restitution bars claims for money payments under the contract the land contract claims that by definition could be made only against the party to that contract
