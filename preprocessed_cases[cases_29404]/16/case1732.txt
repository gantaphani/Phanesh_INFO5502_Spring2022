honeywell international,honeywell appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in its suit against phillips petroleum company phillips.the issue on appeal is whether the court erred in holding that phillips had no contractual duty to indemnify honeywell for costs and attorney fees honeywell incurred defending a suit by lone star industries lone star.
in,the signal companies,signal sold a former oil refinery site along the houston ship channel to lone star the lone star site.approximately a year later,signal reformed itself as a holding company and began running its three estate development,chemicals,and natural subsidiaries.signal transferred its natural resources business to signal oil gas signal oil,a previously inactive subsidiary.the transfer agreement the master agreement contained a provision requiring signal oil to assume certain liabilities,the scope of which is the basis for this action.
in,lone star sued signal,now named honeywell under the comprehensive environmental response compensation act cercla and the resource recovery and conservation act rcra for pollution damages on the lone star site.b,a b.in,honeywell filed a complaint against signal oil,now phillips,for indemnity.honeywell successfully defended against lone star claims,with the district court entering judgment in favor of honeywell in.the judgment against lone star did not address honeywell claims against phillips,which had yet to be adjudicated.on honeywell motion,the court entered an order pursuant to fed.civ.severing honeywell action against phillips.the court entered an amended final judgment in the original action reflecting the severance.
honeywell complaint against phillips,filed before honeywell legal liability to lone star had been adjudicated,asked the court to hold phillips liable both for any amount it might be adjudged liable to lone star and for costs and attorney fees associated with the lone star suit.honeywell indemnity claims against phillips remained in the complaint against phillips after that action was severed from the lone star action in.but,in light of the court judgment against lone star and lone star failure to appeal,the parties focused exclusively on honeywell request for attorney fees and costs in their and for summary judgment.phillips motion argued that it was obligated to indemnify honeywell only for liabilities related to the assets that signal transferred to signal oil.because signal sold the lone star site two years before transferring its natural resource operation to signal oil,phillips argued,signal oil did not inherit liability associated with the site.
the district court agreed.it held that neither the master agreement nor a supplement executed in as part of signal sale of signal oil the supplemental agreement required phillips to indemnify honeywell for liability relating to a property signal sold in.honeywell appeals,arguing not only that the district court erred in granting summary judgment but also that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over honeywell severed claim.
before reaching the merits of the district court decision,we address honeywell contention,raised for the first time on appeal,that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over its severed action against phillips.see arizonans for official english arizona,d stating that every appellate court has an obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction and that of the district court giles nylcare health plans,cir a lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,which means we can examine the district court jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.internal citation omitted.
in assessing whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,we generally look to the time at which the action commenced.see carney resolution trust,cir subject matter jurisdiction is determined at the time the complaint is filed.however,a severed action must have an independent jurisdictional basis.see united states,cir holding that severed counterclaims became independent actions requiring an independent jurisdictional basis.see also providing that the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy emphasis added.accordingly,we look to the point at which that action was severed from lone star action against honeywell to determine whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over honeywell claims against phillips.
phillips argues that honeywell complaint contained both federal and state law causes of action.honeywell complaint against phillips alleged,in relevant part 
cause of action involving lone star 
if honeywell is liable to lone star then phillips is liable to honeywell by way of assumption,indemnity contribution.
prayer for relief 
defendant and plaintiff honeywell respectfully prays that the court enter judgment against phillips and 
a hold phillips liable for any amounts which honeywell may be judged liable to lone star,including award of contribution from phillips pursuant to f if honeywell is found liable to lone star for response costs 
d enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to that phillips is liable to honeywell for all current and future liabilities including all current and future response costs pursuant to f if honeywell is found liable to lone star for future response costs.
phillips contends that paragraphs,a,and d assert federal causes of action,namely claims for indemnification pursuant to f.thus,phillips argues,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.
honeywell responds that,notwithstanding its references to f,the complaint does not establish subject matter jurisdiction because it either did not state a viable federal question at the time it was filed or no longer stated a viable federal claim after the lone star judgment became final.see raymon alvord.sch,cir a complaint that alleges the existence of a frivolous or insubstantial federal question is not sufficient to establish jurisdiction in federal court.murphy inexco oil,cir the assertion that the claim involves such a question must be more than incantation.while jurisdiction does not depend on the contention having ultimate merit,its mere recital can not confer jurisdiction if the contention is frivolous or patently without merit.
honeywell request that the district court hold phillips liable for any amounts which honeywell may be judged liable to lone star,including award of contribution from phillips pursuant to f if honeywell is found liable to lone star for response costs states a federal cause of action sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction.while the sufficiency of honeywell complaint to support this cause of action,and whether phillips could be subjected to liability under f,are certainly open to question legal insufficiency of a federal claim generally does not eliminate the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court growth horizons.county,cir.having reviewed honeywell complaint,we find that its cercla contribution claim against phillips,when filed,was not so insubstantial,meritless or so foreclosed by precedent as to render it insubstantial for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.
honeywell next argues that even if its complaint against phillips stated a federal cause of action when filed,it no longer stated a viable federal claim after honeywell was adjudged not liable to lone star.honeywell notes that its complaint asked for contribution from phillips pursuant to f if honeywell is found liable to lone star for response costs emphasis added.honeywell claims that at the time its action against phillips was severed,lone star time to appeal the district court judgment against it had already passed and there was,therefore,a final,unappealable judgment.thus,honeywell reasons,the cercla contribution claim dissolved by its own terms when honeywell prevailed in the lone star action.
we reject this argument.even assuming that a final,unappealable judgment in favor of honeywell against lone star would have defeated subject matter jurisdiction
