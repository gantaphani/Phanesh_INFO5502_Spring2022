plaintiff mark schaefer appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the district of new hampshire dismissing his suit against defendants indymac mortgage services onewest bank,fsb the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and harmon law offices,harmon.schaefer complaint sought an injunction barring his impending eviction an order nullifying the march foreclosure sale of his home and requiring the defendants to allow him to modify or reinstate his mortgage and monetary damages.
the district court found that schaefer claims were barred by the economic loss doctrine,and dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim.see schaefer indymac mortg,cv,wl,at,reconsideration denied,wl.we affirm.
the following facts,which are alleged in schaefer complaint,are accepted as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss.see.ret.cvs caremark,cir.
in november,schaefer refinanced his home mortgage,and entered into a refinancing loan and mortgage agreement with indymac bank,fsb.under the terms of the loan and mortgage agreement,schaefer was required to make regular monthly payments,and indymac bank was allowed to accelerate the principal and to foreclose on the mortgage in the event that schaefer fell behind on his payments the mortgage agreement also gave schaefer the right to reinstate the mortgage before foreclosure upon payment of past due amounts,penalties,interest,and fees.in this litigation,schaefer alleges that indymac or its successors subsequently undertook two additional duties beyond the scope of the contract that restricted their right to foreclose a duty to provide him with a reinstatement amount in the event that he fell into arrears,and a duty to process an application for loan modification before foreclosure.
at some time after november,indymac bank assigned the mortgage to its corporate parent,onewest bank.the mortgage was serviced by indymac mortgage services,which,like indymac bank,is now a subsidiary of onewest bank.we refer to all three entities indymac bank,indymac mortgage services,and onewest bank as onewest.
schaefer defaulted on the loan in,after which onewest agreed to modify the loan.
in late,schaefer again fell behind on his mortgage payments.on january,schaefer received a letter from onewest the january letter informing him that his loan account was p ayments p ast d ue.see schaefer br.addendum.the letter specified a t otal a mount d ue of,and indicated that after february,a f ee a ssessment would be added,bringing the total to.id.the letter did not refer to either amount as a reinstatement amount,and did not include specific line items for further accruing interest,costs,attorney fees,or other items that schaefer alleges are typically included as additions to an arrearage to establish an actual reinstatement amount.id.at.around the same time,schaefer downloaded from onewest website a comprehensive mortgage modification application.id.at.
on january,schaefer received a letter from harmon,counsel to onewest,informing him that harmon had been instructed to bring a foreclosure because schaefer was in breach of the conditions of the loan documents.see id.at.this letter stated that the loan was hereby accelerated,with the entire balance of due and payable forthwith and without further notice.id.the letter also informed schaefer that e ven though the note has been accelerated,he may still have the right to reinstate the loan.id.the letter did not include a reinstatement amount,but directed schaefer to the firm website or telephone number in order to request a reinstatement amount.id.
schaefer requested a reinstatement amount from harmon website on february and again on february.on each occasion,he received the following seemingly automated notice 
your request has been received.we will forward the reinstatement information to you when it is obtained from your lender or servicer or the lender or servicer will send this information to you directly.
unless there is an imminent sale,please wait business days before following up with us on reinstatements you may follow up by contacting us at 
we will get back to you within hours with a status of your pending request.
id.at.schaefer alleges that neither harmon nor onewest ever contacted him with a reinstatement amount schaefer did not attempt to follow up on his requests for a reinstatement amount by contacting onewest.
on february,schaefer received a foreclosure notice from harmon,informing him that a foreclosure sale would occur on march 
two days later,schaefer faxed onewest a completed application for a loan modification.he telephoned onewest three days thereafter,and was told by a onewest representative to resend part of his application,which he promptly did.
on february,a onewest representative contacted schaefer and asked for additional information regarding schaefer partner,kathryn russell,whom schaefer had listed as a future contributor to his mortgage payments.schaefer was instructed to fax russell financial information to the fax number.
at about the same time that the onewest representative instructed schaefer to send russell information to the fax number,schaefer received a letter from a customer contact manager at onewest named elizabeth milian the milian letter.id.at.the milian letter stated that milian and her team,which included loan modification underwriters,would be schaefer point of contact throughout this process,and that either milian,or a representative from her team,would be available to answer any questions he may have while his loan was being reviewed.id.the letter provided milian contact information,including a fax number the fax number.id.the letter closed by expressing milian intent to provide timely and accurate communication between schaefer and onewest,and by indicating that once he had submitted a completed application,milian team would initiate the review of his loan.id.
on february,schaefer faxed russell financial information to onewest.acting in reliance on the milian letter,he sent the information to the fax number,rather than to the fax number previously provided by the onewest representative.several days later,schaefer received a telephone call from a representative inquiring about the submission of the financial information.schaefer explained that he had faxed the materials to the number,and was told by the representative to disregard the milian letter and resend the materials to the number.he did so on march.schaefer heard nothing further from onewest.
the foreclosure sale took place,as scheduled,on march.on march,fannie mae notified schaefer that it had purchased his house at the foreclosure sale and eleven days later harmon served him with an eviction notice.
in early april,schaefer filed suit against onewest,fannie mae the current mortgage holder,and harmon onewest counsel in new hampshire state court.in his verified complaint,schaefer alleged the facts recited above,and asserted two causes of action negligence,arising from the defendants failure to provide him a reinstatement amount and alleged mishandling of his modification application,and negligent misrepresentation,arising from the allegedly misleading milian letter as relief,schaefer sought an injunction against the pending eviction,an order nullifying the foreclosure sale and requiring the defendants to allow him to modify or reinstate his mortgage,and compensatory damages for the loss of his home of years and any and all equity therein.id.at.in other words,schaefer central claim was that onewest and fannie mae could not exercise their right to foreclose under the mortgage contract.
the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the district of new hampshire on the basis of diversity of citizenship.see.the defendants filed motions to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing both that schaefer tort claims were barred by the economic loss doctrine and that the claims failed because the defendants had not breached any duties owed to schaefer.
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.the court first rejected schaefer argument that the economic loss doctrine does not apply to claims seeking injunctive relief,holding that because the harm alleged in the complaint is economic,consisting of the loss of his property and the equity he held in the property,the doctrine applies without regard to the form of relief sought.schaefer,wl,at.the court went on to find that none of the tort claims fell within any exception to the economic loss doctrine recognized by the new hampshire courts.id.at.the court dismissed the negligence claim,holding that schaefer had not alleged facts or developed an argument sufficient to establish that onewest assumed duties based on harmon january letter or the milian letter.id.at.regarding the negligent misrepresentation claim,the court concluded that the subject matter of the milian letter relate d entirely to the defendants attempts to collect schaefer mortgage debt,and that any claim related to that letter was therefore barred by the economic loss doctrine.id.at second and third alterations in original,quotation marks omitted.
schaefer appealed.we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo an order dismissing a claim under rule b.see.ret,at.
the economic loss doctrine is a doctrine according to which parties bound by a contract may not pursu e tort recovery for purely economic or commercial losses associated with the contract relationship.see plourde sand gravel,quoting tietsworth harley davidson,further proceedings at.the purpose of the doctrine is to prevent tort law unreasonable interference with principles of contract law.see id.at.
in its broadest form,the doctrine reaches beyond the contractual context,and provides that a plaintiff may not recover in a negligence claim for purely economic loss.see id.at quoting border brook terrace condo.ass gladstone,see also kelleher marvin lumber cedar,we have recognized that a plaintiff may not ordinarily recover damages for purely economic loss in tort.in other words,the doctrine holds that,in the absence of a specific duty,no general duty exists to avoid negligently causing economic loss.this version of the doctrine has been adopted in new hampshire.as the new hampshire supreme court has stated,i n new hampshire,the general rule is that persons must refrain from causing personal injury and property damage to third parties,but no corresponding tort duty exists with respect to economic loss.see plourde,at quotation marks omitted.however,this broad doctrine has exceptions 
the gravamen of schaefer argument is that new hampshire law recognizes an exception to the economic loss doctrine for voluntarily assumed duties extrinsic to the central issues of a contract,and that the defendants assumed such a gratuitous,duty to provide him a reinstatement amount and consider his application to modify the mortgage following his default.see schaefer br.
the new hampshire supreme court has long followed the guidance of the restatement of torts concerning issues of tort law generally the second restatement of torts does not discuss the question of a defendant liability for economic loss resulting from the breach of an assumed duty,but does recognize that under certain circumstances,o ne who undertakes,gratuitously,to render services to another is subject to liability for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking.see restatement second of torts emphasis added see also id.addressing harm in similar terms.the new hampshire supreme court follows this rule in cases 
while the restatement does not explicitly address whether economic losses,as opposed to losses resulting from physical injury,are recoverable for the breach of a voluntarily assumed duty,courts in a large number of jurisdictions have read the references to physical harm in and of the restatement as affirmatively precluding recovery for economic losses in such cases a smaller number of courts,by contrast,have held that and do not limit liability for the breach of an assumed duty,and that economic losses are recoverable in such cases as well,at least under some circumstances 
the law in new hampshire is not entirely clear on this question.in one case predating the adoption of the current restatement of torts,brunelle nashua building and loan association,the new hampshire supreme court held that the defendant,a seller of real estate,could be held liable in tort for breaching its agent separate oral undertaking to see to it that the plaintiffs received a good title,even though the defendant contractual obligations did not extend so far.id.at syllabus see also id.at opinion.more recently,in seymour new hampshire savings bank,the court referred to the prevailing rule according to which no tort duty is imposed upon a lender to exercise reasonable care in its inspection of the borrower premises unless the lender voluntarily undertakes to perform such inspection for the benefit of the borrower,see id.at emphasis added,quotation marks omitted,thus perhaps suggesting that a defendant may be held liable for economic losses resulting from the failure to conduct such inspections if the defendant had in fact voluntarily assumed a duty to conduct them.
even if we were to assume that the holding in brunelle and the dictum in seymour place new hampshire in the camp of states that extend and to economic losses resulting from the breach of an assumed duty in some circumstances,we would still conclude that schaefer has not stated a negligence claim on which relief may be granted.
the parties appear to agree on what is apparent from the face of the mortgage agreement that schaefer was obligated to make regular monthly payments and that,if he failed to do so,onewest and fannie mae had a right to accelerate the loan and foreclose on the mortgage.the parties also agree that schaefer did not make the required payments.the mortgage agreement provided as well that in the event of schaefer default onewest would discontinue foreclosure proceedings and reinstate the mortgage if schaefer paid his arrears plus any expenses incurred by onewest within a prescribed period of time.schaefer alleges that the defendants additionally undertook two duties to provide him with a reinstatement amount if schaefer fell into arrears and if schaefer applied to modify his mortgage,to process his application before foreclosure.schaefer alleges that the defendants failed to perform or negligently performed these undertakings and are therefore subject to tort liability.
we conclude that new hampshire economic loss doctrine bars schaefer from recovering in tort for a breach of either of these alleged undertakings.with respect to the alleged duty to provide a reinstatement amount,it is true that onewest agreement to allow reinstatement necessarily included a promise to provide schaefer with a reinstatement amount upon request.but if onewest assumed a contractual duty to provide a reinstatement amount,schaefer tort claims here must fail because the essence of the economic loss doctrine is that a party to a contract may not pursu e tort recovery for purely economic or commercial losses associated with the contract relationship.plourde,at internal quotation marks omitted.see also tietsworth,at the doctrine generally requires transacting parties to pursue only their contractual remedies when asserting an economic loss claim.internal quotation marks omitted.although schaefer claimed in the breach of contract count of his complaint that he was denied critical information in the form of a reinstatement quote,thereby denying him any realistic opportunity to reinstate his loan,schaefer br.addendum,as explained previously,schaefer has abandoned his breach of contract claim on appeal,see supra.
nor can schaefer recover in tort for the breach of an alleged duty that contradicts the terms of the contract.the mortgage agreement specifically granted onewest the right to accelerate payments and foreclose in the event that schaefer fell into default and failed to reinstate.it is clear,then,that the second duty schaefer alleges the defendants assumed the duty to process his mortgage modification application before foreclosure is not merely an additional duty,coming on top of the obligations the defendants assumed under the contract
