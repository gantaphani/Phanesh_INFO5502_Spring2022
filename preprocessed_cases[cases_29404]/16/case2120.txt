the regional airport authority of louisville airport authority appeals a grant of summary judgment to c parking of louisville republic on its claim that it was allowed to terminate its airport parking concession due to financial losses in the wake of the terrorist attack on september.because the district court erred in finding that security restrictions on parking implemented after the attacks constituted damage or destruction to the premises that would release republic from its contractual obligations,we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of republic.none of the other arguments raised by republic in defense to the airport authority counterclaim for breach of contract is meritorious.we therefore remand to the district court with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of the airport authority.
in june,after a public bidding process,republic won a contract that gave it the right and obligation to operate premises at the louisville international airport sdf that included the surface parking lot,garage,toll plaza,and the employee parking lot.in return,republic agreed to pay the airport authority the greater of a monthly minimum guarantee of of the gross receipts from the same month of the previous year or an amount equal to of its actual gross receipts for that month.at the beginning of each month republic paid the minimum guarantee,and it tendered any difference between that amount and the figure at the end of that same month.the interest rate for late payment was of the balance due.
the parties implemented the agreement smoothly until september,when the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon resulted in the federal aviation authority faa stopping commercial air travel for approximately three days.afterwards,enhanced airport security restrictions meant that republic could not use parking spaces,of the entire lot,until november,when the faa made the spaces available to anyone who was willing to undergo a vehicle search.travel at sdf remained below levels until republic terminated the contract in november,although the decrease in travel volume in october represented an improvement over the deficit in september.
under the terms of the contract,republic owed the airport authority on october,amount of the october minimum guarantee based on the gross receipts from october.in a letter dated october,republic stated that it was not economically feasible to pay the full amount because of its revenue losses from the september attacks.the letter outlined a relief provision,modeled on republic other contracts,because it was fair and equitable that we all share equally in the pain.under its plan,republic took the september guaranteed monthly figure as a base and reduced it by the projected october decline in revenue.the emergency plan also guaranteed that republic would cover its operating costs,including for management services,although republic would pay the airport authority all revenues in excess of the direct operating costs.finally,republic computed that the airport authority should reimburse it for its september operational loss by allowing republic to deduct approximately from its guaranteed minimum for three months.upon the belief that the airport authority would find the proposal acceptable,republic remitted instead of the that the airport authority was owed under the terms of the original agreement.republic did not invoke any provisions of the contract itself to justify this reduced payment.
on october,the airport authority responded that it could not legally accept republic compromise offer due to the fact that the current minimum was bid under the franchise provisions of kentucky constitution.the airport authority further informed republic that it was in default of its payment obligations and that failure to make immediate payment may result in termination of your concession pursuit of other remedies the authority may have.
republic terminated the concession agreement on november,pursuant to section,and subparagraphs b and d thereof,and section,effective december.section b excused performance if the government took over the airport section d allowed termination if the parking facilities were damaged or destroyed and section stated that a party could not be held responsible for breach caused by factors beyond its control.on the same day,republic filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky seeking a declaratory judgment that its failure to pay the full amounts in october and november was due to causes beyond its control,and therefore it was not in breach of its agreement with the airport authority.
on november,republic sent the airport authority an additional payment of for october,based on actual gross revenues of and the deductions for revenue loss,operating expenses,and its september shortfall,as outlined above.the payment represented of the revenue after deducting the actual operating cost for october.republic did not charge the airport authority the management fee.because its revenues were down for the first six days of november,republic reduced its minimum guarantee for november by that percentage with the other two reductions for operating costs and the september loss,the estimated payment totaled,instead of due under the original arrangement.
in a certified letter dated november,the airport authority demanded immediate full payment an additional to settle october more for the november minimum guarantee and interest on both payments from their respective due dates.the airport authority also informed republic that it was making alternative arrangements for the operation of the public and employee paid parking facilities at louisville international airport from and after december.on november,the airport authority filed a against republic for breach of contract,demanding full payment,compensatory damages,incidental damages,costs,and pre and interest.the parties then filed simultaneous for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted republic motion,and denied the airport authority,for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
this is a diversity case,governed by kentucky law.we agree with the district court that the language of the concession agreement is unambiguous.we therefore enforce the agreement strictly according to its terms and assign the contract language in dispute its ordinary meaning,without considering extrinsic evidence.frear pta indust.the district court granted summary judgment to republic,a decision this panel reviews de novo.copeland machulis,cir per curiam.
the district court found the language of section d of the contract to be a plausible basis for termination.that provision allows republic to end the agreement after days in the event of 
the damage or destruction of all or a material part of the premises used or occupied by republic hereunder that materially and adversely affects the ability of republic to perform its obligations hereunder,or damage or destruction of all or a material part of the airport or airport facilities,including access to public roads,which is necessary to the operation of republic business,except to the extent and in the event such damage or destruction results from acts of negligence of republic.
republic argued in the court below that the events of september resulted in destruction or material damage to the parking lot at the louisville airport because the ensuing security regulations deprived it of access to prime parking spaces.in addition,faa warnings about the dangers of air travel and admonitions to travelers to take public transportation to the airport also constituted damage to the facility.republic therefore concluded that it could terminate the contract.the district court found that the dramatic decline in use of the airport after september resulted in a substantial loss of the value of the parking facilities,and concluded that the parking facility at the airport was damaged in such a way that republic was unable to perform as required by the agreement.it rejected the airport authority argument that damage was limited to physical damage,not loss in value,and determined that republic was entitled to terminat
