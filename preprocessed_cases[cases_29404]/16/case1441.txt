we are asked in this appeal to consider whether a prescriptive statute in louisiana retroactively applies to eric holt cause of action.holt home in new orleans,louisiana suffered extensive fire damage in january,and he sought to recover payment under his homeowners policy with state farm fire casualty company state farm.dissatisfied with state farm response to his claim,holt filed suit against the insurer in february.between the time holt cause of action arose in january and his lawsuit in february,the state legislature amended the applicable prescriptive statutes in the louisiana insurance code.previously,an insured had only months from loss to file a suit the amendment extended the prescriptive period to months.state farm moved the district court for summary judgment,arguing that holt suit was time barred and that he could not benefit from the extended prescription period.the district court denied the motion,concluding that the amended prescription period applied retroactively to holt claim.we affirm.
holt was out of town when his property suffered extensive fire damage on or about january.when holt returned to new orleans and discovered the fire in february,he contacted state farm about his loss.state farm refused to pay the claim.holt sued state farm in louisiana trial court on february,and state farm thereafter removed the suit to federal district court.holt sought payment under his homeowners policy,as well as statutory penalties,general and specific damages,attorney fees,and costs.state farm denied liability.the insurance company also argued that holt claim was prescribed under both the contract and louisiana insurance law.
in october,state farm moved for summary judgment on the basis of its prescription argument.state farm argued that both the insurance policy and louisiana insurance law required that holt file his lawsuit within months of january,the date his house suffered fire damage.thus,because holt lawsuit was filed in february,it was time barred.holt opposed the motion,arguing that he benefitted from the amendment to the louisiana insurance laws that extended the applicable prescription period from months to months.the amendment,act of act,became effective in.holt argued that because act went into effect before his cause of action had prescribed,the statute retroactively applied to his suit and extended the prescription period,thereby rendering his lawsuit timely filed.state farm countered that act could not be applied retroactively for two reasons it was a substantive law,and therefore,under louisiana law,had prospective application only and even if it were not a substantive law and therefore capable of being applied retroactively,such application was unconstitutional.the district court denied state farm motion for summary judgment,concluding that act applied retroactively to holt claim.finding that its order involved a controlling question of law as to which there was a substantial ground for difference of opinion,the district court certified the prescription issue for immediate appeal to this court.we granted state farm leave to appeal,and have jurisdiction under b.
the sole question presented in this appeal is whether act,which extended the applicable prescription period in this case,applies retroactively to holt cause of action.act amended the prescriptive periods in two louisiana insurance statutes.b and f the previous version of b provided that for specified types of insurance,including fire,an insurance policy could not limit a right of action against an insurer to less than months after the inception of the loss.similarly,the previous version of f provided that a suit for recovery under the standard fire insurance policy in louisiana had to commence within months after the inception of the loss.act changed the prescriptive periods in both statutes from months to months.it went into effect on august,
finally,holt homeowners policy,which provided fire insurance to his property at all relevant times,specified that with respect to lawsuits against the insurer,t he action must be started within one year after the date of loss or damage.the policy also stated that when a policy provision conflicted with the applicable state law,the state law would govern.
we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.am.int l specialty lines ins.canal indem,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.the facts and evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the.am.int l specialty,at.
when,as here,jurisdiction is based on diversity,we apply the substantive law of the forum state.erie tompkins.to determine louisiana law,we look to the final decisions of louisiana highest court.am.int l specialty,at.in the absence of a final decision by that court addressing the issue at hand,a federal court must determine,in its best judgment,how the state highest court would resolve the issue if presented with it.id.as the louisiana supreme court has not addressed the retroactive applicability of act,the district court had to make an erie guess on appeal,we do the same,de novo.
article of the louisiana civil code sets out the governing rule of statutory construction applicable to this case.that article,titled retroactivity of laws,states 
in the absence of contrary legislative expression,substantive laws apply prospectively only.procedural and interpretative laws apply both prospectively and retroactively,unless there is legislative expression to the contrary.
a court application of article requires a inquiry cole celotex,so d.first,the court must ascertain whether in the enactment,the legislature expressed its intent regarding retroactive or prospective application.if the legislature did so,the judicial inquiry ends.if the legislature did not,the court must then classify the enactment as substantive,procedural,or interpretive id.at.substantive laws either establish new rules,rights,and duties or change existing ones.prejean dixie lloyds ins,so d.procedural laws,in contrast,describe the method of enforcing,processing,administering or determining rights,liabilities or status.id.thus,if a statute merely prescribes the method of enforcing a right which previously existed or maintains redress for invasion of rights,it is classified as procedural.id.interpretive laws merely establish the meaning that the interpretive statute had from the time of its enactment.id.
as is clear from its text,article expressly authorizes the retroactive application of laws that a court deems procedural or interpretive.indeed,the louisiana supreme court over thirty years ago stated that according to its consistent interpretation of the louisiana laws,procedural laws generally will be given retroactive effect in the absence of language showing a contrary intention.lott haley,so d.this jurisprudential rule is subject to the exception that procedural laws are not accorded retroactive effect where such retroactivity would operate unconstitutionally to disturb vested rights.id.
in determining whether act applies retroactively to holt cause of action,we start with the first prong of the article inquiry whether the legislature expressed its intent regarding retroactive or prospective application.a review of act shows that it does not contain a clear and unmistakable expression of such legislative intent.we thus proceed to the second prong of the inquiry to determine whether act is substantive,procedural,or interpretive.
in louisiana,statutes of limitation are generally treated as procedural laws.chance am.honda motor,so d,see also lott,so d at same.under this well established principle of statutory interpretation,statutes of prescription generally apply to all actions instituted after the effective date,even though the cause of action may have accrued before the enactment of the legislation.chance,so d at.the louisiana supreme court has specified two exceptions to this rule of retroactivity for prescriptive statutes the statute is not retroactive where such application would strip a part
