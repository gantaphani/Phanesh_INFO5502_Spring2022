plaintiffs appeal from the district court dismissal of their claims under.b.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
freightliner of knoxville,fok is a tennessee corporation authorized to sell and service the freightliner brand of trucks.carroll properties,is a tennessee partnership that built and leased the fok facility to buddie carroll.carroll,a tennessee resident who is the sole shareholder of fok and its president,then leased the facility to fok.
daimlerchrysler vans,llc dc vans is a delaware company wholly owned by daimlerchrysler,ag.dc vans distributes a line of commercial vans known as the sprinter.defendant freightliner,llc fllc is a delaware company also wholly owned by the parent daimlerchrysler,ag.fllc manufactures vehicles marketed under the freightliner brand.
fok alleges that in february,the president of fllc presented it and a select group of freightliner dealers with the opportunity to sell what was to be called the freightliner sprinter,a commercial van which could also be customized for passengers.although it was to be marketed in the united states under the freightliner brand,the sprinter was virtually identical to a van that had been sold in europe for many years,with tremendous success,under the brand.fok believed that if it became a freightliner sprinter franchisee,it would be able to sell a great deal of product for a long time.
the catch,according to fok,was that a dealer would only be selected to sell the sprinter if it were to upgrade its facility in a variety of ways,including among other things creation of a separate showroom for sprinter vans,so as to segregate potential sprinter corporate customers from truck customers who frequent every freightliner dealership for sales and service.fok took the bait and accordingly changed the design plans for its planned knoxville facility by adding designated space for the sprinter vans.fok estimates that it paid in additional construction costs in order to build the new space.fok was rewarded for its efforts sometime after may fllc notified fok that it had been approved for a sprinter retail sales and service agreement.at the same time,fllc told fok that dc vans,and not fllc,would be the distributor of the sprinter vans.this appears to have been a mere hiccup in the negotiations,however,as on september,fok entered into a dealer agreement with dc vans for the sale of sprinters.
fok alleges that regardless of who its distributor was fllc or dc vans,it had always operated under the unwritten assumption that the sprinter vans would be distributed exclusively to freightliner dealers such as fok,and sold exclusively under the freightliner brand.as fok states in its amended complaint,dc vans stepped seamlessly into the shoes of fllc.it parroted and confirmed the distinct impression of exclusivity fostered by fllc representations.this assumption proved mistaken,however sometime in,fok was informed that the sprinter van would also be sold through dodge dealers under the dodge brand,as a dodge sprinter.to add insult to injury,on july,fok was informed that not only would the sprinter be concomitantly sold as a dodge product,but also that freightliner dealers would only be permitted to sell sprinter vans until,at which point the vans would be sold exclusively as a dodge product.dc vans has since pulled back from this stance,and has in fact amended the record to note that it will not terminate its sprinter agreements with freightliner dealers,and that the sprinter van will simply be dual branded for the foreseeable future.indeed,despite the instant litigation,fok and dc vans continue to do business in freightliner sprinter vans pursuant to their dealer agreement,an agreement which has now been extended through the model of freightliner sprinter.d.
dc vans concession notwithstanding,fok claims that the damage was done by the mere fact of having the rug pulled out from what it thought was an exclusive dealership agreement.essentially,fok claims that it would never have entered into the dealer agreement in the first place,nor invested in its facility,had it known that dc vans intended to distribute the sprinter under both the dodge and freightliner brands furthermore,fok maintains that dc vans has engaged in discriminatory pricing by offering dodge dealers special incentives with respect to sales of the sprinter product.due to these incentives and discounts,dodge dealers were allegedly able to offer the vans to the public at a significantly lower price than fok was able to offer and still make a profit.
fok filed suit in federal court against fllc and dc vans on october,bringing a total of eleven claims,some against both defendants and some only against dc vans.jurisdiction was proper on the basis of diversity additionally,because one of the claims arose under federal antitrust law,federal question jurisdiction was properly invoked.all eleven claims were dismissed on the pleadings by the district court.fok now only requests that we review the following two aspects of its original claims,both of which are directed solely at dc vans,not at fllc whether it was proper for the district court to dismiss fok claims under the tennessee trade practices act,ann.to and whether it was proper for the district court to dismiss fok claims under the federal act,d and e.
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss under.b.adika smith,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.kottmyer maas,cir quoting conley gibson,d.this court must accept all facts in the complaint as true and construe the complaint liberally in favor of the plaintiff.adika,at.
claims under the tennessee trade practices act 
the tennessee trade practices act ttpa states that n o supplier may terminate,cancel,fail to renew or substantially change the competitive circumstances of a retail agreement without good cause.ann.fok claims under the ttpa are twofold.first,it alleges that by the sprinter van and by selling the van through dodge dealerships,dc vans has effected a substantial change in the competitive circumstances of a retail agreement.second,it claims that dc vans constructively terminated the retail agreement,both by stating its intent to withdraw the van from freightliner dealers and by providing competing dodge dealers with the same sprinter product on better terms than those offered to fok.
in dismissing fok claims,the district court ruled that the ttpa does not apply to motor vehicles.the ttpa defines a retailer as a person,firm or corporation engaged in the business of selling and retailing farm implements and machinery,construction,utility and industrial equipment,outdoor power equipment,attachments or repair parts and shall not include retailers of petroleum products.fok continues to assert that the sprinter van qualifies as industrial equipment under the ttpa,as it is designed ostensibly for industrial use.dc vans vigorously counters that the sprinter is quite simply a motor vehicle,distinguishable from the common understanding of industrial equipment,and that the presence of another tennessee statutory scheme which provides for the licensing and regulation of motor vehicle sales,et,suggests that the state legislature did not intend to include motor vehicles within the ambit of the ttpa.there are apparently no tennessee authorities that definitively address whether industrial equipment includes motor vehicles used for industrial purposes under the ttpa.
we frankly find the language of the ttpa to be rather vague and unhelpful,and are disinclined to endorse the district court sweeping interpretation of this statute without more guidance from the tennessee legislature or courts.we find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute,however,because even assuming that the ttpa governs the distribution and sale of the sprinter van,fok has failed to allege facts that would amount to a violation of the statute.
first,fok claim that dc vans has substantially change d the competitive circumstances of the retail agreement,is undercut by the plain terms of the retail agreement itself,which fok quoted in relevant part in the amended complaint.in the retail agreement,dc vans retains all rights and discretion with respect to the manufacture,distribution,sales and service of motor vehicles,including the rights a to sell and service contract goods in the primary market area b to appoint other dealers in the primary market area on terms and conditions deemed appropriate amended compl.emphasis added.this provision explicitly contemplates the sale of sprinter vans through other dealers.consequently,dc vans decision to sell the vans through dodge dealers was actually provided for in the retail agreement.neither the amended complaint nor fok brief identifies any portion of the retail agreement that precludes dc vans from the sprinter van or from specifically selling it through dodge.nor does any portion of the amended complaint indicate that the retail agreement speaks to how the terms of the agreement between dc vans and fok should compare to the terms offered to any other dealers a straightforward reading of the agreement belies fok argument that dc vans business relationship with dodge amounted to a change in the competitive circumstances of the retail agreement under the ttpa,as this relationship is explicitly anticipated in the agreement itself.
fok makes a number of factual allegations pertaining to representations made by dc vans prior to the execution of the retail agreement.the amended complaint alleges that based on these representations fok was led to believe that freightliner would be the exclusive dealer of the sprinter van.see amended compl.even taken as true,the allegations of such representation are not enough for fok claim of changed competitive circumstances to survive,as they stand in stark contrast to the terms that were eventually included in the retail agreement.see staubach retail,llc hill realty,the parol evidence rule does not permit contracting parties to use extraneous evidence to alter,vary,or qualify the plain meaning of an unambiguous written contract.furthermore,to allow a party to a contract to admit that the party signed the contract but to deny that the terms of the contract express the party agreement would destroy the value of contracts.internal citations omitted.moreover,dc vans can not be said to have somehow pulled a fast one on fok by memorializing different terms than the parties discussed,as it had fok sign a release that discharged any prior obligations owed to fok by dc vans,including claims based upon any prior agreement or representation.the retail agreement itself also stated that it constitute s the parties entire agreement relating to selling and servicing contract goods,and supercedes all prior negotiations,understandings and agreements,written or oral,relating to its subject matter.if fok had any doubts about whether it maintained an exclusive right to sell the sprinter van based on prior discussions between the parties,despite the contrary language in the retail agreement,the explicit provisions of the release and the retail agreement should have cleared them up.any such representations were clearly and intentionally excluded from the retail agreement,and fok can not now rely on them to support its claim that dc vans changed the agreement competitive circumstances.
fok also fails to allege facts to support its claim that dc vans terminated the retail agreement.although the complaint alleges that dc vans constructively terminated the agreement by the sprinter vans and distributing them through dodge,such distribution was specifically contemplated in the agreement.we would be to read fok factual allegations to include a claim of constructive termination of the agreement based on actions taken by dc vans that were provided for by the very terms of the agreement itself.
additionally,fok contends that dc vans terminated the agreement by advising fok that it would stop distributing sprinter vans under the freightliner brand after.this allegation could be read to present a claim for anticipatory breach,presenting us with the potentially interesting legal question of whether anticipatory breach amounts to termination under the ttpa.yet fok now concedes that dc vans has decided not to withdraw the freightliner sprinter from the market and to offer an extension of the dealer agreement,effectively terminating its termination claim.this concession forces fok to put all its eggs in the changed competitive circumstances basket based on the of the vans,an argument which we reject under the terms of the contract as discussed above.
for these reasons,we affirm,albeit on different grounds,the district court dismissal of fok claims under the ttpa.
claims under the act 
the price discrimination act rpa amends portions of the clayton antitrust act and is codified at a d,and e.fok amended complaint,however,alleges violations of d and e only these two sections of the rpa deal with discrimination in the field of promotional services made available to purchasers who buy for resale.lewis philip morris,cir.the language of the sections provides as follows 
d payment for services or facilities for processing or sale it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing,handling,sale,or offering for sale of any products or commodities manufactured,sold,or offered for sale by such person,unless such payment or consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities.
e furnishing services or facilities for processing,handling.it shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of a commodity bought for resale,with or without processing,by contracting to furnish or furnishing,or by contributing to the furnishing of,any services or facilities connected with the processing,handling,sale,or offering for sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms.
emphasis added.as this court has said,if the seller here,dc vans pays the retailer here,dodge dealerships to perform the promotional service,d applies.lewis,at.whereas if the seller itself provides the promotional service to the retailer,e applies.id.this is often a fine distinction and thus the two sections tend to be considered together as a harmonious whole.id.at bottom,t he aim of both sections is to eliminate devices by which preferred buyers obtain discriminatory preferences under the guise of promotional allowances.bouldis suzuki motor,cir citing federal trade comm.fred meyer,d.
the services or facilities envisioned by the rpa are not explicitly defined within the text of the act,but they have been construed to include any kind of advertising,catalogs,demonstrators,display and storage cabinets,display materials,hand bills,special packaging or package sizes,warehouse facilities,accepting returns for credit,prizes or merchandise for conducting promotional contests,and monetary awards paid by the seller to clerks,salesmen,and other employees of the customer for special sales or promotional efforts.lewis,at quoting cecil corley motor general motors,see also barbara bruckman,discounts,discrimination,and exclusive dealing issues under the act,antitrust,section d has been applied to a broad range of promotional payments,including cooperative advertising programs,rebates that a retailer must pass to consumers,payments for customer mailings,payments for preferred shelf space,payments for institutional advertising,advertising the buyer business generally,and unjustified deductions for promotional allowances.services and facilities covered by section e have been held to include handbills,demonstrators,catalogues,cabinets,display racks,prizes or merchandise for conducting promotional contests,materials,advertising services,providing personnel
