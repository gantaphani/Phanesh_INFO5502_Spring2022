opinion of the court 
this case involves a dispute between two businessmen,john edwards,the,and wesley wyatt,the,concerning control over pilot air freight corporation pilot,an air freight forwarding company.
edwards and wyatt were introduced to one another by a philadelphia attorney,richard phillips,who represented both businessmen separately.phillips became involved in the business as well,and a conflict over the company management and control ensued.the dispute has been marked by shifting alliances and agreements among these three individuals.
this appeal arises from edwards action against wyatt for breach of an oral contract.edwards appeals from the district court judgment in favor of wyatt after a trial.the district court held that,though there was a contract,wyatt had established a defense of anticipatory repudiation.
edwards has argued,however,that wyatt waived any defense of repudiation and denies,in any event,that an anticipatory repudiation occurred.of even greater significance,edwards contends that the district court did not consider the evidence of events that took place after a july,letter,which the district court held had constituted edwards repudiation of the agreement with wyatt.these events,edwards claims,either nullified any repudiation or reconstituted an agreement between edwards and wyatt.
finally,edwards complains that the district court failed to address or resolve edwards alternative claim that he was entitled to relief against wyatt based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel.that claim was pleaded in count two of edwards complaint.
our review leads us to conclude that,indeed,the district court did not consider material trial evidence or if it did,it failed to refer to any such evidence in its opinion.nor did the district court make findings of fact relating to that evidence,which pertained to events that took place after july.moreover,the district court failed in its opinion to express its reasoning or findings having to do with the alternate count which edwards pleaded the promissory estoppel count.it is for these reasons that we will reverse the district court judgment and remand for a new trial.
these parties have had a long and convoluted relationship.at various times,edwards aligned himself with wyatt and against phillips.at other times,wyatt aligned himself with phillips and against edwards.at still other times,edwards and wyatt were aligned with one another against phillips.in each instance,the efforts were designed to gain control of pilot.these shifting alliances did little credit to any of these three individuals.eventually,however,edwards and wyatt meetings came down to an april oral agreement,known as the handshake agreement.
therefore,we will first describe,as briefly as possible,the relevant events that occurred prior to the formation of the handshake agreement.we will then discuss in fuller detail the handshake agreement,followed by edwards purported repudiation of that agreement on july,and then the events that took place following the repudiation.
activities prior to the handshake agreement 
edwards was the president of pilot,and owned of the one hundred total issued shares of stock in pilot.the remaining shares were owned by edwards cousins.edward wyatt,wl,at,findings of fact.in,phillips,who was counsel to both edwards and wyatt,introduced the two,because he believed that wyatt might be able to help edwards and pilot by investing in pilot.id.finding of fact.both wyatt and phillips invested in pilot,and phillips became pilot chairman.
shortly thereafter,edwards decided to adopt an exit strategy from pilot because of phillips approach to running it.id.finding of fact.at first,wyatt and edwards agreed to push phillips out of pilot.wyatt,however,changed his mind,and in april realigned with phillips to vote edwards out of pilot and put phillips back in charge of the company.id.at finding of fact.
following his removal from pilot,edwards filed for bankruptcy.the assets of edwards bankruptcy estate included his interest in pilot as well as claims edwards had against wyatt,pilot and phillips.id.finding of fact.
edwards,who had been acting pro se,retained stephen braga as counsel to represent him in the bankruptcy proceeding ja stipulation of facts h.
because of the bankruptcy proceeding,the control of pilot stock,as it stood by the fall of,was as follows wyatt owned percent of the issued and outstanding stock of pilot,edwards chapter trustee controlled his and percent of pilot stock,and the balance of pilot stock was owned or controlled by phillips,who also served as pilot president and chief executive officer.edward,wl,at finding of fact.therefore,wyatt or phillips could secure control of pilot if they were able to obtain control over edwards stock in pilot.
in december,one of wyatt lawyers,jay ochroch,met with edwards lawyer,braga,to discuss a potential alignment between edwards and wyatt and the possibility of trying to effect a sale of pilot.id.finding of fact.following this meeting,braga testified that a dinner meeting was held in philadelphia in early january among wyatt his counsel,ochroch and braga.ja.at this meeting,braga sought to determine why edwards should trust wyatt given wyatt switch to side with phillips in april.id.
braga then arranged for a meeting between edwards and wyatt.edwards testified that,at that meeting,wyatt explained his reasons for seeking to realign with edwards.ja.
following this meeting,edwards and wyatt entered into a settlement agreement on february.edward,wl,at finding of fact.the settlement agreement provided that edwards and wyatt use their best efforts to cause pilot to sell either all or substantially all of the assets of pilot,the stock of pilot,or cause an initial public offering ipo of the pilot stock,and required that edwards and wyatt attempt to file a joint motion to secure the sale or initial public offering of pilot or the conversion of the bankruptcy case to a chapter case.ja 
after the settlement agreement was reached,edwards and wyatt made concerted efforts to secure the trustee backing for an ipo of pilot.the trustee rejected the proposal,and the district court denied edwards and wyatt joint motion for the bankruptcy court to approve the ipo proposal.see edward,wl,at findings of fact.
instead,the trustee determined that edwards stock in pilot should be sold to phillips on march,the trustee filed her sale motion t he trustee sought the sale of edwards pilot stock to phillips for million and mutual releases by the estate and pilot for various claims pending between the estate and pilot.id.findings of fact.
b.the unwritten handshake agreement 
following these events,edwards and wyatt entered into an unwritten handshake agreement on april,which edwards claims wyatt has breached.
w hen it became apparent that wyatt and phillips were now involved in a bidding contest for edwards stock to avoid being in a minority position,wyatt and edwards agreed that neither would enter into any agreement with phillips to settle the bankruptcy sale proceeding without the participation of the other party the handshake agreement.
id.finding of fact.this agreement was never reduced to writing.id.finding of fact.the motivation for the handshake agreement differed from the purpose of the settlement agreement 
the handshake agreement was totally different from the february written s ettlement a greement.as braga put it at trial by the time of the h andshake a greement,it was clear the two options in the written agreement,the ipo motion and a chapter to conversion motion,were not going to work,so the written agreement was fulfilled by that point in time.the h andshake a greement was an additional agreement made in light of the changed circumstances that those two things did work.
id.finding of fact.the handshake agreement involved a mutual exchange of promises the mutual consideration underlying this new agreement was wyatt did not want edwards to reach an agreement with phillips any more than edwards wanted wyatt to reach an agreement with phillips.by standing together,they were each stronger.id.finding of fact emphasis added.
the district court found that,according to the testimony of ira silverstein,one of wyatt attorneys,under the handshake agreement,if either wyatt or edwards took an unreasonable position,the other party would no longer be bound by the handshake agreement.id.finding of fact.
wyatt testified that the handshake agreement meant that wyatt would not settle the matter behind edwards back.ja.the district court then held that the handshake agreement was binding,and that t he facts at trial established that wyatt agreement with phillips,without the participation of edwards,would have been a breach of the handshake agreement.edward,wl,at conclusion of law emphasis added.
wyatt and phillips make competing bids for edwards stock 
in early may,wyatt tendered a bid of million for edwards assets,but,as noted,the trustee favored and supported phillips million bid.id.at findings of fact.
over edwards objection,the bankruptcy court established procedures for a sale to go forward,and wyatt submitted a new bid of million.id.at findings of fact.
d.the bankruptcy court hearing of july,
the bankruptcy court set a hearing date for july,for the purpose of selling edwards pilot stock.braga testified that,two days prior to the hearing,an attorney,alan davis,had entered the case.davis represented pilot franchisees and employees and managers of pilot including phillips.ja.braga further testified that on july,he received a call from silverstein,wyatt counsel,in which silverstein told him that davis sought agreement of a continuance of the next day hearing so they could pursue global settlement talks.ja.according to braga,silverstein asked braga to agree to the continuance at the bankruptcy hearing,and braga agreed to do so because wyatt and edwards were aligned.ja.
phillips,in collaboration with pilot franchisees,offered a bid of million.edward,wl,at finding of fact.
the bankruptcy court issued a continuance at the request of counsel for the pilot franchisees and of braga.id.finding of fact see also ja tr.of bankruptcy court hearing of july.
edwards argues that this continuance request triggered new fissures in the relationship between wyatt and him.according to the testimony of kevin brinkworth edwards associate,wyatt,who was present at the bankruptcy court hearing,seemed somewhat confused,and said,why is this happening why is there a continuance i was aware of this.i wanted to buy this stock today.ja.brinkworth testified that he informed braga of wyatt reaction.id.as braga testified,i was approached by kevin brinkworth who told me that he had just had a very disturbing conversation with wyatt,who was upset about my agreeing to the continuance and blaming me for his inability for buying the shares that day.ja.
wyatt testified that he did not agree completely with brinkworth account of the meeting 
my recollection is,i was confused by the continuance and still am and did understand why the continuance happened,but i do not recall speaking with you braga and telling you that you ruined everything.i do recall that conversation at all.i am not saying it did take place,but i do recall that 
what i said to brinkworth is i did understand the procedure that was taking place.i did understand what was going on.
edwards testified that,at some time following the hearing,wyatt 
told me that he was fully prepared to bid on the stock.that he had authorized his attorney,ochroch,to bid up to million and that he told me that he had a facility at republic bank for another million and that the bidding did take place because he braga screwed it up.
the district court found that a lthough braga claims there was some confusion over wyatt understanding of the july continuance,braga admitted at the time that edwards would not have been prejudiced as a result of the continuance so long as the bids in place at the time were made irrevocable.edward,wl,at finding of fact.the district court also found that,as edwards testified,wyatt had authorized ochroch to bid up to million for the pilot stock.id.finding of fact.
braga letter of july 
on july,braga wrote 
to ochroch and silverstein expressing his concern about the relationship between wyatt and edwards because,as a result of the july hearing silverstein had instructed wyatt not to talk to edwards anymore and it hard for two people to have an alignment going forward if you not talking to each other.
edward,wl,at finding of fact.
in greater detail,this letter stated 
i write to provide you with the benefit of my client thoughts on where we are at this new juncture of our case.john edwards perceives that the essential point of your negotiations with the franchisees has to be to effectively offer his stock to the franchisees,in exchange for their agreement to participate in the management of the company as wes wyatt would like and to pursue wes idea of rolling them up into the company.john can understand why wes might believe that these are valid business objectives to pursue,although john disagrees with them.nonetheless,if this is the objective then it fundamentally changes the very premise of the cooperating relationship between john and wes,which was designed to insure that john retained the benefit of his pilot stock and then assisted wes in controlling the company future.neither john nor i would dispute that legitimate beliefs might justify such a shift in the parties relationship,but we both think that this apparent fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between he and wes needs to be recognized up front and dealt with as such.
the reality of the events over the past hours only heightens john belief and,in this case,mine as well that something fundamental has changed.in fact,those events confirm that there really is no ongoing relationship between john and wes at this point in time.by declining to continue john consulting contract with wes,by declining to make a good faith payment toward john legal fees,by declining to allow john to speak with wes,and by declining as of the time of this writing to have wes confirm to me that he understands that everything that happened in court yesterday morning happened at ira silverstein direction,john believes that you have effectively severed the relationship.in particular,john believes that he and wes had an express understanding that wes would take care of john financially until this matter reached its conclusion in john view,that understanding has now been breached by the foregoing actions.
in the few hours since we have spoken,and as a result of my communicating the results of our conversation this morning to john combined with yesterday results,john has gone over the edge.i have never seen him like this before,and i do not know if i can control him.nothing would surprise me at this point.if your plan is as john perceives it to be,then i would suggest that you make negotiating an endgame result with john your first and immediate priority.otherwise,the game may be over as far as he is concerned,if it is not already.
ja emphasis added.
f.the braga letter of july,
braga testified that he sent another letter on the following day because he had received no response to the prior day letter.ja.in relevant part,this letter stated 
when i arrived at my office this morning,john edwards was here and still very upset.we spent the morning discussing the circumstances in which john presently finds himself,and as a result of those discussions,it is clear that there is no turning back from what john views as the breach of his relationship with wes.
in light of the foregoing,john has asked me to endeavor to negotiate his own independent settlement in this matter.i have been authorized to give you and,thus,wes a period within which to conclude a settlement agreement with john.if such an agreement has not been concluded within that time,then i have been directed to provide the same opportunity to phillips,which i will initiate on friday,august,if necessary.
ja emphasis added.
ochroch testified that,in his view,the july letter and the july letter 
together meant that there was going to be no cooperation between edwards and wyatt,all bets were off and edwards could not force wes wyatt to pay him some amount of money beyond what he was bidding in open court,that edwards was going to go to phillips and try to make a deal for himself.
ja.silverstein,ochroch,testified that a s i read this july letter,it terminated the handshake agreement.ja.
the district court found that wyatt understood the july,letter to mean that the handshake agreement was terminated.edward,wl,at finding of fact emphasis added.the district court held that this letter constituted a repudiation of the handshake agreement.id.at conclusion of law.
meeting in early august 
edwards identifies several events that occurred after the july letter.he argues that these events would constitute either a retraction of the repudiation or a new set of promises by wyatt.the district court,however,made no findings related to these events,nor did it refer to them in its opinion.accordingly,we are obliged to refer to evidence in the record as it relates to these events.
the first of these events was an august meeting.braga testified that in response to his july letter,he received a call from ochroch inviting him to come up to philadelphia for a meeting to discuss the issues.ja.this meeting occurred,according to braga,in the second week of august.id 
braga testified that in addition to ochroch and himself,this meeting was attended by brinkworth wyatt and wyatt counsel,ochroch and lane fisher.id.edwards was not present,nor was silverstein,another counsel for wyatt.id.
according to braga,w e talked through the issues and there was in effect what i call a compromise resolution.ja.
ochroch testified that he remembered the meeting differently 
braga told us that wyatt was not supporting edwards the way he should and he needed edwards and if he would do it he was going to go over to phillips and try to make a deal with phillips we did not make a deal.we did not patch everything up.everybody went their separate ways 
august meeting in coffee shop between edwards and wyatt 
sometime in august,there was a meeting at a coffee shop in the building where edwards resided.the district court did not discuss this meeting in its opinion.
wyatt testified that at this coffee shop meeting,he and edwards discussed the possibility of my outbidding phillips.ja.according to edwards testimony,at this meeting wyatt said that 
everything is back on track and he said basically what transpired in this entire blowup or bump,it was lawyers posturing.lawyers have to justify their fees he said nothing changed in his mind with respect to what he wanted to do.he was still on board and he was fully prepared to go forward and bid on the stock,so we can go forward with what he had proposed in february,the settlement agreement to sell the stock or assets of pilot,see supra 
ja emphasis added.
wyatt also agreed that he had made a comment that the lawyers were posturing.see ja wyatt testimony.edwards testified that at this coffee shop meeting,wyatt asked me to arrange a meeting with braga in washington.he said he would like to go down and talk to braga in washington.ja.
september meeting in washington with edwards,braga,wyatt,and phil fisher 
edwards and wyatt agree that such a meeting in washington occurred in early september.the district court did not discuss this meeting in its opinion,nor did it make findings.
braga testified that several things were discussed at this meeting,including that 
we talked about phillips and what he was up to and we talked about the possibility of a settlement.wyatt told me that they were trying to have talks with the franchisees and if there was a global settlement they would have to include edwards,which is what i understood,anyway.
ja emphasis added.
edwards testified that at the meeting in washington they discussed basically just reiterating that there were no problems and that the game plan was the same as it had been since february,that is,wyatt intention was to go forward and bid on and acquire the stock.ja.
wyatt testimony acknowledged that this meeting occurred.wyatt responses to questions asked by braga acting as counsel provided wyatt view of the meeting 
do you recall in that discussion or in any other discussion with edwards asking him to arrange for you to come down to washington and meet with me 
i remember going to washington to meet with you.
do you remember that you requested edwards to set that up 
i believe i did,yes,sir.
q.in fact you submitted an affidavit that indicated that you came to washington as a courtesy to me 
i was trying to come up with some way,if there was a way,to make this thing work out.
do you recall what we discussed in washington 
before lunch,we discussed where we were and what was going on with phillips and i think i was trying to find out just explore,not find out,just explore,any options that i had discovered to try and figure out how to get this matter resolved 
q.you had a meeting couple of weeks earlier with the franchisees that did not go very well 
are you referring to the new york meeting 
a.that meeting did not go well.
q.we also discussed,what,if anything,edwards might be able to do to help you in the camden case 
that correct.
q.you were frustrated that case had not been resolved yet 
that correct 
q.you brought counsel with you to washington.
i brought fisher 
do you recall saying to me at the meeting in washington that if there was going to be a settlement as a result of the talks with the franchisees they would have to include edwards 
q.you said that to me 
i said that to you.
q.in washington 
i think i said it more than once.
ja emphasis added.
realignment and october hearing in bankruptcy court 
braga testified that at the october bankruptcy court hearing,outside the courtroom,silverstein informed him that wyatt and phillips had settled.ja.
the district court found that wyatt and phillips had made a joint bid on october,wyatt and phillips jointly offered a cash bid of million,plus the claims settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into between wyatt,phillips and others.edward,wl,at finding of fact.
later,over edwards objection,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion to sell edwards assets pursuant to wyatt and phillips joint bid.id.at finding of fact.
following these events,edwards filed a complaint against wyatt in the united states district court for the district of columbia on december,alleging breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and fraud and misrepresentation.see compl.the case was transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania.see edwards br.at.wyatt filed an answer that denied most of the complaint allegations.the answer also listed several defenses,although,significantly,it did not identify nor specify repudiation as an affirmative defense.wyatt also raised certain counterclaims,which the district court dismissed,see ja,and which are not the subject of any before us.
following proceedings,the district court held a bench trial from may to may.after receiving submissions from the parties,the district court issued its ruling on august,based on separate findings of fact and six conclusions of law.
the district court made no findings of fact based upon the events and actions which took place subsequent to the july,letter,except for facts related to the october bankruptcy hearing.nor did the district court address edwards alternate claim for relief based upon promissory estoppel.
we reproduce the text of the district court conclusions of law 
the handshake agreement represented an enforceable promise.wyatt and edwards each mutually agreed not to enter into any agreement with phillips without the participation of the other party 
the facts at trial established that wyatt agreement with phillips,without the participation of edwards,would have been a breach of the handshake agreement.
braga july,letter did not establish that wyatt had already breached the handshake agreement.
the handshake agreement was repudiated by braga july,letter.an anticipatory breach of a contract occurs whenever there has been a definite and unconditional repudiation of a contract by one party communicated to another a statement by a party that he will not or can not perform in accordance with agreement creates such a breach braga letter made clear edwards intent to terminate the handshake agreement before the time to perform had arrived.braga threatened to negotiate with phillips if wyatt did not reply to the letter.wyatt did not reply,and understood the letter to mean that the handshake agreement was terminated.
the handshake agreement was not reformed,and a new agreement between edwards and wyatt was not reached.
wyatt did not waive his defense of repudiation.wyatt was not required to raise repudiation as an affirmative defense in pleadings 
edward,wl,at conclusions of law citations omitted.
based on these conclusions,the district court entered its final judgment in favor of wyatt on august.edwards filed a timely notice of appeal.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction of this diversity action under.we have jurisdiction over this appeal from the district court final judgment pursuant to.
edwards raises a number of challenges to the district court decision.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,but have plenary review of the district court conclusions of law.see lanning southeastern pennsylvania transp.authority,cir.
the linchpin of the district court ruling in favor of wyatt is that edwards,by braga transmittal of the july,letter,repudiated the handshake agreement.edwards denies that the july letter constituted an anticipatory repudiation that discharged wyatt obligations to perform under the handshake agreement.
prior to challenging the district court holding that the letter was a repudiation on the merits,however,edwards argued that,procedurally,wyatt defense of repudiation was not properly before the district court.edwards took the position that,contrary to the district court holding,under pennsylvania law repudiation is an affirmative defense that must be pled in a defendant answer.because wyatt did not plead repudiation as a defense,edwards argues that he was denied an opportunity to undertake trial preparation with this defense in mind.edwards claims that the district court should have held that wyatt had waived his defense of repudiation by failing to plead it.
while edwards and wyatt argued and briefed the issues of affirmative defense and waiver,our disposition of this appeal,in which we reverse and remand on the merits on other grounds,makes it unnecessary for us to decide these uncertain issues of pennsylvania law we therefore decline to predict how pennsylvania courts would resolve these issues.
the district court drew the legal conclusion that the july letter was a repudiation of the handshake agreement.see edward,wl,at conclusion of law.edwards argues that the district court erred in holding that the letter constituted a repudiation,and that we should reverse the district court judgment.
t o constitute anticipatory breach under pennsylvania law there must be an absolute and unequivocal refusal to perform or a distinct and positive statement of an inability to do so.pennsylvania federation of jewish agencies,quoting mcclelland new amsterdam casualty,emphasis added.as the pennsylvania supreme court has said,though t he rationale behind the rule of anticipatory repudiation is the prevention of economic waste,we reject any argument suggesting a dilution of our long recognized standard of an absolute and unequivocal refusal to perform.id.at 
the district court assessment of the july letter,and its rationale in holding that edwards had repudiated his agreement with wyatt,does not meet the standard set by pennsylvania of an absolute and unequivocal refusal to perform.the district court found only that wyatt understood the july,letter to mean that the handshake agreement was terminated,edward,wl,at finding of fact and that braga letter made clear edwards intent to terminate the handshake agreement before the time to perform had arrived.braga threatened to negotiate with phillips if wyatt did not reply to the letter.id.at conclusion of law.
however,neither of these determinations suffice to support a conclusion that braga july letter should be viewed objectively as an absolute,unequivocal refusal to perform.hence,the district court holding that edwards had repudiated the handshake agreement can not be sustained.
moreover,even if the district court had found that the july letter represented an absolute,unequivocal refusal to perform,on this record such a finding alone would still be insufficient to support the district court conclusion that there was a repudiation.
the record reveals that the events that followed the july letter are highly significant and material in determining whether there was an anticipatory repudiation by edwards.even if the district court had considered these events which bore on the issue of repudiation or reconstitution of an agreement we can not determine whether it did so.we are clear,however,that the district court failed to make any findings of fact which specifically relate to these events occurring between the july letter and the october bankruptcy hearing most significantly,the district court opinion makes no mention of ochroch telephone call to braga following the july letter and the subsequent meeting in philadelphia during the second week of august among ochroch,braga,wyatt,and others the coffee shop encounter between edwards and wyatt in august or the washington meeting in september between edwards and wyatt and their counsel 
the district court failure to consider this evidence and to make the requisite findings concerning these events renders the district court legal conclusion of repudiation erroneous.
first,though m ere expression of doubt as to willingness or ability to perform is not enough to constitute a repudiation,restatement cmt.b,the recipient of a statement may seek adequate assurances that the other party will perform.id.the telephone call by ochroch following the july letter and the subsequent august meeting bear heavily on attempts to secure adequate assurances,and the record may well be read to reflect that such assurances were given.but the district court opinion does not refer to these events,and therefore we must conclude that the district court did not consider this issue.
second,even if the july letter constituted an effective repudiation which we seriously doubt in light of the lack of findings to the effect that it was absolute and unequivocal the events that occurred after braga faxed the july letter may well have been deemed,if considered,a nullification of the repudiation.as the restatement explains,a repudiation may be nullified by a retraction if the injured party is made aware of the retraction before he has prejudicially changed his position 
the effect of a statement as constituting a repudiation under or the basis for a repudiation under is nullified by a retraction of the statement if notification of the retraction comes to the attention of the injured party before he materially changes his position in reliance on the repudiation or indicates to the other party that he considers the repudiation to be final.
the effect of events other than a statement as constituting a repudiation under or the basis for a repudiation under is nullified if,to the knowledge of the injured party,those events have ceased to exist before he materially changes his position in reliance on the repudiation or indicates to the other party that he considers the repudiation to be final.
restatement emphasis added.
the record is replete with evidence of events that,if considered by the district court,could lead to a holding that any repudiation was nullified.see also restatement cmt.b it is not necessary for the repudiator to use words in order to retract his statement.conduct,such as an offer of performance,may be adequate to convey the idea of retraction to the injured party.in particular,the august meeting in philadelphia wyatt statement at the coffee shop meeting that everything is back on track and that nothing had changed in his mind,ja edwards testimony not disputed by wyatt and the september meeting in washington at which wyatt stated that edwards would be included in a settlement involving the franchisees,see ja wyatt testimony,is significant and material evidence that wyatt recognized that the repudiation if any had been nullified
