on june,florida residents matthew and lamae creamer rented a from hertz corporation hertz in florida they planned to travel from panama city,florida to spearman,texas for a family reunion.they apparently told the hertz agent that they planned to make the trip without stopping for the night by alternating drivers.the creamers signed a rental agreement that stated this agreement is solely for the purpose of creating a bailment that allows you to use the car as permitted by this agreement.under the agreement,the creamers could drive the minivan anywhere in the united states and canada,but they were obligated to return it to florida.the agreement referenced florida financial responsibility and no fault personal injury laws but did not contain a provision.
the creamers began driving at around noon on june.matthew creamer creamer drove approximately eight hours from panama city to new orleans,louisiana,at which time creamer began to drive.she drove through the night into texas while creamer slept in the car.he awoke near daybreak to discover that the car was pulled over to the side of the road and that creamer was asleep.he then resumed driving and set the cruise control to miles per hour,the highway speed limit.creamer fell asleep at the wheel and awoke as he hit bobby ray cates cates parked car.tragically,cates was standing in front of the front passenger door and the impact of the collision projected him several feet into the roadway.
as a result of the severe head injuries he sustained,cates is unable to work and is almost completely incapacitated.cates medical expenses exceed.he resides at a care facility.priscilla cates cates is his legal guardian.
cates filed a diversity suit in the northern district of texas against creamer for negligent operation of a motor vehicle under texas law,seeking compensation for medical expenses and lost wages.she also sued hertz under florida dangerous instrumentality doctrine,which imposes vicarious liability on the of a vehicle who entrusts it to a lessee who operates it negligently,causing damages.hertz moved for summary judgment,contending that texas law,not florida law,controls the vicarious liability issue.texas does not recognize the dangerous instrumentality doctrine instead,it has adopted the doctrine of negligent entrustment,which provides that for cates to make hertz vicariously liable she must show entrustment of a vehicle by the owner to an unlicensed,incompetent,or reckless driver that the owner knew or should have known to be unlicensed,that the driver was negligent on the occasion in question and that the driver negligence proximately caused the accident.schneider esperanza transmission.the district court granted hertz motion and dismissed cates suit against hertz after finding that cates could not make a prima facie case of negligent entrustment against hertz under texas law.it subsequently denied cates motion to reconsider its summary judgment order.
the first trial,with creamer as the sole defendant,began on july.creamer denied that he was liable and argued that cates was contributorily negligent.the jury returned a verdict in which it found that creamer was not negligent.the district court,however,granted cates motion for new trial.the second jury returned a verdict in favor of cates,finding that creamer was negligent and cates was negligent.the jury assessed actual damages of.the district court entered judgment of plus prejudgment interest of.
this appeal and cross appeal present two issues.first,cates appeals the summary judgment dismissing hertz,contending that florida law,not texas law,controls the issue of vicarious liability.creamer the grant of cates motion for new trial.he urges that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion for new trial because the first verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence.creamer requests that we reinstate the first verdict.we will address this issue first.
we review a district court grant of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion.gov t fin.servs.one.partnership peyton place,cir.where a motion for a new trial is granted,we scrutinize that decision more closely.scott monsanto,cir noting that when a motion for new trial is granted the broad discretion allowed to the trial court is tempered by the deference due to a jury.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.texas,star indem,cir.finally,we review a district court conflict of laws determination de novo.spence glock,cir.
a district court can grant a motion for new trial if the first trial was unfair or if the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence.monsanto,at.several factors guide us in the review of a district court order granting a new trial we consider the simplicity of the issues,pernicious occurrences at trial,and the extent to which the evidence is in dispute.id.quoting smith transworld drilling,cir.if we determine that one or more of the above factors supports the district judge,we generally affirm the grant of a new trial.shows jamison bedding,cir.however,even if we find that all three of these factors weigh against the grant of a new trial,we may still apply an overriding consideration and affirm the district court order of a new trial by determining independently that the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence.id.
we will assume that each of the three factors tilts against the grant of a new trial here.the question thus becomes whether the fourth consideration,standing alone,supports the grant of a new trial.see shows,at.we have frequently affirmed district court grants of motions for new trials on evidentiary grounds alone.see,shows united states horton,cir bazile bisso marine,cir massey gulf oil,cir weyerhaeuser bucon construction,cir.
creamer argues that he presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find in his favor.he maintains that falling asleep at the wheel creates only a rebuttable inference of negligence.creamer further argues that he successfully rebutted that inference by submitting evidence that cates was drunk at the time of the accident,that cates did not turn on his hazard lights after pulling over,that cates car may not have been entirely off the road that creamer had no reason to anticipate that he would fall asleep at the wheel because he was when he began driving that morning,and that creamer had nodded off only momentarily.
cates counters that creamer did not present any evidence that justified or excused his falling asleep at the wheel and thus did not rebut the inference of negligence.she further argues that any evidence tending to show cates negligence goes only to comparative negligence and does not relieve creamer of responsibility.she also contends that creamer contention that cates car was in the roadway is meritless because it is controverted by the police officer report,which found that cates car was legally parked on the shoulder.finally,cates argues that the danger of a crash is foreseeable when the driver falls asleep while traveling miles per hour.these facts,cates argues,foreclose any doubt as to the foreseeability of the accident.
we agree with cates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the first jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence.this conclusion is clearly supportable when evaluated under texas law.texas case law acknowledges that i t is hardly possible to yield to sleep without having premonitory symptoms of its approach.mcmillian sims,writ dism.agr.when a driver ignores these warnings and falls asleep while driving,as creamer concedes,an inference of negligence arises.id.citing potz williams.creamer can not point to any evidence that he did not experience these premonitory symptoms of sleep.creamer evidence that he was before driving shows only that he exercised due care before he became sleepy it shows neither that he had no warning signs of sleepiness nor that he was excused or justified in ignoring such signs.moreover,the evidence relating to cates fault does not go to exonerate goes to establish comparative fault for the injury.because we find that creamer did not rebut the inference of negligence arising from his nodding off at the wheel,we affirm the district court holding that the first jury creamer of all against the great weight of the evidence.
we now turn to consider whether the district court erred in applying texas law instead of florida law,which had the effect of relieving hertz of all liability 
we review de novo a district court choice of law determination.in re air disaster at ramstein air base,germany,cir.
cates argues that the district court erred in its conflict of laws analysis,specifically,by failing to follow the narrow approach set forth in the second restatement on conflicts of laws,which texas has adopted.see duncan cessna aircraft.she contends that the court should have focused on the facts and circumstances surrounding the issue of vicarious on the issue of general negligence.in support of her argument she cites of the second restatement on conflict of laws,which provides that 
t he local law of the state which has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties with respect to the issue of vicarious liability should be applied in determining whether one person is liable for the tort of another person 
hertz argues that should not be applied to this case because it contains a specifically relevant limitation in determining which state law should apply to an issue of vicarious liability,the forum will be influenced by rules of vicarious liability prevailing in other states.restatement second conflict of laws cmt.b.hertz asserts that state laws have overwhelmingly rejected vicarious liability arising from the dangerous instrumentality doctrine.thus,hertz concludes,the prevailing view of the majority of the states should persuade the forum court not to apply vicarious liability under florida law.
hertz argument that we should disregard the florida rule on vicarious liability because only three states have adopted the dangerous instrumentality doctrine ignores the broader and more relevant consideration.although requires us to be influenced by the rules of vicarious liability prevailing in other states,it also directs that a relationship which forms the basis for the imposition of vicarious liability in a substantial number of states will likely be adequate for such an imposition,even if it would not result in such liability under the forum local law.restatement second conflict of laws cmt.b.the relevant inquiry,thus,is not how many states have adopted the precise rule that prevails in florida,but how many states recognize vicarious liability in comparable relationships between bailor and bailee.we note that at least nineteen states,including the district of columbia,arguably impose vicarious liability on automobile lessors in some circumstances,often under the principles of agency at least eight of those jurisdictions would likely impose vicarious liability on automobile lessors in the same manner that florida does we think that this establishes an adequate basis for a texas court to impose florida law of vicarious liability despite the fact that texas itself does not recognize vicarious liability under these circumstances.accordingly,we reject hertz argument that the imposition of vicarious liability on these facts is so aberrant that we should disregard a analysis.
section directs forum courts to apply t he local law of the state which has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties with respect to the issue of vicarious liability in deciding whether one person is liable for the tort of another.restatement second conflict of laws cmt.a.the district court mistakenly focused solely on the factors generally relevant to tort cases without following the directive of and to apply the conflicts analysis with respect to the individual issues that may arise in a given tort case.here,the specific issue is whether florida or texas law should apply to the question of hertz vicarious liability for creamer negligence.
our finding that the district court erred in its analysis by not focusing on,however,does not determine the ultimate question in this case whether the court erroneously held that texas,not florida,law should apply on the question of vicarious liability.we must now conduct an analysis of that ultimate question.
as we have already noted,texas has adopted the restatement second on conflict of laws and the most significant relationship test outlined in and of the restatement.see duncan,at.section directs that the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the particular issue in tort should govern that issue.restatement second conflict of laws.section requires us to consider the relative interests of the respective states in having their laws applied to this case.
comment a of states that deal with particular issues in tort with greater precision as compared to,which is cast in terms of great generality.this comment concludes that the best way to bring precision into the field is by attempting to state special rules for particular torts and for particular issues in tort.id 
we therefore turn once again to,which directs us to consider 
whether the relationship between the defendant and the other person makes the imposition of vicarious liability reasonable and whether there is a reasonable relationship between the defendant and the state whose local law is to be applied.
cmt.a.as to the first inquiry,the rental agreement created a bailment relationship between creamer and hertz in florida.comment b of states that a bailment relationship establishes an adequate relationship for the imposition of vicarious liability.as to the second inquiry,there is clearly a reasonable relationship between hertz and florida law hertz does business in florida,and the rental contract that provides the potential basis for the imposition of vicarious liability refers to florida law.furthermore,the rental agreement required the creamers to return the car to hertz in florida.on this basis,we are persuaded that the relationship between hertz and creamer establishes an adequate basis for the imposition of vicarious liability against hertz and that hertz had a reasonable relationship with the state of florida.we thus find that weighs in favor of applying florida law to the vicarious liability issue.
continuing our analysis of the relevant restatement provisions,next requires us to apply the rule of.we thus turn to,which provides a list of contacts that should be considered in determining what state law applies to a specific issue in a tort case.these contacts include 
a the place where the injury occurred,
b the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,
c the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,and 
d the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.
hertz emphasizes that both the injury and the conduct causing the injury in this case occurred in texas.these factors,however,are meant to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.we also evaluate these contacts qualitatively instead of quantitatively.spence glock,cir.
that both the injury and the conduct causing the injury occurred in texas would weigh heavily in favor of applying texas law to the issue of creamer negligence that caused an injury to a texas citizen on a texas road.but those contacts are less important in determining which state law should apply to the issue of hertz vicarious liability for those injuries caused by its lessee.more relevant to hertz vicarious liability is the place where the relationship of the parties is centered.see d.the most relevant relationship is that which arises from the lease of the automobile.although cates may have a real interest in the lease,cates,a texas resident,essentially has no relationship with the lease.texas has no relationship with the lease,and hertz has no relationship with texas concerning this lease.creamer has no relationship with the state of texas arising from the lease.creamer,however,is a florida resident and is a party to the lease.hertz is the other party to the lease and does its relevant business in florida.florida is the situs where the lease was executed.in short,florida,not texas,has the most significant relationship to the issue of hertz vicarious liability.
now that we have identified the most significant contacts,directs that these contacts are to be considered under the principles provided in.section requires us to engage in an analysis of the relative interests of the respective states.specifically,we should assess 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems,
b the relevant policies of the forum,
c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,
d the protection of justified expectations,
e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,
f certainty,predictability,and uniformity of result,and 
g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.
we note that the interests we consider are those that are specifically relevant to the issue of vicarious liability.our analysis of these factors leads us to conclude that texas has only a minimal interest in having its law apply to the vicarious liability issue.texas interest in avoiding judgments against defendant bailors is not implicated here because hertz is not a texas corporation and did not conduct the business relating to this rental agreement in texas.furthermore,although texas has the greater interest in seeing cates compensated for her husband injuries and in avoiding the burden of providing medical care for cates,it is florida law,not texas law,which offers greater protection of those interests.
florida interests in having its law applied to the vicarious liability issue in this case,however,are also minimal.florida dangerous instrumentality doctrine protects plaintiffs from impecunious drivers by imposing liability on the owners of the vehicles,but here,the plaintiff is not a florida resident.further,although florida may have an interest in regulating the conduct of vehicle bailors to reduce the incidence of accidents,we are not persuaded that that interest extends beyond florida borders.
thus,because the interests of neither state clearly predominate over those of the other,the interest analysis of provides little impact on our decision.we are,however,persuaded by our reading of the most significant relationship test of and that florida clearly has the greater connection to the facts and circumstances as they relate to the vicarious liability issue we therefore conclude that the district court erred in applying texas law to the issue of hertz vicarious liability.because the district court did not conduct a vicarious liability inquiry under florida law,we remand this case to it for determination,under florida law,of hertz vicarious liability for cates judgment against creamer.on remand,the district court should focus particularly on whether the florida law of vicarious liability may be applied to benefit residents in a situation such as the case at hand.it seems that the district court will have to make an erie guess to resolve this question,as no florida precedent exists to resolve the question.
in sum,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting cates motion for new trial because creamer did not present evidence rebutting the inference of negligence that arose from his falling asleep at the wheel.the first jury verdict denying relief to cates was,therefore,against the great weight of the evidence.we further hold that the district court erred in failing to analyze the conflict of laws question in the specific context of the vicarious liability issue and in failing to apply of the restatement.our own analysis of that section leads us to conclude that florida,not texas,law should apply to the vicarious liability issue because the bailment relationship,which is the basis for vicarious liability here,is centered in florida and because specifically states that a bailment relationship is an adequate basis for the imposition of vicarious liability.accordingly,we affirm cates judgment against creamer,vacate the judgment for hertz,and remand to the district court for determination of hertz vicarious liability under florida law for the judgment entered against creamer.
affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded.
insofar as the majority opinion upholds the district court grant of a new trial to cates and,consequently,the verdict of the second trial,i concur.however,i respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority opinion that holds that florida law applies to the issue of vicarious liability.
this case is undisputedly based on diversity jurisdiction,and our responsibility in diversity cases is to determine what the substantive law of the forum state is,not what we think it should be.see am.ins.ryan,cir boardman united servs.auto.ass n,cir.moreover,once we have determined what the law is,our duty is to apply it,not to define its contours.boardman,at.i dissent from the majority opinion because the majority uses the wrong approach in determining what texas conflicts law is and in doing so,reaches the wrong result.
the majority cites a texas supreme court case,duncan cessna aircraft,for the proposition that texas follows the restatement second of conflict of laws to determine choice of law in tort cases and appears to conclude that texas would adopt section of the restatement in the vicarious liability context.the majority then provides a quite voluminous analysis of how section applies to the facts of this case.but the texas supreme court has never applied the test in a vicarious liability case.consequently,it is unclear whether texas highest court would adopt section as controlling law in the vicarious liability context and how that same court would interpret that section even if it did.moreover,where a state highest court has not yet spoken on an issue,we have stated that we will look to the state appellate courts for guidance unless we are convinced that the highest court of the state would not adopt the appellate courts reasoning.primrose operating am.ins,cir.the best evidence of what the texas supreme court would do in this case can be found in bartley budget,which i describe below in my discussion of how this case should have been decided remarkably,the majority makes no mention at all of bartley and fails to indicate why it believes the supreme court of texas would not follow the reasoning set out there.and even if the majority has good reason not to follow bartley,it fails to consider the next best solution in a choice of law case in which guidance from the state supreme court is lacking certification.
i have spoken out on the importance of certification several times in the past,see,tanks lockheed martin,cir demoss,specially concurring compass bank king,griffin adamson
