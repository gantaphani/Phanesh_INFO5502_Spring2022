the question we must decide in this case is how broad a meaning we should attribute to the phrase using with your permission the covered auto in an automobile liability policy.the district court concluded that a person to whom general custody of a vehicle was given was not an omnibus insured and therefore not covered when he negligently entrusted the vehicle to another person whose negligent operation caused injury.we disagree and reverse and remand.
in,rnc,a corporation providing construction services to the communications industry,contracted to perform work for phonoscope,a cable television company phonoscope.the work consisted of hanging fiberoptic cable television wire on utility poles in the houston area the phonoscope job.rnc in turn hired blythe,a contract laborer.rnc authorized blythe to recruit and supervise a four man crew to work on the phonoscope job.rnc provided a truck to be used in performing the work.the truck was equipped with a bucket,that could be raised and lowered,and was large enough to hold one man.rnc informed blythe that its insurers would not permit him to operate the rnc truck because of his driving record.it was understood that one of the men in blythe crew would actually operate the vehicle.
rnc provided phonoscope with evidence of a commercial automobile liability insurance policy issued to rnc by progressive county mutual insurance the progressive policy.the progressive policy covered bodily injury and property damages in the amount of per accident.rnc was the named insured.in addition,the progressive policy extended coverage in an omnibus clause to a nyone else while using with rnc permission a covered auto.the policy specifies that it covers all bodily injury and property damage caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.rnc also obtained an excess insurance policy for the truck from associated.the associated policy covered up to per occurrence.coverage under the associated policy was triggered only when coverage under the progressive policy had been exhausted.the associated policy,as a following form policy,adopted the coverage provisions and definitions of the underlying progressive policy.
on april,blythe crew was hanging cable television wire using rnc truck.blythe gave one of the crew members,george eason eason,the keys to drive the truck.at the time of the accident,eason was driving the truck and wood,another member of blythe crew,was in the raised bucket.blythe was not present at the job site.at wood request,eason moved the truck to allow wood to get closer to a utility pole.unfortunately,the bucket of the truck hit power lines,causing a fire which severely burned wood on over of his body.
wood brought suit in state court against phonoscope,rnc,blythe and eason.rnc obtained summary judgment in its favor.eason was defended by associated and progressive.blythe was not offered counsel by either progressive or associated and represented himself pro se.under standard texas legal instructions pertaining to negligence claims,the jury found blythe negligent,eason negligent and wood negligent.the jury awarded wood total damages of,exclusive of interest and costs,and awarded to wood minor son,slade zacharia wood,for loss of parental consortium.
approximately two months after the jury rendered its verdict in the wood suit,blythe claimed coverage under the progressive policy and the associated policy.associated reacted to this demand by filing suit against blythe and wood for declaratory judgment in federal court.associated sought a declaration that blythe is not covered under the associated policy and that wood is not entitled to any payment under the associated policy for blythe liability.blythe counterclaimed,seeking declaratory judgment that he is covered under the associated policy and alleging other various contract and tort claims.both parties moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether blythe is covered by the associated policy.
the district court granted associated motion for summary judgment.it concluded that blythe was not an insured under the omnibus clause of the policy because he was not present at the work site when the accident occurred and therefore was not using the vehicle.it rejected blythe theory that the negligent entrustment claim against him establishes his use of the truck when it injured wood.accordingly,the court held that associated had no duty to defend or indemnify blythe for the liability incurred as a result of the wood suit.because the district court held that associated had no duty to defend blythe,it concluded that blythe claims,for injuries arising out of associated failure to tender a defense in the wood suit,must also fail.accordingly,it dismissed blythe counter claim and entered final judgment.blythe and wood appeal.
this case is on appeal from the district court decision on motions for summary judgment and subsequent dismissal of blythe counterclaims.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo also,the only issue decided by the district court involved construction of associated policy,a question of law,which we also review de novo 
the question we must decide is whether,under the facts of this case,blythe was using the covered vehicle and therefore qualifies as an omnibus insured so as to be entitled to defense and indemnity under the terms of the omnibus clause of associated policy.the facts are undisputed and both parties agree that blythe can only be covered under the associated policy as a permissive user under the omnibus clause,which provides coverage to a nyone else while using with rnc permission a covered auto.
the parties have cited no decision of the texas supreme court that resolves this question.accordingly,in deciding this case,this court sitting in diversity must apply texas law,using its best judgment as to what the texas supreme court would do if presented with the same case when making an in the absence of explicit guidance from the state courts,we must attempt to predict state law,not to create or modify it.in the absence of texas supreme court guidance,this court defers to the holdings of lower texas appellate courts although no texas case clearly answers this question,no texas case precludes recovery by blythe and many include language that supports his position.based on our review of decisions by texas courts and courts in other jurisdictions,we conclude that the texas supreme court would follow the weight of jurisprudence which would extend coverage under the omnibus clause to blythe as a user of rnc vehicle.
we begin our review of texas law with the understanding that the texas supreme court has defined use in this context broadly.the court in leleaux.school dist.made clear that use is broader than operation and includes putting or bringing a thing into action or service and employing a thing for or applying a thing to a given purpose in contrast operation is defined as a doing or performing of a practical work.
blythe central argument is that,although he was not permitted to drive the truck,rnc entrusted him with the vehicle to use it to accomplish the phonoscope job.when blythe entrusted the operation of the truck to eason,he was putting the truck into service to perform the task assigned to him by rnc,the vehicle owner and named insured.he argues that his entrustment of the vehicle to eason constitutes use of the vehicle.given rnc instructions prohibiting him from operating the vehicle,blythe argues that rnc necessarily understood that he would be required to entrust its operation to members of his crew to do the work.at the time of the accident,the vehicle was being operated to perform rnc work and its use was within the scope of rnc permission which should constitute use by him.
the texas supreme court case of snyder allstate ins.lends some support to blythe argument snyder addressed,among other issues,coverage of a person driving an insured vehicle with the permission of the first permittee of the named insured under an allstate vehicle policy.the allstate policy listed rhodes as the named insured.rhodes purchased the insured vehicle for the use of his daughter darla.at the t
