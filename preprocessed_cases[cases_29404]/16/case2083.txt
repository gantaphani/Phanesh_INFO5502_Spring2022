on may,caradon filed a lawsuit against in the district court for the northern district of georgia,claiming contributory patent infringement and breach of contract among other claims and seeking contribution and indemnity arising from the settlement of therma tru claims.caradon confined its prayer for relief to postpetition damages,which is to say damages stemming from sales between caradon and after petitioned for bankruptcy relief in.on june,moved for a stay of caradon action in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of ohio,claiming that the reorganization plan and confirmation order discharged the claim.

in a bankruptcy case on appeal from a district court,we owe no special deference to the district court decision and review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and uphold its factual findings unless clearly erroneous.crowell united states,cir.there is some debate between the parties about the application of this dichotomy to a bankruptcy court interpretation of a reorganization plan over which it presided and about what terex metropolitan life insurance in re terex,cir,requires in this context.because the appropriate standard of review does not affect our analysis of this appeal,we will assume without deciding that we must give the bankruptcy court interpretation of the confirmed reorganization plan the same full deference we gave it in terex.
the parties appear to share considerable common ground in their framing of this dispute.first,under the bankruptcy code,all claims against the debtor are discharged upon the confirmation of a chapter reorganization plan except as otherwise indicated in the plan of reorganization.see d a except as otherwise provided in the plan the confirmation of a plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation cpt holdings indus.allied employees union pension plan,local,cir holstein brill,cir.
second,the bankruptcy code defines administrative expenses incurred during the pendency of the bankruptcy and payable by the debtor as the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.b.in reading brown,d,the supreme court held that a postpetition tort claim against a debtor constituted an actual and necessary cost of the administration of the estate under.since then,and in reliance on reading,this circuit like many others has used a test to determine whether a claim is an administrative expense under a debt qualifies as an actual,necessary administrative expense only if it arose from a transaction with the bankruptcy estate and directly and substantially benefitted the estate.pension benefit guar.sunarhauserman,in re sunarhauserman,cir see,in re jartran,cir.
