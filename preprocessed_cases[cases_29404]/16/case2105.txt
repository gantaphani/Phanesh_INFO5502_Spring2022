the issue to be decided in the present case is whether the doctrine provides federal jurisdiction over a state law claim on the basis that an embedded element of the claim concerns n,an accounting rule in the federal tax code.we hold that it does not.
plaintiffs jerome and elzetta mikulski filed a class action suit against centerior energy corporation centerior in the cuyahoga county ohio court of common pleas,alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract.for ease of introduction,we can ignore certain details until later in the analysis and set out the underpinnings of this case without all their rough edges.simply put,centerior interpreted n to mean that,beginning with its fiscal year,it could no longer deduct certain interest expenses from its calculation of taxable earnings.therefore,centerior did not deduct these expenses from its earnings,which made centerior appear more profitable but also increased centerior tax liability.because centerior declared and distributed dividends based on these reported earnings,the increased tax liability was passed on to its shareholders via irs forms.
the plaintiffs contend that centerior interpretation of n,in regard to this particular interest expense,was not only incorrect,but was fraudulent.the plaintiffs accuse centerior of intentionally overstating its earnings and profits during the time periods in question,in order to make itself appear more profitable.in what turned out to be a critical response to an interrogatory,the plaintiffs explained their theory in terms of 
section n states that no construction expenses incurred before january,may be considered in calculating a corporation earnings and profits.
centerior included in its earnings and profits calculations for and subsequent years more than billion of construction expenses that its subsidiaries had incurred in and earlier.
therefore,centerior violated the internal revenue code by doing what section n of the code specifically forbids.
pls.supp.resp.to interrog.of defs.second set of interrogs rearranged from original.to be clear,these construction expenses are actually interest expenses on construction loans that span the years in question,which are labeled construction period carrying charges in n.section n actually states in the case of any amount paid or incurred for construction period carrying charges no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such amount,and there is no date provision in the codified statute.the essential point of this interrogatory response,however,is that it invoked federal law,namely n,as the basis for the plaintiffs state law claim.thus,the plaintiffs contend,based on this interpretation of n,that centerior by overstating its earnings and profits misrepresented to its shareholders via irs forms that their dividends were taxable,which caused those now shareholders to erroneously overpay their federal and state income taxes.
centerior disputed the plaintiffs interpretation of n,particularly its effective date provision,which led to the question of whether n applied only to interest expenses actually incurred after january,as the plaintiffs argued,or if it instead applied to accumulated interest expenses that related to construction projects that remained ongoing after january,as centerior had assumed.the plaintiffs concede that their claim will fail under the latter construction if centerior complied with the accounting requirements in the statute,then it would not be culpable for overstating its taxable earnings and profits or misreporting taxable dividends.
centerior removed the case to federal court by asserting,based on the plaintiffs response to the interrogatory,that the complaint raised a substantial federal question,the resolution of which was essential to the disposition of the plaintiffs claims.the plaintiffs moved for a remand to state court,and the district court denied the motion,finding that the plaintiffs cause of action,although presented as breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation,was actually aimed at a tax refund and raised a substantial federal question involving federal tax law.
centerior next filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the action was expressly preempted by,and implicitly preempted by the scope and complexity of the internal revenue code.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge who recommended judgment on the pleadings and documented three findings.first,the plaintiffs could have raised the issue with the irs,filed for a refund,or pursued administrative remedies,but they did not.second,if the court allowed the lawsuit to proceed,then it could be opening the federal courts to litigation by every shareholder for misstatement of earnings and profits,by every employee for overstatement of earnings on forms,and by every independent contractor for an overstated form.third,the internal revenue code was designed to avoid these types of actions and instead allows injured taxpayers to proceed directly against the government for a refund.
the plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,arguing that its principal error was in mischaracterizing their claim as one for a tax refund,which led to the erroneous conclusion that the claims were preempted by federal tax law.at a hearing before the district court,the plaintiffs refuted preemption and once again disputed removal jurisdiction.the plaintiffs emphasized that their suit was based on state law claims for breach of contract and fraud,not the alleged violation of the internal revenue code.the district court rejected the plaintiffs arguments,adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of centerior.the district court concluded that the complaint relied on the interpretation of the internal revenue code,and therefore jurisdiction was proper based on either preemption or a substantial question of federal law.the district court granted judgment on the pleadings based on the plaintiffs failure to exhaust their remedies with the irs.
the plaintiffs appealed to this court on the issue of federal jurisdiction.mikulski centerior,cir rehearing en banc granted,opinion vacated.the majority reversed,finding that the district court had misapplied both the preemption and the doctrines,and consequently lacked jurisdiction.the entire panel agreed that the district court had erred in finding the plaintiffs claims preempted by.the majority further held that the mere presence of a federal statute as an element of a claim does not present a substantial federal question.the dissent relied on grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,d,to argue that the federal government has a substantial interest in the construction of n because it affects the amount of federal tax a security holder must pay.
centerior petitioned for rehearing en banc,asking whether federal question jurisdiction exists over state law claims when plaintiffs recovery depends upon a contested interpretation of federal tax law this court granted the rehearing and vacated the panel opinion.

this is a case in which ohio citizens sued an ohio corporation in ohio state court,and the defendant corporation removed the case to federal court.let there be no doubt that the plaintiffs would prefer to be in state court.in the absence of diversity,a defendant may remove a civil action from state court to federal court only if the plaintiff allegations establish original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under federal law.b.to determine whether the claim arises under federal law,we examine the well pleaded allegations of the complaint and ignore potential defenses.beneficial bank anderson,d.even a defense that relies on the preclusive effect of a prior federal judgment or the effect of a federal statute will not provide a basis for removal.id.citations omitted.

we are mindful that state courts are generally presumed competent to interpret and apply federal law.see zwickler koota,d during most of the nation first century,congress relied on the state courts to vindicate essential rights arising under the constitution and federal laws.as the seventh circuit recently noted,there is nothing unusual about a court having to decide issues that arise under the law of other jurisdictions otherwise there would be no field called conflict of laws and no rule barring removal of a case from state to federal court on the basis of a federal defense.hays cave,cir.the supreme court has explained this rule against removal on the basis of a federal defense 
although such allegations show that very likely,in the course of the litigation,a question under the constitution would arise,they do not show that the suit,that is,the plaintiff original cause of action,arises under the constitution.for better or worse,under the present statutory scheme as it has existed since,a defendant may not remove a case to federal court unless the plaintiff complaint establishes that the case arises under federal law.

resolution of this appeal will require an inquiry into the federal interest in having the federal issue decided by a federal court,and we acknowledge this otherwise axiomatic state courts are competent to interpret and apply federal order to ensure that we do not misconstrue the nature of the federal interest or become misled by some histrionic fear that allowing state courts to decide federal law issues might lead to some disastrous consequence,such as irreconcilable interpretations of the tax code,a potential race to the bottom,or diminished federal tax revenues.while there is certainly a significant federal interest in avoiding each of these consequences,the simple fact is that these are not the types of consequences to be considered by courts.the legal analysis that guides this decision does not include consideration of the effect of state versus federal adjudication on the outcome of any given case or issue.i t is up to congress,not the federal courts,to decide when the risk of error with respect to a matter of federal law becomes so unbearable as to justify divesting the state courts of authority to decide the federal matter.beneficial bank,at.scalia,dissenting.thus,our inquiry is ultimately one of congressional intent,not policy or personal preference.
under the doctrine,a federal court will have jurisdiction if a plaintiff has carefully drafted the complaint so as to avoid naming a federal statute as the basis for the claim,and the claim is in fact based on a federal statute.franchise tax,at.a defendant raising this doctrine may not rely on facts not alleged in the complaint.caterpillar williams,d.although occasionally a removal court will seek to determine whether the real nature of the claim is federal,regardless of plaintiff characterization,most of them correctly confine this practice to areas of the law by federal substantive law.id.at.quotation marks and edits omitted citing federated dep t stores,at.brennan,dissenting.thus,artful pleading and preemption are closely aligned.
accepting the possibility that the plaintiffs may have carefully structured their complaint to avoid federal jurisdiction,we consider whether the facts alleged in the complaint actually implicate a federal cause of action.the plaintiffs have asserted two state,causes of action breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation the complaint specifies,in pertinent part 
a shareholder stock certificate constitutes a written contract with the issuing corporation.
pursuant to relevant provisions of the internal revenue code,including section c,a corporation paying dividends to its shareholders is obligated to issue an accurate irs form or a substitute form to its shareholders.
thus,by virtue of its written contract with its shareholders,centerior was contractually required accurately to report dividends and returns of capital to every shareholder.to the extent such contractual obligations may not be specifically stated in the written contract,such contractual terms are implied by operation of law.
centerior breached its written contract with the plaintiff class by misreporting to class members the portion of the distributions which constituted taxable dividends and the portion which constituted a return of capital.
furthermore,in order for centerior to fulfill its contractual obligation accurately to report shareholder dividends and returns of capital,centerior had the additional obligation accurately to calculate its earnings and profits and the of its subsidiaries.
centerior also breached its written contract with the plaintiff class when it inaccurately calculated earnings and profits for purposes of determining the portion of distributions which constituted taxable dividends,and thereby understated that portion of the distributions which constituted a return of capital.
centerior misreporting caused the members of the plaintiff class to overpay their respective income taxes for and all other relevant periods.
as a direct and proximate result of such overpayment,the members of the plaintiff class have been damaged in the amount of such overpayment,which damages can be calculated for each class member on a basis.
so,both causes of action rely on the same premise that centerior overstated the amount of taxable dividends it distributed in and three other years,which caused its shareholders to overpay their federal and state income taxes.importantly,the plaintiffs do not state or imply a federal securities exchange act claim,in which investors allege that they were harmed through the purchase or sale of mispriced shares these plaintiffs allege a traditional tort and breach of contract.
in july,congress enacted as part of the taxpayer bill of rights,pub,stat,and created a private cause of action against anyone who willfully files a fraudulent information return,irs form that causes injury to the purported recipient.this appears to provide a federal cause of action under the facts alleged in the complaint,but because all of the events giving rise to the plaintiffs claims preceded the enactment of by almost ten years,would be unavailable to these plaintiffs for these claims.furthermore,neither this section of the statute nor the act itself contains any indication that congress intended it to be the exclusive remedy for a fraudulent overstatement of taxable dividend distributions,so the plaintiffs claims do not necessarily state a federal claim.
congress enacted as part of the deficit reduction act of,pub,stat,and governs certain calculations.according to the plaintiffs complaint,the reason centerior overstated the taxable portion of the distributions,dividends was because it miscalculated its earnings and profits.under the internal revenue code,if a corporation has earnings and profits,then distributions to shareholders are considered taxable dividends up to the amount of the earnings and profits.a.but if distributions exceed earnings and profits,then the distributions are considered returns of capital.see lewis cir,cir luckman cir,cir.while we agree that affects the measure and calculation of a corporation earnings and profits,it is only a guideline or instruction on proper tax accounting practices.it does not include a civil suit provision or implicitly create a private cause of action.similarly,which governs the reporting of dividend payments and the reporting of earning and profit calculations,does not state or imply a private cause of action either.
therefore,we must conclude that the mikulski plaintiffs would not have had a federal,statutory cause of action against centerior on these or similar claims that is,none of these statutes provides a federal cause of action that might have been invoked by a less artfully drafted complaint.we can not conclude under these facts that the plaintiffs carefully drafted their complaint to avoid a federal statute or federal cause of action.see franchise tax,at.
the doctrine applies in circumstances in which congress may intend the preemptive force of a federal statute to be so extraordinary that any claim purportedly based on that state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefore arises under federal law.caterpillar,at.the supreme court has found complete preemption in only three classes of cases section of the labor management relations act of lmra,the employee retirement income security act of erisa,and the national bank act.see beneficial bank,at.complete preemption requires a finding that the federal statutes at issue provided the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action.id.at.to date,the supreme court has not found complete preemption over claims that allege misreporting by corporations to their taxpaying shareholders.
this circuit has recognized that complete preemption is a limited rule.although we held that the national flood insurance act,completely preempts state law because it explicitly confers original exclusive jurisdiction on the federal district courts,gibson am.bankers ins,cir,we have declined to extend complete preemption to various statutes that lack similarly explicit language.see,wellons nw.airlines,cir denying complete preemption under the airline deregulation act musson theatrical,fed.express,cir airline deregulation act strong telectronics pacing,cir medical device amendments to federal food,drug,and cosmetic act gustafson lake angelus,cir federal aviation act.
congress has not created an exclusive federal remedy under the internal revenue code for the miscalculation of earnings and profits or the misreporting of taxable dividends.congress knows how to enact exclusive private rights of action when it chooses to do so,see cent.bank first interstate bank,d,and several provisions in the tax code expressly prescribe an exclusive,private federal remedy.see,j b shall have as an exclusive federal remedy i the exclusive remedy for any person claiming a such civil action shall be the exclusive remedy e a petition shall be the exclusive remedy.in contrast,neither of the provisions relied upon by the mikulski plaintiffs,n or c,contains any express statement of an exclusive federal remedy.even,which creates a private right of action against a company submitting a fraudulent information return,does not purport to be exclusive.
under a,no private action shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected,until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the secretary.this provision was intended to provide taxpayers with a means to obtain relief from improper collections by tax collectors while also protecting government collection officers from being sued by taxpayers.see,reprinted in.we find no indication that congress intended this tax refund procedure to be a security holder exclusive remedy for a company misreporting of dividends.id.although the federal courts have broadened in the airline cases and applied it to airlines that effectively act as agents for the irs by collecting excise taxes from passengers,see,brennan sw.airlines,cir sigmon sw.airlines,cir kaucky sw.airlines,cir,that expansive application does not extend to the present case because centerior did not collect or withhold any taxes.centerior was not acting as a collection agent for or on behalf of the irs.see in re air transp.excise tax,d,limiting the applicability of the airline cases to their unique circumstances.
the mere fact that the plaintiffs damages are calculated in terms of overpaid income taxes does not necessitate the conclusion that the plaintiffs claim must actually be one for a federal income tax refund.marks newcourt credit group,cir the underlying damages do not dictate the nature of a plaintiff claim.this is especially so for the claim of state income plaintiffs alleged overpayment of state income taxes obviously does not assert a federal income tax refund claim.perhaps more to the point,however,is that the plaintiffs are not seeking a tax refund inasmuch as they are not accusing the irs of any wrongdoing.under the plaintiffs theory,the irs was an innocent,who,like the plaintiffs themselves,merely relied on the issued by centerior,while centerior was the active,liable tortfeasor.see anza ideal steel supply,d thomas,concurring noting that courts have historically found proximate causation even for injuries where an innocent third party intervenes between the tortfeasor and the victim,such that the innocent third party is the immediate cause of the injury citation and emphasis omitted.the same reasoning applies to the plaintiffs breach of contract claim.we therefore conclude that does not preempt the present case.
the plaintiffs claims are not completely preempted by federal law and the district court erred by concluding that they were.we find no basis for federal jurisdiction based on the complaint,the doctrine,or complete preemption.
under the doctrine,a state law cause of action may actually arise under federal law,even though congress has not created a private right of action,if the vindication of a right under state law depends on the validity,construction,or effect of federal law.see franchise tax,at.shulthis mcdougal.as an initial proposition,then,the law that creates the cause of action is state law,and original federal jurisdiction is unavailable unless it appears that some substantial,disputed question of federal law is a necessary element of one of the state claims,or that one or the other claim is really one of federal law.franchise tax,at.the mere presence of a federal issue in a state law cause of action does not automatically confer federal question jurisdiction,either originally or on removal.such jurisdiction remains exceptional and federal courts must determine its availability,issue by issue.the supreme court has developed a standard,through an evolving case line,by which the federal interest in providing a forum for an issue is weighed against the risk that the federal courts will be unduly burdened by a rush of state law cases.
in smith kansas city title trust,the supreme court first acknowledged that federal jurisdiction may exist over an ordinary cause of action where the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the constitution or laws of the united states,and that such federal claim is not merely colorable.in smith,a shareholder sued in federal court to prevent a company directors from breaching their duty to the shareholders,as set out by the state laws of incorporation.id.at.holmes,dissenting.specifically,the plaintiff alleged that the federal farm loan act was unconstitutional,and therefore,an investment in bonds issued under that act would result in a defendant breach of duty.id.at.the supreme court,raising the jurisdictional question sua sponte,ultimately determined that federal jurisdiction was proper because of the significant federal interest in determination of the constitutionality of a federal statute.id.at.subsequent cases have narrowed and refined the rule.
in moore chesapeake ohio railway,a railroad employee sued his employer under the kentucky employers liability act,alleging that he was injured by defective equipment.under the state law,a violation of the federal safety appliance acts constituted negligence per se and eliminated the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk.id.at.the supreme court determined that federal jurisdiction was lacking because the federal interest in a state law tort action was not significant.the action fell within the familiar category of cases involving the duty of a master to his servant the federal statute,in the present case touched the duty of the master at a single point,and the right of the plaintiff to recover was left to be determined by the law of the state.id.at.
therefore,in the early cases,the court decided jurisdiction based solely on the magnitude of the federal interest.these two cases in particular highlight a distinction between the significant federal interest in deciding the constitutionality of a federal statute,a potential rebuke of congressional authority,as compared with the minimal federal interest in the shaping of the scope of a state statutory duty,a task likely to recur routinely and repeatedly.the court has since added another dimension the desire to protect the federal courts from the burden of excessive litigation that is better suited to state courts.
in merrell dow pharmaceuticals thompson,d,the plaintiffs sued a drug company on a state law tort claim,alleging that the drug company was presumptively negligent because it had violated the branding provision of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act.in what appeared to be a departure from the approach,the court introduced new factors,explaining that the very reasons for the development of the modern implied remedy doctrine including the increased volume of federal litigation are precisely the kind of considerations that should inform the decision.id.at.quotation marks and citations omitted.under this approach,the court placed significant emphasis on the absence of a federal statutory cause of action the congressional determination that there should be no federal remedy for the violation of this federal statute is tantamount to a congressional conclusion that the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently substantial to confer jurisdiction.id.at.quotation marks omitted.based primarily on the absence of a private,federal cause of action,the court concluded that federal jurisdiction was lacking.id.at.
in grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,at,the plaintiff filed a state law claim to quiet title,alleging that the defendant record title was invalid because the irs,in seizing the plaintiff property to satisfy a federal tax deficiency,had failed to give the plaintiff proper notice pursuant to a.although the complaint did not set forth a federal cause of action,the court recognized that the state law claim presented a question of federal law.but this recognition did not end the inquiry as to whether the action arose under federal law it triggered further considerations.the court observed,the presence of a disputed federal issue and the ostensible importance of a federal forum are never necessarily dispositive there must always be an assessment of any disruptive portent in exercising federal jurisdiction,in the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.id.at.
in grable,the supreme court,for the first time,brought its two concerns together into a single standard,which it described as the framework of examining the importance of having a federal forum for the issue,and the consistency of such a forum with congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts.id.at.the court then recognized that grable particular federal issue implicated the ability of the federal government,the irs to vindicate its own administrative action.id.at.the court also acknowledged that the rarity of this issue would portend only a microscopic effect on the division of labor.id.
because a,the federal tax code provision at issue in grable,did not provide for a private,federal cause of action,the court was compelled to reconcile its decision with its earlier opinion in merrell dow.id.at.to do this,the court introduced the welcome mat metaphor 
merrell dow saw the missing cause of action not as a missing federal door key,always required,but as a missing welcome mat,required in the circumstances,when exercising federal jurisdiction over a state action would have attracted a horde of original filings and removal cases raising other state claims with embedded federal issues.for if the federal labeling standard without a federal cause of action could get a state claim into federal court,so could any other federal standard without a federal cause of action.and that would have meant a tremendous number of cases.
one only needed to consider the treatment of federal violations generally in garden variety state tort law.the violation of federal statutes and regulations is commonly given negligence per se effect in state tort proceedings.a general rule of exercising federal jurisdiction over state claims resting on federal statutory violations would thus have heralded a potentially enormous shift of traditionally state cases into federal courts.expressing concern over the increased volume of federal litigation,and noting the importance of adhering to legislative intent,merrell dow thought it improbable that the congress,having made no provision for a federal cause of action,would have meant to welcome any tort case implicating federal law solely because the violation of the federal statute is said to create a rebuttable presumption of negligence under state law.in this situation,no welcome mat meant keep out.merrell dow analysis thus fits within the framework of examining the importance of having a federal forum for the issue,and the consistency of such a forum with congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts.

in empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d,the plaintiff was a health plan administrator operating pursuant to the federal employees health benefits act who sued to share in the defendant damage award obtained in a state court personal injury suit.the court did not shut the jurisdictional door propped open in grable,but it made clear that grable is to be read narrowly grable emphasized that it takes more than a federal element to open the arising under door.this case can not be squeezed into the slim category grable exemplifies.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also summarized the factors that established the significance of the federal interest in grable the dispute there centered on the action of a federal agency irs and its compatibility with a federal statute,the question qualified as substantial,and its resolution was both dispositive of the case and would be controlling in numerous other cases.id.the court found federal jurisdiction lacking in empire because the tort action was between private parties,the federal issue did not dispose of the case,the bottom line practical issue is the share of the settlement properly payable to empire,and the federal issue was too and for its resolution to affect numerous other cases.id.
the plaintiffs in the present case seek to rely on centerior violation of an accounting provision in the federal tax code to demonstrate that centerior is liable for fraudulent misrepresentation or breach of contract.from this perspective,the present case most closely resembles merrell dow presumption of negligence for violating the branding provision of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act or moore application of negligence per se for violating the terms of the federal safety appliance acts,neither of which supported jurisdiction.but the present case does not raise a question of mere compliance or noncompliance with a federal statute the question concerns the meaning of the statute,specifically,the effective date provision.from this perspective,the present case more closely resembles smith conclusive determination or grable decisive guidance on future application,both of which supported jurisdiction.but,unlike smith,the present case does not challenge the constitutionality of the statute,and unlike grable,it does not affect the manner in which the irs might vindicate its own administrative actions.
we must consider this case in the framework of examining the importance of having a federal forum for the issue,and the consistency of such a forum with congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts.grable,at.the doctrine has three parts the claim must necessarily raise a disputed federal issue the federal interest in the issue must be substantial and the exercise of jurisdiction must not disturb any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.id.at.accord eastman marine mech,cir.
the plaintiffs theory certainly appears to raise a disputed federal issue whether n requires capitalization of only those interest expenses actually incurred after the effective date as the plaintiffs argue,or if it instead requires capitalization of all accumulated interest expenses associated with construction projects that were ongoing as of the effective date as centerior had assumed.the plaintiffs theory is actually a bit complicated,and this shorthand rendition is convenient but incomplete.the plaintiffs produced an expert report that offered a more precise explanation of the theory,although even this is still decidedly murky 
by capitalize,i mean that for purposes of calculating,earnings and profits,the interest expense attributable to a certain construction project would not be deducted from the tabulation of,but instead would be added to the cost of the asset being constructed until completion of the project 
prior to,corporations were not required to capitalize interest on property under construction the interest was deducted from as a current expense.under section of the tax equity and responsibility act of,corporations were required to capitalize,not deduct from the interest on nonresidential real estate construction that began after.
in,congress amended the irc and added section n to prohibit corporations from deducting this interest and other carrying costs from.the provision was effective for amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after september,section e a of.
according to the effective date provisions of section n,interest capitalization was required on centerior construction expenditures.however,centerior capitalized interest on at least billion in construction expenditures made before which was not required by n.as a result,centerior capitalized significantly more interest than required by law and overstated for and by corresponding amounts.
since is the source of payment for taxable dividends to shareholders,a significant ly overstated would very likely cause a corporation to report distributions to shareholders as their taxable incomes,dividends,when in fact the shareholders were returned capital investment.as a consequence,shareholders overstated their taxable income and tax liabilities.
pls.supp.resp.to interrog.of defs.second set of b expert report.
for our purposes,we can abbreviate the plaintiffs claim anew centerior is alleged to have improperly capitalized,included in its statements of taxable earnings some billion in construction expenses interest on the belief that it was required to do so by n,while the plaintiffs argue that n effective date provision excludes any expenses from its capitalization requirement,the tax code prohibited centerior from including these expenses in its statements of taxable earnings.whether due to the parties confusing descriptions of the issue,the inconsistencies in the language used,required and prohibited,or the fact that tax accounting sometimes appears to be a form of alchemy,it is difficult to frame this dispute with particularity.the plaintiffs have certainly staked their claim on this federal issue,however,and the parties have crossed swords over it.arbaugh y h,d.moreover,the plaintiffs concede that their claim will fail under centerior interpretation of the statute.we therefore have little difficulty in concluding that there is a federal issue and it is actually disputed.
the second component is the substantiality of the federal interest.see grable,at.the supreme court has identified four aspects of a case or an issue that affect the substantiality of the federal interest in that case or issue whether the case includes a federal agency,and particularly,whether that agency compliance with the federal statute is in dispute whether the federal question is important,not trivial whether a decision on the federal question will resolve the case,the federal question is not merely incidental to the outcome and whether a decision as to the federal question will control numerous other cases,the issue is not anomalous or isolated.see empire.at analyzing grable,at.while certain of these factors may be more applicable than others in any given set of circumstances,no single factor is dispositive and these factors must be considered collectively,along with any other factors that may be applicable in a given case.in this analysis,we address each factor in turn,and consider them in aggregate.based on our considered judgment of these factors,we ultimately conclude that the federal interest in the present issue is not substantial.
the first factor is both objective and apparent,and in this case it weighs against characterizing the federal interest as substantial because there is no federal agency in this dispute.see empire.at the dispute in grable centered on the action of a federal agency irs and its compatibility with a federal statute.section n imposes a duty on citizens,corporations,not the federal government or a government agency,and this case involves no question of whether a government agency has complied with a statute or regulation.see id.while the federal government may have an interest in the uniform application of regulations that relate to the collection of taxes,it has only a limited interest in private tort or contract litigation over the private duties involved in that collection.see grable,at.the government ability to collect taxes from an individual shareholder or a corporation is not affected by the resolution of the dispute between these two parties.the government is free to interpret and apply the tax code as it sees fit,without the slightest regard for this lawsuit.unlike grable,in which the irs prevailing practice was alleged to violate due process,this case will have no res judicata effect that would apply to the irs,no matter which court,federal or state,decides the case.in fact,the irs even has the authority to vindicate its interest by issuing a formal interpretation of this statute via administrative rule making,if it chooses to do so.see,staff of the comm.on taxation,general explanation of the revenue provisions of the tax reform act of comm.print it is anticipated that regulations will be issued providing for the allocation of expenditures to the construction period and among different properties.
the second factor is far more subjective and requires that we decide whether the question to be resolved is important.see empire.at.to be sure,resolution of this issue will require the analysis and interpretation of federal law,specifically the deficit reduction act of,pub,e,stat,and.but the specific question at issue concerns only the interpretation of the effective date of an accounting provision that instructs companies on how to adjust their earnings and profits calculations to account for certain construction project interest expenses.this question does not implicate any broader or more substantial issue.the question does not necessarily even resolve all aspects of the present case,and it will provide little if any precedent for future cases.in the years since its enactment,the irs has never issued a rule to interpret the provision,far as we are the irs ever litigated an action involving this provision.based on our subjective view of this issue,we find it more likely than not that this particular question is not particularly important to the federal government.
the third factor is objective though the answer is not immediately apparent whether resolution of this question is dispositive of this case.it is not.see empire.at.resolution of this question is dispositive if decided in favor of centerior,but only because the plaintiffs have conceded as much.if the plaintiffs prevail on their construction of n,and show that centerior miscalculated earnings and profits due to its violation of n,then the plaintiffs must still prove the remaining elements of fraudulent misrepresentation such as intent or breach of contract such as the existence of a contract see fns,supra.if,on the other hand,centerior prevails on its construction and shows that it complied with n in calculating its earnings and profits accurately,then the plaintiffs can not prevail unless they demonstrate some other misrepresentation or breach of contract.therefore,conformity with n may,but will not necessarily,conclude the action.
finally,the fourth factor is again subjective and,as touched upon in the discussion of the second factor,we find that a decision on this particular and very narrow question will not be controlling over numerous other cases see empire.at.the disputed provision applies only to construction period carrying charges,a special category of construction costs that includes interest paid or accrued,on indebtedness that is incurred or continued in order to acquire,construct,or carry property.n b i.furthermore,the particular issue concerns the effective date of september,years ago.finally,i f costs must be capitalized under other provisions of the internal revenue code,then section n is not applicable.cir.since,corporations such as centerior have been required to capitalize interest expenses in order to calculate taxable income.thus,the adjustment prescribed by n has been at least partially superseded.
whether the interpretation of n is resolved in state court or federal court,the outcome will be the same companies will report taxable dividends in the manner prescribed by law,as legislated by congress and interpreted by the courts.the irs undoubtedly has an interest in collecting taxes,and it is of no consequence to the irs whether this case,or any like it,is resolved in federal court rather than the state court.the irs ability to collect taxes in accordance with the law is unaffected by the judicial forum.this leads us to our final point on federal interest n does not control the irs collection of the plaintiffs income taxes.while n may affect a shareholder tax obligations,it will only do so under particular circumstances.
throughout this case,this appeal,and this opinion to this point,one aspect of the plaintiff position has generally been accepted that each shareholder suffered the same damages,which can be measured by the alleged overpayment of state and federal income taxes.although the district court certified the shareholders as a plaintiff class and the presumption of identical damages has not been challenged,this presumption is highly suspect,and to the extent that this suspect presumption is relied upon or overlooked in this analysis,the true situation is worth acknowledging.each of the individual shareholders presumably,at least theoretically,falls within a particular differing income tax bracket,holds a unique investment portfolio with different gains,losses,deductions,offsets,writeoffs,tax shields,in any given year,and consequently,pays a different amount of taxes.while the receipt of money,return of capital is almost always better than taxable money,dividends,this simple distinction does not automatically lead to an identical effect on each individual shareholder overall tax obligation,given the complexity of the tax code and the creativity of tax accountants.for instance,corporate investors pay a lower effective tax rate on dividends than do individual investors.pension funds and do not pay taxes on dividends,so for them,the difference is irrelevant for tax purposes.this simple distinction is merely intended to demonstrate that the classification of distributions as taxable dividends,rather than returns on capital,does not directly control the payment or collection of personal income taxes.
in concluding this section,we find that each of the four factors identified by the supreme court draws us towards a determination that the federal interest in the present issue is not substantial.taking all four factors into consideration,and acknowledging two unassailable truths that state courts are fully competent to decide this question,and that n does not control the collection of the plaintiffs personal income taxes conclude that the federal interest in this case is not so substantial that it compels a finding that these traditional state law claims actually arise under federal law not without some statement to that effect by congress.
this is not to say that there is no federal interest or even some significant federal interest there may very well be,and it might not be difficult to find.but such a finding would be immaterial.the pertinent finding,which leads to our present conclusion,is that the federal interest in this case is not substantial as that term has been defined under the prevailing supreme court precedent.see empire.at grable,at.moore,at.smith,at.if a case could be deemed to arise under federal thereby invoke federal time the litigation involves the interpretation of a provision in the federal tax code,then these be meaningless insofar as they attempt to define a federal interest or to guide the inquiry into congressional delegation of responsibility.indeed,the portions of the tax code that expressly provide for a federal remedy would be little more than surplusage.we therefore think it would be imprudent to assume that either congress or the supreme court intended such an expansive or limitless view of federal jurisdiction.
even if there were a significant federal interest,we find that the exercise of jurisdiction over this type of lawsuit would impermissibly disrupt the congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.see grable,at.congress has made no provision for a federal cause of action under n.as the supreme court explained in grable,merrell dow thought it improbable that the congress,having made no provision for a federal cause of action,would have meant to welcome any tort case implicating federal law solely because the violation of the federal statute is said to create a rebuttable presumption of negligence under state law.in this situation,no welcome mat meant keep out.grable,at.while grable went on to explain that the absence of a provision is not determinative,this certainly provides a starting point for this part of the analysis.
under the prescribed standard,we must pursue this question further and inquire into the risk of upsetting the intended balance by opening the federal courts to an undesirable quantity of litigation.see id.at.this is,to be sure,a speculative inquiry,requiring us to speculate about the consequences for the federal caseload that will flow from this decision,and,although this is intended to be a reasoned speculation,we concede that reasonable people no doubt over the likelihood or severity of the possible consequences.
while we ultimately conclude that the possibility of encumbering the federal courts with these cases appears both real and significant,or at least not insignificant,we are at pains to avoid overstating our position.we eschew predictions of any extreme outcome that may lurk in such phrases as flood of litigation or overwhelm the federal courts,and we have not succumbed to some eschatological trembling.rather,we posit an objective and necessarily that,by allowing the present dispute over a relatively obscure provision of the tax code to be pursued in federal court,we would extend federal jurisdiction not only to the question raised in this case,but to any dispute over the meaning or effect of virtually any provision in the entire federal tax code.
the question is not whether such a holding will open the federal courts to analogous the most rudimentary concept of legal precedent it certainly will.the pressing questions are what cases would be analogous and how many would there be.this case involves the interpretation of the effective date provision of a accounting guideline in the federal tax code.the universe of analogous cases would conservatively include any case that involves the interpretation of any provision that is at least as significant as the effective date provision of any accounting guideline that is at least as significant as expenses that is in the federal tax code.it is no overstatement to say that this description covers numerous tax code provisions it may not be an overstatement to say that it covers them all.examples of such cases abound,including common malpractice actions against tax preparation professionals or company accountants involving disputed interpretations of tax code provisions actions by shareholders for misstatement of earnings and profits actions by employees for overstatement of earnings on forms or by independent contractors for overstated forms.limitation of this universe of analogous cases unlikely.
even recognizing that there are some limits,such as irs preemption and statutes of limitation,we are left with the conclusion that finding a substantial federal question in the case we decide today would open the door of the federal courts to significantly more than the solitary case asserting a constitutional challenge,as in smith,at,or the microscopic effect portended by the quiet title action in grable,at.and even if the actual number of cases proved not to be overwhelming,or even uncomfortably burdensome,it appears unlikely that its to open the federal court door quite so wide.
the balance here weighs against the propriety of federal jurisdiction,and this case can not be squeezed into the slim category of cases that grable exemplifies.see empire.at.the state court in which the suit was lodged is competent to apply federal law,to the extent it is relevant,and would seem suitably positioned to determine the application of n in the present case.id.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court for dismissal for lack of federal jurisdiction.
a majority of the court relies upon two bases for its decision today that federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction over the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in this case.first,the majority concludes that does not preempt the present case.with that determination,i am in full agreement.second,the majority states that there is no substantial federal interest in obtaining a federal court decision regarding the effective date of a provision of the federal internal revenue code that will enhance the ability of a federal agency to collect the monies necessary to carry on the workings of the federal government.even if the federal interest were held to be substantial,the majority nevertheless contends that we should remand this matter to the state court lest provision of a federal forum would portend an extension of federal jurisdiction that would embroil us in any dispute over the meaning or effect of virtually any provision in the entire federal tax code,as well as in state malpractice actions,shareholder suits,and other decidedly disputes.see op.at.from these portions of the majority ruling,i respectfully dissent.
congress has seen fit to entrust federal district courts with original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.emphasis added.because the plaintiffs in this litigation allege that their suit raises claims based only upon the ohio state law concepts of breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation,they argue that any exercise of federal jurisdiction in this matter would be unjustified.as recognized almost years ago by the united states supreme court,however,e ven though state law creates a litigant causes of action,its case might still arise under the laws of the united states if a complaint established that its right to relief under state law requires resolution of a substantial question of federal law in dispute between the parties.franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d.
significantly,the supreme court has ruled just two years ago in grable sons metal products,darue engineering and manufacturing,d,another case from this circuit,that even a action to quiet title can implicate a substantial federal interest in construing federal tax law.id.at.in that case,although grable sons filed its complaint in state court against only darue engineering and manufacturing,the entity then in possession of an internal revenue quitclaim deed to the plaintiff former property,the court recognized that the determinative issue involved an analysis of the validity of the notice provided to grable sons by a government agency.consequently,not only does t he government have a direct interest in the availability of a federal forum to vindicate its own administrative action,id.at,but the national interest in providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial to support the exercise of federal question jurisdiction over the disputed issue on removal,which would not distort any division of labor between the state and federal courts,provided or assumed by congress.id.at.emphasis added.
as the majority concedes,even the supreme court subsequent ruling in empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d,has not shut the jurisdictional door propped open in grable.see op.at.empire involved a dispute concerning a federal employee insurance carrier attempt to obtain reimbursement from the insured after the estate of the federal employee recovered damages unaided by the in a tort action against a third party alleged to have caused the accident.id.at.concluding that such a quintessential contribution claim does not raise a substantial federal question,even though a federal employee recovery pursuant to a federal employees insurance policy was at issue,the court emphasized numerous differences in the grable and the empire scenarios.foremost among those differences was the simple fact that grable centered on the action of a federal agency irs and its compatibility with a federal statute.empire.at.the court further explained that the federal question in grable was substantial,that judicial resolution of the question would be dispositive of the case before it,as well as of future cases,and that the dispute involved a pure issue of law.see id.
despite the court successful effort in empire to distinguish the situation presented in that case from the scenario in grable,the justices have also recognized that there is no single,precise,test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in claims between nondiverse parties.grable,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.instead,the question is,does a claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.id.
in addressing that question in this action,the majority opinion first correctly concedes that a federal issue is indeed raised in the plaintiffs complaint and that the federal issue is actually disputed.see op.at.despite that concession,the majority asserts that the substance of the dispute is somehow minimized by the absence of participation by a federal agency,citing empire recognition that grable centered on the action of a federal agency.see op.at,citing empire.at.nowhere in grable nor in empire,however,did the supreme court indicate that agency participation in litigation constituted a sine qua non to the exercise of federal jurisdiction.rather,such participation was merely one factor in reaching the ultimate conclusion that the national interest in providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial.grable,at.in this case,however,even in the absence of participation by a federal agency,
