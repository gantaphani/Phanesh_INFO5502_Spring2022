chenell hammond,a retail customer,appeals from the dismissal of her action under against kmart corporation and sears holdings corporation collectively,kmart,where she successfully purchased goods using the store layaway process.the district court granted kmart motion to dismiss because hammond pleadings were insufficient to state a claim under.it dismissed the federal claim,but dismissed without prejudice a pendent state law claim.we affirm on the narrow facts of this case and the paucity of the allegations.
hammond filed suit on january,bringing a federal claim of racial discrimination under and a pendent state law claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.we take all of hammond factual allegations as true,drawing reasonable inferences in her favor,lemelson bank ass n,cir,as did the district court.
hammond is an african american woman.in her complaint,she alleged that on november,a white kmart sales clerk said insulting racial slurs and comments to her while she was placing items on hold in a layaway transaction.
more specifically,on that day hammond was at kmart with her two children.in order to place several items on layaway,she needed to give the sales clerk her identification card,which indicated that she lived in roxbury,massachusetts,a part of boston which has a high percentage of african american residents 
upon receiving this identification card,the white sales clerk asked if hammond would be jumping the counter to get what she needed because she is from roxbury.the clerk also labeled the identification card,which was not a driver license,a liquor id.
the clerk commented that she used to live in dorchester,which is adjacent to roxbury,but had to move because of porch monkeys in that area.she said that these porch monkeys had fired gunshots through her window,causing her to dive under her bed for protection.
the clerk next spoke to hammond about a public housing project in weymouth,massachusetts,assuming that hammond was familiar with it,although she was not.specifically,the clerk said that she lived in weymouth and that the only action in her neighborhood came from that project.
hammond was humiliated and deeply offended by these comments,which she believed reflected the sales clerk belief that she was poor,inferior and violent because she is african american.she alleged no other consequences.
the complaint did not allege that kmart in any way failed to go through with the layaway,refused to perform any transactions with her,or otherwise refused to contract with her.nor did it allege that hammond had complained to the store,and,if so,what had happened in response.
kmart moved to dismiss the claim,stating that the complaint allegations regarding the sales clerk racially discriminatory remarks fail to state a claim under.it argued that hammond failure to allege that kmart interfered with a contractual relationship or denied her any rights under the layaway contract warranted dismissal of her claim.
hammond opposed this motion but did not seek to amend her complaint.rather,her opposing memorandum added that the kmart clerk remarks almost did cause the cessation of the layaway transaction because hammond was so offended by them that she considered walking away from the checkout counter.
the district court,following garrett tandy,cir,dismissed hammond claim.it reasoned that hammond fail ed to make any factual averments to support a claim that the store clerk comments,described as racially demeaning,insulting,rude,and discriminatory,precluded her from making or enforcing her layaway contract with kmart.it held that hammond additional assertion that she almost did not complete the layaway payment was also inadequate to state a claim.
hammond appeals from the dismissal of her claim.
we review de novo an order of dismissal for failure to state a claim.lemelson,at.dismissal is appropriate if the complaint does not set forth factual allegations,either direct or inferential,respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.id.quoting united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir.so,t o survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.alteration in original quoting ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.
the text of provides all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens interpretation of this language has been the subject of a number of supreme court cases.see domino pizza,mcdonald,rivers roadway express,runyon mccrary.this court also has a series of cases.see garrett,danco,wal mart stores,inc,cir benjamin aroostook med,cir.
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must show that she is a member of a racial minority the defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her race and the discrimination implicated one or more of the activities listed in the statute,including the right to make and enforce contracts.garrett,at.
it is undisputed that hammond,an african american,is a member of a racial minority.in addition,kmart for present purposes does not contest that a jury could find that the sales clerk remarks,as alleged in the complaint,were racially discriminatory.the question is whether hammond complaint sufficiently met the third requirement.under garrett,to satisfy the foundational pleading requirement for a suit,a retail customer must allege that he was actually denied the ability either to make,perform,enforce,modify,or terminate a contract,or to enjoy the fruits of a contractual relationship,by reason of a animus.id.at emphasis added.
the scope of coverage has changed over time.in congress amended to overrule patterson mclean credit union,which had narrowly interpreted the statute phrase make and enforce contracts,pt,at.patterson had held that the statutory phrase did not encompass racial harassment experienced by an african american employee who claimed she was ultimately fired because of her race.at.the court determined that conduct by the employer after the contract relation has been established,including breach of the terms of the contract comprises the performance of a contract,not its making or enforcement.id.at.
the amendment sought to undo this holding by more broadly defining the phrase make and enforce contracts to include the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,as well as the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.b.even with this broader definition,however,congress focus on bar ring all racial discrimination in contracts did not change,pt,at emphasis added see also rivers,at garrett,at.
as the supreme court more recently said in domino pizza n othing in the text of suggests that it was meant to provide an omnibus remedy for all racial injustice.if so,it would not have been limited to situations involving contracts.at.as a result,courts interpreting the amendment,including this court in garrett,have continued to require a sufficient nexus between the asserted discrimination and some contractual right or relationship.garrett,at.
our case law and supreme court precedent control the outcome here.in garrett,we affirmed a district court dismissal of a claim by a retail customer of the defendant store for failure to state a claim.at.there,as in this case,the plaintiff alleged that racial discrimination interfered with his right to make and enforce contracts in a retail store,although he had completed his purchase.
garrett,an african american man,claimed he endured two forms of racial discrimination related to his shopping at radio shack.the first is that three white employees monitored his movements throughout the store,and at least one of them accompanied him throughout his visit.id.at.
although radio shack did not carry a police scanner that garrett was looking for,he ended up buying a book,a phone,and some batteries.id.this court held that garrett allegations of surveillance did not state a claim because the monitoring by the three employees did not impair h
