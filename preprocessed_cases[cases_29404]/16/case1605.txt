statement of the case and background 
in april,vincent and janice dimare the dimares entered into a contract to purchase a home constructed by lamar homes,lamar.in march,the dimares filed suit against lamar and its subcontractor in texas state court claiming that lamar was negligent and failed to design construct the foundation of the dimares residence in a good and workmanlike fashion in accordance with implied and express warranties.
lamar timely forwarded the lawsuit to casualty company seeking defense and indemnification under a commercial general liability insurance policy cgl policy issued by for a policy period of july,to july.refused to defend lamar,and lamar filed suit against in texas state court seeking a declaration that policy covered the claim asserted against lamar in the dimare litigation and that owed lamar a defense in that suit.lamar also argued that failure to tender a defense violated texas insurance code article,also known as the prompt payment of claims statute.removed the case to federal court.
lamar and filed for summary judgment.at the motion hearing the parties agreed to limit the issue to whether had a duty to defend lamar in the dimare litigation.the district court held that the underlying claim for damages from construction errors essentially presented either a claim based on a breach of contract or breach of warranty and therefore did not have a duty to defend under its cgl policy because such construction errors are not covered by cgl policies as a matter of law.
the district court reasoned that because the gravamen of the underlying petition sought relief for a breach of contract resulting in pure economic loss,the insurer was not obligated to provide a defense under the cgl policy the court stated that t he purpose of comprehensive liability insurance coverage for a builder is to protect the insured from liability resulting from property damage or bodily injury caused by the insured product,but not for the replacement or repair of that product.the court stated further that i f an insurance policy were to be interpreted as providing coverage for construction deficiencies,the effect would be to enable a contractor to receive initial payment for the work from the homeowner,then receive subsequent payment from his insurance company to repair and correct deficiencies in his own work.the court concluded that such a result would transform a liability policy into a performance bond.thus,the court found that was not obligated to provide a defense to lamar in the underlying litigation.
relevant authoritiesa.occurrence and property damage under the cgl policy 
the cgl policy in question provides coverage for bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence that takes place within the coverage territory.the resolution of the first issue presented to us on appeal involves the interpretation and application of the terms occurrence and property damage.under the policy,occurrence means an accident,including a continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.property damage is defined under the policy as either a physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or b loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.
the intermediate texas courts of appeal are in conflict on the application of these clauses in a cgl policy when the insured contractor is sued by a building owner for damage arising from shoddy construction of the building.
courts which have found that construction errors do not constitute an occurrence conclude that a claim for bad workmanship at bottom is a claim for breach of contract,which is not covered under the policy.these courts reason that shoddy work is foreseeable by the contractor and therefore is not an accidental or unexpected loss 
courts that have found an occurrence in this circumstance reason that where the shoddy workmanship is the result of the builder negligence rather than intentional conduct,the loss is unexpected and therefore accidental.

the texas intermediate courts of appeal also disagree on whether damage caused by defective workmanship constitutes property damage under a cgl policy.courts finding no property damage in this circumstance reason that claims for the cost of repairing faulty workmanship are nothing more than claims for pure economic loss,which are the damages that typically flow from a breach of contract.these courts,applying what has been termed the business risk doctrine,assert that a cgl policy does not insure against business risks otherwise,there would be little difference between a cgl policy and a performance bond.these courts hold that because pure economic loss does not constitute damages from physical injury to tangible property,no coverage is provided.
other courts hold that when construction errors cause physical damage to the object of the contract,such damage constitutes property damage and is covered under the policy regardless of whether the only tangible property damaged was the residence itself.

lamar contends that the line of cases holding that construction errors do not constitute an occurrence causing property damage inappropriately rely on the business risk doctrine,and ignore amendments to the standard cgl policy.prior to,the standard cgl policy contained a broad your work exclusion excluding coverage for any property damage to the subject of the contract caused by faulty workmanship.in,the standard cgl policy was amended to except from these your work exclusions damage to the subject of the contract caused by the work of a subcontractor lamar argues that given these amendments,it is inappropriate for courts to deny coverage based on the business risk doctrine when a general contractor requests a defense against claims arising from the work of a subcontractor.lamar contends that many of the courts denying coverage under these circumstances either involved cgl policies,or the courts failed to account for these amendments to the cgl policy.
contends that lamar argument regarding the evolution of the cgl policy and the misapplication of the business risk doctrine is an attempt to use policy exclusions to create coverage,which argues has been rejected by texas courts 
the only texas court that has addressed this issue concluded that construction errors caused by subcontractors were covered after the subcontractor exception to the your work exclusion was incorporated in the general contractor cgl policy the texas supreme court has not addressed this argument.
given the frequency this issue is litigated and the copious amount of conflicting caselaw on both sides regarding whether construction errors causing damage to the subject of the contract constitute an occurrence causing property damage under a cgl policy,we believe that this is an issue that the texas supreme court should consider resolving.indeed the parties have called our attention to the texas supreme court call for b
