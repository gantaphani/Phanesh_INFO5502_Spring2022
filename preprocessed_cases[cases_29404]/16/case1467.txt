this case arises out of a disagreement between two insurers over their respective duties to indemnify for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident.amerisure,the primary insurer,argued that it did not have a duty to indemnify.navigators,the excess insurer,disagreed,demanding that amerisure pay the million limit of its policy.the insurers,however,agreed that the lawsuit should be settled,and they agreed on the amount of the settlement,million.amerisure paid the million,but reserved its right to seek reimbursement.navigators and another insurer paid the balance.amerisure then sought reimbursement from navigators through equitable and contractual subrogation.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for navigators,finding that,although the amerisure policy did not cover the incident,amerisure could not recover through equitable or contractual subrogation.
before us are four issues whether insurance liberty mutual insurance,bars amerisure claim whether equitable subrogation is available whether amerisure had a duty to indemnify under three exclusions in its policy and whether the conditional exclusion of the navigators policy applied.we conclude that contractual subrogation is available,and hence,we do not reach the claim for equitable subrogation.furthermore,we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to amerisure duty to indemnify.finally,we conclude that the conditional exclusion does not apply.accordingly,we vacate the grant of summary judgment on the claim,and we remand for the determination of amerisure duty to indemnify.
background and procedural history 
on october,william sylvester drove two employees of texas crewboats,captain dixie clanton and deckhand jimmy satterfield,from freeport,texas to morgan city,louisiana where the two were to board and crew the florida lilly,one of texas crewboats vessels.while en route,sylvester fell asleep at the wheel,thereby causing the vehicle to veer off of the road and flip over.clanton and satterfield suffered significant injuries as a result.they sued texas crewboats and sylvester in louisiana state court,claiming negligence and recklessness against sylvester and bringing similar claims under the jones act against texas crewboats.clanton and satterfield claimed that sylvester was driving in the course and scope of his employment with texas crewboats and that texas crewboats was vicariously liable.they also sued texas crewboats for maintenance and cure benefits.
at the time,texas crewboats carried three insurance policies that the incident potentially implicated.amerisure provided million of primary insurance.under that policy,sylvester,who was driving the vehicle with the permission of texas crewboats,was also an insured.fireman fund insurance company provided million of primary coverage for marine protection and indemnity.navigators was the excess insurer,covering up to million.under this arrangement,if an incident fell within the coverage of any of the primary insurers,that insurer must indemnify the insured up to million,and then,navigators would cover the remainder up to million.
the amerisure policy contains three exclusions that are relevant here 
the insurance does not apply to any of the following 
workers compensation 
any obligation for which the insured or the insured insurer may be held liable under any workers compensation,disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.
employee indemnification and employer liability 
bodily injury to 
a.an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured 
but this exclusion does not apply to bodily injury to domestic employees not entitled to workers compensation benefits or to liability assumed by the insured under an insured contract.
fellow employee 
bodily injury to any fellow employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of the fellow employee employment.
the amerisure policy also reserves amerisure right to subrogation 
if any person or organization to or for whom we make payment under this coverage form has rights to recover damages from another,those rights are transferred to us.that person or organization must do everything necessary to secure our rights and must do nothing after accident or loss to impair them.
the navigators policy contains a conditional exclusion that reads,
as respects all activities of the assured except liability arising out of ownership,charter,use,operation,maintenance,loading,unloading,ship repairing or as a bailee of any watercraft not otherwise excluded or limited herein,this insurance shall be free from liability unless coverage is provided in an underlying policy scheduled hereon,and then coverage hereunder shall only operate as excess of such coverage 
a from operation,ownership,use of any automobile,truck or aircraft 
under the circumstances,texas crewboats wanted the case settled,and all of the interested parties,including the insurers,agreed.following mediation,the parties agreed to the following settlement clanton claims would be settled for and satterfield for.the insurers,however,could not agree on which of them should pay.amerisure argued that only the fireman and navigators policies applied.navigators insisted that the incident also fell within the amerisure policy,and therefore,demanded that amerisure pay its million limit.
in april,amerisure moved for summary judgment in louisiana state court,seeking a declaration that its policy did not cover the incident.on june,amerisure voluntarily withdrew that motion.ultimately,amerisure paid million and navigators paid million,which included sums from fireman.in the settlement agreement,amerisure reserved its right to seek reimbursement from navigators through subrogation.during those settlement negotiations,amerisure filed this subrogation action in the united states district court for the southern district of texas.
the parties filed for summary judgment before the district court in.the motions focused on three issues whether the three exclusions in the amerisure policy applied,whether the conditional exclusion in the navigators policy applied,and whether amerisure could recover through contractual and equitable subrogation.over two years later,in january,the district court issued its opinion,addressing only the first and third issues.amerisure ins.navigators ins,op.at.it decided the former for amerisure,finding that all three exclusions equally apply to deny coverage.id.at.nonetheless,the court denied reimbursement because it found that amerisure could not pursue contractual or claims against navigators.see id.at.with respect to contractual subrogation,the court held that navigators had been released from liability as a party to the settlement.see id.it also held that,under insurance liberty mutual insurance,amerisure has no contractual right to be subrogated because the insured parties were fully indemnified.id.on the question of equitable subrogation,the court found that amerisure voluntarily contributed to the settlement.see id.amerisure timely appealed.

discussion 
contractual subrogation and 
the first issue that we must address is one of first impression for this court whether insurance liberty mutual insurance,precludes contractual subrogation simply because the insured has been fully indemnified.we hold that it does not.
in texas,parties create rights by agreement or contract,granting the right to pursue reimbursement from a third party in exchange for payment of a loss.see id.at.when the insurer seeks to recover through contractual subrogation,it stands in the shoes of the insured,obtaining only those rights held by the insured against a third party,subject to any defenses held by the third party against the insured.id.
the texas supreme court,in,elaborated on the doctrine when this court presented the following certified question 
two insurers,providing the same insured applicable primary insurance liability coverage under policies with million limits and standard provisions one insurer also providing the insured coverage under a million excess policy,cooperatively assume defense of the suit against their common insured,admitting coverage.the insurer also issuing the excess policy procures an offer to settle for the reasonable amount of million and demands that the other insurer contribute its proportionate part of that settlement,but the other insurer,unreasonably valuing the case at no more than,contributes only,although it could contribute as much as without exceeding its remaining available policy limits.as a result,the case settles without an actual trial for million funded million by the insurer which also issued the excess policy and by the other insurer.
in that situation is any actionable duty owed directly or by subrogation to the insured rights to the insurer paying the million by the underpaying insurer to reimburse the former respecting its payment of more than its proportionate part of the settlement 
id.at.both policies included pro rata clauses,limiting each insurer exposure to the lesser of the limit of the policy that it issued and its proportion of the settlement.id.at.the texas supreme court held that,
in the context presented,a fully indemnified insured has no right to recover an additional pro rata portion of settlement from an insurer regardless of that insurer contribution to the settlement.having fully recovered its loss,an insured has no contractual rights that a may assert against another in subrogation.
id.at.from this,the court concluded that,after being fully indemnified,the insured does not have any contractual rights remaining against.because the insured has no rights to which liberty mutual may be subrogated,liberty mutual has no right of reimbursement through subrogation.id.at.
district courts in this circuit have differed on the impact that has had on contractual subrogation.two courts,including the district court here,have broadly construed to preclude contractual subrogation whenever the insured is fully indemnified or defended 
because the men fully recovered their losses in the settlement,they no longer have contractual rights against either where not all of them contributed to the men recovery.without a claim against an insurer,amerisure has no contractual right to be subrogated.ins.liberty mut.ins.
amerisure ins.navigators ins,op.at,see also trinity.ins.employers mut.cas,d,applying,plaintiffs stand in no better position than lacy masonry,who,having been fully defended by plaintiffs in the underlying suit,has no basis to recover damages against emc for its failure to defend,aff on other grounds and rev on other grounds,cir on appeal,this court did not reach the subrogation question under after finding that the appellants could recover through a contribution claim.see trinity.ins.employers mut.cas,at.
the majority of courts,however,have cabined to its facts.see arrowood indem.gulf underwriters ins,no,wl,at,noting that was heavily dependant on the existence of pro rata clauses and that it should not be stretched beyond the facts which underlie that case duininck,howe precast,wl,at,is a narrow case lexington ins.chi.ins,no,wl,at,emphasizing that does not address whether an insurer that contributes to a settlement fund but denies coverage for the underlying lawsuit,and that reserves the right to dispute coverage and seek reimbursement for the entire amount it paid,may recover that amount from the other insurer american home assur.liberty mut.ins,wl,at,acknowledging that is confined to the factual circumstances.
most recently,judge lee rosenthal,in a opinion,rejected the argument that automatically precludes subrogation claims whenever the insured is fully indemnified.see employers insurance of wausau insurance.supp d,wl,at.there,the court emphasized that is limited to situations where the insurers were insurers,did not dispute that both covered the loss,and were subject to pro rata clauses.see id.at.the court further reasoned that such a broad reading of 
would make statutory or contractual indemnification in texas unavailable to the insurer of a seller asserting that its acts or omissions did not cause the underlying plaintiff injury if the seller insurer assumed the insured defense and paid to settle the claim.this reading is not supported by the texas supreme court statements after.see frymire eng g jomar int l,the allegedly responsible party argument that the settling party can not assert equitable subrogation because its indemnity payment was under a voluntary contract would,if accepted and applied to other contracts,be a radical departure from texas subrogation law.for instance,insurance policies are contracts,too,and if the hotel property insurer had paid the hotel for the cost of repairs pursuant to a policy agreement,it would certainly be able to assert an equitable subrogation claim against the allegedly responsible party.
we agree with the majority of courts that have examined this issue and we reject the overly broad view of subrogation exclusion.that view would effectively end contractual subrogation in texas.this can not be so,particularly in light of the texas supreme court most recent decision in texas health insurance risk pool,wl.
although sigmundik does not specifically address the reach of,it is nonetheless instructive.there,the insurer had fully indemnified the insured for his medical expenses arising out of injuries sustained in an explosion.see id.at.after the death of the insured,his wife filed a negligence action on behalf of herself,her two minor sons,and the insured estate.id.the insurer intervened,arguing that it was subrogated to the rights of the insured and his estate based on an express subrogation provision in the policy 
we will be subrogated to all rights of recovery which any person may have against another party for all benefits paid by the pool which were incurred by the insured person as a result of the negligence or misconduct of another party.our right to repayment shall be a lien against any recovery by the insured person whether it be by judgment,settlement,or otherwise.
id.the negligence action settled for,and the court explained that,through contractual subrogation,the insurer stepped into the shoes of the insured the estate and has a valid claim to recover the from the settlement.see id.at.the court could not have reached this result if the broad view of was in fact the law of texas.
since,the texas supreme court has not specified the precise boundaries of its holding as it applies to contractual subrogation when the insured is fully indemnified.nor do we attempt to do so here.instead,our decision here is an erie guess,and in making an erie guess,we must determine how the texas supreme court would resolve the issue under the specific circumstances presented.see chaney dreyfus serv,cir citation omitted.accordingly,in light of sigmundik,we hold that does not bar contractual subrogation simply because the insured is fully indemnified 
our inquiry does not end here,however,as we still must determine whether precludes contractual subrogation in this case.it does not.in,the insured was fully protected because both insurers acknowledged their duties to defend and indemnify.see at.limiting to such circumstances is faithful to the longstanding view of the texas supreme court,as articulated over half a century ago by justice jack pope,that dueling coinsurers must place the interests of their insureds before their own.see hardware dealers mut.fire ins.farmers ins,emphasizing that the settled principles of texas insurance law require insurers to give dominant consideration to the rights of the insured.that is the missing element here amerisure insisted that its policy did not apply,and navigators refused to indemnify until amerisure paid its million policy limit.in other words,the insureds would not have been fully protected,and applying the exclusion in this situation would have further deviated from settled principles of texas insurance law by discouraging insurers from first defending and indemnifying and then seeking reimbursement for the costs that a coinsurer should have paid.see keck,mahin cate union fire ins.of pittsburgh,rejecting a view of subrogation as bad public policy because it would discourage insurance companies from paying or settling disputed claims and thereby force insureds more often into litigation with their insurers see also hardware dealers,at.therefore,we hold that does not bar contractual subrogation when an insurer has denied coverage.
the district court provided an additional basis for dismissing amerisure claim.it held that,a lthough amerisure purchased the right to pursue the mens claims against third parties,navigators has been released from liability as a party to the settlement.amerisure ins.navigators ins,op.at.this overlooks how contractual subrogation places amerisure in the shoes of its insureds,texas crewboats and sylvester.see,at.neither released navigators.furthermore,in its settlement agreement with clanton and satterfield,amerisure reserved its right to recoup its contribution through subrogation from navigators.in sum,amerisure has a right to contractual subrogation.accordingly,we do not reach the claim.see bay rock operating paul surplus lines ins,antonio,pet.denied here,there is no dispute that paul had a contractual subrogation right pursuant to its insurance policy with hollimon therefore,the express agreement of the parties controls,and equitable principles do not come into play.
ii.coverage under the amerisure policy 
although amerisure has a right,that right only entitles it to reimbursement if amerisure did not have a duty to indemnify its insureds,texas crewboats and sylvester.amerisure contends that three exclusions in its policy preclude its duty to indemnify.these exclusions relate to workers compensation,employee indemnification,and injuries to fellow employees,which we will describe in greater detail below.in order to determine amerisure duty to indemnify,we must examine how each of these exclusions applies to each insured.that is because section of the amerisure policy requires that,e xcept with respect to the limit of insurance,the coverage afforded applies separately to each insured who is seeking coverage or against whom a claim or suit is brought.amerisure has no duty to indemnify if any one of the exclusions applies to each insured.put differently,amerisure must indemnify if none of the exclusions discharges its duty to indemnify texas crewboats and sylvester.
the district court found that all three exclusions deny coverage navigators disputes this,urging us to hold,as an alternative ground for affirmance,that none of the exclusions apply.in addition,navigators contends that,under the clause of its policy,if the amerisure policy did not cover sylvester,its policy also would not.in that situation,navigators argues that amerisure may not recover its contribution.
with respect to texas crewboats,we conclude that only the exclusion applies.with respect to sylvester,the only exclusion that could potentially apply is the exclusion,but there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding this question.hence,the issue of amerisure duty to indemnify survives summary judgment.finally,we conclude that the conditional exclusion of the navigators policy does not apply.
interpreting insurance policies in texas 
under texas law,insurance policies are construed as are contracts generally,and must be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the parties at the time the contracts were formed.cas.jhp,cir citations omitted.when an insurance policy is ambiguous or inconsistent,the interpretation that would afford coverage governs.id.citations omitted.exceptions or limitations on an insurer liability are construed even more stringent ly.cas.swift energy,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.the court must accept the interpretation of the exclusionary clause urged by the insured if it is not itself unreasonable,even if the insurer interpretation seems more reasonable or a more accurate reflection of the parties intent.barnett aetna life ins,citations omitted.the court resolves all doubts regarding coverage in favor of coverage.see king dallas fire ins,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,merchs.fast motor lines.
an insurer has two responsibilities relating to duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.see,markel int l ins.two documents determine an insurer duty to insurance policy and the plaintiff pleadings in the underlying litigation,which the court must review without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.guideone elite ins.fielder.baptist church,citations omitted.this is known as the rule.id.citations omitted.under the rule,the f acts outside the pleadings,even those easily ascertained,are ordinarily not material to the determination and allegations against the insured are liberally construed in favor of coverage.id.
the rule,however,does not govern the duty to indemnify.see,at.that is because the two duties are distinct such that one duty may exist without the other.id.at.in determining coverage,a matter dependent on the facts and circumstances of the alleged event,parties may introduce evidence during coverage litigation to establish or refute the duty to indemnify.id.at.with these principles in mind,we now turn to the exclusions at issue.
b.the amerisure exclusions 
workers compensation exclusion 
the workers compensation exclusion does not preclude coverage for texas crewboats or sylvester.
texas crewboats 
clanton and satterfield sued texas crewboats for negligence under the jones act.this exclusion precludes coverage for a ny obligation for which the insured or the insured insurer may be held liable under any workers compensation or any similar law.the issue,therefore,is whether the jones act is similar to workers compensation.it is not.
the texas supreme court has not addressed this precise question,and we have located only one published decision that is directly on point,sanders homes indemnity insurance,so d,d cir in sanders,so d at,the court considered the effect of a similar exclusion,stating that t his insurance does not cover a ny obligation imposed by a worker compensation law or any similar law.the court held that the jones act is not similar to workers compensation because the former is based on the employer negligence while the latter is not.see sanders,so d at see also abogado int l marine carriers,explaining that workers compensation claims,which are imposed without regard to fault,are not similar to and independent of claims based on jones act negligence citation omitted.we find this reasoning persuasive.
furthermore,the operative phrase here,any similar law,is ambiguous with respect to the jones act claims.in light of this ambiguity,the court must interpret the term so that it does not exclude coverage.see cas.swift energy,cir citation omitted.
this exclusion does not apply to sylvester.clanton and satterfield charged sylvester with negligent and reckless driving.because sylvester was not clanton or satterfield employer,such claims,if proven,would not create obligation s for which sylvester or his insurer may be held liable under any workers compensation,disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.
ii.exclusion 
this exclusion precludes coverage for texas crewboats,but not for sylvester.
texas crewboats 
the parties agree that the accident involved bodily injury to employee s of texas crewboats arising out of and in the course of employment by texas crewboats navigators,however,contends that the exclusion is inapplicable under the subsection of the exclusion that states,t his exclusion does not apply to bodily injury to do
