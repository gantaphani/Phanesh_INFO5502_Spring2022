avery cashion,iii,appeals from the district court judgment in favor of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,acting as receiver for the bank of asheville the bank,in this action by the fdic to recover the deficiency owed on a promissory note executed by cashion and payable to the bank.cashion contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the fdic because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the fdic was the holder of the note and whether the note had been cancelled or assigned.he also asserts the district court abused its discretion in striking his surreply brief opposing summary judgment and an affidavit attached to it.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in august,cashion signed a promissory note note payable to the bank in the original principal amount of.through march,the bank and cashion entered into a number of modifications and renewals of the note.the note was originally secured by three other promissory notes,and a fourth promissory note was added as additional collateral in.
in september,the bank filed an action in north carolina state court alleging that it was the holder of the note,that cashion had defaulted by failing to make the payments due on the note,and that it was entitled to full payment plus interest pursuant to the note terms.cashion answer admitted a copy of a document,which speaks for itself,is attached to the bank complaint,and that the signature on that document appears to be the signature of cashion,but demand ed that the bank produce the original document that is described as the note.
before the case proceeded further,the bank closed and the fdic was named receiver and liquidating agent.after the fdic was substituted as the real party in interest in the state court,it removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina the fdic then moved for summary judgment,asserting that it had set forth a prima facie case to recover proceeds on the note and that no genuine issues of material fact precluded judgment as a matter of law.it attached to the motion an affidavit from sherry martin,a resolutions and receiverships specialist for the fdic who was familiar with the books and records of the fdic and the bank.martin stated in the affidavit that the information alleged in the complaint came from records and employees of the bank,and was correct and true.
cashion opposed the motion,asserting that two genuine issues of material fact existed first,whether the fdic satisfied its burden of proving that it was the holder of the note in light of its failure to produce the original note,and second,whether the note had been cancelled or assigned.to support the latter argument,cashion included an affidavit asserting the note had been cancelled and attaching a copy of the internal revenue service irs form c that he alleged he received from the bank in early the c form as the sole basis for his affidavit the c form,labeled cancellation of debt in text,had been filled out by hand and lists the bank of asheville as the creditor and cashion as the debtor,references the note account number,reflects the date canceled as and the amount of debt canceled as.the debt description box states assignment of promissory notes.
the fdic attached a supplemental affidavit from martin to its response in support of summary judgment in which she reiterated her 
familiar ity with the books and records acquired by the fdic when it was appointed receiver for the bank the books and records in question were made at or near the time of the matters therein recorded and were kept in the course of the bank regularly conducted business activity,the regular practice of which was to keep such books and records.
martin supplemental affidavit also stated that the fdic had possession of the original note,that the copy attached to the complaint was true and correct,that the note had not been transferred or assigned to a third party,that the note had not been paid by cashion or a third party,and that the note had not been cancelled or cashion otherwise absolved of liability.martin also stated that based on the bank records in the fdic possession,the c form appear ed to have been sent to cashion by the bank prior to the receivership.martin also indicated that 
t he most likely explanation for the debt cancellation referred to in on the irs c form is that assignment of promissory notes refers to the collateral securing the note the fact that the bank may have issued an irs c form concerning the collateral that secured the note does not mean that the bank cancelled cashion debt to the bank reflected by the note.
based on martin supplemental affidavit,the fdic argued that it was the holder of the note and was not required to produce the original note in order to prove that status under north carolina law because a true copy was sufficient.in addition,the fdic contended that the c form was inadmissible hearsay and that cashion had not properly authenticated the form for admission into evidence under any of the exceptions to the rule against hearsay.the fdic also posited that the c form did not refer to the note,but to the collateral for the note.alternatively,the fdic asserted that at most,the c form indicated the bank intent that the note be cancelled,but was not competent evidence of actual cancellation.
cashion did not move to strike martin supplemental affidavit,but instead filed an additional notice of filing in opposition to summary judgment hereinafter surreply countering the fdic arguments regarding the admissibility and import of the c form.cashion attached to the surreply an affidavit from his business partner,raymond chapman,in which chapman described the c form and then gave his viewpoint as to what cashion receipt of the c form from the bank likely meant cancellation of the note.
the fdic moved to strike the surreply and chapman affidavit,noting that n othing in the c ourt pretrial order and case management plan authorize d the filing of a surreply,and cashion had not sought leave of court to authorize such a filing.it further asserted that a surreply was not appropriate under the circumstances given that its reply had not raised any new issues.in addition,the fdic argued that the chapman affidavit contained opinion testimony from a person who was not an expert witness rather than information based on chapman personal knowledge.for that reason,the fdic urged the district court to strike or disregard the affidavit 
for reasons summarized in context below,the district court granted the fdic motion to strike the surreply and chapman affidavit,denied cashion motion for leave to file those items,and then awarded summary judgment to the fdic.the district court entered final judgment in favor of the fdic in the amount of,together with interest at the rate of per day from and after september.
cashion noted a timely appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
cashion raises three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the fdic because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the fdic is the holder of the note whether the district court abused its discretion in granting the fdic motion to strike the surreply and chapman affidavit and whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the fdic because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the note has been cancelled or assigned.
we review an award of summary judgment de novo.adams trs.of the of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.pro.a.in considering the matter,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party here,cashion and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.see adams,at.
we review the district court evidentiary and scheduling decisions for abuse of discretion.see noel artson,cir stating that a district court evidentiary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion cray commc ns,novatel computer,cir stating the district court decisions regarding briefing and hearing on summary judgment motions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.
consistent with the note governing law provision,we look to north carolina law to determine whether the fdic established that it is the holder of the note.the holder of a negotiable instrument is entitled to enforce it.a holder is the individual,corporation,or any other legal or commercial entity.b,in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession.b.when signatures are admitted or established,production of the instrument entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense.harvey son jarman,quoting former,recodified using similar language at.
the district court rejected cashion contention that the fdic had not shown that it is the holder of the note because it failed to produce the original note despite cashion demand in his answer that it do so.relying on dobson substitute tr,and liles myers,the district court concluded that production of the original note is not the only manner in which holder status can be proved under north carolina law.the district court observed that the fdic had proffered evidence that the bank was the holder,that the fdic succeeded to all rights of the bank when it was appointed as the bank receiver,and that a true and accurate copy of the note was in the record.in addition,the district court observed that cashion did not dispute the accuracy of the copy but instead simply made a strict demand for production of the original note in his answer.
on appeal,cashion contends the district court erred because the fdic had not satisfied its burden of proving,under north carolina law,that it was the holder of the note due to the failure to produce the original note in response to cashion demand for strict proof.opening br.cashion points to liles as establishing a party right under north carolina law to demand such strict proof,and points to the bank entering into receivership as sufficient to create uncertainty as to the content of the bank records.cashion asserts that martin c arefully crafted affidavit is insufficient to prove holder status because it was a perfunctory and conclusory verification in the face of cashion demand.opening br.
we readily conclude that cashion argument misconstrues the relevant north carolina case law.in liles,the court of appeals of north carolina held that the plaintiff failed to introduce the promissory note itself or any other competent evidence showing that the plaintiff was the current holder of the note.at emphasis added.cashion argument ignores the court inclusion of the category or any other competent evidence in asserting that liles permits a debtor to demand strict proof in the form of the original note as a mandatory condition precedent before a court can determine status as a holder.any uncertainty remaining after liles was eliminated in dobson,wherein the north carolina court of appeals flatly rejected the same argument now made by cashion that a holder of a note can not prove his status by producing a copy of a promissory note as opposed to the original.at.in dobson,the plaintiff introduced a true and correct copy of the promissory note as well as affidavits from two bank officials stating that the bank was the owner and holder of the note.id.the debtor disputed the accuracy of the copy,but offered no evidence that the photocopy was not a true and correct copy.the north carolina court of appeals noted that u nder similar circumstances it had 
held that where there is no evidence that photocopies of a note or deed of trust are not exact reproductions of the original instruments,a party need not present the original note or deed of trust and may establish that it is the holder of the instruments by presenting photocopies of the note or deed of trust.
id.the debtor bare statement denying the authenticity of the copy and demanding production of the original was insufficient to cast doubt on the bank evidence that it is the holder of the note and does not serve as evidence that the copies are not exact reproductions.id.at.
so,too,cashion demand of strict proof through production of the original note is not sufficient under applicable north carolina law to defeat summary judgment by creating a genuine issue of material fact.like the debtor in dobson,cashion produced no evidence to suggest that the copy of the note in the record was somehow inaccurate,or anything but a true and correct copy.nor did he produce any evidence other than bald speculation and his bare statement that the fdic did not possess the original note.cashion also failed to introduce any facts that question the veracity of sherry martin affidavit,which was based on her personal knowledge of the bank records.see in re foreclosure by david simpson,discussing why an affiant factual statements,so long as they are based on personal knowledge,are competent evidence.in short,cashion came forward with no facts that call into question the fdic evidence establishing that it is the holder of the note.see econo travel motor hotel taylor,s,stating that to create a question of fact challenging this evidence,the debtor would have to come forward with facts,not mere allegations,which controvert the fact set forth in the plaintiff case.the copy of the note,coupled with martin affidavit,is sufficient other competent evidence to prove the fdic status as holder of the note under north carolina law.the district court thus did not err in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the fdic status as holder of the note.
the district court granted the fdic motion to strike the surreply and chapman affidavit.it characterized the fdic arguments regarding the c form as responses and rebuttal s to issues raised in cashion response in opposition to summary judgment,rather than new matters raised for the first time in the reply.as such,it concluded cashion had ample opportunity to present all of his arguments and evidence regarding the c form in his responses to the fdic motion for summary judgment,and could have done so at that time.the court also concluded that chapman affidavit provided interpretations of the c form,but because chapman was not put forward as an expert witness,such testimony was not admissible as it went beyond his personal knowledge.
cashion contends these decisions constituted reversible error given that both the surreply and chapman affidavit address the important matter of showing why the c form was competent evidence.he explains that because the surreply and chapman affidavit were offered to aid,rather than hamper,the decision making process,opening br,and were offered in response to an argument made for the first time in the reply brief that the c form was inadmissible and referred to the collateral for the note,the district court should not have stricken them.
on this record,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion to strike cashion surreply.surreplies are generally not permitted under the local rules of the western district of north carolina,local rule e,and the parties briefing schedule did not authorize filing one.cashion relied on the c form in opposing summary judgment.the fdic reply brief then challenged both the admissibility and weight of this evidence in considering summary judgment.the reply brief therefore did not raise a new legal theory or new evidence,but instead responded to cashion own argument and evidence.that cashion failed to anticipate how the fdic would respond to his reliance on the c form does not automatically entitle him to file a surreply.nor can we discern any other reason that would make the district court decision inequitable.
as to the decision to strike chapman affidavit,federal rule of civil procedure c requires that a n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment must be made on personal knowledge,set out facts that would be admissible in evidence,and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.chapman affidavit gives his lay opinion about the meaning of the c form and challenges martin interpretation of it.cashion has failed to show how that testimony reflects chapman personal knowledge of the c form,nor can he it is speculative and expresses chapman opinion for these reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the surreply and chapman affidavit.
the district court provided three different bases for its conclusion that the c form did not create an issue of material fact as to whether the note had been cancelled or assigned.we need only address one of those grounds in light of our conclusion that it was a proper basis for rejecting cashion position the district court held that a form c does not itself operate to legally discharge a debtor liability,and thus does not,standing alone,raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding cashion liability on the note.the district court held that summary judgment in favor of the fdic was therefore appropriate because the note was not sufficient evidence for a jury to return a verdict in cashion s favor on the issue of whether the note had been cancelled assigned by the bank prior to the institution of this action.
cashion contends here,as he did below,that the c form is prima facie evidence that the note was discharged given that actual discharge is one of the identifiable events that can trigger the requirement to send the irs and debtor copies of the form.cashion points to a handful of state and federal lower court decisions that support his position that the district court erred in holding that the c form does not constitute sufficient evidence of discharge to withstand a motion for summary judgment.under cashion theory of the case,the c form is prima facie evidence of a discharge,and having proffered this prima facie evidence,the burden of persuasion shifted to the fdic to rebut a presumption of cancellation.and,he contends,the fdic can not successfully rebut the presumption in this case because it has disavowed knowledge of actions prior to when the bank entered into receivership.
the fdic responds that the c form did not create a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment in its favor because it is not sufficient evidence alone upon which a jury could find in favor of cashion.citing to the relevant irs regulations,irs statements regarding c forms,various state and federal lower court opinions,and an unpublished opinion from the fifth circuit some of which the district court relied on as well,the fdic contends that the c form did not effectuate a discharge,did not preclude it from seeking to collect the amount owed on the note,and evidenced at most proof of an intent to cancel rather than actual cancellation.accordingly,the fdic asserts the district court did not err in concluding that the c form did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the note had been cancelled or assigned.
the question before us is relatively straightforward did the introduction into evidence of the c form create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the note had been cancelled or assigned.this specific issue is one of first impression not only before this court,but apparently before any federal appellate court through a published opinion.while approximately two dozen state and federal cases discuss the legal significance of a creditor filing a form c with the irs in any analogous context,there is only one relevant federal appellate court opinion,and it is unpublished.see owens commissioner.lexis cir.may,per curiam unpublished.the other opinions,both published and unpublished,are from the united states tax court,bankruptcy courts,united states district courts,and various state trial and appellate courts.as discussed in the parties briefs and observed above,there is no uniformity in how these courts have resolved the central inquiry.
a small minority of the lower courts have held,as cashion urges us to do here,that filing a form c with the irs constitutes prima facie evidence of an intent to discharge a loan,at which point the burden of persuasion shifts to the creditor to proffer evidence that it was filed by mistake or pursuant to another triggering event in the regulations.see,in re welsh,wl,unpublished amtrust bank fossett,franklin credit mgmt.nicholas.these courts have generally noted that because filing a form c has legal significance to the debtor income tax liability,and because the debtor faces penalties or fines for failing to comply with the obligations imposed,it would be inequitable to permit a creditor to collect the debt after having received the benefit of the of the debt from filing the form lastly,some but not all of the courts holding that a filed form c alone is prima facie evidence of discharge have also recognized that the form can satisfy the applicable ucc provisions for when a writing constitutes an intentional voluntary act of discharge,and thus itself effectuates the discharge of the relevant debt.see,franklin credit mgmt,at.
while we can not say that the analysis summarized above lacks any support,we find a different approach taken by a majority of the courts to consider the matter ultimately more persuasive.that analysis relies principally on the language of the irs regulations and the purpose of a form,capital one,massey,case cv,wl,unpublished in re zilka,lifestyles of jasper,gremore.
the internal revenue code irc sets forth certain reporting requirements to the irs,which the irs regulations have implemented through the form c filing requirement 
any applicable entity that discharges an indebtedness of any person must file an information return on form c with the internal revenue service.solely for purposes of the reporting requirements of the applicable statute and this regulation,a discharge of indebtedness is deemed to have occurred if and only if there has occurred an identifiable event described in paragraph b of this section,whether or not an actual discharge of indebtedness has occurred on or before the date on which the identifiable event has occurred.
p a emphasis added.subsection b of p lists eight identifiable events that trigger the reporting obligation.the identifiable events include discharge through the debtor filing for bankruptcy,the expiration of the statute of limitations for collection,discharge by agreement of the parties,a creditor decision to discontinue collection activity and discharge debt,and expiration of the testing period.b i.
tracking the plain language of the regulation,a creditor may be obligated to file a form c even though an actual discharge of indebtedness has not yet occurred or is not contemplated.subsection a.moreover,the identifiable event triggering the obligation may not involve an actual discharge of the debt rather,the event may be deemed to constitute a discharge s olely for purposes of determining the form c reporting obligation.id.and subsection b.
the plain language of the regulation leads us to conclude that filing a form c is a creditor required means of satisfying a reporting obligation to the irs it is not a means of accomplishing an actual discharge of debt,nor is it required only where an actual discharge has already occurred.this understanding of the creditor obligation to file a form c is also clearly expressed in the irs own interpretation of the regulations.two irs information letters issued in october addressed concerns regarding the impact of a creditor compliance with the form c reporting obligation and the continuing liability of a debtor on the subject debt.info,wl,info,wl.in the first,the irs addressed a creditor concern that filing the form c would constitute a written admission that it had discharged the debt and would therefore make debtors unwilling to pay on their obligations.citing subsection a of the regulations discussed above,the irs responded that it does not view a form c as an admission by the creditor that it has discharged the debt and can no longer pursue collection.info.in the second letter,the irs assured a concerned creditor that filing a form c satisfies the reporting requirements of statute and implementing regulations,neither of which prohibit collection activity after a creditor reports by fil
