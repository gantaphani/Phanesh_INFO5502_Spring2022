appellant sage hospitality resources hotel seeks review of a district court order compelling it to submit to arbitration a dispute over the meaning of ambiguous language in the duration clause of a neutrality agreement between the hotel and appellee unite here local union.as the parties agreed to a broad arbitration clause that unambiguously encompasses their dispute,we hold that the issue was properly consigned to the arbitrator for resolution.we therefore affirm.
the hotel and the union entered into a neutrality agreement agreement on june,in anticipation of the renovation of a dilapidated structure in downtown providence into the renaissance providence hotel.the agreement set forth a process allowing the union to organize the hotel employees and to seek recognition as their collective bargaining representative in turn,the union would refrain from engaging in any picketing or economic activity against the hotel.
three provisions of the parties agreement are relevant to this case.first,the agreement established a card check procedure,by which t he union may request recognition as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the hotel employees.second,the agreement provided for binding arbitration of any dispute over its interpretation or application 
the parties agree that any dispute over the interpretation or application of the agreement shall be submitted to expediated sic and binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures below the parties hereto agree to comply with any order of the arbitrator,which shall be final and binding,and furthermore consent to the entry of any order of the arbitrator as the order of judgment of the united states district court for the district of rhode island without entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law.
finally,the duration clause of the agreement stipulated that the agreement shall be in full force and effect from the date it is fully executed until thirty months from the full public opening of the hotel,or if sooner upon the employer recognition of the union.the agreement did not define the term full public opening.
a dispute over the meaning of this term arose on january,when the union requested recognition from the hotel pursuant to the card check procedure.the hotel declined the request,characterizing it as untimely.in the hotel view,the full public opening occurred on june,when it held a ceremony marking the opening of the hotel doors.this event,says the appellant,was preceded by a soft opening in which it had already begun renting out a small number of rooms and holding events.according to the hotel,the agreement expired on december,thirty months after june,and it thus was no longer obligated to participate in the card check procedure.
the union then demanded arbitration over the meaning of the term full public opening,alleging that the full public opening instead occurred on august,when the hotel held a and gala.the hotel rejected the arbitration demand,again relying on untimeliness in arguing that its obligation to honor the arbitration clause of the agreement expired on december,along with the agreement itself.
on january,the union filed in federal court a petition to compel the hotel to submit to arbitration.the union argued that the meaning of the term full public opening was for the arbitrator,who should decide the threshold issue of whether the agreement was in effect,as well as the ultimate issue of the results of the card check procedure.the hotel countered that the court should determine whether an agreement to arbitrate continued to bind the parties.it maintained that the term full public opening did not need to be construed by an arbitrator,because either it was not an ambiguous term or it was tantamount to a date certain.to the extent evidence was needed to determine the date of the full public opening and hence the duration of the agreement,the hotel argued that the court,not an arbitrator,should conduct an evidentiary hearing.
in an opinion and order dated may,may order,the district court granted the union petition.see unite here local sage hospitality,d,hereinafter unite here i.relying primarily on this court holdings in international brotherhood of electrical workers,local freedom wlne tv,cir,and new england cleaning services,services employees international union,local,cir,the district court determined,inter alia,that this case was directly in the path of the rule consigning termination disputes to arbitration if the agreement includes a broad arbitration clause and ordered the parties to arbitration.unite here i,d at see also id.at.
a week later,the union moved to enforce the district court judgment.in response,the hotel filed a motion to stay the court order pending appeal and,in the alternative,for reconsideration.it assayed an argument not previously raised that this circuit law on the arbitrability of termination disputes was implicitly overruled by the supreme court decision in howsam dean witter reynolds,under which the parties dispute,the hotel claimed,would presumptively be for a court to decide.in an order and opinion dated september,september order,the district court granted the union motion to enforce the judgment and denied the hotel motion to stay.see unite here local sage hospitality,d,hereinafter unite here ii.the court granted in part the hotel motion to reconsider by clarif ying certain parts of its may order however,it declined to withdraw any part of that order id.at.
the hotel appeals,asserting that the district court erred in concluding that the question of what full public opening means,and thus whether the agreement was still in effect at the time the union demanded the card check and arbitration,is for the arbitrator,and not the court,to resolve 
the central question here is whether a court or an arbitrator should decide whether the agreement was in effect at the time it was invoked by the union.the union points out that the resolution of that question turns on the meaning of the phrase full public opening as it appears in the duration clause of the agreement.it contends that this is a straightforward issue of contract interpretation,which the agreement arbitration clause and relevant first circuit law assign to the arbitrator.as its main rejoinder,the hotel posits that the parties conflict implicates a question of arbitrability under howsam,and hence is presumptively for a court to decide.to the extent our precedents might require a different outcome,the hotel argues,we should declare them overruled by this subsequent supreme court precedent.
we review a district court order compelling arbitration de novo,bay boston mgmt.unite here,local,cir,and we are not wedded to the lower court rationale,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record,kristian comcast,cir quoting intergen grina,cir.in our review,we focus only on the threshold issue of arbitrability we do not rule on the merits of the underlying claims.at t,commc ns workers.
a.the general legal framework does the dispute fall within the scope of the parties arbitration clause 
it is axiomatic that arbitration is a creature of contract.see united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,u.where there is a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement,a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.granite rock.int l of teamsters,citing first options of chicago,kaplan,at t,at.our focus in this inquiry is to determine and effectuate the parties intent,not to substitute our own preferences.municipality of san juan corporaci贸n para el fomento econ贸mico de la ciudad capital,cir.
here,the parties dispute concerns the interpretation of the duration clause of the agreement.we may only affirm the district court order compelling arbitration if this issue is within the scope of the parties arbitration clause.that clause of the agreement provides that any dispute over the agreement interpretation or application shall be submitted to binding arbitration.the parties did not place any limitations on that language,and certainly did not exclude controversies relating to the duration or termination of the contract.a question as to the meaning of the term full public opening is manifestly a dispute over the agreement interpretation or application.accordingly,by its own phraseology,the arbitration clause applies to the issue in dispute,which was appropriately referred to the arbitrator for resolution.
this result,grounded in the unambiguous language of the parties arbitration clause,also comports with our precedents.inquiring into the scope of similar arbitration clauses,we have concluded that they encompass disputes over the interpretation of duration language.in international brotherhood of electrical workers,local freedom wlne tv,for example,we considered an arbitration clause that covered a ll problems arising out of grievances or out of the application or interpretation of the a greement or the performance of any party under it,and inferred from this broad language the parties agreement to arbitrate any dispute involving construction of the substantive provisions of the contract.id.at.we thus held that the employer was required to submit to arbitration the question of whether its agreement with the union continued in effect beyond its stated expiration date.id.likewise,in municipality of san juan corporaci贸n para el fomento econ贸mico de la ciudad capital,we declared it manifest that the issue of contract duration must be decided by the arbitrator,where the arbitration clause covered any controversy aris ing between the parties with regard to their responsibilities and obligations under this contract.id.at green tree fin.bazzle,plurality opinion suggesting that where parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator a ll disputes,claims,or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract,a dispute about what the arbitration contract means is a dispute relating to this contract and constitutes evidence that the parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator,not a judge,would answer the relevant question.
the appellant acknowledges that the agreement arbitration clause covers a broad range of matters.on appeal,the hotel stakes its hopes on the claim that under the supreme court decision in howsam,its dispute with the union must be considered a question of arbitrability that is presumptively for a court to resolve 
b.the howsam framework does the dispute raise a question of arbitrability 
in howsam,the court observed that a lthough it has long recognized and enforced a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,at quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,it has also carved out an exception to this policy the threshold question of whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration,the question of arbitrability,is an issue for judicial determination u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.howsam,at quoting at t,at first options,at.in other words,questions of arbitrability are subject to a presumption against arbitration and in favor of judicial resolution.this difference in treatment is animated by the principle that a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration and should not be compelled to arbitrate arbitrability unless it committed itself to doing so.first options,at.
but howsam emphasized that question of arbitrability is a term of art with a narrow scope 
the court has found the phrase applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so,and,consequently,where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.
howsam,at.consequently,howsam specified that only certain substantive gateway matters are subject to the presumption,id.at quoting revised unif.arbitration act of cmt,supp,and identified two categories of disputes where that presumption clearly applies disputes about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and disagreements about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy,kristian,at quoting howsam,at see also id.clarifying that e xamples of the former include whether an arbitration contract binds parties that did not sign the agreement,and whether an arbitration agreement survived a corporate merger and bound the subsequent corporation,and examples of the latter include whether a layoff controversy was covered by the arbitration clause of a agreement,and whether a clause providing for arbitration of various grievances covers claims for damages for breach of a agreement.in contrast,procedural questions that grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.howsam,at quoting john wiley sons,livingston,u,internal quotation mark omitted.
in defending against the arbitration demand,the hotel maintains that the dispute between it and the union implicates a substantive question of arbitrability and,as such,should presumptively be for the court to decide.the contrary results required by freedom wlne tv and like cases,the hotel insists,demonstrate that our precedents are inconsistent with the court recent caselaw and should be repudiated the union counters that howsam requires no reconsideration of our law that the parties dispute does not fit into the types of exceptional questions howsam reserves presumptively for the courts and that even if their dispute were to be characterized as a substantive question of arbitrability,the presumption in favor of judicial resolution would nonetheless be overcome by the parties clearly manifested intent to arbitrate a dispute over the interpretation of the duration clause of the agreement.we agree with the union.
the hotel absolutist position that contract expiration issues are necessarily substantive questions of arbitrability proves too much.not all questions of contract duration are alike granite rock.at.emphasizing that it is not the mere labeling of a dispute for contract law purposes,but whether the parties consented to arbitrate the dispute,that determines whether an issue is arbitrable.in this instance,the parties dispute the meaning of language in the duration clause of the agreement a classic issue of contract construction and one the parties clearly contemplated would be resolved by an arbitrator.this type of grievance concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties.green tree,at.indeed,the parties do not contest that the agreement was valid,that they were subject to its requirements,and that the substantive scope of the arbitration clause is clear.the present dispute is therefore not a substantive question of arbitrability but a matter of contract interpretation that should be for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide.id.at.
in any event,even if we were to agree with the hotel that a duration dispute of the type at issue here could be characterized as a question of substantive arbitrability and thus presumptively reserved for judicial determination,the presumption would be overcome by the clear and unmistakable intent of the parties to arbitrate controversies such as the one raised here.see first options,at.the breadth of the arbitration clause,which covers any disputes over the interpretation or application of the agreement,presents an insurmountable impediment to the hotel position.
the parties to this grievance negotiated a broad arbitration clause memorializing their intention to arbitrate all questions of contract construction.whether categorized as an issue of substantive arbitrability or not,the instant dispute over the meaning of language in the duration clause is one that the parties clearly anticipated would be resolved by an arbitrator,not a court.see howsam,at.in these circumstances,we must enforce the bargain the parties struck and allow the arbitrator to decide t
