opinion of the court 
robert fleisher,filed suit against the standard insurance company standard,alleging,inter alia,a violation of a b of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a b.the suit arises out of standard decision to reduce fleisher monthly disability ltd benefits by the amount of the monthly benefits he receives under a separate ltd insurance policy issued to him by the north american company for life and health insurance north american.fleisher disputes standard decision that the north american policy constitutes group insurance coverage,and that the monthly payment he receives under that policy is therefore deductible income under the standard policy.the district court,applying the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review,granted standard motion to dismiss.specifically,it found that standard determination to offset the north american monthly benefit of from standard monthly obligation of is supported by substantial evidence and not unreasonable.fleisher now appeals this decision.for the reasons stated herein,we will affirm the decision of the district court.
during the course of his career as a dentist,fleisher obtained ltd insurance coverage under two separate policies.in july,fleisher obtained coverage under a policy issued by north american north american policy to the american association of endodontics aae,of which fleisher is a member.the north american policy provides for ltd benefits of per month.
in august,fleisher became eligible for ltd insurance coverage under a group policy issued by standard standard policy to his employer,endodontics,endodontics.the ltd coverage offered by fleisher employer is an employee benefit governed by erisa.see shaw delta air lines,d an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa includes any program that provides benefits for contingencies such as illness,accident,disability,death,or unemployment.the standard policy provides for monthly ltd benefits equal to a percentage of the plan participant earnings,which in fleisher case was a maximum of before reduction by deductible income.the policy defines deductible income to include a ny amount you a plan participant receive or are eligible to receive because of your disability under another group insurance coverage.emphasis added.the standard policy excludes from deductible income benefits paid under any individual disability insurance policy.the policy does not define either another group insurance coverage or individual disability insurance policy.
in january,fleisher became disabled and claimed ltd benefits under both the standard and the north american policies.shortly after fleisher began collecting under both policies,standard reduced his monthly benefits from to based on its determination that the north american policy constitutes another group insurance coverage,and that the in benefits he receives under it is therefore deductible income.fleisher filed an administrative appeal of standard decision,arguing that the north american policy qualifies as an individual disability insurance policy,and therefore is not subject to deduction.by letter dated july,standard rejected fleisher appeal and continued making the deduction.
on may,fleisher filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,asserting individual and class claims for wrongful denial of benefits under erisa,along with various state law claims.after standard moved to dismiss the complaint,fleisher filed an amended complaint on september.after standard moved to dismiss the amended complaint,fleisher filed a second amended complaint sac on october,the sac asserts three erisa claims breaches of fiduciary duty count i and contract count iii,both pursuant to a,a,and breach of contract pursuant to a b count ii.the sac seeks restitution for the deductions previously taken as well as injunctive relief to govern future deduction decisions.
standard moved to dismiss the sac pursuant to.b.on may,the district court granted standard motion.the district court initially concluded that the benefits offset determination was governed by the deferential abuse of discretion standard.applying that narrow standard of review,the court held that fleisher could not show that standard decision reflected an unreasonable interpretation or application of the standard policy.the district court recognized that there was a conflict of interest arising from the fact that standard both paid benefits and made the offset decision,and that such a conflict had to be considered in deciding whether standard had abused its discretion.it concluded,however,that standard interpretation of pertinent policy provisions was not so close as to make the conflict of interest a determinative factor.the court also dismissed fleisher a claims for breaches of fiduciary duty and contract,concluding that standard conduct was not improper.

fleisher coverage under the standard policy,an employee welfare benefit plan,is governed by erisa,et.section a b of erisa creates a civil cause of action for a plan participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.to assert a claim under this provision,a plan participant must demonstrate that he or she ha s a right to benefits that is legally enforceable against the plan,and that the plan administrator improperly denied those benefits.hooven exxon mobil,cir.the sac alleges that standard breached its obligations under erisa to fleisher by taking a deduction to which it was not entitled and thus unreasonably failing to pay those benefits in full.
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court held 
a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.
when a plan grants its administrator such discretionary authority,t rust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate,id.at,and we review a denial of benefits under an arbitrary and capricious standard.orvosh program of group ins.for salaried emps.of volkswagen of,cir likewise,when an administrator acts pursuant to her authority to construe the terms of the plan,critzer cbs,cir or to act as a finder of facts,mitchell eastman kodak,cir,abrogated on other grounds as recognized by miller am.airlines,cir,we also apply the arbitrary and capricious standard when reviewing those interpretations and factual findings.

courts defer to an administrator findings of facts when they are supported by substantial evidence,which we have defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.soubik,office of workers comp.programs,cir.when reviewing an administrator factual determinations,we consider only the evidence that was before the administrator when he made the decision being reviewed.mitchell,at.the standard policy vests the administrator with f ull and exclusive authority to control and manage the group policy,to administer claims,and to interpret the group policy and resolve any questions arising in the administration,interpretation,and application of the group policy.this language clearly triggers application of the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review.see abnathya,at,abrogated on other grounds by metro.life ins.glenn,d.
in the district court,fleisher argued that standard decision is not entitled to arbitrary and capricious review,asserting that this deferential standard only applies to an administrator interpretation of documents that are part of the plan itself.because standard deduction decision was based in part on its finding that the north american policy a document constituted group insurance coverage,fleisher reasoned that de novo review is appropriate.
we rejected a similar argument in mitchell,in which a plan administrator denied mitchell claim for benefits based on a factual finding about his eligibility,rather than on an interpretation of the terms of the plan.at.the plan vested the administrator with full discretionary authority to determine all questions arising in the administration,interpretation and application of the plan.id.we held that this broad grant of discretionary authority to the administrator to apply the plan must encompass the resolution of factual disputes,because such determinations of eligibility for ltd benefits are certainly one of the questions arising in the administration,interpretation and application of the plan.id.at.
the district court relied on our reasoning in mitchell in rejecting fleisher argument for de novo review.the court found that the standard policy grants the administrator discretionary authority over application of the policy,which includes the authority to interpret the plan and make findings of fact necessary to determine eligibility.accordingly,the court reviewed standard deduction decision including its interpretation and characterization of the north american policy under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
fleisher apparently reasserts his challenges to this deferential standard now,declaring on appeal,this court reviews the plan administrator denial of benefits by applying the standard of review the district court should have used initially.appellant br.at,citing mitchell,at dewitt penn del directory,cir.fleisher,however,offers no further argument to support this apparent challenge,and we discern no error with the district court determination that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies here.we will therefore apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to standard denial of benefits,including its determination about the north american policy 
the standard policy permits it to reduce fleisher monthly ltd benefits by any amount paid or payable under another group insurance coverage.at issue here is the meaning of group insurance and whether standard reasonably determined that the north american policy falls within the meaning of this term.in this regard,standard determination involved both an interpretation of group insurance and a factual determination about the north american policy.
the district court recognized,and the parties do not dispute,that the term group insurance is ambiguous.the court consulted various insurance law treatises and found that insurers use the term group insurance to refer to at least two subsets of collective insurance products,including true group insurance and franchise insurance.the court explained a basic difference between the two 
group insurance is an arrangement by which a single insurance policy is issued to a central entity commonly an employer,association,or union for coverage of the individual members of the group.franchise insurance is a variation on group insurance,in which all members of the group receive individual policies.
quoting couch on insurance ed.
the district court also identified other distinguishing features of the two types of group policies.under true group insurance policies,the certificate holder is typically an employee of the master policy holder,all members or employees are automatically enrolled,and the master policy holder works directly with the insurer and is responsible for paying premiums,notifying the insurer about changes concerning which persons are covered at a given time,and submitting members claims,citing appleman on insurance law practice,ed.appleman.
franchise insurance is also issued through a group which holds the master policy that provides for the general terms.while the master policy holder and insurer may negotiate with the insurer to modify or terminate the plan,in all other respects the relationship between members and the insurer is precisely that of an insurer dealing directly with its policyholders,quoting appleman.as the district court explained 
f ranchise insurance generally has the following characteristics members of the relevant association or entity may enroll in the plan but are not required to do so members pay premiums directly to the insurer members make claims directly to the insurer and insurers agree to waive underwriting,and take all applicants across the board.
quoting appleman.
therefore,a lthough true group insurance and franchise insurance are distinct products,the district court found that,lawyers,legal writers,publishers,and the courts can refer to them individually and collectively as group insurance,citing holmes appleman on insurance ed.on this basis,the court concluded that the term group insurance is ambiguous because it may reasonably refer to at least two different types of collective insurance products.
our dissenting colleague,relying upon general principles of contract law,dissenting op.at,suggests that we should apply the principle that ambiguous terms in an insurance policy must be construed most strongly against the insurance company that drafted it.id.at.he vigorously asserts that our review must be informed both by such general principles of contract law and by erisa purposes as manifested in its specific provisions.id.at,quoting burstein retirement account plan for emp.of allegheny health educ.research,cir emphasis added by judge garth internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the dissent argues that the result here is inequitable because the standard policy to which fleisher subscribed at no time alerted him to its deductible provisions,nor did standard offer an interpretation of those provisions so that a layperson such as fleisher could assess the protection that he was seeking.id.at.
with all due respect to our dissenting colleague,we think that he misapprehends the nature of the abuse of discretion standard of review.notably,the case he cites for applying general principles of contract law to interpret erisa plan terms,burstein,did not involve review of a benefits determination under an abuse of discretion standard,but instead concerned a conflict between a summary plan description and the plan document itself.and while we have applied the doctrine of contra proferentem in the context of erisa claims,we have done so only to decide whether the plan documents confer discretionary authority on the plan administrator so as to trigger deferential review,a decision we make under a plenary standard of review.see,heasley belden blake,cir.where,however,the abuse of discretion standard applies,we have made clear that we must defer to the plan administrator interpretation of ambiguous plan terms unless that interpretation is arbitrary or capricious.see mcelroy at because the language of the plan is equivocal,the plan administrator was authorized to interpret it,and we must defer to this interpretation unless it is arbitrary or capricious.
the dissent application of the contra proferentem doctrine would supplant deference to an administrator reasonable interpretations of ambiguous terms with a presumption that such an interpretation is unreasonable.in addition to undermining the established deferential standard,contrary to supreme court authority,such an approach also eviscerates the provision of the standard policy which granted the administrator discretion in the first place.indeed,the administrator can hardly be said to exercise discretion if her interpretations of the policy terms is burdened by a presumption against the insurer.
notably,every court of appeals to have addressed the issue has concluded that a court reviewing a benefits decision for abuse of discretion can not apply the principle that ambiguous plan terms are construed against the party that drafted the plan.see,d h therapy,llc boston mut.life ins,cir we have emphasized that our review of whether a plan administrator abused its discretion does not require that we determine either the best reading of the erisa plan or how we would read the plan de novo.we have also noted that the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply to review of an erisa plan construction advanced by an administrator given authority to construe the plan.citations omitted marrs motorola,cir a lthough,generally,ambiguities in an insurance policy are construed in favor of an insured,in the erisa context in which a plan administrator has been empowered to interpret the terms of the plan,this rule does not obtain.citation and quotation marks omitted carden aetna life ins,cir white coca cola,cir lennon metro.life ins,cir kimber thiokol,cir winters costco wholesale,cir pagan nynex pension plan,cir a pplication of the rule of contra proferentum is limited to those occasions in which this court reviews an erisa plan de novo.district courts in our circuit also have recognized that the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply where,as here,judicial review is constrained by the abuse of discretion standard.see,brown first reliance standard life ins,wl,at,doe hartford life accident ins,wl,at.
the dissenting opinion reads as if we were interpreting an ambiguous term in an insurance policy under a de novo standard of review.it alludes to notions of contracts of adhesion and reasonable expectations of the insured that populate cases interpreting insurance policies in the first instance.those concepts are simply not applicable where,as here,the erisa plan document makes the plan administrator the competent authority to interpret ambiguous plan provisions in the first instance.see kimber,at t he reasonable expectation doctrine is inapplicable to the review of an erisa disability benefits plan under the arbitrary and capricious standard.as judge cudahy explained in morton smith,cir 
courts invoke the contra proferentem rule when they have the authority to construe the terms of a plan,but this authority arises only when the administrators of the plan lack the discretion to construe it themselves when the administrators of a plan have discretionary authority to construe the plan,they have the discretion to determine the intended meaning of the plan terms.in making a deferential review of such determinations,courts have no occasion to employ the rule of contra proferentem.deferential review does not involve a construction of the terms of the plan it involves a more abstract inquiry the construction of someone else construction.

ultimately,we think judge garth is mistaken inasmuch as he implies that fleisher has somehow been the victim of a contract of adhesion,or that he was otherwise misled by standard.although the standard policy did not define the terms group insurance or individual insurance or reference the term franchise insurance,it reposed in the administrator the authority to interpret ambiguous terms.thus,we are not concerned that plan participants like fleisher or,as judge garth suggests,sophisticated plan participants like the judges on this panel are misled by insurance policies such as standard.since the standard policy vested the administrator with discretion to interpret the policy,under our case law we have no option but to uphold this interpretation unless it is arbitrary or capricious.as our dissenting colleague observed in another erisa case,a court must actually apply the correct standard of review mere lipservice and mere citation to a standard of review will not suffice.lasser reliance standard life ins,cir garth,dissenting.in this case,application of the deferential standard of review precludes reliance upon the general principles of contract law on which the dissent rests.whether we would reach a different interpretation under de novo review is therefore irrelevant.
having established that group insurance is ambiguous and that the standard administrator is authorized to interpret it,the district court evaluated the features of the north american policy to determine whether standard could reasonably interpret it as a type of group insurance coverage.the court observed several features of the north american policy consistent with franchise insurance,including that the policy was issued through a group,the aae,whose members could individually apply for coverage,and that the members otherwise interacted directly with the north american regarding coverage and premiums.the court also noted that the certificate,which fleisher attaches to the complaint,clearly states that it is issued pursuant and subject to group policy pg,which is held by aae,and that fleisher obtained the certificate as a member of the aae.the court acknowledged fleisher argument that the policy bears certain features characteristic of individual insurance policies,but concluded that the policy can nonetheless be reasonably characterized as a franchise policy.on this basis,the court dismissed fleisher a b claim.
fleisher challenges this conclusion on appeal,urging that standard determination is unreasonable because it is based on a factual finding that the north american policy is franchise insurance that is not supported by the evidence.instead,fleisher contends that the evidence supports the conclusion that the policy is an individual disability insurance policy with all the characteristics of an individual disability insurance policy and none of the characteristics of a group insurance policy.appellant br.at.
first,fleisher notes that unlike franchise insurance,where insurers agree to waive underwriting,and take all applicants across the board,the north american policy was subject to individual underwriting.appellant br.at.in this respect,he cites portions of the sac that allege that he was required to complete a medical questionnaire as part of his application for the north american policy,and that the application itself indicates that north american ordered a retail credit report,and stated that the underwriting procedure may entail an investigative consumer report.id.at.
the district court did not suggest nor do any of the treatises it cited indicate that waiver of underwriting is a sine qua non of franchise insurance.rather,the court listed waiver of underwriting as one of four characteristics that franchise insurance generally has.moreover,the relevant inquiry is whether standard interpretation is supported by substantial evidence,which does not require that the evidence uniformly supports its conclusion,but merely requires such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.soubik,at.the district court correctly found that standard interpretation is supported by substantial evidence,including that the north american policy possesses the other general features of franchise insurance,that it was issued to fleisher through his membership in a group,and that it states that it is a group policy.thus,the fact that the north american policy lacks one feature of franchise insurance does not outweigh the other evidence in support of standard interpretation.
