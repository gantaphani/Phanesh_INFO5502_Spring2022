local of the service employees international union challenges the decision of the district court vacating an arbitration award in its favor.because the arbitrator was acting within the scope of his authority in resolving this dispute,because the company has not charged the arbitrator with fraud or dishonesty in making the award,because the arbitrator was arguably construing the contract when he awarded union employees a increase for and because the company has shown no more than that the arbitrator made an error,perhaps even a serious error,in interpreting the contract,we reverse and direct the district court to enter an order enforcing the award.see united paperworkers int l union,misco,d.
michigan family resources mfr runs the federal headstart program that serves kent county,which lies in western michigan.local of the service employees international union represents some of mfr employees.on behalf of its members,the union negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with mfr that entitled its members to annual wage increases.the agreement contains four pertinent provisions.
article of the agreement provides 
bargaining unit members will receive the same cost of living increases paid to other mfr employees pursuant to the directive of mfr funding source.the parties understand that the timing and amount of any such increase is entirely dictated by the funding source.
ja.the funding source mentioned in this provision,the parties agree,refers to the federal government.
article provides 
during the fall semester of each program year,bargaining unit members will be reviewed and will be considered for a merit increase mfr will guarantee at least that for each bargaining unit employee the sum of any cola,increase paid during the year and the merit increase will be as follows.for example,if the increase for is,effective on september,bargaining unit members will receive at least an additional.
article provides an exclusive method of resolving disputes arising under the agreement and requires the parties to arbitrate any grievances that they can not resolve on their own.the arbitrator,it says,shall have full authority to render a decision which shall be final and binding upon both parties and the employees,except that the arbitrator shall not have authority to change,alter,amend,or deviate from the terms of this collective bargaining agreement in any respect.article c.the provision also says that i f the union requests arbitration,the parties shall choose an arbitrator by selecting from the following list through the alternating strike method mario chiesa,mark glazer,william daniel,george roumell and lamont stallworth.id.
article provides that the agreement expresses the understanding of the parties and it will not be changed,modified,or varied,except by written instrument signed by duly authorized agents of the party thereto,and that t here are no past practices which are binding upon the parties.ja.
in may,mfr notified the union employees that they would receive a increase for from the funding source,the federal government,from employees would receive a increase for the year.although the pay increase for union employees satisfied the collective bargaining agreement minimum requirement for that year,the union claimed that the agreement required parity between union and employees in the payment of increases.the union,as a result,filed a grievance against mfr.in accordance with the agreement,the parties engaged one of the designated arbitrators to resolve the dispute.
on december,the arbitrator issued a opinion resolving the dispute in favor of the union.the question,as he saw it,was whether article requires mfr to provide parity in payments for its union employees when employees receive higher payments.arb.op.at.on this point,the arbitrator reasoned,article was not entirely clear.while it required union members to receive the same payments from the federal funding source as other employees,it did not directly address the cost of living increases from other sources,such as from the employer.id.at.the arbitrator then noted that before and after the adoption of the collective bargaining agreement,mfr granted the same increase to all employees,regardless of union affiliation.id.at.mfr never held merit reviews,he added,and in a memo dealing with pay increases for the first year of the collective bargaining agreement it characterized the entire wage increase to union employees as a increase.i am persuaded,the arbitrator then concluded,that article becomes ambiguous because of the employer prior decision to characterize both its individual payment and its payment from the federal funding source as cost of living.id.in the end he resolved this ambiguity based on the employer prior practice of granting identical increases to all employees and awarded union members an equivalent increase.
on january,invoking of the labor management relations act,mfr filed a complaint in federal court seeking to vacate the award.on november,d,the district court granted mfr motion for summary judgment,holding that the arbitrator award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement because the arbitrator considered evidence to aid in construing the collective bargaining agreement when,in fact,no construction was necessary.d at.t he arbitrator,the court concluded,went beyond the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement by imposing additional requirements upon the parties and considering past practices,which are specifically disclaimed by the collective bargaining agreement waiver provision.id.
a panel of this court affirmed.family,serv.employees int l union local,cir,and applied this court test for assessing arbitration awards in doing so,see cement,gypsum united steelworkers of america,local,cir.the union petitioned for and we granted en banc review.see.lexis cir.may.
in,the supreme court issued three decisions designed to end the federal courts hostility to awards.in one of those decisions,united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d,the court held that while federal courts,not arbitrators,should determine whether a collective bargaining agreement requires a dispute to be resolved through arbitration,d oubts should be resolved in favor of coverage,and a n order to arbitrate should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.id.at.in another decision,united steelworkers american manufacturing,d,the court held that if the collective bargaining agreement provided that a dispute should be submitted to arbitration,the underlying question of contract interpretation is for the arbitrator,even though the claim in the court eyes appears to be a frivolous one.id.at.the courts,it pointed out,have no business weighing the merits of the grievance,considering whether there is equity in a particular claim,or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.id.
in the final case,the one most pertinent here,united steelworkers enterprise wheel car,d,the court considered the role of the federal courts in enforcing arbitration awards.the refusal of courts to review the merits of an arbitration award,it began,is the proper approach to arbitration under collective bargaining agreements because t he federal policy of settling labor disputes by arbitration would be undermined if courts had the final say on the merits of the awards.id.at.observing that the court of appeals refusal to enforce the award in that case was not based upon any finding that the arbitrator did not premise his award on his construction of the contract,but was based merely on disagree ment with the arbitrator construction of it,the court reversed.id.at.the company primary argument in favor of declining to enforce the award,the court explained,was that by applying correct principles of law to the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement it can be determined that the agreement did not provide for this kind of award,and that therefore the arbitrator decision was not based upon the contract.id.yet that approach,the court countered,would require courts,even under the standard arbitration clause,to review the merits of every construction of the contract and would make meaningless the provisions that the arbitrator decision is final because it never would be.id.at.s o far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.id.at.only when an arbitrator declines to confine himself to interpretation and application of the agreement and instead opts to dispense his own brand of industrial justice may the courts refuse to enforce an award.id.at.thus while the arbitrator may look for guidance from many sources in construing the agreement,his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.id.
in the years after what came to be known as the steelworkers trilogy,our court refereed numerous disputes over what it means for an award to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.attempting to summarize those decisions,we eventually announced a inquiry for determining whether to enforce an arbitration award.an award fails to draw its essence from the agreement,we stated,when it conflicts with express terms of the collective bargaining agreement it imposes additional requirements that are not expressly provided in the agreement it is without rational support or can not be rationally derived from the terms of the agreement and it is based on general considerations of fairness and equity instead of the precise terms of the agreement.cement,gypsum united steelworkers,local,cir citations omitted.if a dissatisfied party to an arbitration satisfied any one of these tests,we held,the court should not enforce the award.see wyandot,local,united food commercial workers union,cir.
during the years since cement divisions,the supreme court has refined the standard of review in this area in two cases,both of which suggest that cement divisions gives federal courts more latitude to review the merits of an arbitration award than the supreme court permits.in,just one year after cement divisions,the court considered when a federal court may refuse to enforce an arbitration award rendered under a agreement in united paperworkers int l union,misco,d.elaborating on the steelworkers trilogy,misco reminded litigants that the courts have a limited role when the losing party to an arbitration seeks judicial intervention.id.at.the federal courts retain authority to ensure that the arbitration award grows out of a legitimate process that the collective bargaining agreement commits the dispute at hand to arbitration,id.at.requiring the arbitrator to act within the scope of his authority that the prevailing party did not procure the decision through fraud,that the arbitrator did not suffer from a conflict of interest or exercise dishonesty in reaching his decision,and that the arbitration award did not merely reflect the arbitrator own notions of industrial justice,id.
otherwise,misco explained,t he courts are not authorized to reconsider the merits of an award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.id.at.because the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge,it is the arbitrator view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.id.at.in attempting to clarify the line between an award that permissibly draws its essence from the contract and one that impermissibly reflect s the arbitrator own notions of industrial justice,the court gave this guidance a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.id.at.consistent with this frame of reference,the court upheld the award in that case because the arbitrator arguably was construing and applying the contract and because the decision involved at worst improvident,even silly,decisionmaking.id.at.
major league baseball players ass garvey,d,reinforced the federal courts modest role in this area.in summarily reversing a court of appeals decision,the court explained that the federal courts review of decisions is not just limited,misco,at.it is very limited,garvey,at.rather than asking whether the arbitration award draws its essence from the contract,the court asked whether the arbitrator was even arguably construing or applying the contract.id.at.quoting misco,at.o nly when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application,the court explained,does he enter the forbidden world of effectively dispens ing his own brand of industrial justice,making the arbitrator decision unenforceable.id.at.quoting enterprise wheel,at.but when an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract,and no dishonesty is alleged,the arbitrator improvident,even silly,factfinding does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award.id.quoting misco,at.
misco and garvey refine the steelworkers trilogy in two ways.one,they define the line between a permissible award that draws its essence from the contract and an impermissible award that simply reflect s the arbitrator own notion of industrial justice based on whether the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.misco,at.see garvey,at.two,misco and garvey show that the court means what it is saying.in both cases,the court held that once it was established that the arbitrator was construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,it made no difference whether the arbitrator had committed serious,improvident or even silly errors in resolving the merits of the dispute.misco,at.garvey,at.
our decision in cement divisions of course does not reflect these refinements of the steelworkers trilogy because the court had no reason to know they existed.accordingly,instead of continuing to apply cement divisions inquiry,a test we now overrule,we will consider the questions of procedural aberration that misco and garvey identify.misco,at.did the arbitrator act outside his authority by resolving a dispute not committed to arbitration did the arbitrator commit fraud,have a conflict of interest or otherwise act dishonestly in issuing the award and in resolving any legal or factual disputes in the case,was the arbitrator arguably construing or applying the contract so long as the arbitrator does not offend any of these requirements,the request for judicial intervention should be resisted even though the arbitrator made serious,improvident or silly errors in resolving the merits of the dispute.
these relatively straightforward inquiries,we acknowledge,mask a harder question what role,if any,still remains for a court to consider the arbitrator resolution of the merits in determining whether he was arguably construing the contract the union,supported by the national,argues that the court view of the merits has nothing to do with this question.so long as the arbitrator purported to construe the contract,that is the end of the matter.mfr argues by contrast that federal courts always must consider the merits of a dispute to determine whether the arbitrator was arguably construing the contract.
we respectfully disagree with both of them.the court repeated insistence that the federal courts must tolerate serious arbitral errors suggests that judicial consideration of the merits of a dispute is the rare exception,not the rule.at the same time,we can not ignore the specter that an arbitration decision could be so ignor ant of the contract plain language,misco,at,as to make implausible any contention that the arbitrator was construing the contract.an interpretation of a contract thus could be so untethered to the terms of the agreement,to borrow a phrase from our circuit justice,garvey,at.stevens,dissenting,that it would cast doubt on whether the arbitrator indeed was engaged in interpretation.such an exception of course is reserved for the rare case.for in most cases,it will suffice to enforce the award that the arbitrator appeared to be engaged in interpretation,and if there is doubt we will presume that the arbitrator was doing just that.warrior gulf,at.an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
this view of the arguably construing inquiry no doubt will permit only the most egregious awards to be vacated.but it is a view that respects the parties decision to hire their own judge to resolve their disputes,a view that respects the finality clause in most arbitration agreements,see ja stating that the arbitrator shall have full authority to render a decision which shall be final and binding upon both parties,and a view whose imperfections can be remedied by selecting better arbitrators.
gauged by these modest requirements,the arbitrator award in this case must be enforced.nothing in the record,nothing the parties have told us,suggests that fraud,a conflict of interest or dishonesty infected the arbitrator decision or the arbitral process.and no one disputes that the collective bargaining agreement committed this grievance to arbitration or disputes that this arbitrator was one of the five arbitrators selected by the parties to be eligible to resolve this dispute.the arbitrator,in short,was acting within the scope of his authority.
that leaves the question whether the arbitrator was engaged in interpretation was he arguably construing the collective bargaining agreement the arbitrator opinion has all the hallmarks of interpretation.he refers to,quotes from and analyzes the pertinent provisions of the agreement,and at no point does he say anything indicating that he was doing anything other than trying to reach a interpretation of the contract.
neither can it be said that the arbitrator decision on the merits was so untethered from the agreement that it casts doubt on whether he was engaged in interpretation,as opposed to the implementation of his own brand of industrial justice.when it comes to parity between union and issue before the agreement is clear in one respect but silent in another.on the one side of the ledger,article of the agreement says that increases must be distributed equally,providing that b argaining unit members will receive the same cost of living increases paid to other mfr employees pursuant to the directive of mfr funding source.ja.whatever increase mfr funding source namely,the federal government provides in a given year,then,that funding must be allocated equally in terms of percentage salary increases to union and members alike.on the other side of the ledger,article says nothing about parity when it comes to increases.viewed from the vantage point of article,the agreement is silent about whether parity must exist between union and increases funded by the employer.
other provisions of the agreement do not eliminate this ambiguity.article addresses merit increases and says that bargaining unit members will be reviewed and will be considered for a merit increase each year.but this sentence says nothing about increases,and mfr premised its salary increases on changes to the cost of living.
article also guarantee s each union employee a minimum salary increase for each of the three years of the agreement,so that the sum of any cola,increase paid during the year and the merit increase will be as follows.for example,if the increase for is,effective on september,bargaining unit members will receive at least an additional.ja.but by setting a floor for salary increases to union employees during these three years,the agreement did not impose a ceiling on those increases.the agreement thus is silent about increases over the floor for union employees and about whether increases over the floor should be given to union and employees on an equivalent basis.
in the face of this contractual silence,the arbitrator did what all adjudicators do under these circumstances looked for other indicators of meaning.in attempting to resolve this ambiguity,he had at least three paths open to him.in the first place,he could have noted that the agreement is utterly silent about whether there must be parity in increases,then drawn an inference from the employer application of the agreement during its first year.because mfr had awarded equal increases in,the arbitrator could have drawn the inference that the parties application of the agreement reflected their understanding of it.this approach would not have violated article instruction that t here are no past practices which are binding upon the parties,ja emphasis added,and indeed article prohibition only on using past practices to bind the parties also might well have permitted the arbitrator to draw an inference from the fact that the employer practice before this collective bargaining agreement had been the give equal adjustments.
instead of relying on this inference,the arbitrator took a different tack.he determined that the above language article mandate that b argaining unit members will receive the same cost of living increases paid to other mfr employees pursuant to the directive of mfr funding source,id.becomes ambiguous because of the employer prior decision to characterize both its individual payment and its payment from the federal funding source as cost of living.arb.op.at emphasis added.in other words,because the employer traditionally gave federally funded and its own increases,the arbitrator took the same cost of living increases language in article to require parity for all such increases.this train of reasoning,however,contains two serious flaws.later language in this sentence pursuant to the directive of mfr funding source shows that the provision refers only to parity for federally funded increases.and the clear meaning of this sentence does not become ambiguous based on a party interpretation of it.
whether the becomes ambiguous phrase was a slip of the pen or a slip in thought,it bears emphasizing that it was still the above language the contract he was trying to figure out.and the fact remains that the agreement was utterly silent,and thus already ambiguous,on the point at hand did the contract tell mfr whether there should be parity in increases that ambiguity permitted,indeed required,the arbitrator to engage in construction of the agreement,which is all we are asked to determine.that he chose the wrong path in justifying the award,however,does not give us a warrant to vacate it.if it is true that appellate courts generally review judgments,not opinions while performing de novo review,chevron usa res.def.council,d,it is assuredly true that we review outcomes,not opinions,while performing the exceedingly deferential task of considering whether to vacate an arbitration award.add to this the fact that arbitrators in this area may be,and frequently are,and therefore hardly inculcated in all of the nuances of contract interpretation,that arbitrators have no obligation to issue a written decision to justify their awards,see enterprise wheel,at,and that vacating awards based on flawed chains of reasoning may well encourage arbitrators to play it safe by writing no supporting opinions,and it becomes clear that this award should be enforced.
through all of this,it needs to be emphasized,we do not endorse either of the above paths of the one the arbitrator took or the one he could have taken.for our part,the better course for the arbitrator would have been to say that the agreement explicit parity requirements for,increases implied that the parties did not mean to create other parity requirements.and indeed had a district court in a diversity case faced this question,we might well have demanded that answer in conducting plenary review of the issue.but that of course is not the point.that the deciphering of this contract required implications and inferences suffices by itself to show that the arbitrator was permissibly engaged in interpretation.the arbitrator,it is true,made a legal error,perhaps even a serious legal error,but an error of interpretation nonetheless,which does not authorize us to vacate the award.it was the arbitrator construction,not three layers of federal judicial review,that the parties bargained for,and that delegation of authority must be respected even when time and further review show that the parties in the end have bargained for nothing more than error.
mfr persists that if the arbitrator erred,then he must have exceeded his authority because article c of the collective bargaining agreement says that the arbitrator shall not have authority to change,alter,amend,or deviate from the terms of this collective bargaining agreement in any respect.not so.an arbitrator does not exceed his authority every time he makes an interpretive error he exceeds that authority only when the collective bargaining agreement does not commit the dispute to arbitration.otherwise,every error would be grounds for judicial intervention,which is inconsistent with the supreme court insistence that we must tolerate serious,improvident and silly legal and factual arbitral errors and which is inconsistent with another provision of this collective bargaining agreement and most collective bargaining agreements that the arbitrator shall have full authority to render a decision which shall be final and binding upon both parties.no decision would be final,to say nothing of speedy,misco,at,if the losing party needed only to allege an interpretive error to invoke the intervention of the federal courts.true,no arbitration agreement and certainly not this one explicitly gives the arbitrator jurisdiction to misapprehend the agreement,and neither for that matter does title of the united states code explicitly give appellate courts jurisdiction to affirm legal errors.but that is the import of having a finality clause in an arbitration agreement,the import of the supreme court decisions in this area over the last years and,so far as our jurisdiction is concerned,the import of asking fallible human beings to make final sense of imperfectly worded documents.in the last analysis,we have an arbitrator who plainly was arguably construing the contract and who perhaps just as plainly made a serious error in construing the contract,a confluence of circumstances that does not invest us with authority to overturn the decision.garvey,at.the award must be enforced.
for these reasons we reverse and remand the case so that the district court may enter an order enforcing the arbitration award.
my dissent is a narrow one i agree with the majority in principle,but not in application.as to principle,i agree with the majority conclusion that this court cement divisions test be dropped.see op.at.the cement divisions inquiry has allowed this court too much latitude to review the merits of arbitrator interpretations of collective bargaining agreements,in contravention of the dictates of the supreme court steelworkers trilogy as clarified in misco and,to a lesser extent,garvey.cement divisions should consequently be replaced by a test more reflective of misco and garvey,something to the tune of as long as the arbitrator is arguably construing the contract or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,this court will not overturn his decision.
of course,simply replacing this court test with that of the supreme court does not advance matters much,especially since the supreme court has provided us with only two cases for guidance.see garvey,at.noting that the supreme court cases do not provide significant guidance as to what standards a federal court should use in assessing whether an arbitrator behavior is so untethered to either the agreement of the parties or the factual record so as to constitute an attempt to dispense his own brand of industrial justice stevens,dissenting.to be fair,the majority appears to replace cement divisions with an inquiry that looks only for procedural aberration committed by the arbitrator,not for legal error.op.at.the majority then posits a series of hypotheticals to indicate when such procedural aberrations might have occurred.this is an admirable start,especially since the majority writes from a clean slate.but the contours of procedural aberration or,if one prefers,when an arbitrator is not arguably construing or applying the collective bargaining agreement,and acting within the scope of his authority can only be defined as we apply this new test to new,discrete cases.after all,t he glory of the system of adjudication is that general principles are tested in the crucible of concrete controversies.a court can not be assumed to address and resolve in the case in which it first lays down a rule every controversy within the semantic reach of the rule.malhotra cotter,cir.misco was a relatively easy case,because the appeals court there applied vague notions of public policy to overturn the arbitrator decision.garvey was also easier than the case we review now,because in garvey the appeals court attempted to substitute its own credibility determination a factual finding for that of the arbitrator.here,however,we deal with an arbitrator decision that a term of the collective bargaining agreement becomes ambiguous.this is completely because it implies that the term was unambiguous to begin with.
thus i turn to the application of the majority new standard.arbitrator glazer began his analysis by quoting the relevant pay raise parity language in article of the collective bargaining agreement bargaining unit members will receive the same cost of living cola increases paid to other mfr employees pursuant to the directive of mfr funding source.arb.op.at.as the majority correctly points out,the plain meaning of this parity provision does not jump off the page.because mfr funding source is the federal government,article clearly requires parity as to increases.but article says little about parity as to increases,the key issue here.had glazer found that the article parity clause was inherently ambiguous,then there is some merit to the majority argument that this finding,even if erroneous,is unreviewable inasmuch as it represents an arbitrator attempt to arguably construe the collective bargaining agreement.but glazer ruled,instead,that article becomes ambiguous because of mfr prior decision to characterize both its employer payment and its payment from the federal funding source as cola.arb.op.at.this is where glazer opinion is woefully flawed.
first,to say that a clause becomes ambiguous makes little sense in the realm of contract interpretation,because it implies that the clause was un ambiguous to begin with.and if that were the case,then glazer would have no business bringing in extrinsic evidence to construe it.the majority views glazer use of the phrase becomes ambiguous as either a slip of the pen or a slip of thought.op.at.this may or may not be true,but i am less willing than the majority to give the arbitrator the benefit of the doubt.the majority opines that either way,glazer was faced with contractual silence,and thus it was proper for him to look for other indicators of meaning.op.at.another plausible reading of glazer opinion,however,is that he or article plain language as unambiguous,and then went beyond the scope of his authority in subsequently rendering it ambiguous.
furthermore,even if the majority is correct that glazer was faced with contractual silence,that does not automatically mean his subsequent interpretation of this silence must evade our review.in this case,increases from sources other than the funding source here,the federal simply not provided for by the collective bargaining agreement,and so it is not at all clear why union employees should have a right to such a benefit in the absence of express language creating that benefit in the agreement itself.in other words,article does not require further construction as to increases from sources.to say that glazer was arguably construing something that requires no further construction is to say that glazer was acting beyond the scope of his authority as an arbitrator.contractual silence does not always equal co
