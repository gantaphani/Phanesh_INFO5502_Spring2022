fidelity international currency advisor a fund fidelity seeks review of a district court judgment resolving a controversy between fidelity and the internal revenue service irs.in substance,the district court sustained irs adjustments to fidelity partnership returns for the two tax years at issue and upheld a percent penalty for tax underpayment.fid.int l currency advisor a fund,llc united states,d.
the litigation arises out of the following events.richard egan was the founder of emc corporation,a manufacturer of computer storage devices,and in the early years of this ultimately successful business,egan received options to acquire emc stock.when he exercised those options in,they generated million of ordinary income for him and his wife it was estimated this could create a tax liability of over million.
prior to exercising the options,egan met with various accounting and law firms to discuss methods of reducing the potential tax liability.ultimately,the plan adopted and put into effect required egan to form a partnership with a foreign national that partnership would engage in transactions that would generate largely offsetting gains and losses without net risk the gain component would be principally allocated to the foreign national the loss component would be principally allocated to egan and used on his individual return to offset gains on his exercise of the emc stock options,virtually eliminating tax on those gains.
to this end,in july egan formed fidelity as a limited liability company federally taxed as a partnership.egan was one partner the other principal partner was samuel mahoney,who was an irish citizen.common shares were initially assigned percent to mahoney and percent to egan egan contributed million in cash and certain interest rate options valued at million,and mahoney contributed in cash.
then,in october,fidelity entered into a set of transactions whereby it purchased and sold options,related to foreign currency exchange rates and configured in pairs the terms set for each pair as to premium,strike price,maturity dates,and possible payout assured that a loss on one option in a pair would be offset by a corresponding gain on the other.in substance,the transaction would provide virtually no opportunity for a net gain but also no risk of a net loss 
one week later,fidelity terminated four of the options that had gained in value due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.the offsetting options in the pairs,correspondingly reduced in value,were not terminated.instead,the proceeds from the terminated options were used to purchase replacement options that would ensure that the eventual losses taken by the partnership when it terminated the original options that had lost value and the replacement options would offset the gains initially realized.
this generated net taxable gains on fidelity books of about million from the options that had been terminated.but under the tax laws fidelity pays no taxes rather its gains and losses are assigned to the partners in accordance with their ownership shares in the partnership and taxed to the partners on their own returns.because of the and percent share allocation,egan was assigned million net gain and mahoney million net gain.
then,a week later,in early november,egan bought percent of the common partnership interest from mahoney for and so owned percent with mahoney being reduced to percent.a month later,in early december,fidelity terminated the four remaining original foreign currency options as well as the replacement options acquired immediately after the october termination.not surprisingly in light of the design of the option pairs,the december loss million only modestly exceeded the original gain.
fidelity now allocated the million loss in proportion to the reallocated ownership shares egan was allocated million in loss and mahoney million.the net economic loss to the partnership from all the offsetting foreign currency options was just over half a million dollars advisory fees brought the total cost to million a cost dwarfed by the potential tax benefits for egan.
the gains and losses from the currency option transactions were reported on the partnership return and the associated forms allocating to fidelity partners the gains or losses for the transactions.almost all the losses were assigned on the schedule to egan.an attached schedule reflecting other income loss pertaining to each transaction say,the purchase and ultimate disposition of an option by fidelity showed a cost or other basis for the option such as the premium paid to acquire it,the associated revenue generated the price received on its sale and the difference the net gain or loss on the purchase and sale.
the ultimate effect of these currency option transactions was to give egan a net loss on paper of million comprising percent of the gain from the foreign currency options,percent of the loss,and fees and mahoney a net gain of million including percent of the gain,percent of the loss,and fees.egan net loss was reported on his personal return to offset gain on the nearly million in income realized from the exercise of his emc options in the same year.
these foreign currency options transactions were the core means of generating the loss for egan,but a related set of transactions was also necessary.under the tax laws,a partner may deduct his share of a partnership losses only to the extent of his adjusted outside basis in the partnership at the end of the year in which the loss occurred.d.this outside basis refers to the partner investment in the partnership as opposed to the inside basis of investments made by the partnership in carrying on its own business.
to establish this necessary large outside basis,egan in had become a partner not only of fidelity but of a second vehicle called fidelity world,which in early october entered into two pairs of offsetting options keyed to interest rates.fidelity world contributed them to fidelity,reporting as a capital contribution by egan the million cost of premiums paid to secure the future interest rates options and ignoring largely offsetting premiums received for the sale of the other two options.
in,fidelity closed out the contributed interest rate options by purchasing a set of offsetting options that locked in any existing gain or loss to protect against any future changes.when these options were all terminated in,the transactions produced a very modest net loss of million,due primarily to advisor fees nearly million was proportionally allocated to egan on fidelity return and reported by him to shield other income on his own tax return.
in and,the irs notified fidelity that it was making adjustments to fidelity and partnership tax returns.under the governing regime,the partnership return items may be adjusted by the irs and contested changes may be judicially reviewed in a district court proceeding or,the tax court or court of federal claims addressed only to partnership items.a.these include the proper allocation of such items among the partners,and the applicability of any penalty which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.id.f.
in this case,the irs disallowed all of egan claimed contributions to fidelity,reduced egan claimed outside partnership basis to zero for and most importantly disallowed the losses on fidelity option transactions that egan had used on his personal returns for and to shield his income.the adjustments rested on the irs determination that the option transactions,and egan contribution,lacked economic substance.the irs also disregarded the partnership as a sham and lacking in economic substance.
tax considerations are permissibly taken into account by taxpayers in structuring their financial transactions,but where a transaction has no economic purpose other than to reduce taxes,the irs may disregard the reported figures as fictions and look through to the underlying substance here,the irs found and the district court later agreed that fidelity option transactions were designed to cancel each other out and were merely reported to generate paper losses to use on egan return.the shift in partnership ownership part way through was a cou
