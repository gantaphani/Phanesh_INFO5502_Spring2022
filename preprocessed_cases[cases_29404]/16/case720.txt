plaintiffs diesel props props and diesel kid kid collectively diesel appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a bench trial before harold baer,judge,a dismissing their claims against defendants greystone business credit ii llc greystone and global brand marketing gbmi,and b ordering props to pay greystone in damages,including interest,on its counterclaim for unjust enrichment.on appeal,diesel contends principally that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting,after trial,diesel claims against greystone for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and account stated,and in holding props liable to greystone for unjust enrichment.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment against props for unjust enrichment,and we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
background 
most of the background facts of this controversy are undisputed and were stipulated by the parties prior to trial.
a.the relationships among the parties 
props and kid are italian companies,subsidiaries of nonparty diesel spa,which owns the trademarks on merchandise.props and kid are licensed by spa to produce adult shoes and children shoes,respectively,bearing diesel trademarks.in,props and kid entered into distribution agreements with gbmi,a california corporation the distribution agreements,pursuant to which gbmi would purchase shoes designed and manufactured by diesel and sell them to retailers in the united states.in the summer of,gbmi was experiencing severe financial difficulties and owed spa and kid more than million in back royalties and advertising commitments.by december,those amounts had increased to more than million.
greystone is a delaware company that makes loans to financially distressed companies and takes security interests in their assets.in december,greystone,gbmi,and diesel entered into agreements pursuant to which greystone would make funds available to gbmi and would make payments from those funds directly to diesel.on december,spa and kid sent a letter to gbmi,with a copy to greystone,stating that props and kid were each willing to sign a agreement with greystone and gbmi with respect to such financing.on december,greystone and gbmi executed a loan and security agreement lsa,pursuant to which greystone established a million revolving credit account for gbmi the revolver in exchange for a security interest in substantially all of gbmi present and assets,including all of gbmi books and records relating to gbmi business.on the same day,two letter agreements,identical in substance,were by gbmi,greystone,and props,the other by gbmi,greystone,and kid the tripartite agreements or tpas with reference to the lsa and the distribution agreements.the tpas contained payment provisions requiring,inter alia,that gbmi not place an order under the distribution agreements unless it had received a bona fide purchase order for diesel products from a retailer a customer purchase order and that gbmi provide copies of such customer orders to diesel and greystone that diesel,before delivering such products to gbmi,send greystone copies of diesel invoices for those products diesel invoices and that gbmi supply diesel and greystone with copies of invoices that gbmi sent to its customers customer invoices.in those circumstances,gbmi delivery of such customer invoices to greystone would constitute an irrevocable request that greystone automatically pay diesel,from gbmi revolving credit account,the amounts shown on the corresponding diesel invoices.with respect to gbmi debts on orders not placed according to the terms of the debts to its suppliers other than was not authorized to make payments from gbmi credit account except as expressly instructed by gbmi.diesel was aware that the credit account could be used to pay other gbmi creditors.the tpas provided that diesel had the right,at any time before shipping shoes to gbmi,to request and receive information from greystone as to,inter alia,whether gbmi was in noncompliance or default with respect to any requirements imposed by the lsa the notice provisions,
despite the december arrangements,gbmi financial difficulties continued.at various in december and january was in default of revenue covenants and other terms of the lsa.in addition,during the next eight months,diesel shipped to gbmi several lots of shoes for which diesel was never paid.on september,diesel notified greystone that greystone was in default of the tpas for,inter alia,failing to make payments,and notified gbmi that gbmi was in default of the distribution agreements diesel informed each that unless its defaults were cured within days,diesel would consider its agreements terminated the conditional termination letters.on october,after neither greystone nor gbmi had cured its defaults,diesel notified them that their respective contracts were terminated as of october.diesel shortly thereafter commenced the present action.
at the time of termination,gbmi had received orders from retailers for pairs of diesel shoes for the season and had incurred significant expenses associated with collecting those orders.after terminating the distribution agreements with gbmi,diesel designated diesel usa,a wholly owned subsidiary of spa,as its united states distributor.had operated retail stores but had no experience in selling shoes to retailers,and it had little information about other retailers orders for the season.in november,hired a former gbmi employee,who gave a complete list of gbmi open orders the order book.props personnel referred to the order book as the gbmi employee dowry and wrote i t looks like christmas came early this year.had net sales for the season of more than million,selling pairs of shoes to retailers who included those identified from the gbmi order book.
b.the district court rulings after trial 
in the present action,diesel asserted numerous claims,several of which were dismissed prior to trial.to the extent pertinent to this appeal,diesel third amended complaint alleged principally that greystone had failed to give diesel notice of many defaults by gbmi under the lsa and had thereby breached the tpa notice provisions that the failures of gbmi and greystone to pay diesel for shoes shipped to gbmi breached the distribution agreements and the tpa payment provisions and that diesel was entitled to recover from each defendant for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,or account stated.diesel sought approximately million in damages,plus interest.greystone,in connection with props acquisition of the gbmi order book,in which greystone claimed a security interest,asserted a counterclaim seeking more than million for unjust enrichment.
the district court held a bench trial on the above claims.in a posttrial opinion and order reported at wl,civ,diesel,annotated with citations to pertinent documents and to testimony and other sworn statements by officials of greystone,gbmi,spa,kid,and props,the district court ruled against diesel on all of its claims and ruled in favor of greystone on its unjust enrichment counterclaim against props.the court dismissed diesel claims against gbmi on the ground that gbmi obligations to make payments to diesel arose only under the distribution agreements,and those agreements contained clauses requiring all claims thereunder to be litigated in milan,italy.see diesel,wl,at.
as to diesel claim against greystone for breach of the payment provisions of the tpas,the court concluded that diesel was not entitled to recover,principally because it had not shown that a condition precedent to greystone obligation to make payments had been performed.the court found that the tpas and the lsa,executed on the same day,made express reference to one another,and that the terms of each w ere conditioned on the performance and fulfillment of conditions of the other.id.at.
t he lsa authorized greystone to wire gbmi funds directly to diesel pursuant to the terms of the tpas.likewise,greystone payment obligations under the tpa w ere expressly s ubject to the terms and conditions of the lsa.thus,the standing instructions from gbmi to greystone to advance revolver proceeds directly to diesel applied only if the tpa applied to the particular orders for which payment was requested and all conditions under the tpa were met that is,if the terms of the tpa did not apply to a particular order for which payment was requested,the order was outside the structure set forth in the tpa,greystone had no authority under the lsa to wire gbmi revolver proceeds directly to diesel rather,gbmi,as the borrower under the lsa,would be required to send greystone a separate instruction to disburse loan proceeds to diesel as a 
the tpa contained three primary independent provisions.first,gbmi was required to obtain a purchase order from a bona fide customer customer purchase order before placing an order for shoes with diesel a copy of the customer purchase order was to be delivered to both diesel and greystone second,the tpa provided that at any time before shipping the shoes,diesel had the right to request written notice from greystone as to whether at the time of such request there were a sufficient funds to permit payment in the amount requested in the diesel invoice,b if not,gbmi would be prevented from requesting a loan under the lsa,or c if gbmi was not in compliance with any of the covenants warranties under the lsa,or is in default under the lsa,irrespective of whether that or default has been waived by greystone the notice provision.third,pursuant to the tpa,gbmi was required to deliver to diesel and greystone a copy of any invoices to customers customer invoice,which were deemed an irrevocable request for disbursement of a revolving loan in the amount of the corresponding diesel invoice the payment provision.in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lsa,within two days of its receipt of a customer invoice,greystone was required to wire the proceeds of the new loan in the amount of the corresponding diesel invoice the only express conditions prior to payment w ere a receipt of a customer invoice and availability of funds under the lsa 
diesel,wl,at citations to the record omitted emphases added.the court noted that diesel 
december letter expressly stated that the tpa should only be applied to orders placed by gbmi upon receipt of a purchase order for product from a bona fide customer of diesel products.although greystone did not sign the december letter,it is undisputed that it would not have closed on the lsa if diesel had not signed the december letter,and that greystone agreed to the terms of the december letter by accepting the tpa and closing on the lsa.joint pretrial order.
diesel,wl,at other citations to the record omitted emphasis ours.although noting that rejection of a contract claim on the basis of nonperformance of a condition precedent is generally disfavored,the district court found that 
in this case the words and actions of the parties demonstrate that all interested parties intended that the december letter make the customer purchase order requirement a condition precedent to the operation of the tpa.
diesel,wl,at.it found that when diesel shipped shoes to gbmi that were not supported by customer purchase orders the tpa simply did not apply to these shipments,id.at 
the effective date of the tpa was december,at that time,there were pairs of shoes being held at snatt,diesel consolidator warehouse in hong kong,waiting to be shipped to the united states although the procedure set forth under tpa was supposed to cover all orders after its execution,gbmi paid for these shoes by letter of credit because it wanted fast delivery,and the formalities required to implement the tpa were not yet in place on gbmi end while diesel contends all parties understood the rest of the shipments for the season would be paid for under the tpa,that does not appear to be what happened.beginning in january,diesel began accepting orders from gbmi that were not supported by customer purchase orders,understanding that the terms of the tpa would not apply to those shipments diesel opted to take the risk of accepting those orders because it was anxious to have its shoes distributed into the united states in time for the season diesel continued to ship to gbmi without requiring customer purchase orders throughout the life of the tpa knowing full well that,based on the structure of the tpa and as made explicit in the december letter,those orders were not covered by the tpa 
because the tpa simply did not apply to these shipments,greystone lacked any authority to lend funds to a such as diesel without the direct authorization of gbmi as its borrower under the lsa gbmi and greystone actions under the lsa were consistent with this occasions,gbmi requested that greystone wire revolver funds directly to diesel in specified amounts greystone honored each instruction.
diesel,wl,at footnote and citations to the record omitted emphases added see also id.at.
as to diesel claim against greystone for breach of the tpa notice provisions,the district court found that there were indeed numerous occasions on which greystone failed to give notice of gbmi noncompliance with the lsa.but it found that diesel had failed to carry its burden of showing that losses it suffered from nonpayment for shoes it shipped to gbmi were caused by those failures.gbmi greystone credit account was available for payments not only to diesel but to other gbmi creditors as well,and the court found that diesel,with awareness of gbmi financial problems,shipped shoes to gbmi even when it had received notice of gbmi defaults or of the current lack of funds in the credit account sufficient to pay for shoes being shipped by diesel.see,id.at.
there is no dispute that diesel was well aware of gbmi dire financial situation,and that it chose to take the business risk associated with continuing to ship shoes to gbmi,because it wanted to ensure a market for its footwear in the united states one example is the occasion on january,when diesel sent a notice letter requesting a response under the notice provision of the tpa,but failed to wait the requisite two business days for a response from greystone,and shipped over of a million dollars worth of shoes that same day.to make the cheese more binding,the testimony revealed that on the two occasions when diesel was notified of gbmi defaults under the lsa,rather than discontinue its relationship with gbmi,it continued to ship goods.in february,over the four days following the first default notice,diesel shipped million worth of shoes.thereafter,even though it knew gbmi was in financial difficulty and in default under the lsa,and that it had not been paid for its shipments,in the three months following the first notice of default,diesel proceeded to ship over million dollars worth of shoes to gbmi,after it received the second notice of gbmi default on july,undeterred by gbmi financial state,diesel continued to ship shoes,shipping over million worth of shoes in the ensuing two weeks.diesel continued to ship shoes up until the day before it sent its notices to greystone and gbmi of its intent to terminate the tpa and distribution agreements,almost two months after it received the second notice of default.
id.at.the court noted testimony by diesel witnesses who testified that had they received notice of any of the additional instances of covenant breaches of availability in addition to the two notices of default actually received,they would not have continued to ship shoes to gbmi.see also id.at.but the court found that this testimony wa s belied by the events as they actually unfolded,id.at,and that diesel own actions and business decisions to continue to ship shoes irrespective of gbmi financial condition constituted an intervening cause of diesel s losses,id.at.
addressing diesel alternative claims against greystone,the district court dismissed the claim for account stated,finding that the on which diesel relied for that claim were statements of accounts owed not by greystone,but by gbmi.see id.at.as to the claim for unjust enrichment,which was premised on greystone receipt from gbmi of proceeds of sales of shoes for which payment was not made to diesel,the court found that greystone had not been enriched unjustly 
the evidence in this case reveals the only benefit greystone retained was to the extent it was,or could have been,repaid for loan funds disbursed to gbmi under the lsa.however,gbmi was obligated to repay greystone for those loans.equity and good conscience do not require a party to give up what it rightfully obtained,or is entitled to,under a contract b benefits can not be deemed to unjustly enrich a contracting party.
diesel,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court found merit,however,in greystone counterclaim for unjust enrichment against props for the value that props unjustly obtained by purloining greystone collateral,gbmi order book.id.at.the court rejected props contention that the distribution agreements entitled props to the order book at the end of the sales campaign.having found that the sales campaign had ended as of the termination of the distribution agreement s,id.at,the court found that 
the facts show that props purposely timed its notice of default so that the end of the cure period would coincide with the end of the sales campaign the distribution agreement nowhere states that props is entitled to the order book if the agreement is terminated props timed its notice of default and termination to correspond exactly with the end of the sales period.the court is not persuaded by props arguments that gbmi was required to provide it with the order book,
id.at.the court ordered props to pay greystone unjust enrichment damages in the amount of plus in interest,for a total of.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,diesel contends that the judgment dismissing its claims against greystone and holding it liable to greystone for unjust enrichment should be that judgment should be entered in its favor for some to the grounds that the district court abuse d its discretion in,inter alia,finding that there was an unperformed condition precedent to greystone obligation to make payments,finding that greystone failures to give diesel notice of many of gbmi defaults were not the proximate cause of diesel losses,finding that props benefited from use of gbmi order book,and failing to find that props was contractually entitled to the order book,diesel brief on appeal at.applying the normal standard of review,we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed insofar as it dismissed the claims of diesel but reversed insofar as it held props liable to greystone for unjust enrichment.
standard of review 
on an appeal from a judgment entered after a bench trial,we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.see,giordano thomson,cir henry champlain enterprises,cir fdic providence college,cir.under new york law,which the tpas provided would be applicable,the initial matter of whether a written contract is ambiguous is a question of law.see,law debenture trust of new york maverick tube,cir ja apparel abboud,cir international multifoods commercial union insurance,cir.the meaning of an unambiguous contract is likewise a matter of law.see,revson cinque cinque,cir bell associates,lloyd underwriters,cir seiden associates,anc holdings,cir.
when the district court as factfinder is confronted with a contract provision that is not unambiguous,it may properly consider evidence extrinsic to the contract,including testimony offered by the parties.see,amusement business underwriters american international group,wall street franklin national bank,evidence of surrounding facts and circumstances to show the parties intent.the meaning of an ambiguous provision,in light of such evidence,is a question of fact for the factfinder.see,revson cinque cinque,at in time products,toy biz,cir consarc marine midland bank,cir.
after a bench trial,the court f indings of fact,whether based on oral or other evidence,must not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.a see,anderson bessemer city,banker nighswander,martin mitchell,cir.the clearly erroneous standard applies whether the findings are based on witness testimony,or on documentary evidence,or on inferences from other facts.see,anderson,at petereit thomas,cir.
in deciding whether factual findings are clearly erroneous,we are required to give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.a.it is within the province of the district court as the trier of fact to decide whose testimony should be credited.see,anderson,at.the court is also entitled,just as a jury would be,see,robinson cattaraugus county,cir fiacco city of rensselaer,f d,cir,cert.denied,to believe some parts and disbelieve other parts of the testimony of any given witness.we are not allowed to the court credibility assessments.see,anderson,at.
further,w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.at see united states yellow cab.the fact that there may have been evidence to support an inference contrary to that drawn by the trial court does not mean that the findings made are clearly erroneous.see,palazzo corio,cir healey chelsea resources,cir.
w hen the district court is sitting as trier of fact,it has no obligation to draw a given inference merely because it is supportable nor has it any obligation,in its capacity as trier of fact,to view the evidence in the light most favorable to a particular party.the obligations of the court as the trier of fact are to determine which of the witnesses it finds credible,which of the permissible competing inferences it will draw,and whether the party having the burden of proof has persuaded it as factfinder that the requisite facts are proven.
cifra general electric,cir.
given the standards governing our review of the district court rulings after the bench trial,we have little difficulty in concluding that the rejection of diesel claims should be affirmed.we reach the opposite conclusion with respect to the ruling that greystone was entitled to unjust enrichment damages from props.
b.the dismissal of diesel contract claims against greystone 
in order to recover from a defendant for breach of contract,a plaintiff must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the existence of a contract between itself and that defendant performance of the plaintiff obligations under the contract breach of the contract by that defendant and damages to the plaintiff caused by that defendant breach.see,eternity global master fund morgan guaranty trust of new york,cir harsco segui,cir.causation is an essential element of damages in a breach of contract action and,as in tort,a plaintiff must prove that a defendant breach directly and proximately caused his or her damages.national market share sterling national bank,cir emphasis in original see,wakeman wheeler wilson manufacturing co.recovery is not allowed if the claimed losses are the result of other intervening causes.see,national market share sterling national bank,at kenford county of erie.
the district court concluded that diesel claim against greystone for breach of the tpa notice provisions should be dismissed for lack of sufficient proof that the failures to give diesel notice of many of gbmi defaults caused diesel losses.although diesel argues that this was error because its witnesses testified that diesel would have ceased shipping shoes to gbmi if greystone had notified diesel of each of gbmi defaults,the court refusal to credit that testimony was entirely permissible.the court found,inter alia,that in january,diesel faxed a request to greystone for gbmi default information within two business days but did not bother to await a response,instead shipping more than of a million dollars worth of shoes to gbmi on the day of the inquiry that in february,in the four days following its receipt of a notice from greystone that gbmi was in default,diesel shipped to gbmi million worth of shoes that in the three months following that first notice of default,diesel sent gbmi more than million dollars worth of shoes that in july,in the two weeks after it received notice of another gbmi default,diesel shipped gbmi more than million worth of shoes and that diesel was still shipping shoes to gbmi on september,one day before sending gbmi the conditional notice of termination.these findings
