after a bench trial,the district court awarded a judgment against weybosset hotel,llc weybosset and in favor of its construction company,stonestreet construction,llc stonestreet,in the sum of.stonestreet and weybosset are both rhode island companies.weybosset appeals,arguing that there was no federal jurisdiction,and the was awarded in error.
weybosset argues that the district court erred in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over this case following the settlement of some of the dispute between the case two diverse parties,stonestreet and allstate interiors exteriors.it also challenges one of the district court discovery rulings,along with its interpretation of the governing construction contract.
background 
all of the claims in this case arise from the hampton inn suites renovation and construction project in providence,rhode island.stonestreet,as the construction manager and general contractor,entered into a construction contract contract with weybosset in november,with an initial project completion date of november.largely as a result of cost overruns and other delays,disputes relating to the contract have now been the subject of litigation in state and federal court.
key contract provisions 
the main compensation provision in the contract is its guaranteed maximum price gmp,which is defined as the sum of the cost of work and the construction manager fee.the gmp was not to exceed the maximum of originally set by the contract,but was subject to additions and deductions by changes in the work as provided in the construction documents.the mechanism came in the form of change order requests cors,under which stonestreet could seek additional funds if project timing or cost requirements changed.throughout the project,cors were typically prepared by stonestreet and submitted to weybosset for approval and signature.
included in the gmp was,which represented a lump sum of stonestreet general conditions costs from the preconstruction and construction phases of the project.the lump sum included more specific estimates,including the costs of an administrative assistant,project executive,and project manager.during the project,stonestreet divided the lump sum equally across its monthly payment requisitions until the original lump sum was fully billed by november.
generally,stonestreet paid its subcontractors pursuant to its standard form contracts,which contained a clause that stated it is agreed that the contractor stonestreet,as a condition precedent to payment of any monies which become due to the subcontractor,must first receive payment from the owner.the timing disconnect between the provision and the payment schedule under the contract between weybosset and stonestreet,which was based on the overall progress of the project,led to several instances of subcontractors not being paid after their work was completed.
project delays 
the main project delay concerned the provision of permanent power to the building.in the early stages of the project,weybosset existing structures provided temporary power however,stonestreet eventually required a permanent power supply to continue work on the project in the construction contract,the parties agreed that p rimary service,cable and transformer were excluded from stonestreet scope of work,and were thus controlled by weybosset.at trial,witnesses testified that primary service means permanent power.
stonestreet initially anticipated having permanent power at the project site during the summer of.power was in fact not supplied at that time,and the delay in supplying permanent power led to delays in,among other things,installation of the mechanical,electrical,and elevator systems.as a result of these delays,stonestreet generated an updated project schedule on october,which reflected a revised completion date of january,at that point,the remaining elements of the project could not be completed without permanent power at the site.power was ultimately provided on january.
in light of these delays,stonestreet submitted cor,which sought an increase in the total gmp of to cover increased general conditions costs that resulted from the overall project delays.in january,stonestreet submitted a draft of requisition,which sought payment for december work as specified in cor.at the time of submission,stonestreet was not advised that it would not be paid for its continued work on the project as reflected in cor,and it continued to install systems once permanent power was supplied to the building.in march and april,stonestreet twice updated cor to reflect continued project costs weybosset did not respond to either submission.on may,edmund landry,weybosset representative,formally rejected cor.
procedural history 
the case was originally filed on june,in the district court for the district of rhode island by allstate interiors exteriors allstate,one of the subcontractors on the project,against stonestreet.allstate sought payment of an outstanding balance of,and stonestreet counterclaimed that allstate had not completed the work as originally agreed between the parties.in addition,stonestreet filed a complaint against weybosset,bringing several state law causes of action arising from the construction project.the claims included breach of contract,breach of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,and tortious interference with contractual relations.stonestreet also argued that weybosset failure to pay stonestreet certain sums caused stonestreet to breach its contract with allstate and other subcontractors on the project,and that weybosset should therefore indemnify stonestreet for damages sustained as a result of such breaches.
while this case was pending in federal court,all three parties were involved in parallel litigation in rhode island state court.that litigation dealt with two mechanics liens,filed against weybosset by allstate and stonestreet,respectively.the dispute between allstate and weybosset in state court was resolved by settlement.
when allstate resolved its claim against weybosset in state court,it effectively resolved most of allstate claims against stonestreet in federal court.stonestreet counterclaim against allstate remained outstanding,and allstate remained a party to the case.while the resolution of allstate claim against stonestreet,confirmed during a january,hearing before the district court,came relatively quickly after the initiation of this case,allstate participated in discovery along with stonestreet and weybosset.additionally,because stonestreet counterclaim against allstate was still pending,allstate remained a party to the case regardless of the state court settlement.
following this partial settlement,weybosset filed a motion to dismiss stonestreet complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in november.it argued that the main dispute in the case concerned state law claims between two parties,weybosset and stonestreet both rhode island companies,and that exercising federal jurisdiction over the dispute between those parties following the resolution of some claims between allstate and stonestreet the two diverse parties was therefore improper.notably,allstate remained a party to the case following the partial settlement,as stonestreet counterclaim against allstate was not part of the settlement.the district court denied weybosset motion on february.
before trial,weybosset filed a series of discovery motions,each seeking to strike certain of stonestreet materials from the record.the district court denied all three motions,and weybosset appeals from one of those rulings.
following a partial grant of summary judgment in weybosset favor that is not at issue in this appeal the district court conducted a bench trial.after the trial and the filing of memoranda,the district court issued its final order on october.as it is relevant to this appeal,the district court ruled in favor of stonestreet on the core breach of contract claim and awarded damages in the amount of.before this court,weybosset appeals three of the district court rulings the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction following allstate and stonestreet partial settlement the interpretation of the construction contract for the
