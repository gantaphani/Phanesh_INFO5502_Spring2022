background 
substantive factsa.introduction 
this case involves a challenge by the government to the acquisition of defendant southern belle by defendant dfa and the allen family limited partnership aflp.the government alleges that this acquisition,as structured both in the original and revised agreements,has resulted in a monopoly on the market for school milk in over forty school districts in kentucky and tennessee,and that it has reduced competition substantially in almost fifty additional districts.
b.the entities involved 
dairy farmers of america 
dfa,a kansas corporation with its principal place of business in kansas city,missouri,is a milk marketing organization and the largest dairy farmer cooperative in the nation.dfa primary purpose is marketing the raw,unprocessed milk of its dairy farmers to dairy processors.dfa also invests in dairy processors in order to allow dfa farmer members to participate in the profits earned from the sale of the finished products,and to secure an outlet for its members raw milk.
southern belle 
southern belle is a limited liability company formed in february.southern belle owns a milk processing plant in somerset,kentucky,that bids on school milk contracts.under the initial ownership structure of the company,fifty percent of the voting interests in southern belle was owned by the allen family limited partnership aflp,which is managed by robert allen allen,and fifty percent was owned by dfa.allen had previously been an advisor to dfa corporate board.in addition,allen had earlier participated in another joint venture with dfa,in which he made a million profit on a million investment.according to gary hanman,the ceo of dfa,dfa partnered with allen on southern belle because we knew him,our experience has been great,our relationship has been perfect through the years.
the original agreement gave aflp a put option that entitled it to sell its interests to dfa after three years at a price sufficient to recover its initial contribution.although dfa asserts that aflp has always had exclusive responsibility for the operations of the plant and the sale and marketing of the products from the plant,including the sale of milk to schools,the initial agreement provided for the business and affairs of the company to be managed by the common members,by dfa and aflp.
on july,six days before dfa filed a motion for summary judgment in this case,dfa and aflp agreed that dfa would exchange its common member interests in southern belle for preferred capital interests,thus eliminating dfa right to vote on any matter or to sit on the southern belle representative committee.pursuant to this revised agreement,aflp no longer has a put option,and can sell southern belle at its option at any time,and require dfa interests to be sold.southern belle,including its plant in somerset,is managed by aflp,which,as noted,is managed by allen.dfa does not have any ownership interest in aflp,and aflp does not have any ownership interest in dfa.with respect to responsibilities,southern belle school milk bidding and pricing decisions are made at levels below allen.
national dairy holding and 
national dairy holding,national dairy,owns the milk processing plant in london,kentucky,which bids for school milk contracts in many of the same school districts as southern belle.national dairy was formed in march by tracy noll noll,allen meyer meyer,cletes beshears beshears,the cletes beshears family trust beshears family trust,and dfa.in february,noll,beshears,and beshears family trust sold their interest in national dairy.consequently,meyer now holds fifty percent of the voting interest in national dairy,and dfa holds the other fifty percent.meyer and dfa have participated in three other joint ventures,one of which enabled meyer to turn an investment of several hundred thousand dollars into a gain of approximately seventy million dollars.
as a limited partnership,national dairy has a general partner responsible for its operations and limited partners.the general partner is dairy management,which,like national dairy itself,is fifty percent owned by meyer and fifty percent owned by dfa.meyer is also the manager of dairy management.national dairy is operated and controlled solely by its manager.while dfa owns fifty percent of the voting interest in national dairy,which in turn owns,dfa does not participate in any of school milk business decisions.indeed,even national dairy has limited involvement in the operations of,and no involvement in the school milk bidding process or knowledge about the schools to which submits bids,the prices of the bids,or the product mix offered.
evidence relating to the structure of school milk markets 
the government retained three expert witnesses in conjunction with this case,each of whom prepared a written report.frank scott professor scott is the gatton professor of economics at the university of kentucky.john johnson johnson is a former president of johnson dairy,in ashland,kentucky,with over twenty years of experience in the kentucky dairy industry.edward rock professor rock is the saul fox distinguished professor of business law at the university of pennsylvania law school.
according to the expert reports of johnson and professor scott,the school districts at issue in this case purchase milk in cartons through a sealed bid process and award contracts to the lowest bidder.there is a separate competition and bidding process in each school district.southern belle and are the only bidders in school districts,and two of only three bidders in additional districts.
professor scott found that the school districts have no practical alternatives to purchasing milk from these suppliers,and would continue to buy milk even if there were a fairly large price increase.
evidence of anticompetitive effects of dfa partial acquisition of southern belle 
the government experts offered testimony and submitted reports regarding alleged anticompetitive effects of dfa partial acquisition of southern belle.professor scott report of march asserts that it is in dfa interest to reduce or eliminate competition between and southern belle,because dfa receives fifty percent of the profits from both dairies,regardless of which supplies a particular school district in other words,it would not benefit dfa for the two dairies to compete and drive down prices and profits.
in a deposition in june,professor rock testified that meyer and allen have a strong incentive to manage and southern belle in a manner that furthers dfa interest in suppressing competition,because dfa,national dairy and southern belle all profit from the elimination of competition between the dairies,and because allen and meyer have both profited from lucrative joint ventures with dfa in the past,creating an incredibly strong incentive for them to keep dfa happy.at.rock wrote in his march report that 
b y installing joint venture partners who have proved their loyalty,who have economic incentives to achieve the high price outcome and to further dfa interests,and who have an expectation of future profitable joint ventures with dfa,dfa has made it extremely unlikely that that any competition will break out among its group of dairies.the rational desire of the joint venture partners to participate in highly profitable business opportunities with dfa ensures that they will act in ways consistent with dfa interests.
professor scott asserted in his report that dfa arrangements were likely to lead to decreased competition comparable to that which resulted from the southern conspiracy of the and.in a rebuttal report responding to an expert report submitted by dfa,scott also presented an analysis of school bidding data that he concluded was consistent with significant anticompetitive effects.according to his econometric model,before dfa acquisition of southern belle,prices in districts where southern belle and were the only bidders on school milk contracts were not significantly different from prices in other districts with only two bidders.afterwards,districts receiving bids only from southern belle and paid more than other districts with only two bidders.prices in school districts where only southern belle and bid were almost cents higher in after the transaction than in other districts and in other years.at.
scott also testified as the government representative in a deposition pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in that deposition,he testified that the government could not identify any specific instances where a specific price in a specific school district can be linked to an explicit action by dfa,and that the government had no evidence of any specific price increases of milk sold to schools.at.he also stated that there was no evidence that representatives had communicated with southern belle representatives regarding the pricing of bids for school milk contracts,or in which school districts to place bids.
ii.procedural history 
the government filed a complaint against defendants on april,alleging that dfa acquisition of a partial interest in southern belle constituted a violation of section of the clayton act.according to the complaint,because of dfa existing interest in,dfa partial acquisition of southern belle was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition for the manufacture,distribution,and sale of school milk and of increasing the prices of school milk in the relevant geographic markets.the government sought the following relief that dfa be compelled to divest all of its interests in southern bell that dfa be permanently enjoined and restrained from acquiring or maintaining simultaneous legal or beneficial interests in both southern belle and that dfa be compelled to provide the united states with notification at least thirty days in advance of any acquisition of legal or beneficial interests in any fluid milk processing operation that any school district that entered into a contract with dfa for the supply of school milk be permitted to terminate or rescind such contract that the government costs be awarded that any other further relief as is proper be awarded.extensive discovery followed the filing of the complaint.
on july,defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment.dfa also submitted a document modifying the agreement governing the relationship between dfa and southern belle.one week later,the government filed a motion in opposition to the motions for summary judgment,and requesting discovery related to the modifications of the belle agreement,under rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.
in the weeks that followed,the parties filed a number of pretrial motions.without ruling on these and other motions,the district court granted summary judgment to dfa on august.in granting summary judgment to dfa,the district court repeatedly emphasized that dfa had no voting interests in southern belle although the district court failed to note that this was true only as of july,and thus did not have the ability to influence business decisions regarding the sale of school milk.the district court concluded that b ased on the limited nature of dfa ownership interest in southern belle the incentives and opportunities for collusion are not substantially greater by virtue of dfa dual ownership interests than they were prior to this challenged acquisition,and further,that the government had established no causal connection between dfa partial acquisition of southern belle and any anticompetitive effects on the market for school milk.
with respect to southern belle,the district court concluded that section of the clayton act operates only against the acquirer in a transaction,and thus,that southern belle could not be liable as a matter of law.
the government filed a notice of appeal to this court on october.
discussion 
i.the grant of summary judgment to defendant southern belle 
we will briefly address the government case against southern belle before turning to the heart of this dispute.the district court granted southern belle motion for summary judgment on the ground that section of the clayton act is directed solely against the acquirer in a transaction,in this case,dfa.see no person shall acquire emphasis added dailey quality school plan,cir by its terms proscribes only the acquiring corporation.
the government argued in the alternative that southern belle presence in the case was required for complete relief.the district court rejected this contention because it found that dfa was also entitled to summary judgment on all claims.although we disagree with this conclusion,for reasons that will be explained below,we will not consider the government alternative argument with respect to southern belle because it was waived.
the only argument against the grant of summary judgment to southern belle in the government brief is contained in a footnote on page,stating that the grant of summary judgment in favor of southern belle must be reversed if this court reverses the judgment in favor of dfa,because parties may be joined in a section case if they are necessary for relief.an argument contained only in a footnote does not preserve an issue for our review.rather,an appellant brief must include a statement of the issues presented for our review,and an argument with respect to each issue.fed.app.a becherer merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir an issue only drop ped in a footnote and not raised in the statement of issues or argument section of a brief is not properly raised before the court see also marks newcourt credit group,cir issue waived when mentioned only in the final sentence of a brief.furthermore,the government attempt to save the issue by inclusion in its reply brief is unavailing.see united states perkins,cir.the government has not preserved,and we will not entertain,any argument with respect to the grant of summary judgment to southern belle.
ii.the original agreement 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard as the court below.equitable life assur.soc y of poe,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.we must consider the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.verizon north strand,cir.a genuine issue of material fact exists when there is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for the party.a mere scintilla of evidence will not be enough for the party to withstand summary judgment.skousen brighton high school,cir.
b.the district court failure to consider the government claim regarding the original agreement 
a threshold question with respect to this issue is whether the district court was required to rule on the legality of the original southern belle agreement.the district court did not so rule,and did not offer any explanation of its failure to do so.dfa argues that because the original agreement was replaced by a revised agreement,the district court did not need to examine the legality of the original agreement.according to dfa,no relief could have been afforded even if the original agreement was illegal,because the government did not seek money damages and,in the absence of any evidence that dfa intends to reinstate the terms of the original agreement,an injunction to prohibit such reinstatement is unnecessary.
this argument is unsuccessful because it misstates the burden in establishing that a claim is moot.the supreme court has repeatedly explained that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice,unless subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.serv.toc,d quoting city of mesquite aladdin castle,d and united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d.the party asserting mootness bears a heavy burden of persua ding the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to stand up again.id.otherwise,the courts would be compelled to leave t he defendant free to return to his old ways.id.quoting mesquite,at.
thus,it is dfa burden to show that the government claim with respect to the original agreement is moot the government is not required,as dfa suggests,to present evidence that the terms of the original agreement might be resorted to.as the government notes,dfa has made no effort to meet its heavy burden of persuading the court that it will not revert to the original agreement.the government claim with respect to the original agreement was not mooted by the adoption of the revised agreement,and the district court should have considered it.
section of the clayton act 
in relevant part,section of the clayton act states 
no person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire,directly or indirectly,the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce,where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country,the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly.
section is designed to arrest in its incipiency the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock or assets of a competing corporation.united states du pont de nemours,d.the supreme court has explained that congress used the words may be substantially to lessen competition emphasis supplied,to indicate that its concern was with probabilities,not certainties.brown shoe united states,d.the government can satisfy its burden by establishing a reasonable probability of substantial anticompetitive effects.du pont,at.section can deal only with probabilities,not with certainties.and there is certainly no requirement that the anticompetitive power manifest itself in anticompetitive action before can be called into play.if the enforcement of turned on the existence of actual anticompetitive practices,the congressional policy of thwarting such practices in their incipiency would be frustrated.ftc procter gamble,d citations omitted.however,ephemeral possibilities will not satisfy the requirement of a reasonable probability.united states marine bancorporation,d.
in perhaps the seminal case on section,the supreme court explained that where an acquisition would produce a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market,and results in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market,the likelihood that competition will be substantially lessened is so great that it must be enjoined in the absence of evidence clearly showing that the acquisition is not likely to have such anticompetitive effects.united states philadelphia bank,d.thus,where the government shows that the acquisition in question would result in a firm controlling an undue percentage of the relevant market and a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market,a presumption of illegality arises because there is a presumption of anticompetitive effects.
the district court explained that the ability to exercise some control over the business decisions of the entity being acquired is critical because the acquisition must cause anticompetitive effects.if the acquiring company has no control over the that would form the basis of the alleged anticompetitive effects,the district court reasoned,the likelihood of causing anticompetitive effects decreases.at.
the district court conclusion that a section plaintiff must demonstrate some mechanism by which the challenged acquisition causes anticompetitive effects is supported by a number of cases,cited by the district court,in which an acquisition was deemed illegal because it gave the acquiring party the ability to influence competitive behavior.these cases focus on the degree to which the defendant controls the processes that cause anticompetitive effects,rather than the nature or extent of the acquisition.see du pont,d section violated when du pont,which had the same chairman of the board as general motors,acquired a percent interest in general motors mctamney stolt tankers terminals.where plaintiffs alleged that defendants controlled the business activities of two companies,defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings failed even though the acquisition was never consummated nelson pacific southwest airlines,an agreement by which a defendant achieved significant control over the decision making process or the property of its competitor could satisfy the section acquisition requirement even where defendant had not actually acquired the competitor stock.we would also point out that several of the leading supreme court cases finding violations of section were cases in which the defendant was involved in an actual merger,which necessarily implies control and the ability to affect competition.see brown shoe,d procter gamble,d philadelphia bank,at.
this court therefore agrees with the district court conclusion that control or influence may cause anticompetitive effects,and that the courts may assume anticompetitive effects with certain strong indications of control.
we,however,do not agree with the district court conclusion that a lack of control or influence precludes a section violation.the supreme court decision in du pont is instructive on this point.in its du pont decision,the court found that du pont percent ownership of general motors common stock violated section,in that du pont purposely purchased the stock so that it would entrench itself as the primary supplier of general motors requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics.at.although the court found an antitrust violation,it left to the district court the task of fashioning an appropriate remedy.id.at.
the district court approved a remedy whereby du pont would retain ownership of the general motors stock,but the stock would be stripped of its voting rights.united states du pont de nemours,d.these voting rights would be distributed pro rata to du pont shareholders.id.at.in addition,the remedy prevented du pont officers or directors from serving as general motors officers or directors.id.at.
the supreme court found the district court remedy to be inadequate to address the antitrust violation the court initially emphasized that in cases where the united states has shown a section violation,divestiture,as opposed to voting restrict
