brown forman is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of kentucky.brown forman markets and distributes finlandia vodka and jack daniel whiskey in the united states and puerto rico.caribbean is a corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth of puerto rico.as the complaint avers,in,caribbean entered into a series of oral agreements with primalco,brown forman predecessor,by which caribbean agreed to promote finlandia in puerto rico.in august,brown forman and caribbean formalized this commercial relationship in a written promotion agreement,whereby caribbean agreed to employ its best efforts to promote finlandia vodka in puerto rico on brown forman behalf.under the terms of this agreement,caribbean received a commission of per each case of finlandia sold in puerto rico by the distributor,ballester hermanos.this agreement also contained an integration clause which stated 
th e agreement covers all the terms and conditions of brown forman agreement with caribbean concerning the promotional services that caribbean will be rendering for finlandia vodka and supersedes all other agreements,whether written or oral,previously entered into.this letter agreement may be amended or changed only in writing duly signed by caribbean and brown forman.
on june,brown forman and caribbean subscribed a written promotion agreement,by which caribbean agree d to use its best efforts to promote jack daniel whiskey in puerto rico.per the terms of this agreement,caribbean received a commission of per case of jack daniel sold in puerto rico by the local distributor,suárez.the agreement also included an integration clause which stated 
this agreement covers all the terms and conditions of brown forman agreement with caribbean concerning the promotional services that caribbean will be rendering for jack daniel.this letter agreement may be amended or changed only in writing duly signed by caribbean and brown forman.
pursuant to these written agreements,caribbean was required to provide promotional merchandise create and set up product displays in certain locations purchase materials and products locally hire personnel for promotional activities and issue invitations for special events.both contracts were set to expire on april.
in march,brown forman renewed the promotional agreements until april.in april,brown forman informed caribbean that it was its operations in puerto rico and that the company had decided to hire caribbean on a monthly basis.on april,caribbean accepted brown forman proposal to renew their commercial relationship on a monthly basis.the parties thereafter engaged in a series of negotiations to restructure their commercial relationship.in the course of these negotiations,brown forman explained that it was planning to establish an office in san juan that would undertake all promotional,sales,and merchandising activities in puerto rico.as the complaint states,on september,brown forman confirmed its decision to terminate its prior commercial relationship with caribbean and offered to hire caribbean as an exclusive broker consultant for brown forman brands.on september,caribbean filed a complaint against brown forman seeking equitable and legal relief for an alleged unlawful termination of a sales representative contract in violation of law.the original complaint stated that the parties had a contractual relationship whereby iom caribbean acted as a sales representative for finlandia vodka and jack daniel whiskey in puerto rico.brown forman removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.
caribbean subsequently filed an amended complaint,including both a cause of action under law for the unlawful termination of its sales representation contract and an additional cause of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.caribbean claimed that although the written promotional agreements did not deal with its duties as a sales representative,had also entrusted caribbean with the sale of its products as an additional endeavor under the existing commercial relationship.regarding finlandia vodka,the complaint averred that the parties intentionally opted to exclude caribbean sales activities from the written promotional agreements.finally,caribbean claimed that,pursuant to its commercial dealings with brown forman,caribbean sent purchase orders to the local distributors of finlandia and jack daniel ballester hermanos and suárez,then supplied the products to the clients.
in october,caribbean filed a motion requesting a temporary restraining order tro a preliminary injunction.the district court denied the tro and scheduled a hearing to address caribbean request for preliminary injunctive relief.prior to the hearing,brown forman opposed caribbean request for a preliminary injunction and requested the dismissal of caribbean complaint for failure to state a claim under law.additionally,brown forman petitioned the court to refer caribbean claims to arbitration per the terms of certain arbitration clause included in the promotional agreements.
the district court held a hearing on october,in which the parties stated their positions regarding the nature of their commercial relationship.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court judge informed the parties of his decision to dismiss caribbean complaint for failure to state a claim.in an opinion and order dated november,the district court explained that dismissal of caribbean law claim was proper as caribbean had not shown that it was an exclusive sales representative as required by law.furthermore,the district court dismissed caribbean claim for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,finding that the arbitration clauses included in the promotional agreements required the parties to arbitrate that claim.
on april,the district court denied caribbean motion for reconsideration.the district court later issued a summary order granting brown forman request for costs and attorneys fees in the amount of caribbean now appeals.
ii.puerto rico sales representatives act 
in,the puerto rico legislature enacted law to protect sales representatives from the unjust termination of their contracts laws ann.tit,see also orba mbr industries,d.the statute provides that no principal or grantor may terminate the representative relationship,or directly or indirectly perform any act that may impair the established relationship,or refuse to renew said contract,except for just cause.laws ann.tit.if the principal terminates its commercial relationship with an exclusive sales representative without just cause,it is liable for the damages caused.id.stating the criteria courts should employ to calculate damages due to an unlawful termination of a sales representation contract.
under law,a sales representative is a n independent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation contract of an exclusive nature,with a principal or grantor,and who is assigned a specific territory or market,within the commonwealth of puerto rico.id.a emphasis added.in turn,a sales representation contract is 
an agreement established between a sales representative and a principal,through which,and regardless of the way in which the parties establish,delineate or formalize said agreement,the party of the first part commits himself to making a reasonable effort and due diligence in the creation or expansion of a market which is favorable for the products that the principal sells,directed at capturing clientele to offer it a product or service marketed by him in puerto rico,and the party of the second part is bound to comply with the commitments that may result from the sales representative efforts and coordination and to pay the commission or remuneration.
the recent puerto rico supreme court decision in,tspr,pr sup.lexis certified translation provided by parties outlines the characteristics a sales representative should bear to enjoy protection under law according to the puerto rico supreme court,a sales representative is a business intermediary who exclusively promotes and processes contracts on behalf of a principal in an ongoing,stable manner operates in a defined territory or market is responsible for creating or expanding the market for the principal products through promotional efforts receives commissions for his services or a pay previously agreed upon by the parties and operates as an independent merchant.see id.at 
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court allowance of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,pan american grain,cir.we may affirm the dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly appears,according to the facts alleged,that the plaintiff can not recover on any viable theory,cir.to overcome a motion to dismiss,plaintiff complaint may not rely on labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.bell atl.twombly,see also ashcroft iqbal,threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.
iv.discussion 
the scope and nature of the promotional agreements bear upon caribbean ability to show that it is plausibly entitled to relief under law.we thus begin by unpacking the parties arguments regarding these agreements.
it is undisputed that the parties executed two written promotional agreements that do not include any terms or conditions regarding caribbean alleged duties as a sales representative of finlandia and jack daniel in puerto rico.rather,the agreements address caribbean duty to promote the products by engaging in promotional and advertising efforts.absent written provisions regarding caribbean duties as a sales representative,caribbean claim revolves around its allegation that the parties intentionally excluded the terms of its duties as a sales representative and that this court should consider extrinsic evidence showing that the written contracts are incomplete and do not rule the entire and true commercial relationship between the parties 
article of the puerto rico civil code provides that where the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties,the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.laws ann.tit.the article also states that i f the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties,the intention shall prevail.id.in order to judge the intention of the contracting parties,attention must principally be paid to their acts,contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract.laws ann.tit.
construing the substantive provisions of the puerto rico civil code and puerto rico former parol evidence rule,laws ann.tit,app.iv,b repealed we have stated that courts may not consider extrinsic evidence to vary the express,clear,and unambiguous terms of a contract.borschow hosp.med.supplies,césar castillo,cir see also vulcan tools of puerto rico makita,cir.following this reading of puerto rico rules of contract interpretation,we have declined to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties intent when,for example,the evidence is offered to show that the written agreement was not the entire agreement between the parties.see exec.leasing banco popular de puerto rico,cir see also borschow hosp.med.supplies,at.
caribbean contends,however,that our decisions declining to consider extrinsic evidence are no longer good law in as much as the parol evidence rule of puerto rico was repealed in although caribbean claims that we should our prior decisions concerning puerto rico substantive rules of contract interpretation,it has not pointed to any decisions from the puerto rico supreme court showing that our interpretation of article is erroneous,even in the face of the repeal of puerto rico parol evidence rule however,we need not conclusively decide this issue that involves puerto rico rules of contract interpretation.even if we consider evidence tending to show that the parties intended to omit caribbean sales duties from the promotional agreements,the evidence is insufficient to establish that caribbean procured and closed sales on brown forman behalf in an exclusive manner as required by law.
first,caribbean allegations regarding its sales activities do not support the conclusion that caribbean had the authority to procure and conclude sales on brown forman behalf.per caribbean allegations and admissions,caribbean procured and sent purchase orders to the local distributors who then processed and concluded the sales.caribbean also admitted that it did not place orders directly with brown forman.that is,the complaint lacks any factual allegations that would tend to show that brown forman was bound by the sales caribbean claims that it procured and closed.at most,the allegations show that a representative relationship existed between caribbean and the local distributors.however,in order to enjoy protection under law,a sales representative must have the authority to procure and conclude orders that bind the principal.laws ann.tit,c stating that in a sales representation agreement,the principal is bound to comply with the commitments that may result from the sales representative efforts and coordination see also,tspr at explaining that a law sales representative procures and concludes orders on behalf of the principal.
secondly,caribbean allegations reveal that it was not compensated for its sales efforts.rather than receiving compensation for the sales that caribbean claims it procured and closed,caribbean commission was based on the terms of the promotional agreements.under the terms of these agreements,caribbean received a fixed percentage of overall product sales,regardless of whether it actually procured or concluded the sales.thus,per caribbean own allegations and admissions,there is no indication that brown forman agreed to compensate caribbean on the basis of its purported sales representation efforts.
finally,caribbean law claim fails on the pleadings as it failed to put forth sufficient facts to show that it was entrusted with exclusive sales responsibilities within a defined territory.exclusivity is generally apparent either from the contract or from the arrangements agreed upon between the parties.orba,d at.the exclusivity requirement is met where neither the principal merchant nor third parties are allowed to sell the product in the same territory or market in which the sales representative operates,tspr at.
caribbean amended complaint mentions the exclusivity requirement in a conclusory and casual fashion.the amended complaint merely avers that caribbean solicit ed and negotiate d purchase orders of finlandia vodka and jack daniel whiskey with its clients in an exclusive nature.although caribbean claims that it was involved in the sale of more than cases of finlandia and cases of jack daniel,its amended complaint is devoid of any factual allegations regarding the scope of caribbean alleged exclusive right to procure and execute purchase orders on brown forman behalf,and does not include any factual allegations regarding any assurances from brown forman that would support the contention that no other sales representatives were allowed to sell the products in puerto rico.surprisingly,the complaint nowhere explains the territorial scope of caribbean duties,an explanation that would support the assertion that caribbean indeed was granted the right to sell the products in puerto rico.
in conclusion,even if we take as true caribbean factual allegations that the parties intended to exclude caribbean sales duties from the written promotional agreements,and even if we credit the allegations that caribbean was involved in the sale of more than cases of finlandia and cases of jack daniel,we are bound by caribbean admissions that it did not send purchase orders to brown forman,and that it was not compensated on the basis of the sales that it allegedly made.because the facts in caribbean complaint do not support the conclusion that caribbean procured and closed sales on brown forman behalf,we find that the complaint fails to establish that caribbean is plausibly entitled to relief under law.additionally,the allegations fail to establish that caribbean enjoyed exclusivity in its sales endeavors.the district court properly dismissed caribbean law claim for failure to state a.dismissal of caribbean breach of contract claims 
caribbean complaint included a separate cause of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the district court dismissed this claim,finding that the arbitration clauses included in each of the promotional agreements required the parties to arbitrate the claim in relevant part,the arbitration clauses included in the promotional agreements stated that a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof shall be finally settled by arbitration in louisville,kentucky administered by the american arbitration association 
on appeal,caribbean claims that its breach of contract claim is not subject to arbitration because it arises out of the terms of the oral sales representation agreements.viewing the oral sales representation contracts as separate and independent agreements,caribbean contends that the arbitration clauses included in the promotional agreements do not cover claims arising out of the oral agreements.
caribbean claim requires us to examine the scope of the arbitration clause.this is a legal issue that we review de novo.see mitsubishi motors soler,cir,rev in part on other grounds.in evaluating the scope of the arbitration clauses,we are mindful that all doubts are resolved in favor of arbitration arbitration will be ordered unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
although caribbean argues that its breach of contract claim arises out of separate and independent verbal sales representation agreements,its complaint makes it clear that the breach of contract claim arises out of brown forman decision to terminate the commercial relationship between the parties.the complaint also shows that the commercial relationship between the parties is governed by the promotional agreements that include a mandatory arbitration clause.by caribbean own admissions,the oral sales representation contracts depend on,and are closely interrelated to,the promotional agreements regarding key contractual terms.for example,caribbean readily admits that the compensation it received for its alleged sales efforts was governed by the terms of the promotional agreements.consequently,even if we draw the inference that the sales representation agreements are independent agreements,they would still be part of the commercial relationship and would therefore be covered under the arbitration clause.
under these circumstances,we find that the arbitration clauses can be reasonably interpreted to cover caribbean claim that brown forman breached the commercial relationship between the parties in bad faith.the district court properly referred the breach of contract claim to arbitration 
attorneys fees 
at the conclusion of the hearing held by the court on october,the court stated that it would entertain a motion for attorneys fees.consequently,brown forman filed a motion requesting attorneys fees in the amount of.in an order dated november,the district court denied brown forman request,stating that brown forman had failed to file a verified statement of fees and expenses.the order further explained that the court had not yet granted attorneys fees to brown forman,but that it had only allowed the parties to file motions regarding attorneys fees.in compliance with the district court order,brown forman filed a supplemental motion renewing its request for costs and attorneys fees.it appended a verified and itemized statement of attorneys fees and costs,showing that it had calculated the total amount requested by multiplying the total hours each attorney expended in the litigation by each attorney respective hourly rate.caribbean did not object to brown forman request for attorneys fees and costs.absent an objection from caribbean,the district court entered a summary order awarding the total sum in attorneys fees that brown forman had requested.
we typically review an award of fees and costs for abuse of discretion.wennik polygram grp,cir.however,because caribbean failed to oppose brown forman request for attorneys fees and did not challenge the district court award,we review for plain error.united states richard,cir.under the plain error standard,we may reverse the district court award if the court engaged in particularly egregious or obvious legal error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.plain error applies only where the error results in a clear miscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.negrón caleb brett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
caribbean challenge to the district court grant of attorneys fees is.first,caribbean argues that it has not acted obstinately or frivolously in litigating this case,as required by puerto rico law to support an award of attorneys fees,see fajardo shopping,sun alliance ins.of puerto rico,cir,and,thus,that the district court grant of attorneys fees constitutes reversible plain error.second,it contends that,even if it is assumed arguendo that awarding attorneys fees to brown forman is appropriate in this case,the district court nonetheless plainly erred in computing the amount of the award,which was reached by multiplying the number of hours that brown forman attorneys expended in the litigation by their hourly rate.it is caribbean contention that the district court in effect employed the lodestar method that,per the puerto rico supreme court decision in corpak,art printing ramallo brothers,is not available under puerto rico law 
where,as here,the court jurisdiction is based on diversity of the parties,a district court award of attorneys fees is governed by relevant state law,in this case rule d of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure laws ann.tit,app.iii,rule d see also fernández,kellogg usa,cir attorneys fees are recoverable in diversity cases where a state law provides the right to recover such fees.
under puerto rico rule of civil procedure d,the award of attorney s fees to the prevailing party depends exclusively on the decision of the presiding judge with regard to whether or not the losing party,or his counsel,acted in a frivolous or obstinate manner.corpak,art printing.emphasis omitted.this rule was not designed as a premium to successful litigants,but rather as a penalty,reyes banco santander de,cir,to be imposed only in those cases where the court believes that the losing party,or his counsel,has been obstinate or frivolous.corpak,art printing.emphasis in the original.the general standard is that attorney s fees should be imposed in actions which result in a litigation that could have been avoided,which prolongs it needlessly,or that obliges the other party to embark on needless procedures.american airlines,cir quoting fernández san juan cement,offic.trans.
once the court makes the threshold determination of obstinacy or frivolousness,imposition of attorneys fees is mandatory.correa cruisers,a div.of kcs int l,cir.the amount of the fees awarded,however,is left to the discretion of the court.id.t he degree or intensity of the obstinate or frivolous conduct is the test or determining or critical factor to be considered by the court when calculating the attorney s fees that the obstinate or frivolous losing party shall bear.corpak,art printing.emphasis omitted.in addition,the court may consider factors such as the nature of the action,the questions of law involved,the amount at issue,the time spent,the efforts and professional activity needed for the case,and the skills and reputation of the lawyers involved.id.
under puerto rico law,attorneys fees are not meant to compensate a litigant for the total costs incurred in the law suit.corpak,art printing.rather,fee awards must be commensurate to that amount which,in the opinion of the court,reasonably represents the value of th e legal services,considering the degree of obstinacy or frivolousness and other circumstances of the case.asociación de condóminos trelles reyes,offic.trans.furthermore,as the lodestar method that allow courts to determine the attorneys fees award by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended in defending a case by a reasonable hourly fee,regardless of the degree or intensity of the losing party obstinate or frivolous conduct,are not available under puerto rico law.corpak,art printing.
the plain error standard of review imposes a high burden on caribbean.puerto rico,cir i t is rare indeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.for the reasons stated below,we find that the district court did not commit plain error in its award of attorneys fees to brown forman and,therefore,affirm on this issue.
first,although the district court failed to make an express determination as to caribbean obstinance or frivolousness,we find that such determination is sufficiently implicit and supportable on the record to withstand plain error review.for example,in its opinion and order dated november,the district court correctly noted that caribbean c learly did not meet the exclusivity requirement of law,and found caribbean assertion that the alleged sales representation agreements provided for the same payment terms as the promotional agreements to be preposterous.iom brown forman,d,emphasis added.also,the record shows that caribbean has put forth inconsistent arguments regarding the scope of the agreements 
caribbean argues that its actions can not be considered obstinate or frivolous in light of the fact that,at the time it filed the complaint,the puerto rico supreme court had yet to interpret law.this factor,however,is not sufficient to conclude that the district court committed plain error.pérez marrero colegio de cirujanos dentistas de puerto rico,the fact that the issue is new,does not give a party a carte blanche to act in an obstinate or frivolous manner.emphasis omitted.as previously explained,caribbean presented various inconsistent arguments and its facts failed to establish a number of the elements clearly required for a law claim.
in light of these considerations,we find that the record a plain error standard of implicit determination that caribbean conduct was frivolous.therefore,the district court did not commit plain error in awarding attorneys fees to brown forman.
second,for the reasons stated below,we find that the amount of the attorneys fees award granted by the district court to brown forman also withstands plain error review.
the puerto rico supreme court has held,while interpreting rule d,that the amount an obstinate or frivolous party must bear does not necessarily have to match the actual attorneys fees paid by the prevailing party.corpak,art printing.this is due to the fact that rule d does not seek to compensate the prevailing party.id.rather,its main purpose is to penalize or sanction a losing party with an attorneys fees award that is commensurate with the degree or intensity of his obstinate or frivolous conduct.id.
a court,however,is not precluded from deciding to a proper analysis under rule d the losing party must bear an attorneys fees award that matches the attorneys fees requested by the winning party,even if such amount coincides with what would otherwise be imposed if the court had calculated the award by using the lodestar method.in other words,the fact that the attorneys fees award granted by a court under rule d coincides with the reasonable attorneys fees expended by the winning party is not sufficient to find that the court plainly erred,provided that the award is supportable based on the losing party obstinate or frivolous conduct and the other circumstances of the case.such a sanction may be appropriate,for example,in a case where the court finds that the losing party conduct was particularly frivolous,since awarding the full amount of the reasonable fees requested by the prevailing party sends a message to the losing party that the action should never have been brought.
in light of the purpose of rule d and the finding of frivolousness in this case,we find that the district court did not commit plain error in determining the amount of the attorneys fees award.
in sum,we find that the district court attorneys fees award to brown the amount plain error review.accordingly,we affirm the district court order on this issue.conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we affirm all of the challenged district court orders.
