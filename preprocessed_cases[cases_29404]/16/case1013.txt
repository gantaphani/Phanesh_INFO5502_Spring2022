james easter,and ennie,ennie appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to american automobile insurance company aaic and denial of their motion for summary judgment in this declaratory judgment action.specifically,aaic sought and received a declaratory judgment that its insured,insurance agent tyrone murray,is not covered under its professional liability policy.this case presents a threshold issue of whether easter and ennie have standing to appeal.we conclude that ennie has standing to appeal as a directly injured party of the insured murray,but that easter does not have standing to appeal because his interests in this case are too remote and speculative.
on the policy coverage issue,we agree with the district court that murray was not covered under aaic policy.thus,for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court judgment.
on march,stephen meloni drove his vehicle while intoxicated and struck a pole,tragically killing his passenger,jessica easter.james easter,individually and as the administrator of the estate of his daughter jessica,filed a lawsuit on october,against ennie and steven meloni in the philadelphia county court of common pleas easter lawsuit.easter alleged that ennie illegally sold alcohol to gary grato,who then supplied that alcohol to meloni causing him to operate his vehicle negligently and recklessly.
in response to the lawsuit,ennie sought a defense and indemnification from its general liability insurer,century surety company century.century provided ennie with a defense under a reservation of rights and then filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court granted summary judgment to century,declaring that century did not owe ennie a defense or indemnification for the easter lawsuit because the insurance policy in effect during the relevant time period contained a liquor liability exclusion.
consequently,on november,ennie filed a lawsuit ennie lawsuit against its insurance agent,tyrone murray,alleging that murray negligently failed to place liquor liability insurance coverage for ennie.through its principal thai poeng,ennie claimed that it consulted with murray on august,with the purpose of obtaining insurance that would protect the company from any and all risks arising out of the business of operating a beer distributorship.ennie alleged that in,murray sold it the century insurance policy under the pretense that it protected ennie from these risks.with this belief,ennie renewed that policy annually through murray.murray attested that poeng renewed the century policy that was in effect during march in december,and that this policy did not contain liquor liability coverage.hence,ennie alleged that murray,as a licensed commercial insurance agent,breached his duty to advise it properly of the necessity or availability of liquor liability coverage.ennie contends that due to this breach of duty,it was required to pay the costs of its own defense in the easter lawsuit and has been subjected to a potential adverse judgment arising out of the lawsuit.
in response to the ennie lawsuit,murray sought a defense under his professional liability policy with aaic.

app.prior to his relationship with aaic,murray was covered under a liability policy from united states liability insurance company uslic from the period of november,through november.that policy had a retroactive date of november.hence,murray had a lapse in professional liability coverage from november,through december,immediately proceeding the january,effective date of the first aaic policy.
murray tendered his defense of the ennie lawsuit to aaic,and aaic provided murray with a defense under a reservation of rights to deny coverage and to seek recompense of all costs expended if it was determined that the aaic policy did not provide murray coverage.on may,aaic filed the present declaratory judgment action against murray,ennie,and easter in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,and subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that murray actions that were the basis for the ennie lawsuit were not covered under the aaic policy.ennie and easter for summary judgment.the main issues in dispute were the determination of the policy retroactive date,the date upon which the wrongful acts occurred,and whether the wrongful acts took place wholly after the retroactive date.easter and ennie argued that aaic must provide coverage because the retroactive date for the policy was november,and murray wrongful act of failing to insure ennie for liquor liability insurance on march,occurred after the retroactive date.aaic,on the other hand,maintained that ennie was not covered under the policy because the retroactive date of the policy was january,and murray wrongful act of failing to provide liquor liability insurance occurred in and continued at each policy renewal.
on december,the district court granted summary judgment to aaic,finding that murray wrongful act did not occur wholly after the aaic policy january,retroactive date and,therefore,murray was not covered under the policy.in january,ennie and filed timely notices of appeal from the district court judgment 
we raised the issue of standing sua sponte and as a threshold matter must determine whether easter and ennie are permitted to challenge the district court order.article iii of the constitution limits the federal courts to adjudication of actual c ases and c ontroversies.const.art.iii,cl.courts enforce the requirement through the several justiciability doctrines,p erhaps the most important of which is standing.toll,twp.of readington,cir quotation marks omitted.standing circumscribes the federal judicial power by requiring a litigant to show that it is entitled to have the court decide the merits of its case.allen wright.the three constitutional elements of standing are an injury in fact,that is,a concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest that is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical causation,the showing of a fairly traceable connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant and redressability,that is,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife.
the controlling case in this court on whether injured parties have standing in a declaratory judgment action in the insurance coverage context is federal kemper insurance rauscher,cir in that case,the insured driver,rauscher,and his two passengers were involved in an automobile accident,leaving one passenger permanently disabled.id.at.the insurance company,kemper,filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against rauscher and his passengers,asking the district court to construe rauscher insurance policy as not covering the accident.id.at.rauscher failed to answer,and the district court granted a default judgment to kemper against rauscher and the passengers,holding that the passengers rights were merely derivative of rauscher rights.id.we reversed,holding that a case or controversy existed between the insurance company and the injured passengers and,therefore,the passengers had standing to defend the declaratory judgment despite rauscher absence.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,we noted that the critical determination for standing to sue in this scenario was whether the rights of an injured party within the procedural context of a declaratory judgment action are truly derivative of the rights of the insured.id.at.if the rights of the injured party are derivative and not independent,then there would be no case or controversy,as there would be no real dispute between the injured party and the insurance company.id.we recognized that a case or controversy must exist between the insurance company and the injured third party under such circumstances,since the insurance company brought the declaratory judgment action against the injured third party in the hope of attaining a binding judgment against both the insured and the injured party.id.at.taking a realistic approach,we concluded that the injured party has an independent right to present its case upon the ultimate issues,apart from that of the insured,because in many of the liability insurance cases,the most real dispute is between the injured third party and the insurance company,not between the injured and oftentimes impecunious insured.id.quoting james moore et,moore federal practice.
applying the principles set forth in rauscher,we conclude that ennie has standing to appeal the district court order in this declaratory judgment action.like the passengers in rauscher,ennie is the directly injured party and its interests in the lawsuit are,therefore,independent of the insured murray.ennie has a particularized interest in the lawsuit because a determination of murray coverage would dictate its ability to receive the full benefit of the ennie lawsuit.
the holding in rauscher,however,does not extend to easter,as he is an injured party.unlike ennie,easter interests in this lawsuit are purely derivative of the injured third party interests.essentially,the only interest easter has in the lawsuit is the potential pecuniary gain that will flow to him through ennie,since he has failed to make any claims directly against the insured.for easter to recover any of the insurance proceeds,he would have to prevail in his lawsuit against ennie,which would have to prevail in its lawsuit against murray,who would have to prevail on this appeal of the district court judgment in favor of aaic.counsel for easter conceded at oral argument that standing here would be based on a process,and it is this process that makes easter interest merely speculative.notably,easter has failed to identify a court that has permitted standing for a party with derivative claims of the injured third party in a declaratory judgment action between an insured and insurer.we conclude that easter does not have standing to pursue this appeal,as his interests in this declaratory judgment action are too remote and speculative,absent any contractual assignment of rights under the insurance policy therefore,only ennie has standing to pursue this appeal.
we will now address the interpretation of the policy between aaic and murray to determine if aaic is required to provide murray with insurance coverage for the ennie lawsuit.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same legal standard as it should have.vitalo cabot,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in conducting our analysis,we must view the record in the light most favorable to ennie,and must draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see vitalo,at.to defeat summary judgment,however,ennie must show that the materials cited do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute.c.

in determining aaic responsibility to provide insurance coverage to murray,we must first address the retroactive date of the aaic policy and then decide whether murray wrongful act occurred wholly after that retroactive date.an interpretation of the amendatory endorsement,specifically the term immediately preceded,will determine the retroactive date.ennie argues that the retroactive date must be determined by considering only paragraph.a of the amendatory endorsement,and,as such,the retroactive date must be the retroactive date which immediately preceded the first policy american automobile insurance company issued to the agent.app.ennie contends that the policy which immediately preceded the first aaic policy beginning january,was the policy issued by uslic covering the period of november,through november,because that policy was the last in time.hence,ennie maintains that the retroactive date of that policy,november,also governs the aaic policy.in the alternative,ennie contends that if immediately preceded is open to two different interpretations,then we must construe the term against the insurer and conclude that immediately preceded means next in line.
ennie also dismisses paragraph.b of the amendatory endorsement,maintaining that its language and lapse provisions are not applicable to murray.paragraph.b applies only if the agent was added after the inception date of the first american automobile insurance company policy.app.ennie argues that murray was an insured under the first aaic policy from its inception.importantly,ennie notes that paragraph.b is the only section referencing lapses in coverage,and it therefore contends that such lapses are only relevant where there has been a lapse between two aaic polices.ennie thus argues that paragraph.b is inapplicable because murray was insured under the first aaic policy since inception,and there were no lapses in aaic coverage because the two policies were continuous.
aaic argues that paragraph.a of the amendatory endorsement supports a retroactive date of january.under paragraph.a,aaic proposes that the definition of immediately is without interval of time,without delay,straightaway,or without any delay or lapse of time.aaic br.quoting black law dictionary ed.as such,aaic contends that there was no policy that immediately preceded the first aaic policy since there was a delay and lapse of time between murray coverage with uslic and aaic.according to paragraph.a,therefore,murray retroactive date would be the first effective date of coverage for his aaic policy,january.aaic contends that this is the only logical interpretation that could have been contemplated by the parties,as the alternative would provide murray coverage despite large gaps in time.for example,taking ennie argument to its extreme,aaic notes that 
if murray were uninsured for a long period of time and,for instance,his most recent previous policy was in effect from november,to november,and he had a thirty year gap in coverage he would have a november retroactive date under the aaic policy.
the district court,in determining the retroactive date,aptly pointed out that aaic policy was poorly drafted,specifically citing two drafting errors in the amendatory endorsement.importantly,the district court correctly assumed that the introductory language of the amendatory endorsement the retroactive date means the earlier of mistakenly utilized a semicolon instead of a colon.app.after assuming a colon was intended in order to allow the amendatory endorsement to make sense,the district court noted that examining the language of paragraph.a in isolation would reasonably support ennie policy interpretation of the term immediately meaning next in line.id.however,because pennsylvania law dictates that the endorsement be read as a whole,the district court concluded that the indentation of the lapse language in paragraph.b was also erroneous because restricting the lapse provision to paragraph.b would mean it would never apply because the analysis would end after paragraph.a,which under ennie interpretation ignores any gap in coverage without regard to the extent of its duration.app.the district court noted that not applying the lapse language to paragraph.a renders it superfluous and creates absurd results,and then determined that the only reasonable interpretation of the endorsement as a whole is to give effect to the lapse provision in all instances of lapse in coverage.id.this interpretation dictates,in light of murray lapse in coverage,a retroactive date of january,the inception date of the aaic policy.
we agree with the thorough and thoughtful analysis by the district court regarding the retroactive date.pennsylvania law dictates that we read the policy language regarding the retroactive date as a whole in the context of the entire amendment and we must attempt to give effect to all of its provisions.in doing this,it is clear that the lapse provisions must be applicable to both paragraphs of the endorsement in order to give logical meaning to paragraph.a and the lapse provisions themselves.this interpretation also protects the purpose of claims made policies and retroactive dates,which are meant to limit an insurer coverage,and avoids the absurd result of giving effect to dates decades in the past.
applying the lapse provision to paragraph.a,we are not persuaded that the term immediately preceded is an ambiguous term.while it is true that this court is bound to construe any ambiguities in insurance contracts in favor of the insured,reading immediately preceded in light of the lapse provision removes any ambiguity about the term,as the date of retroactivity in the policy that immediately preceded the aaic policy is only relevant if the insured has maintained continuous insurance coverage.since murray allowed his coverage to lapse,the retroactive date is the inception date of the first aaic policy issued january,we therefore agree with the district court interpretation of the retroactive date and conclude that the policy language is not ambiguous.
for coverage under the aaic policy,both the claim and wrongful act by murray must have occurred wholly after the retroactive date of january.since it is not disputed that the claim occurred after the retroactive date,the determination of coverage will depend solely on the characterization and timing of the wrongful act.the policy defines wrongful act as a ny actual or alleged negligent act,error or omission,or negligent misstatement or misleading statement app.ennie maintains that murray only wrongful act was failing to advise and provide liquor liability insurance to ennie on the specific date of the accident,march.ennie argues that any negligence attributable to murray before that time did not result in any harm and,therefore,did not give rise to any claims for which coverage is sought under the aaic policy.ennie relies on case law regarding negligence causes of action and occurrence insurance policies,which requires,as in all negligence claims,proof of damages in the alternative,ennie also argues that murray met with a representative of ennie to discuss its insurance coverage after january.ennie contends that murray wrongful act occurred during this meeting where murray failed to advise him of his need for liquor liability coverage.
aaic maintains that murray wrongful act occurred in the fall of when he failed to provide liquor liability coverage and continued at each policy renewal through the last renewal in december.aaic concedes that murray met with ennie regarding its policy in,but argues that this meeting was the continuation of murray wrongful act that had already occurred.
like the district court,we are not persuaded by ennie argument that the wrongful act occurred on the specific date of the accident.ennie reliance on case law regarding insurance coverage disputes that result in lawsuits of negligence is misplaced.here,we are not reviewing a cause of action for negligence,but are tasked with interpreting the policy language.the policy defines wrongful act as a ny actual or alleged negligent act,error or omission,or negligent misstatement or misleading statement.app.as negligent act is not defined in the policy,we are instructed to gi
