in this case under of the labor management relations act of lmra,equitable resources,equitable challenges the district court order enforcing an arbitration award entered in favor of the united steel,paper and forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,allied industrial and service workers international union,and its local collectively,the union.in early,equitable announced its plan to integrate the operations and employees of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries,kentucky west virginia gas company,kentucky west into two other wholly owned subsidiaries operating in kentucky.following announcement of the integration,in june the union filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky to compel equitable and kentucky west to arbitrate successorship issues under the union collective bargaining agreement with kentucky west the cba.the cba included a successorship clause stating that kentucky west agreed to make any sale,lease,transfer,or assignment of the operations covered by this agreement conditional upon the successor entity assuming the cba.the district court dismissed the union action after equitable and the union agreed to arbitrate the successorship issues under the cba.equitable moved forward with its corporate restructuring plan,and,effective july,kentucky west ceased to exist.
equitable,purporting to represent kentucky west interests,appeared at the arbitration.on july,the arbitrator entered an award in favor of the union that required equitable to abide by the cba until it expired in october the award.the arbitrator concluded as a matter of contract interpretation that the restructuring triggered the cba successorship clause and reasoned that equitable could be liable under the clause for multiple reasons,including equitable status as the entity that assumed kentucky west legal obligations after it ceased to exist july,as kentucky west alter ego,and as the entity that received kentucky west operations after july.equitable then filed the instant complaint under of the lmra to vacate or modify the award,alleging multiple defects in the award.the union counterclaimed for enforcement of the award and filed a for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the union,enforcing the award.
on appeal,equitable argues that the district court erred in enforcing the award because the arbitrator exceeded his authority in ordering equitable,a to the cba,to honor the cba as the remedy for kentucky west breach of the successorship clause,which resulted in multiple alleged defects in the award.guided by the highly deferential standard of review for arbitration awards that interpret a collective bargaining agreement outlined in michigan family resources,service employees international union,cir.en banc,cert.denied,we affirm the district court order enforcing the award.
facts and procedure 
the union entered into the cba with kentucky as a delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of equitable resources,effective october,through october.doc.answer,ex.cba at.the cba includes successorship language in section of article ii recognition 
the company agrees that if during the life of this agreement,it discontinues operations,sells,leases,transfers or assigns the operations covered by this agreement,it shall inform the purchaser,lessee,transferee or assignees of the exact terms of this agreement and shall make the sale,lease,transfer,or assignment conditional upon the purchaser,lessee,transferee,or assignee,assuming all the obligations of the agreement until its expiration date and treating affected employees of the bargaining unit in accordance with the terms of this agreement.the company agrees to provide the union with written notice when the transaction is complete and the agreement is assumed.

in early,equitable announced that it was undertaking a corporate restructuring for efficiency purposes that would eliminate kentucky west and move its operations and employees to two wholly owned subsidiaries of equitable,equitable midstream and equitable productions both of which had undergone operations changes prior to january.under this plan,kentucky west would cease to exist effective july.the union filed a grievance with kentucky west on march,and then an amended grievance on may.on may,equitable responded to the union,stating that the grievance was.the union then filed suit in the district court under of the lmra,requesting a preliminary injunction to stay the restructuring and compel arbitration with kentucky west so that the union would be able to arbitrate with kentucky west or equitable without either party being able to argue that arbitration was no longer available under the cba.after telephonic conference calls with the district court,the parties agreed to settle by submitting the case to arbitration,and the union withdrew its suit.
arbitration was held on july.as stated in the award,the question presented to the arbitrator was did the company kentucky west violate the collective bargaining agreement when it refused to secure an assurance from its parent company,equitable resources,that the agreement would be honored after the company assets were transferred to a new entity if so what shall the remedy be doc.answer,ex.award at.the arbitrator found that the predecessor language to article ii,section that was included following negotiations in made it clear and unambiguous on its face that it applies to any such wholesale transfer of work and that o n its face this applies to both external and internal transfers.id.at.the arbitrator concluded that it was clear that insofar as this contract was concerned,the prospect of th is very sort of internal transfer was contemplated by the terms of article ii.the clear understanding was that this was a condition precedent to this transfer and that equitable understood and agreed to this as well.id.at.
the arbitrator found that i t is of some significance that while kentucky west is referenced in the preamble as the company it is also identified as a subsidiary of equitable resources,id.at.the arbitrator found that 
what was clear was that equitable representatives sat at the negotiating table,participated in the negotiations actively and in fact were in reality the ones making most if not all of the decisions regarding the substantive terms of the labor agreement in the bargaining leading up to the current labor agreement.
what is also clear,and this too was not controverted by the company at the hearing,is that at least for purposes of these negotiations,the two companies acted very much as though they were one.certainly as a factual determination,it was quite clear that equitable knew and agreed to the terms of the labor agreement and it was based on that expression of agreement that the union signed the current labor agreement.
id.at citation omitted.the arbitrator reviewed and distinguished prior arbitrations between kentucky west and the union and concluded that none dictated the outcome here because none had dealt with a similar situation that fell squarely within article ii,section as a transfer of the entire operations of kentucky west to another entity.id.at.
the arbitrator supported his ability to arbitrate the dispute after kentucky west ceased to exist under john wiley sons,livingston,nlrb burns international security services,and howard johnson detroit joint executive board here.id.at.in his discussion,the arbitrator in part premised his ability to bind equitable to the cba on the theory that equitable was the successor entity and had agreed to be bound by the cba during its negotiations here it was clear that equitable directed and was responsible for the merger with kentucky west and that its representatives sat at the bargaining table and negotiated the successorship clause which by its very terms purports to bind equitable as a condition precedent to the merger.id.at,referring to equitable as the successor employer to kentucky west.the arbitrator also found that equitable was kentucky west alter ego it is determined that even though the two corporations are legally separate,equitable was in fact,for purposes of the negotiations leading to the cba and for this determination the alter ego of kentucky west and was therefore expressly bound by the terms of the successorship clause found at article ii,section of the parties labor agreement.id.at.the arbitrator found fairly transparent equitable argument that the parent company really did this is sic and therefore can not be bound by the agreements its wholly owned subsidiary agreed to in good faith at the bargaining table.id.at.
the arbitrator ultimately concluded that 
the terms of article ii,section apply to any transferee,such as a subsidiary of equitable and it frankly makes no difference what entity the assets are sold to or merged with.the contract is hereby interpreted to apply as a condition precedent to any such transfer including one to another equitable subsidiary.
the only logical reading of the language of article ii section is that even if the parent made the decision to require kentucky west to transfer it s assets,either inside or outside of the equitable stable of companies,the conditions precedent to such a transfer would be for kentucky west to assure that the terms of the agreement were honored this again is a matter of contract and the clear terms requiring such assurance prior to the transfer.
accordingly,for the reasons stated herein,it is determined that the plain and unambiguous terms of the agreement at article ii section required equitable,as the successor employer to kentucky west,to honor all of the terms and conditions of the labor agreement between kentucky west and the union herein until its expiration on october,for the former kentucky west employees covered under that agreement.
equitable filed the instant suit in the district court on august,seeking to vacate the award.the union counterclaimed for enforcement and filed a motion for summary judgment equitable filed a for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the union and affirmed the award f or the reasons stated on the record and for those provided by the union in their briefs.doc.at dist.minute entry order.equitable timely appeals from the district court order 
ii.analysis 
equitable claims that the award is defective for four separate reasons.first,equitable asserts that the arbitrator acted outside of his authority by imposing the cba on.second,equitable asserts that the arbitrator necessarily resolved a labor representation dispute not committed to arbitration.third,equitable argues that the remedy the award dictates will violate public policy in implementation.and finally,equitable contends that the arbitrator dispensed his own brand of industrial justice.we will address,and reject,each of equitable contentions in turn.
standard of review 
this c ourt reviews a district court grant of summary judgment in a labor arbitration dispute de novo,applying the same standard of review that we employ in other summary judgment cases.totes isotoner int l chem.workers union local,cir.however,we afford great deference to the arbitrator decision 
in an appeal from an arbitrator decision interpreting a collective bargaining agreement,our review is confined to ascertaining whether the arbitrator erred.in doing so,we apply the highly deferential standard of michigan family resources and uphold the arbitrator decision so long as she was arguably construing or applying the contract and was not disqualified by fraud or a conflict of interest.

b.the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by creating parties to the cba 
an arbitrator does not exceed his authority every time he makes an interpretive error he exceeds that authority only when the collective bargaining agreement does not commit the dispute to arbitration.family,at.this approach severely curtail s the scope of authority concept such that an award should not be vacated unless an arbitrator reaches a question not committed to him by the parties.totes isotoner,at quoting truck drivers local allied waste,cir internal quotation marks omitted.equitable does not argue that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in finding that kentucky west breached the cba,and indeed conceded this at the summary judgment hearing.doc.summ.tr.at.instead,equitable argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in ordering equitable to honor the cba as the remedy for kentucky west breach because equitable is not a party to the cba.id.at.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that e ven if wrong in determining the terms or parties to the contract,that is a legal error that the court could not fix.id.at.the district court further found that the arbitrator factual finding that equitable agreed to step into the shoes of kentucky west for purposes of the arbitration and any remedy was supported and that this finding of fact was made as part of the arbitrator contract interpretation.id.at.the district court concluded that equitable put the question of whether it was bound by the cba clearly,squarely before the arbitrator and he rejected equitable argument.id.at.
the award states the question presented to the arbitrator as did the company kentucky west violate the collective bargaining agreement when it refused to secure an assurance from its parent company,equitable resources,that the agreement would be honored after the company assets were transferred to a new entity if so what shall the remedy be doc.answer,ex.award at.in its complaint,equitable stated that 
the primary issues at the arbitration were whether the core issues of representation raised by the union grievance render it unarbitrable whether kentucky west breached article ii section of the cba when equitable imposed a restructuring and if a breach is found,whether there are any monetary damages for the time period from july,through october.

doc.union summ.mot.at citations omitted.these statements reflect the issue statements each party submitted to the arbitrator in their briefs.
we conclude that the arbitrator determination that equitable could be held liable under the terms of the cba was a question of contract interpretation that the parties submitted to the arbitrator.the errors that equitable alleges the arbitrator made are errors of law based on findings of the arbitrator could not have entered the award if he had correctly interpreted the contract under precedent.however,the arbitrator repeatedly stated that his conclusions were grounded in his interpretation of the contract.see,doc.answer,ex.award at t his matter is one which remains a matter of contract did equitable agree to be bound by the terms of the existing labor agreement between the union and kentucky west.the award has all the hallmarks of interpretation h e refers to,quotes from and analyzes the pertinent provisions of the agreement,and at no point does he say anything indicating that he was doing anything other than trying to reach a interpretation of the contract.family,at.the arbitrator reasoned that equitable could be liable under article ii,section for multiple reasons,including as the entity that assumed kentucky west legal obligations after it ceased to exist july st,as kentucky west alter ego,and as the entity that received kentucky west operations after july contrary to equitable contention,the arbitrator interpretation of the cba did not actually make equitable or others a party to the cba the arbitrator determined in his interpretation of the cba that the parties intended article ii,section to be triggered by the instant transaction and that equitable,through kentucky west,was bound by these terms.
first,the arbitrator interpreted article ii,section to manifest clearly the intent of the union,kentucky west,and equitable,as a participant in the cba negotiations and prior any internal or external transfer of kentucky west operations would require kentucky west to secure compliance with article ii,section as a condition precedent,regardless of who or what was the successor entity.doc.answer,ex.award at.with this interpretation,the arbitrator determined that kentucky west violated the provision when equitable restructuring took place.the arbitrator then had to determine who was liable for this violation.the arbitrator addressed and distinguished all of the prior arbitration awards and nlrb rulings that equitable cites on appeal.id.at it is significant that in none of the prior awards was the complete and total loss of the unit involved here the question is whether the terms of the agreement must be honored by the successor entity as a precondition of the sale.as discussed herein,there is no limitation on whether the successor entity is internal or external the integration can not occur without the provisions of article ii being triggered.id.at.distinguishing a true arms length transaction,the arbitrator specifically found that equitable knew and agreed to the terms of the cba,that the contract contemplated the type of internal transfer at issue,and that t he clear understanding was that article ii,section was a condition precedent to this transfer and that equitable understood and agreed to this as well.id.at.the arbitrator rejected equitable argument that representational issues precluded arbitrability,finding support under supreme court precedents to arbitrate the dispute after kentucky west ceased to exist.id.at.
we acknowledge that the arbitrator was influenced by the facts and circumstances here that the successor through its actions and express statements made by its authorized representatives at the bargaining table in fact did agree to b e bound by the terms of the predecessor labor agreement and did in fact assume those responsibilities.id.at.but,as the arbitrator concluded,
this case is not governed necessarily by operation of law or by nlrb precedent,although those considerations are relevant,it is governed by the terms of the contract agreed to by the parties.the one fact that comes through this case like a bolt of lightening sic is that the parties negotiated for this very scenario and agreed,with equitable representatives a part of that agreement,that the terms of the cba would be honored.the bottom line on this entire case is that the collective bargaining agreement survived the merger between kentucky west and equitable because the parties,including equitable,agreed that it would.
id.at first emphasis added.further,the arbitrator found that 
the essential facts in this case demonstrate a very clear intent that equitable as the parent company of kentucky west in the first place and the surviving company for all the kentucky west operations and all of its employees intended through the operation of the successorship clause to be bound by it s terms for the former kentucky west employees.this does make it a matter of contractual interpretation and thus appears to invoke the courts authority to order arbitration under the contract.
id.at.even with his finding that equitable was liable as the parent and legal successor,the arbitrator proceeded to find that equitable had both an express and implied obligation to honor the terms of the prior agreement as the successor based on the clear contractual terms and the facts of the negotiations.id.at.although equitable is correct that the arbitrator did point to evidence from the negotiations,the arbitrator prefaced his reference to this evidence with language showing that he understood its limited evidentiary value,stating that it merely supported his earlier findings interpreting the cba id.at.
from our review of the award,we conclude that the arbitrator was arguably construing or applying the contract in the manner he deemed required to resolve the dispute the parties placed before him.see.family,at internal quotation marks omitted.any legal or factual errors that the arbitrator may have committed related to alter ego status or successor were related to his contract interpretation and application attempts and did not exceed his authority.w hen an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract,and no dishonesty is alleged,the arbitrator improvident,even silly,factfinding does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award.id.at quoting major league baseball players ass garvey,internal quotation marks omitted.
without considering the concessions that the union has urged us to accept regarding equitable representation of kentucky west before the district court and the arbitrator,we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his authority in determining whether equitable was liable for kentucky west breach under the cba once he determined that a breach of the cba did occur.w hen a contract is scrutinized for evidence of an intention to arbitrate a particular kind of dispute,national labor policy requires,within reason,that an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute be favored.john wiley sons,livingston,internal quotation marks omitted id.at finding that specific arbitration issues can raise a broader question of the effect of a merger.further,t he extraordinary deference given to an arbitrator ultimate decision on the merits applies equally to an arbitrator threshold decision that the parties have indeed submitted a particular issue for arbitration.int l ass of machinists aerospace workers.valley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because it is not clear that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of the issue submitted in determining whether equitable could be liable for the breach,we can not overturn the award on this basis.id.this dispute is not one that is without any basis in the cba.see.family,at dobson,iron workers local union,app x,cir unpublished opinion upholding arbitration award because making the contested determination was a reasonable way to determine whether that party is violating that clause and is arguably construing the contract peterbilt motors uaw int l union,app x,cir unpublished opinion.the award represents the arbitrator legal and factual findings under the cba an arbitrator award may only be deemed to have not drawn its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when it conflicts with express terms of the agreement,imposes additional requirements that are not expressly provided in the agreement,or can not be rationally derived from the terms of the agreement.int l ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted.any ambiguity in the collective bargaining agreement permitted,indeed required,the arbitrator to engage in construction of the agreement,which is all we are asked to determine.family,at.even if we concluded t hat he chose the wrong path in justifying the award that would not give us a warrant to vacate it.id.therefore we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his authority by interpreting the cba in a way that allowed equitable to be found liable for the breach.
c.the arbitrator did not exceed his authority to resolve representational questions 
although the arbitrator rejected equitable argument that representational issues precluded arbitrability,equitable asserts that the arbitrator necessarily had to decide representational issues to create the remedy,and that representation issues are outside of an arbitrator authority and thus were not within the scope of the issue presented.although the federal courts without question indulge in a presumption in favor of arbitration,the arbitrator,in determining arbitrability,is constrained by the principle that a party may not be forced to arbitrate any dispute that it has not,by contract,obligated itself to arbitrate.peterbilt motors,app x at citing.family,at united steelworkers mead,cir.the arbitrator is not free to invent contract provisions that will support a finding of arbitrability.id.at.
the district court found that the arbitrator made a legal decision to treat the issue of whether equitable was bound as a successor as a contract interpretation issue and not as a representational issue under labor law.doc.summ.tr.at.indeed,the arbitrator repeatedly stated that he was dealing with a question of contract interpretation this matter is one which remains a matter of contract did equitable agree to be bound by the terms of the existing labor agreement between the union and kentucky west.doc.answer,ex.award at.we agree with the arbitrator conclusion that he did not necessarily have to decide the representation issues equitable raised in order to interpret the cba and impose a remedy because the arbitrator imposed specific performance on equitable as the for kentucky west.contrary to equitable contention,our unpublished opinion in dobson industrial,iron workers local union does not require the opposite conclusion.in construing the contract in dobson,the arbitrator determined that it must also determine whether an alter ego relationship existed,which the company asserted raised an impermissible representation issue that the arbitrator decided against the company.dobson,app x at.however,because the potential representation issue arose within the contract interpretation,we concluded in dobson that the arbitrator decision drew its essence from the contract and,in light of a broad arbitration clause similar to the one in the cba here,the issue could be decided in arbitration.id.at.the same reasoning applies here.as the district court found,the arbitrator only ordered equitable to honor the cba,and i t for the company to figure out in that scenario how to do it legally without running afoul of majority status or unit appropriateness issues.doc.summ.tr.at.
moreover,that an arbitrator may have implicitly decided a representational issue does not necessarily mean that he exceeded his authority because collateral representational issues may remain outside the nlrb exclusive jurisdiction.when a dispute is primarily representational under or of the national labor relations act,simply referring to the claim as a breach of contract is insufficient for the purposes of federal courts jurisdiction,but matter s primarily of contract interpretation,whi ch potentially implicat e representational issues,remain within the federal courts jurisdiction.int l of workers,local trafftech,f d,cir quoting paper,chem.energy workers int l union air prods,cir alterations in original.there are two types of situations in which a dispute will be treated as primarily representational where the board has already exercised jurisdiction over a matter and is either considering it or has already decided the matter,or where the issue is an initial decision in the representation area.id.at internal citations,quotation marks,and alteration omitted.as in trafftech,in the instant case the arbit rato r need not resolve the representational dispute to determine whether the company has violated its collective bargaining agreement.id.at.the union does not question whether it may represent the employees of the other subsidiaries,and it did not ask the arbitrator to decide whether this was possible or to require equitable to bargain with the union for ongoing representation the issue was whether equitable could be liable for kentucky west violation of the existing cba and not whether future representation was possible.see air prods,at,see also john wiley sons,at holding that a union without majority status in the newly merged company could still represent employees in arbitration under former agreement.the fact that equitable sees potential representation issues in the remedy does not preclude the remedy,and equitable may still present such issues to the nlrb.see trafftech,at.
therefore we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his authority to decide a representational issue in this case because the arbitrator successor decision was permissible in furtherance of his interpretation of the cba.
d.the award remedy does not violate public policy 
equitable next contends that the remedy ordered in the award violates public policy by requiring recognition of a minority bargaining unit by a,in violation of the public policy in the national labor relations act nlra,specifically of the nlra.the narrow public policy exception makes an arbitration award unenforceable if it is contrary to an explicit,well defined,and dominant public policy that is ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.associated coal united mine workers,dist,quoting grace local union,int l union of united rubber,cork,linoleum plastic workers,internal quotation marks omitted.the question is whether the actual arbitration enforcement of the interpretation of the public policy,not whether the breach of the labor agreement or the potential actions that could be taken in response to the award violate public policy.shelby county health care am.fed.state,county mun.employees,local,cir see also columbia gas of ohio,util.workers union,app x,cir unpublished opinion.we tak e the facts as found by the arbitrator in determin ing whether the arbitrator interpretation of the contract jeopardizes a and dominant public policy.int l union,uaw dana,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as we stated above,the award clearly draws its essence from the contract.family,at quoting misco,at.the arbitrator found that the union and kentucky west included successorship language in the cba that would require kentucky west to condition any transaction such as the one at issue here on the continuation of the cba.the award merely requires equitable,as the for kentucky west,to honor this mandate and be liable for its breach.equitable does not argue that article ii,section is unenforceable as a violation of public policy,or that there is no legal way to fulfill its mandate or the award.see grace,at recognizing that specific performance of collective bargaining agreement term would violate public policy because in violation of federal discrimination laws,but upholding arbitration award of damages for breach of contract.we conclude,as did the district court that the arbitrator was acting well within the bounds of the cba.see shelby county health care,at finding award that follo
