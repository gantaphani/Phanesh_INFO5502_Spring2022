general motors corporation appeals the district court certification of a nationwide rule b class of cadillac deville owners who allege breach of express and implied warranties.for the reasons that follow we reverse the district court ruling and remand for entry of an order denying class certification.
factual and procedural background 
general motors corporation gm manufactured and sold over and model year cadillac devilles devilles in the united states.the devilles feature air bag systems and side impact sensing modules sisms,the latter of which trigger inflation of the vehicle side impact air bags under certain conditions.this class action centers on alleged defects in the sisms.
in september,gm sent a voluntary recall notice to all deville record owners and lessees explaining that gm 
has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists and may manifest itself in your or model year cadillac deville.gm ha s learned of a condition that can cause the side impact air bags in your car to deploy unexpectedly,without a crash,as you start your car or during normal driving.
gm indicated that it had received reports of inadvertent deployment out of approximately affected vehicles.gm further explained that it was working to obtain replacement sisms and that it would contact deville owners again when replacement sisms were available so that owners could take their devilles to a dealership for the installation of two new sisms.gm expected those replacement sisms to be available to a first group of owners in april.gm additionally provided safety recommendations for the interim and a phone number for customers who had questions.
replacement of the sisms was delayed because the manufacturing line for the and sisms had been dismantled.gm did not have enough replacement parts to implement a general recall of all devilles until may.according to gm,it devised a recall plan to overcome this production problem.using available components,gm produced replacement sisms by november.gm referred to these as service build modules and offered them to owners who called the phone number and expressed particular concerns about the recall.gm engaged a vendor to manufacture the remaining replacement systems,which were referred to as replacement build modules.
among the owners who received gm voluntary recall notice were the named plaintiffs and now class representatives beverly cole,anita perkins,and jewell lowe collectively,plaintiffs.lowe is the mother of one of plaintiffs counsel,perkins is a paralegal for another of plaintiffs counsel,and cole is the paralegal cousin.each purchased a or deville equipped with the sisms at issue however,the sisms in their vehicles were not among those that had deployed inadvertently.nevertheless,after receiving gm september letter,plaintiffs filed a class action suit against gm in federal court in october.in response,gm contacted plaintiffs in november and offered to replace the sisms in their devilles immediately with replacements from gm stock of service build modules.according to plaintiffs,they rejected gm offer because gm did not extend the offer to all deville owners and gm would not answer questions about the source of the parts,the number available,and whether the sisms had been properly tested.plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed this first suit.
plaintiffs filed the present class action suit in louisiana state court on december.gm removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction to the western district of louisiana.on january,plaintiffs moved for class certification pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on behalf of a ll persons and legal entities who have acquired,whether by purchase,lease,donation or otherwise anywhere in the united states,or cadillac devilles equipped with side impact air bag systems and side impact sensing modules.their motion for class certification specifically excluded deville owners who sustained bodily injury or death as the result of the unexpected or premature deployment of a side impact air bag.
briefing and discovery on class certification issues ensued.meanwhile,gm began a phased general recall of and devilles in may by sending recall letters to deville record owners and lessees pursuant to this general recall,lowe sisms were replaced in september,and perkins and coles sisms were replaced in october.according to gm,it completed mailing recall notices to all deville record owners and lessees on december,and the majority of those owners and lessees have had their sisms replaced.plaintiffs do not dispute that gm recall is now complete.
in their first amended and restated class action complaint complaint,plaintiffs allege that gm promoted side impact air bags,which included sisms,as an added safety feature in its and devilles.plaintiffs also allege that gm has admitted that a defect exists in the and the cadillac devilles which can cause the side impact air bags to deploy unexpectedly,without a crash,when the car is started or during normal driving.plaintiffs further assert that gm did not repair or replace the sisms within a reasonable time after the sale lease of the subject vehicles.based on these allegations,plaintiffs aver that gm 
has failed to deliver to plaintiffs and the class members the thing purchased,has delivered a thing other than the thing purchased,has breached express and implied warranties of sale,has sold and delivered to plaintiffs and the class members a thing containing defects under the redhibition laws of the state of louisiana and the comparable provisions of the uniform commercial code,has breached contracts with plaintiffs and the class members,and such conduct has damaged plaintiffs and the class members.
plaintiffs seek recovery from gm for 
return of the purchase or lease price,or,alternatively,for a reduction of the purchase or lease price,the loss of the benefit of the bargain,or the difference between the value of the vehicle as delivered and the value it would have had if it had been delivered as warranted,and for all other pecuniary economic damages as permitted by the redhibition laws of the state of louisiana the comparable provisions of the uniform commercial code,punitive damages,if permitted,interest at the legal rate from the date s of purchase,or alternatively,from the date of judicial demand,until paid,together with reasonable attorney fees,and all costs.
finally,both the complaint and the motion for class certification assert that questions of law and fact common to the class included 
a whether gm breached its contractual or quasi contractual obligations to the class,including without limitation,the warranty against vices and defects,the warranty of merchantability,all express warranties and warranties implied by law 
b whether the defective sisms with which the and cadillac devilles are equipped diminish the usefulness or value of the vehicles 
c whether the sisms with which the and cadillac devilles are equipped are defective such that plaintiffs have been deprived of the difference in value between what they were promised and what they received 
d whether the and cadillac devilles equipped with the aforementioned side impact airbag system are fit for their intended use and 
e whether restitution or,alternatively,reduction,of the purchase lease price,and other pecuniary economic damages,under the redhibition laws of the state of louisiana the comparable provisions of the uniform commercial code punitive damages,if applicable attorney fees are available to plaintiffs and the class members.
for reasons that are not apparent,the district court appointed a special master to review the motion for class certification and other related documents on september,the special master concluded that rule prerequisites were satisfied and recommended certification of a rule b class.gm objected to the special master recommendation in october,contending that plaintiffs lacked standing and that plaintiffs failed to satisfy rule requirements of predominance,superiority,adequacy,and typicality.again for reasons that are not apparent,the district court took nearly three years to enter its ruling.on august,the district court accepted the special master recommendation,certified the class and named cole,perkins,and lowe as class representatives.
gm now brings this interlocutory appeal under rule f,asserting that the district court abused its discretion in certifying a nationwide class of plaintiffs bringing claims under the laws of jurisdictions.gm asserts generally the same arguments it made below.
ii.standing 
before we reach the questions regarding the class certification,we must resolve the standing question as a threshold matter of jurisdiction.rivera,cir.as a jurisdictional matter,standing is a question of law that we review de novo.bonds tandy,cir.facts expressly or impliedly found by the district court in the course of determining jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error.rivera,at.
at an irreducible constitutional minimum,to have standing,plaintiffs must establish three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,plaintiffs must show that they have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting whitmore arkansas,d.second,plaintiffs must establish a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.id.finally,it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.quoting simon.welfare rights,d.
gm argues that plaintiffs lack standing because the air bags in their vehicles never deployed inadvertently,and therefore,they can not have suffered an injury in fact.they argue that without actual deployment,plaintiffs injury is speculative because plaintiffs can only claim that the sisms in their vehicles were potentially defective.because plaintiffs air bags never deployed inadvertently,gm contends that plaintiffs advance the kind of products liability suit we dismissed for lack of standing in rivera,at.
in contrast,plaintiffs argue that even though they have not suffered physical injury,they have suffered economic loss satisfying the requirement because the sisms in all devilles were defective at the moment of purchase.plaintiffs allege that they contracted to purchase devilles with side impact air bags that would deploy only under certain circumstances involving a side impact but that they received devilles with air bags that could deploy unexpectedly,without a crash as the car is started or during normal driving.plaintiffs further allege that gm promised to repair any defect related to materials or workmanship occurring during the warranty period within a reasonable time,but that after admitting the defect,gm did not in fact repair or replace their sisms within a reasonable time.plaintiffs claim that all devilles contained defective sisms at the moment of purchase and that therefore,their injury was concrete at the moment they purchased their devilles.they assert that their injury is that there is a difference between what they contracted for and what they actually received.
in rivera,purchasers of a prescription drug sought recovery of economic damages after learning that the manufacturer had withdrawn the drug from the market because the drug had caused liver damage to other patients.rivera,at.we concluded that the rivera plaintiffs lacked standing because they described their claim as emanating from the drug manufacturer failure to warn and sale of a defective product,but the plaintiffs did not claim that the drug had caused them any physical or emotional injury.id.at.although the plaintiffs quantified their injury in terms of economic damages,we concluded that merely asking for economic damages failed to establish an injury in fact because the plaintiffs never defined the source of their economic injury.id.the plaintiffs could not assert damages because they had no contract with the manufacturer.id.at.due to these factors,we determined that the injuries that the plaintiffs alleged were suffered not by them,but rather,by the patients suffering liver damage.id.at.and we referred to the rivera plaintiffs claim as a products liability suit.id.at.
rivera is distinguishable from the instant case.in rivera,the plaintiffs sought damages for potential physical injuries because they never suffered actual physical injuries,they could only allege injuries that were suffered by.the rivera plaintiffs did not assert economic harm emanating from anything other than potential physical harm.here,although plaintiffs do not assert physical injuries either their own or those of other persons,they do assert their own actual economic injuries.plaintiffs allege that each plaintiff suffered economic injury at the moment she purchased a deville because each deville was defective.plaintiffs further allege that each plaintiff suffered economic injury arising from gm unreasonable delay in replacing their defective sisms.plaintiffs seek recovery for their actual economic harm,overpayment,loss in value,or loss of usefulness emanating from the loss of their benefit of the bargain.notably in this case,plaintiffs may bring claims under a contract theory based on the express and implied warranties they allege.whether recovery for such a claim is permitted under governing law is a separate question it is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiffs seek recovery for an economic harm that they allege they have suffered.see parker district of columbia,the supreme court has made clear that when considering whether a plaintiff has article iii standing,a federal court must assume arguendo the merits of his or her legal claim.citing warth seldin,d.we therefore conclude that plaintiffs have established a concrete injury in fact and have standing to pursue this class action.
iii.class certification 
background 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that several preliminary conditions be met before a proposed class of plaintiffs may be certified.first,rule a provides that certification is proper 
only if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.if rule a prerequisites of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy are met,then the proposed class must additionally satisfy one of the three provisions for certification under rule b.plaintiffs here sought certification of a rule b class,which requires additional showings of predominance and superiority,that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to certify a class for abuse of discretion.spence glock,cir castano am.tobacco,cir.notwithstanding the district court broad discretion to certify a class,it must do so within the bounds of rule.spence,at.the district court must rigorously analyze rule prerequisites before certifying a class.id.failure to do so or the commission of a legal error while doing so may be the basis of reversal.see,id.at concluding that because district court erred in its choice of law analysis,it therefore abused its discretion castano,at concluding that because district court erred in predominance inquiry,it therefore abused its discretion.although the strength of a plaintiff claim should not affect the certification decision,it is necessary for the district court to go beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements of rule have been met a court must understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.castano,at.the court must also consider how a trial on the merits would be conducted if the class were certified.id.at.the party seeking certification has the burden of proof on rule prerequisites.mcmanus fleetwood,cir.
gm argues that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of adequacy and typicality under rule a and predominance and superiority under rule b.because we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the predominance requirement was satisfied,we find it unnecessary to address all of gm challenges.
to satisfy the predominance requirement,plaintiffs must demonstrate that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.in a diversity class action,as is the case here,inherent in the predominance inquiry is a determination of which states substantive laws will apply to the claims.this is because if multiple states laws apply and those laws vary,the variations may impact whether common issues of law and fact predominate among the class members.the rule b certification inquiry must therefore consider how variations in state law affect predominance.castano,at.
federal courts must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state.klaxon stentor.plaintiffs argued and the district court agreed that under louisiana choice of law rules,the laws governing plaintiffs claims are the laws of the state where the vehicle is used by its owner or lessee and in where sic the contract of repair is to be performed.thus,the laws of all jurisdictions all fifty states plus the district of columbia apply to this class action.
we have recognized that in a class action governed by the laws of multiple states,such as this one,variations in state law may swamp any common issues and defeat predominance.castano,at accord georgine amchem,cir holding that predominance was defeated,in part,by the number of differing state legal standards applicable to the controversy,aff,d.the party seeking certification of a nationwide class must therefore provide an extensive analysis of state law variations to reveal whether these pose insuperable obstacles.spence,at quoting walsh ford motor.and the district court must then consider how those variations affect predominance.castano,at.failure to engage in an analysis of state law variations is grounds for decertification.see castano,at concluding that court abused its discretion in certifying class where plaintiffs had failed to properly address variations in state law such that conclusion of predominance was based on speculation spence,at concluding that court abused its discretion in certifying class where plaintiffs had failed to carry their burden of providing an extensive analysis of applicable law.
plaintiffs assert that they have analyzed the applicable laws of the jurisdictions and they are virtually the same.they conclude that predominance is unfettered in this case because any variations in the substantive law applicable to this case are not significant and would not affect the result.they further conclude that neither complex jury instructions nor multiple separate trials will be required to try the common issues in this proceeding under the laws of the jurisdictions.
as support for their argument,plaintiffs provided the district court with an extensive catalog of the statutory text of the warranty and redhibition laws of the jurisdictions implicated in this suit included in this catalog is the text of the relevant provisions of the louisiana civil code and the ucc provisions of states and the district of columbia plaintiffs additionally provided an overview of textual variations in the relevant ucc provisions as adopted by the fifty jurisdictions.finally,plaintiffs submitted a report from an expert on contract law who opined,after analyzing some variations,that the few variations in the provisions of ucc article relevant to this case are such that they do not affect the result and that louisiana law does not differ from article in a manner that would affect the result.
gm,on the other hand,provided the district court with extensive charts of authority concerning express and implied warranty actions from the jurisdictions showing,inter alia,variations among the states in regard to reliance,notice of breach,vertical privity,and presumptions of merchantability.despite gm showing,the district court concluded that applying the laws of jurisdictions would not make the class unmanageable or cause individual issues to overcome common ones because louisiana law and the relevant ucc provisions adopted by virtually every other jurisdiction provided similar protections for express and implied warranties.the district court adopted plaintiffs assertion that common issues predominated over individual ones because all members of the class asserted the same benefit of the bargain warranty claim based on the fact that they contracted for a vehicle that did not have a potentially defective side airbag system,but instead received a vehicle with a side airbag system that had the potential to deploy inadvertently.
we conclude that plaintiffs did not sufficiently demonstrate the predominance requirement because they failed both to undertake the required extensive analysis of variations in state law concerning their claims and to consider how those variations impact predominance.spence,at quoting walsh,at.plaintiffs assertion of predominance relied primarily on the textual similarities of each jurisdiction applicable law and on the general availability of legal protection in each jurisdiction for express and implied warranties.plaintiffs largely textual presentation of legal authority oversimplified the required analysis and glossed over the glaring substantive legal conflicts among the applicable laws of each jurisdiction.
as we explain below,there are numerous variations in the substantive laws of express and implied warranty among the jurisdictions that the plaintiffs failed to extensively analyze for their impact on predominance.although plaintiffs assert that the laws of the jurisdictions are virtually the same,such that no complex jury instructions or multiple separate trials would be necessary,we note that many of the variations in state law raise the potential for the application of multiple and diverse legal standards and a related need for multiple jury instructions.for some issues,variations in state law also multiply the individualized factual determinations that the court would be required to undertake in individualized hearings.specifically,the laws of the jurisdictions vary with regards to whether plaintiffs must demonstrate reliance,whether plaintiffs must provide notice of breach,whether there must be privity of contract,whether plaintiffs may recover for unmanifested vehicle defects,whether merchantability may be presumed and whether warranty protections extend to used vehicles.plaintiffs failed to articulate adequately how these variations in state law would not preclude predominance in this case.
to create an express warranty under ucc,an affirmation of fact or promise or a description of the goods by the seller must be part of the basis of the bargain.ucc.there is a clear split of authority among the jurisdictions as to whether a buyer must show reliance on a statement or representation for it to be considered part of the basis of the bargain.see generally barkley clark christopher smith,the law of product warranties ed identifying three distinct approaches and collecting cases.some jurisdictions require a strict showing of reliance.see,hendricks callahan,cir applying minnesota law overstreet norden,cir applying kentucky law speed fastners,newsom,cir applying oklahoma law hagenbuch tools,applying new hampshire law coryell lombard merkur,d,applying illinois law.other jurisdictions have no reliance requirement.see,winston,stuyvesant ins,so d,applying alabama law young cooper,vestring,applying kansas law villalon vollmering,applying texas law interco randustrial,applying missouri law.and still other jurisdictions have applied a rebuttable presumption of reliance.see,royal bus,lorraine,cir applying indiana law sessa riegle,applying pennsylvania law,aff cir.but plaintiffs ignored these differences.although plaintiffs expert noted that some courts require reliance,instead of analyzing the variations among the jurisdict
