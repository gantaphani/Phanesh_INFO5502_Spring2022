in a bench trial,lana keeton and her company,great events,keeton corporation were found jointly and severally liable to taylor steel for,as a result of keeton failure to pay for five truckloads of steel that she ordered from taylor steel on behalf of a third party.to hold keeton liable in her personal capacity,the court had to pierce the corporate veil.keeton appeals pro se,contending that the district court holding was against the weight of the evidence,that taylor steel owed her money because it sold her defective steel,and that the district court improperly pierced the corporate veil to hold her personally liable.the clerk of this court denied keeton pro se appeal on behalf of her company,so keeton,in her individual capacity,is the only appellant.we affirm the district court.
keeton,through her company great events,keeton keeton,of which she is the sole shareholder,officer,director,and employee,acted as a steel broker and outside steel salesperson.the transaction at issue in the suit concerned a large purchase of steel that keeton made on behalf of its client,mountain metals,from taylor steel.keeton placed the mountain metals order for tons of steel in august.as per taylor steel standard practice with keeton,the company was sold steel on a limited credit line,requiring either cash in advance or payment within ten days of invoicing.taylor steel had maintained these terms with keeton since first doing business with the company in,due to its knowledge that keeton had limited credit and generally did business on a cash flow basis.
keeton paid in a timely fashion for the first ten truckloads of steel shipped to mountain metals.this suit concerns the last five truckloads,shipped during january and february,amounting to worth of steel.in order to pay for these shipments,keeton obtained a letter of credit from mountain metal made out to keeton,not to taylor steel.the five truckloads were shipped,mountain metals paid keeton on the letter of credit,but keeton never paid taylor steel.
the parties have stipulated to all of these facts.the parties also stipulate that keeton returned three coils of steel as unacceptable and that taylor steel credited keeton the full amount of these coils.the stipulated total amount owed on the five truckloads of steel,then,is.taylor steel sued for an action upon an account and for fraud and sought to pierce the corporate veil.
the defendants counterclaimed for breach of commissions contract,breach of contract,and tortious interference with contracts and business relationships.for the first their counterclaim that the steel shipped to mountain metals was not prime steel and that it was not properly warranted,defendants calculated that they owed taylor steel only.in addition,defendants sought damages in the amount of for commissions that keeton claimed taylor steel owed keeton for sales made to sari,a company keeton had brought to taylor steel and for taylor steel tortious interference with keeton business relationship with mountain metal in selling directly to that company.keeton claims that she refused to pay taylor steel and ceased all communications with that company in march due to these complaints.taylor steel offered proof that it continued to pay keeton her commission and refrained from dealing directly with mountain metals as long as keeton was in contact with taylor steel.
after taylor steel initiated the present suit,keeton closed the keeton bank account,put great events,and keeton out of business,and formed a new company,lana keeton,llc,to continue her steel brokering business.
the district court found keeton liable for the full and pierced the corporate veil to extend liability to keeton herself.the court denied taylor steel complaint for fraud,finding that keeton did not contract with taylor steel with the intent to defraud it,and the court denied all of the defendants counterclaims.this appeal,ostensibly on behalf of keeton and lana keeton individually,followed.
because neither a corporate officer nor a shareholder may appear on behalf of the corporation,the clerk of the court properly denied keeton the right to represent her company.doherty american motors,cir canderm pharmacal,elder pharmaceuticals,cir see also rowland california men colony,d in re,cir.therefore,we consider only the question of keeton personal liability for the corporate liability.
we review the factual findings of the district judge in a bench trial for clear error,and the legal findings de novo.pressman franklin bank,cir.great deference is demanded when the factual findings required the judge to make credibility determinations.anderson city of bessemer city,d.this being a diversity case,the district court looked to the choice of law provisions of the forum state ohio,properly leading it to apply ohio law.
under ohio law,an action on an account is appropriate where the parties have conducted a series of transactions,for which a balance remains to be paid.amf,mravec,ohio app d,ohio app.dist,paragraph of the syllabus.to succeed in an action on an account,the plaintiff must prove both all the elements of the contract and that the contract is one that involves transactions usually the subject of a book account.am.sec,baumann,ohio app d,ohio app.dist.the parties produced invoices demonstrating the transactions in question.they further stipulated to the contract to pay for the five truckloads of steel and the failure to make that payment.
the district court found unsupported keeton claims that she withheld payment because the shipped steel was not prime,as specified in the order,and because taylor steel owed her money from past commissions and was trying to deprive her of future earnings by direct dealing with her customers.the evidence for all of this derives entirely from keeton trial testimony,which the judge did not find credible.keeton produced no other evidence that she complained about the quality of the steel to taylor steel,nor has mountain metals complained.and while the district judge chose to believe taylor steel unsupported testimony that the steel had been properly warranted rather than keeton unsupported testimony that it had not,we defer to the reasonable credibility determinations of the district judge.thus,this finding of fact can not be said to be clearly erroneous.
furthermore,taylor steel produced undisputed evidence that,as late as march,it had continued to pay keeton commissions and it had promised not to deal directly with mountain metals.at that point,keeton ceased all communication with taylor steel,refusing to answer phone calls from the company and refusing to pay the money she owed it.keeton oral contract to represent taylor steel as an outside salesperson and as a broker presupposed that she would be actively trying to solicit sales for the company.once she ceased to communicate with taylor steel in march,she was no longer acting in the company interest,and the company was no longer obligated to avoid direct dealing with her clients or to pay her a commission on sales it continued to make to clients she had brought it.
therefore,we find that the judge did not clearly err in finding the defendant companies liable to taylor steel for the full amount owed on the five truckloads of steel shipped to mountain metals.
we are somewhat less sanguine about the district court decision to pierce the corporate veil.nonetheless,we affirm on different grounds.see abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir pointing out that b ecause this court de novo review involves only application of legal propositions to the undisputed facts in the record,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record even if different from the reasons of the district court.under ohio law,
the corporate form may be disregarded and individual shareholders held liable for corporate misdeeds when control over the corporation by those to be held liable was so complete that the corporation has no separate mind,will,or existence of its own,control over the corporation by those to be held liable was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to disregard the corporate entity,and injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong.

grossly inadequate capitalization,failure to observe corporate formalities,insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time the debt is incurred,shareholders holding themselves out as personally liable for certain corporate obligations,diversion of funds or other property of the company property for personal use,absence of corporate records,and the fact that the corporation was a mere facade for the operations of the dominant shareholder s.
leroux billyle supper club ma,ohio app d,ohio app.dist.however,because of the equitable nature of the doctrine,no list of factors can be exclusive or exhaustive.lumber ltv steel,cir applying ohio law.
applying the criteria listed in leroux billyle,the district court held that keeton was the alter ego of keeton because keeton was the president and sole shareholder of great events,keeton and made all corporate decisions keeton said,i am keeton corporation the company was a financially desperate entity in terms of capitalization and revenue,having only in its corporate account and owing on its line of credit account,even while it was purchasing tens of thousands of dollars of steel from taylor steel keeton did not produce any corporate records or minutes showing that great events,keeton was maintaining the proper corporate formalities,and that keeton testified that she did not keep any records or lists of account receivables sic and keeton commingled funds.we point out,as a preliminary matter,that several of these findings do not stand up under close scrutiny.
first,the district judge placed a great deal of weight on keeton statement at trial that i am keeton corporation.keeton made this statement when,on,taylor steel counsel asked her,as of march in the year,you had not spoken to keeton corporation for at least a month keeton answered,i am keeton corporation.to which counsel replied,i sorry,with taylor steel.keeton was doing nothing more here than pointing out to the attorney that he had misspoken.taking this statement out of context to assert that keeton was claiming that her personal identity was synonymous with keeton was erroneous.
second,although inadequate capitalization is often a key justification for piercing the corporate veil,it is not an absolute prerequisite.see leroux billyle,at.keeton,as a steel brokering firm,operated on cash flow,a reality that taylor steel acknowledged when it gave the company very limited credit terms.keeton only incurred liabilities when it bought steel,and it only bought steel when a customer wanted it.presuming that keeton customers paid for the steel,as did mountain metals in this case,the company should not necessarily have been unable to pay its debts just because its capitalization was minimal.
third,the district judge assertion that keeton failed to keep a list of accounts receivable is meaningless in light of keeton unrebutted testimony that she kept a file of invoices recording her accounts receivable.and while taylor steel placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that keeton did not register the name keeton corporation in florida,its place of business,until december,the trial exhibits show that keeton began doing business in florida as a foreign corporation in march,filed its fictitious name in august,had notice of the name published in a miami newspaper in september,and was notified in october of an omission in the filing requiring it to refile.while keeton may have been remiss in not filing immediately upon doing business in florida,the evidence does not show that she refrained from filing in order to defraud taylor steel.
finally,the district judge found that keeton commingled funds of her various companies,all of great events,during the period in which she owed taylor steel the outstanding balance.emphasis added.while we will discuss the issue of commingling further below,in the events to which the judge refers,keeton used great events accounts to fund what she called business trips abroad.she claims the purpose of these trips was to promote boxing matches.the judge chose not to believe this testimony.regardless of his assessment of keeton veracity,however,the judge statement of timing is incorrect.all of the events to which he refers took place one year before the problem with to taylor steel arose.
these errors notwithstanding,we find that under ohio law,taylor steel did meet its burden of proving that keeton was the alter ego for her businesses.as belvedere explains,the corporate form is a legal fiction created for convenience that may be disregarded when the purpose for which it was intended is abused.at.for this reason,ohio law allows the corporate veil to be pierced and individual shareholders or directors held liable when it would be unjust to allow the shareholders to hide behind the fiction of the corporate entity.ibid.we find that keeton abuses the corporate form when she uses it in this suit to shield herself from liability for the debts she,and she alone,caused her company to incur to taylor steel.we note once again that piercing the corporate veil is an equitable remedy,available not where a set list of factors are established but where maintaining the corporate form would work injustice upon an innocent party.
a number of factors persuade us that the veil should be pierced in this case.taylor steel demonstrated that keeton exercised complete dominion over keeton and that she alone decided on behalf of the corporation to withhold payment for the truckloads of steel.while keeton did create a separate identity for her company,maintaining,for example a separate bank account,email address,and phone number for it,as the sole officer,director,and shareholder,she made all of the company decisions.one of those decisions was to withhold payment from taylor steel even though mountain metals had paid keeton.another decision was to refuse to take the calls from taylor steel seeking payment.a third decision was to hold hostage the money keeton owned taylor steel because keeton,in her individual capacity as an outside salesperson for taylor steel,believed she was not receiving her proper commission.
furthermore,keeton had sole control over the movement of funds among her various businesses.while she normally paid taylor steel from accounts belonging to keeton,sometimes she chose to pay from accounts belonging to great events.she testified that she paid keeton bills from whichever of her various corporate accounts had the necessary funds.while we do not believe that this amounted to commingling of funds,since each of keeton business entities were merely of great events,we do find that it indicated her absolute control over these businesses.
although a corporation is a separate legal entity from its shareholder even where there is only one shareholder in the corporation,zimmerman eagle mortgage,ohio app d,ohio app.dist,ohio courts have held that the existence of only a single shareholder can be a powerful indicator of that shareholder exercising control so complete over the corporation that it had no separate mind,will or existence of its own.stypula chandler,wl,at ohio app.dist,sole shareholder and director held personally liable zimmerman,at same intergy,carrigan,wl,at ohio app.dist,same.based on the evidence that keeton used keeton and the other great events,entities as a convenient forum for her various personal business ventures,we find that she so completely dominated keeton that it had no mind or will of its own and was nothing but keeton alter ego.
with regard to the other claims of commingling of funds and failure to maintain corporate formalities,we do not find that taylor steel has met its burden on these points the record contains hints,but nothing resembling proof of these claims.circle research ctr.galbreath,ohio app d,ohio app.dist holding that the party seeking to pierce t
