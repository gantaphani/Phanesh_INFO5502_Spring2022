we agree that the district court correctly granted summary judgment to perkinelmer with respect to most of the claims.however,we conclude that under massachusetts law the purchase agreement contains an implied contractual term that required perkinelmer to use reasonable efforts to develop and promote sonoran technology.accordingly,in this one respect,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.in all other respects,we affirm.
because this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment,we view the record in the light most favorable to the parties here sonoran and donahue.morelli webster,cir.
sonoran is an arizona corporation founded in by donahue,an engineer and businessman,to develop and market ctp technology to the newspaper and graphic arts industries.the ctp technology developed by sonoran was intended to be a digital printing alternative,superior to the costly and analog process required by conventional plate technology.sonoran ctp technology required a greater initial capital investment from customers than conventional technology approximately per unit,but potentially offered significant cost savings over the life of the product.as of,sonoran had developed a prototype ctp machine,but had not made any sales.although there was interest in sonoran product,some customers expressed concern as to whether the company was too small to assure support for the unproven technology.by,sonoran was running out of cash despite donahue investment of approximately million of his own money in the company.facing these challenges,sonoran sought a purchaser to undertake the continued development and marketing of its ctp technology.
perkinelmer is a massachusetts corporation headquartered in wellesley,massachusetts.in late,donahue approached perkinelmer to determine if perkinelmer was interested in purchasing sonoran ctp business.perkinelmer was amenable to donahue overtures,and after negotiations,agreed to purchase substantially all of sonoran assets and business.
perkinelmer and sonoran executed an asset purchase agreement purchase agreement on may.under of the purchase agreement,at closing perkinelmer paid million.some significant portion of that amount went directly to sonoran unsecured creditors.in addition,and of the purchase agreement entitled additional earnout payments provided that perkinelmer would pay sonoran additional amounts if certain ctp product sales targets were met each year between and.under the terms of the provisions,perkinelmer would pay sonoran if at least three ctp machines were sold in the first year following closing,million less any previously paid amounts if at least ten machines were sold by the end of the second year,and additional amounts if certain gross margin targets on sales of ctp machines were met.the additional earnout payment over and above the million during the five year payout period was a maximum of million.
also relevant to this dispute are and of the purchase agreement.section,entitled sharing of data,provided in part that the parties agree that from and after the closing date they shall cooperate fully with each other to facilitate the transfer of the acquired assets from the seller to the buyer and the operation thereof by the buyer.purchase agreement b emphasis added.section stated that the buyer or a subsidiary of the buyer shall offer employment to those employees identified on schedule attached hereto schedule,in turn,listed eight sonoran employees and stated whether or not each had accepted an offer of employment from perkinelmer.the only employee on schedule who had not accepted an employment offer before execution of the purchase agreement was norm bogen,sonoran chief of sales and marketing and principal salesman.
perkinelmer also entered into a separate employment agreement employment agreement with donahue,under which donahue was to serve as site leader and general manager of the ctp business for perkinelmer for a salary of per year.the employment agreement also specified that donahue would be eligible to receive,for five years,bonuses limited in the aggregate to million based on ctp sales and to be calculated in a manner similar to the payments potentially payable to sonoran.the annual bonus section of the employment agreement stated that donahue would have the right to consult with perkinelmer regarding the pricing of ctp product sales.
upon closing,sonoran ctp business which remained located in tucson,arizona became part of perkinelmer azusa,lithography systems division lithography.
it is undisputed that the ctp business,as operated by perkinelmer,was a failure.between may and october,only one ctp unit was sold and no additional amounts were paid under the provisions of the purchase agreement or employment agreement to sonoran or donahue.according to sonoran and donahue,the ctp business failure to thrive was the avoidable result of a series of unreasonable and bad faith decisions by perkinelmer.
by perkinelmer was pursuing an exit strategy for the ctp business.in september perkinelmer sold its ctp assets to macdermid.in october perkinelmer shuttered the ctp business and laid off the associated staff,including donahue.
on november,sonoran and donahue sued perkinelmer in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship.insofar as is pertinent to this appeal,sonoran and donahue sued to recover on four separate theories.first,sonoran alleged that perkinelmer breached the express terms of the purchase agreement by failing to cooperate fully with sonoran and by failing to hire bogen in accordance with and respectively of the purchase agreement.second,sonoran and donahue claimed that perkinelmer breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in both the purchase agreement and the employment agreement by engaging in bad faith conduct.third,sonoran claimed that perkinelmer breached the implied terms of the purchase agreement by failing to make good faith and reasonably competent and diligent efforts to develop,market,and sell sonoran ctp products.finally,sonoran contended that perkinelmer violated chapter.laws ch,by engaging in unfair or deceptive conduct 
following discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to perkinelmer on all four claims.the court held that no express term of the purchase agreement had been violated.with regard to breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in both the purchase and employment agreements,the court held that t he parallel economic interests of the parties compels a conclusion that perkinelmer did not intend to deny plaintiffs the fruits of the contract s and thus that no breach could be shown.sonoran,d at.the court added that e ven were this court to find that perkinelmer intended to deny the plaintiffs the benefit of the contractual earnouts,on the record before the court,the plaintiffs would have great difficulty establishing that perkinelmer conduct caused the injuries the plaintiffs allege and that they have not presented evidence sufficient to establish their damages with the necessary certainty.id.the court further found that the purchase agreement contained no implied obligation to continue operating the ctp business in the face of millions of dollars of losses.id.at.finally,the court held that sonoran chapter claim must fail because the claim relies exclusively on the same set of operative facts as the plaintiffs failed common law claims,and thus summary judgment was appropriate on that claim as well.id.at.
sonoran and donahue timely appealed from the judgment of the district court dated december,and we have jurisdiction under.

breach of the express terms of the purchase agreement 
sonoran first contends that perkinelmer breached the express terms of the purchase agreement,focusing on and of the agreement.the district court held that no reasonable jury could conclude that perkinelmer breached any express provision,and we agree.
we begin with sonoran contention that perkinelmer breached b of the purchase agreement.that provision,entitled sharing of data,provided in part that the parties agree that from and after the closing date they shall cooperate fully with each other to facilitate the transfer of the acquired assets from the seller to the buyer and the operation thereof by the buyer.purchase agreement b emphasis added.although sonoran apparently contends that the shall cooperate fully language of b created a freestanding obligation on the part of perkinelmer to cooperate with sonoran and donahue in operating the business,the unambiguous language of the provision was to the contrary.see,eigerman putnam,courts interpret contracts according to plain terms where these are unambiguous.specifically,b stated that the duty of cooperation was intended to benefit the parties shall cooperate to facilitate transfer of sonoran business to the buyer and to facilitate the operation thereof by the buyer.purchase agreement b emphasis added.the district court correctly held that no basis exists to conclude that perkinelmer breached of the purchase agreement.
equally unavailing is sonoran argument that perkinelmer breached of the purchase agreement by failing to hire bogen.that provision stated that the buyer or a subsidiary of the buyer shall offer employment to those employees identified on schedule attached hereto purchase agreement first emphasis added.sonoran maintains that the district court erred by failing to give any meaning to the phrase shall offer employment such that perkinelmer was required to make a better offer to bogen.
during negotiations with perkinelmer before execution of the purchase agreement,donahue made clear to perkinelmer that bogen would require a raise from his current salary of a year to a year,as well as reimbursement for commuting expenses and a fair commission,in order to remain with the business.in april perkinelmer made offers to the eight sonoran employees listed in schedule of the purchase agreement,including norm bogen.perkinelmer offered bogen only his current salary with no additional amount for expenses or commission.bogen rejected the offer.upon learning of bogen rejection,donahue asked greg baxter,the head of lithography,to increase the offer.baxter represented that he would get a better offer for bogen after closing,though no such language was added to the purchase agreement.perkinelmer never made a better offer to bogen,and bogen never accepted employment with perkinelmer.
we agree with the district court that only required perkinelmer to make a bona fide offer of employment to bogen it did not require perkinelmer to make any particular offer to bogen or to make a second,better offer to bogen after closing when the first offer was rejected by bogen schedule of the purchase agreement confirmed this interpretation of.that schedule listed eight sonoran employees,including bogen,and indicated that each employee but bogen had accepted perkinelmer offer of employment by the may,closing.this clearly indicated that making an offer of employment before execution of the purchase agreement complied with.under these circumstances,the failure to make an offer of employment to bogen after execution of the purchase agreement could not be a violation of the purchase agreement.
in sum,the district court correctly granted summary judgment that perkinelmer did not breach any express terms of the purchase agreement.
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
sonoran and donahue further contend that perkinelmer breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in both the purchase agreement and the employment agreement by engaging in bad faith conduct,including misrepresenting its intention to give bogen a better offer and failing to disclose the lithography division true financial condition.the district court rejected this claim on the ground that there was no evidence that could support a finding that perkinelmer intended to deprive sonoran or donahue of the fruits of the contracts.
the parties devoted much of their briefing for this claim to the issue of whether specific intent is a necessary element of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.indeed,massachusetts law is unclear whether specific intent is required for this claim but it is not necessary to resolve the specific intent dispute.establishing a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires at least bad faith conduct.see schultz hosp.trust bank,cir equip.for indus.northmeadows constr,shawmut bank,wayman,see also famm steel,sovereign bank,cir.
the district court correctly determined that there were only two potential instances of alleged bad faith on perkinelmer part both instances concerned only the purchase agreement and not the employment,perkinelmer representations regarding its intention to offer bogen a better employment contract and its failure to inform sonoran and donahue that its lithography division was struggling financially.however,statements that are made before a contract is executed are inadequate for a claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.accusoft palo,cir it is implicit in the definition of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that the prohibition contained in the covenant applies only to conduct during performance of the contract,not to conduct occurring prior to the contract existence,such as conduct affecting contract negotiations.citing fdic leblanc,cir,and restatement second of contracts,cmt.c see also eigerman putnam,stating that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing only concerns the manner in which existing contractual duties are performed human res.dev.press,ikon office solutions,wl,at,dist.lexis at.
while the failure to make a new and better offer to bogen occurred after the execution of the purchase agreement,the alleged bad faith conduct here was the representation during negotiations that a offer would be made to bogen.in other words,the bad faith act occurred before,not after,execution of the purchase agreement.the same is true with respect to the representations as to the financial condition of the lithography division.
thus,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment that perkinelmer did not breach the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.
breach of the implied reasonable efforts term of the agreement 
sonoran next asserts that,under the purchase agreement,perkinelmer had an implied obligation to exert reasonable efforts to develop and promote sonoran technology,and that it breached its obligation.perkinelmer in turn argues massachusetts does not recognize such an implied obligation,at least not under the circumstances involved here.we conclude that perkinelmer did have an implied obligation under the purchase agreement to use reasonable efforts,and we reverse and remand for a determination of whether perkinelmer breached this obligation with respect to the purchase agreement only.
