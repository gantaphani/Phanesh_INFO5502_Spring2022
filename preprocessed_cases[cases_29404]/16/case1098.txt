congress recognized that multiemployer pension plans affected millions of americans and found that withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan,its participants and beneficiaries,and relations.a.it intended for the mppaa to uniformly impose withdrawal liability and to relieve the funding burden on remaining employers and to eliminate the incentive to pull out of a plan which would result if liability were imposed only on a mass withdrawal by all employers.debreceni,at quoting,reprinted in cong.to solve this problem,the mppaa requires that a withdrawing employer pay its share of the plan unfunded liability.see,at.this insures that the financial burden will not be shifted to the remaining employers.see cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund slotky,cir.
section provides that a withdrawing employer is liable for its share of the plan unfunded vested benefits.a it is the duty of the pension plan to determine whether withdrawal liability has occurred and in what amount.section provides that the amount of an employer withdrawal liability is the employer proportionate share of the unfunded vested benefits existing at the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws.b a.a complete withdrawal,as in this case,occurs when an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan,or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.a.t he date of complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.e.the obligation to contribute arises under one or more collective bargaining or related agreements,or as a result of a duty under applicable relations law.a.although all covered operations is not defined in the statute,we have held that it means the substantial cessation of normal business activity.crown cork seal,cent.states se.sw.areas pension fund,cir.
supervalu,a wholesale food distributor,was a contributing employer to the fund,which is a defined benefit multiemployer pension plan governed by erisa,as amended by the mppaa.employers agree to contribute to the fund based on collective bargaining agreements cbas with various local teamsters unions.the fund,in turn,provides retirement benefits for the employees of the participating employers.supervalu and the teamsters local the union had cbas which required supervalu to contribute to the fund on behalf of employees at supervalu belle vernon,pennsylvania facility through january,or the cessation of covered work.
at the beginning of,supervalu decided to close the belle vernon facility for business reasons.on march,supervalu informed its employees of the decision,and that the closure would occur by late summer.as a result of the closure,approximately employees would lose their jobs.supervalu and the union engaged in negotiations from march until may regarding the effects of the closing.
the negotiations included discussions regarding supervalu potential withdrawal liability to the fund.if supervalu withdrew prior to june,the end of the fund plan year,it would incur no withdrawal liability because the fund did not have any unfunded vested benefits at the end of the prior plan year.see b a.however,if withdrawal occurred after june,during the plan year,supervalu would incur significant withdrawal liability based on the unfunded vested benefits that would exist at the end of the plan year.see id.
it is clear from the record that supervalu was aware of its potential liability under both scenarios.first,at supervalu request,the fund informed it of the status of the fund assets as of april there was a negative return on the assets during the first of the plan year.additionally,supervalu informed the union of the potential withdrawal liability if it were to withdraw in the plan year.at a bargaining meeting,a supervalu representative stated that terminating the cbas after june,would place supervalu in another plan year and make it liable for a large unfunded liability.supervalu also explained to the union that its members would not benefit from supervalu continued participation in the fund,and that supervalu would rather the money go directly to its employees.
based on this knowledge and its desire to maximize its employees benefits,supervalu proposed that the cbas,which were set to expire on january,be terminated and replaced prior to june.it informed the union that the early termination would prevent supervalu from being assessed withdrawal liability for the plan year,which was estimated at the time to be in the range of to million.if the union agreed to the early termination,supervalu would make additional payments to its employees as consideration for the agreement.
in may,the union and supervalu signed a new agreement the termination agreement.under the termination agreement,the prior cbas terminated at on june.the termination agreement was identical to the prior cbas,except that the provisions regarding supervalu contributions to the fund were deleted.additionally,the new terms provided that employees who were entitled to severance payments would receive a lump sum of and that employees that continued working after june,would receive a per hour salary increase the agreement was ratified by the union members on may and june.
supervalu submitted its final contributions to the fund on june.it also informed the fund that its obligations to contribute ceased on june,when it would withdraw as a participating employer from the fund.as supervalu withdrew during the plan year,it believed that it would not incur any withdrawal liability.
however,in february,the fund sent supervalu a letter assessing in withdrawal liability against supervalu because it withdrew during the plan year see.the letter explained that after conducting an investigation,the fund believed that supervalu entered the termination agreement with a principal purpose of evading or avoiding withdrawal liability in violation of erisa c according to the fund,even though the facility did not close until july,supervalu withdrew on june,in order to avoid its share of the unfunded vested benefits that were expected to exist at the end of the plan year.therefore,for purposes of calculating supervalu withdrawal liability,the fund treated supervalu as having withdrawn during the plan year and ignored the june,date in the termination agreement in accordance with c.
in a letter dated may,supervalu requested a review of the fund demand letter as allowed under the fund withdrawal liability procedures and the applicable statutory provisions,see.supervalu argued that its contribution obligations ended on june.additionally,supervalu argued that the termination agreement was a bona fide,arm length agreement which took it outside of erisa evade or avoid provision.receiving no response to its letter,supervalu initiated arbitration on october,pursuant to erisa.
before the arbitrator,the parties made for summary judgment and agreed to limit argument to the issue of whether supervalu engaged in the transaction to evade or avoid liability under c of erisa the arbitrator found that c was unambiguous and that the plain language applied to the transaction at issue in this case.according to the arbitrator,supervalu was aware of its potential liability and persuaded the union to enter the termination agreement to enable supervalu to avoid the liability.the union was willing to agree as supervalu offered a bonus to each employee,as well as a pay increase for the remaining employees.such an arrangement,according to the arbitrator,fit squarely within the plain language of c.therefore,the arbitrator granted summary judgment in favor of the fund.
supervalu filed a complaint in the district court seeking to modify the arbitrator award pursuant to erisa and,and.the case was initially heard by a magistrate judge,francis caiazza,and the parties made for summary judgment.after considering the motions,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,which proposed setting aside the award.additionally,the magistrate recommended granting summary judgment in favor of supervalu.
according to the magistrate judge,the termination agreement was not entered into to evade or avoid withdrawal liability.he recognized that supervalu withdrew during the plan year in order to effect a less costly withdrawal.however,in the magistrate view,because the agreement was bona fide and made at arm length,c was not applicable.the magistrate rejected the arbitrator determination that the withdrawal date in the termination agreement should be disregarded.he explained that the date of withdrawal is determined by the cba,or in this case the termination agreement,and a fund can not simply disregard the cba and choose the date of an employer withdrawal.such a rule would enable a fund to choose the date of withdrawal and prevent an employer and a union from entering an agreement to minimize withdrawal liability.
the fund filed objections to the magistrate recommendations,but the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendations.the district court held that the language of c was not plain,and had to be considered in light of the entire statutory scheme.additionally,it agreed with the magistrate determination that the date of withdrawal is set by the termination agreement.the date of withdrawal is based on a statutory the employer completely nothing in the record enabled the court to find that a different withdrawal date applied.the district court concluded by explaining that where it is not clear that an employer acted to evade or avoid,but rather acted to minimize,withdrawal liability,the court would not interfere.in order to find that supervalu had violated c,it would have had to alter the rules governing withdrawal liability,which was not within its province.such an expansion of c would trump a,and only congress has the power to expand the provision.therefore,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of supervalu 
the fund brought this timely appeal.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we employ the same standard used by the court below.see kay berry,taylor gifts,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party.id.an arbitrator findings of fact are subject to clear error review,but his or her legal conclusions are subject to de novo review.see crown cork seal,at.the parties stipulated to the facts before the arbitrator and district court,so only a question of law remains.
the main issue in this appeal is whether supervalu violated erisa c by entering the termination agreement with the union.section c provides that i f a principal purpose of any transaction is to evade or avoid liability under this part,this part shall be applied and liability shall be determined and collected without regard to such transaction.c.the terms transaction,evade,and avoid are not defined in the statute,and therefore we must construe them in accordance with their ordinary and natural meaning,united states dupont de nemours,cir,and the overall policies and objectives of the statute,united states lowe,cir citing brown gardner,d.
the noun transaction means t he act of transacting or the fact of being transacted,and the verb transact means t o do,carry on,or conduct or t o conduct business.am.heritage dictionary ed.the verb avoid means t o stay clear of or t o keep from happening and is synonymous with escape.id.at.the verb evade means t o escape or avoid by cleverness or deceit or t o fail to make a payment of.id.at.under a plain language statutory reading the provision applies when a contributing employer enters a transaction with a principal purpose of escaping its duty to pay withdrawal liability to the plan or fund.
in dorn transportation,teamsters pension trust fund of philadelphia vicinity,cir,we called c a good faith requirement.id.at.the use of the term good faith requirement has led to confusion in this case.the good faith requirement was simply shorthand for the language of the statute an employer can not act in bad faith,with a principal purpose,of evading or avoiding withdrawal liability.by using such shorthand,we did not create an additional requirement that must be considered in determining whether the statute was violated.rather,a principal purpose to evade or avoid connotes bad faith.
the facts of dorn are too dissimilar to the facts of this case for the opinion to provide much guidance.however,the case is important because we explained that c was designed to guard against the intentional evasion of liability.id.at.there was no violation in dorn because a principal purpose of the transaction as a whole was not to escape liability.id.in other words,c is violated when one of the main reasons for entering a transaction is to effectuate that goal 
there is no doubt that supervalu had the intent required by the statute.supervalu was aware of the significant withdrawal liability that it would incur by withdrawing during the plan year when the facility closed and all covered operations ceased.based on its desire to avoid such liability,supervalu offered enhanced severance benefits and wages to the union members as consideration for the union agreement to enter the termination agreement.by entering the termination agreement,supervalu withdrew from the fund during the plan year,which enabled it to avoid incurring the significant liability that existed for withdrawal during the plan year.the record indicates that the only reason that supervalu chose to renegotiate the cbas less than a month before the facility closed was to bring its withdrawal date within the plan year in order to avoid withdrawal liability for the plan year as there was no other reason for supervalu to enter the termination agreement,its intention to evade or avoid withdrawal liability was a principal purpose,if not its only purpose.therefore,supervalu acted with a principal purpose of escaping withdrawal liability in violation of c 
as noted above,when interpreting undefined terms in a statute,we may also consider the statute policies and objectives.supervalu entering of the termination agreement was also contrary to the purpose of the mppaa.as discussed above,congress enacted the mppaa to protect multiemployer pension plans from the adverse consequences that result when individual employers terminate their participation or withdraw,at.by amending erisa,congress intended to prevent withdrawing employers from threatening the financial stability of a plan by requiring the employers to pay t
