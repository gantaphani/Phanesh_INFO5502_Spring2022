opinion of the court 
this appeal presents us with yet another round of litigation surrounding the dollar national tobacco settlement,known as the master settlement agreement msa in,the was entered into between states and the four largest domestic tobacco companies that together made of cigarette sales in the united states at that time,referred to as the majors.plaintiffs robert mariana,michael mcfadden,karen moran and edward nankervis,all pennsylvania residents who smoke cigarettes,filed suit claiming that certain provisions of the violate section of the sherman act,the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,and the compact clause,const.art.i,cl,of the united states constitution.
in their complaint,plaintiffs sued larry williams,pennsylvania secretary of revenue,and michael fisher,the attorney general of pennsylvania in their official capacities.we note that the majors are not named defendants in this particular litigation as this court concluded in an earlier decision that the majors were immune from antitrust liability under the doctrine.see bedell wholesale,philip morris,cir,cert.denied,d.
the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and plaintiffs appeal.
facts and procedural history 
a comprehensive history of the can be found in bedell and will be repeated here only to the extent necessary for the discussion and analysis.the was negotiated after various lawsuits were either brought or threatened against the majors and other tobacco companies by states seeking to recover medicaid funds that they spent to treat diseases.pennsylvania filed suit against the majors in april and the suit was settled as part of the msa 
under the msa,the majors agreed to pay the settling states billions of dollars and to restrict their marketing of cigarettes,one of the practices complained about in the states lawsuits.in return,the included provisions designed to enable the majors to transfer billions of dollars to the states,provisions that the plaintiffs allege were to be funded by the payment by wholesalers and consumers of artificially high prices for cigarettes.plaintiffs further contend that after the was entered into,the prices charged by the majors have generated revenue much greater than needed to fund the and have enabled the majors to spend record amounts on advertising.
after the execution of the msa,additional tobacco manufacturers representing of the market joined the settlement as subsequent participating manufacturers spms.that joinder meant that nearly all of the domestic cigarette producers had signed the msa.bedell,at.
the addition of the spms was significant,as the majors allegedly had feared that cigarette manufacturers who had been left out of the would be able to expand their market share or enter the market by offering lower prices.id.the is explicit that its purpose is to reduce the ability of cigarette manufacturers to gain market share due to the competitive advantage gained by not contributing to the dollar settlement.id.at.indeed,the declares that it effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the participating manufacturers experience manufacturers with such settling states as a result of the provisions of this agreement.msa ix d e.
on january,plaintiffs filed this suit against the pennsylvania attorney general and the secretary of revenue,in their official capacities,seeking injunctive relief from the continued implementation,enforcement and performance of the on behalf of pennsylvania.plaintiffs claim that a major objective of the is to prevent spms and manufacturers npms from expanding their market share and to prevent new or potential competitors from entering the market.specifically,they challenge the msa renegade clause,the settlement primary mechanism for allocating payment responsibilities based on production levels,and the msa provision calling for enactment by the settling states of qualifying statutes,laws requiring npms to make payments into state escrow accounts for each sale made.see bedell,at.pennsylvania qualifying statute,the tobacco settlement agreement act tsaa,requires each npm either to become a signatory to the as an spm or to make payments into an escrow account fund to be held to pay any judgment or settlement that the commonwealth secures in subsequent litigation against the npm.a and b.the payments are to be returned to the npm after years if they are not needed to pay judgments or settlements.b.
the renegade clause provides that the spm need not make payments to the states under the as long as the market share of an spm does not exceed the greater of its market share or of its market share.msa ix i.this mechanism allegedly discourages spms from underpricing the majors to increase their market share,even if they could do so efficiently.see bedell,at.this provision,the plaintiffs claim,effectively puts a market share cap on spms and restricts their output.
similarly,if npms,including potential new entrants into the market,gain market share,thereby reducing the majors market share,the majors may decrease their payments to the settlement fund.bedell,at.the qualifying statute requires that the npms choose between joining the msa,thereby subjecting themselves to the same restrictions on market share as spms,or be subject to tobacco related lawsuits for which they must make payments into the state established escrow account for any potential adverse judgments.id.at.the also creates a million enforcement fund provided by the majors to investigate and sue npms to enforce the settlement.id.at.
according to plaintiffs,economics force spms to join the scheme while new entry is precluded.this enables the majors to cling to their market share,thereby creating an unregulated cartel.plaintiffs claim that this output cartel has allowed and continues to allow the majors to raise prices to artificially high and supracompetitive levels without fear of significant competition and without any monitoring,regulation,or active supervision by the states.in fact,plaintiffs allege that since the execution of the msa,the majors have raised wholesale prices of cigarettes by nearly while losing less than of their market share.this,according to plaintiffs,is a violation of the sherman act.finally,plaintiffs allege that the violates the commerce and compact clauses of the constitution.
in dismissing the antitrust claims asserted in the complaint,the district court held that in light of bedell,defendants,like the majors,enjoy immunity.it further found that plaintiffs could prove no set of facts that would establish violations of the commerce and compact clauses of the united states constitution.plaintiffs timely appealed.forty states,the district of columbia,and the northern mariana islands,all parties to the msa,have filed an amicus brief urging us to affirm the order of the district court.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.we exercise de novo review over the dismissal of claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.bedell,at.furthermore,we must take all factual allegations and reasonable inferences as true and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs complaint only if plaintiffs could have proved no set of facts entitling them to relief.id.
antitrust claim 
as an initial matter,we consider whether plaintiffs properly have stated a cause of action under the sherman act defendants argue that plaintiffs fail to state a claim as the does not establish an output cartel in violation of the sherman act.the vigor with which defendants argued this issue came as a surprise to us as bedell clearly forecloses their argument.see bedell,at.during oral argument,attorney general fisher,who argued on behalf of both defendants,conceded that the facts and allegations in this case are virtually similar to those in bedell.tr.of oral argument,at.nonetheless,he contended that the bedell court based its findings on the bedell plaintiffs characterization of the rather than the itself.according to general fisher,we must consider both plaintiffs allegations and the itself.this,however,is precisely what the bedell court did as evidenced by the various times it quoted actual sections of the msa,id.at nn.even a cursory reading of bedell discredits defendants argument,which we now reject.thus,it is to bedell itself that we now turn.
plaintiff in bedell was a cigarette wholesaler that brought a class action suit against the majors on behalf of itself and similarly situated wholesalers.like the plaintiffs in the case before us,the bedell plaintiffs alleged that the msa renegade clause and qualifying statutes created an output cartel,thereby violating the sherman act.the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and the plaintiffs appealed.before reaching the defendants arguments on immunity,this court considered and rejected the argument that the terms of the do not constitute an agreement to limit output in violation of the antitrust laws.we stated an agreement which has the purpose and effect of reducing output is illegal under of the sherman act.id.at.we cited cal.dental ass ftc,d,where the court discussed the effects of anticompetitive output restrictions and collegiate athletic ass bd.of regents of of,d,where the court stated that the challenged practices create a limitation on output our cases have held that such limitations are unreasonable restraints of trade.
we noted further,
the court has made clear that a pure restriction on output is anticompetitive and in the absence of special circumstances,would violate the antitrust laws.ncaa,at,d recognizing that output restrictions may be permissible if required in order to market the product at all.by limiting production,the cartel is able to raise prices above competitive levels.
we pointed out that the federal trade of justice guidelines also recognize that agreements to reduce output violate the antitrust laws.id.applying those general principles to the msa,we stated,
plaintiffs allege the agreement between the states and the majors purposefully creates powerful disincentives to increase cigarette production.although the multistate settlement agreement contains no explicit agreement to raise prices or restrict market share,any signatory who increases production beyond historic levels automatically will increase its proportionate share of payments to the multistate settlement agreement.normally,a company which lowers prices would be expected to increase market share.but the penalty of higher settlement payments for increased market share would discourage reducing prices here.for this reason,signatories have an incentive to raise prices to match increases by competitors.it appears this incentive structure has proven true.the majors prices increased dramatically and simultaneously after signing the multistate settlement agreement.
after noting that plaintiffs had alleged that defendants formed an output cartel through the that restricts production and effectively bars entry to the cigarette tobacco market and that the defendants injured the tobacco wholesalers by charging artificially high prices,the court,speaking through judge scirica,stated,w e hold that plaintiffs have properly pleaded an antitrust violation by alleging defendants agreed to form an output cartel through the msa that violates and of the sherman antitrust act.id.at emphasis added footnote omitted.that was the holding of the court and general fisher attempt to argue to the contrary is without basis.the holding was critical to our conclusion as to immunity.without having held that plaintiffs properly pleaded a claim under the sherman act,the bedell court would never have reached the immunity issue.not only are we bound by the bedell court holding that the allegations of an output cartel created by the and resulting qualifying statutes state a claim for a violation of the sherman act,but we reaffirm the legal proposition.we turn therefore to the question whether defendants are immune under either the or the state action also known as the parker doctrine.
antitrust immunity 
having concluded that plaintiffs sufficiently state an antitrust claim in that the creates an output cartel that on its face violates the sherman act,we consider defendants argument that their conduct is immunized from liability.in dismissing plaintiffs suit against the pennsylvania officials,the district court held that the state officials were entitled to immunity on the basis of the doctrine and predicted,on the basis of the language in bedell,that they would not be entitled to parker immunity.the plaintiffs argue that the court erred.they posit that a state implementation and enforcement of a restraint of trade it has adopted or sanctioned is governed by the state action,and not the,immunity doctrine.plaintiffs argue that the state action doctrine fails to shield defendants from antitrust liability in this case.
defendants,on the other hand,claim that they are immune from antitrust liability under both the and parker doctrines.if we were writing on a clean slate,we might find some logic in plaintiffs argument that the conduct of private parties must be evaluated under and that of government units under parker.but the slate is not tabula rasa.
we consider each immunity doctrine in turn.
in bedell,we concluded that although plaintiffs had properly pleaded an antitrust injury,the immunity doctrine nonetheless shielded the majors from liability,thereby making it appropriate for the district court to dismiss plaintiffs complaint under rule b.at.the narrow question before us,then,is whether that same immunity extends to the other party to the the state actors.here,those actors are defendants fisher and williams.under the doctrine,a party who petitions the government for redress generally is immune from antitrust liability.id.at citation omitted.that immunity is so potent that it protects petitioning notwithstanding an improper purpose or motive.id.
the doctrine was first established in presidents conference noerr motor freight,d,where the court held that the sherman act is not violated simply by attempts by private parties to influence the passage or enforcement of laws favorable to the petitioner despite the anticompetitive effects of those laws.several years later in united mine workers pennington,the court reaffirmed that decision,holding that j oint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition,d emphasis added.
the dual principles underlying the doctrine are the constitutional right to petition under the first amendment and the importance of open communication in representative democracies.see california motor transport trucking unlimited,d.the noerr court explained 
in a representative democracy such as this,the legislative and executive branches of government act on behalf of the people and,to a very large extent,the whole concept of representation depends upon the ability of the people to make their wishes known to their representatives.to hold that the government retains the power to act in this representative capacity and yet hold,at the same time,that the people can not freely inform the government of their wishes would impute to the sherman act a purpose to regulate,not business activity,but political activity,a purpose which would have no basis whatever in the legislative history of that act.
at.footnote omitted.thus,immunity shields actions that might otherwise violate the sherman act because t he federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the government.bedell,at quoting city of columbia omni outdoor,d.
highlighted as particularly relevant in bedell,and equally relevant to us here,is the recognition that parties are immune from liability arising from the antitrust injuries caused by government action resulting from the petitioning.at.thus,if the conduct constitutes valid petitioning,the petitioner is immune from antitrust liability whether or not the injuries stem from the actual act of petitioning or from the government action resulting from the petitioning.id.
in bedell,we noted the district court finding that negotiating the was akin to petitioning the government and we agreed that defendants engaged in petitioning activity with sovereign states are immune under the doctrine.id.at footnote omitted.we recognized that other courts have also reached this conclusion.id.at citing hise philip morris,d,aff,cir forces action project llc california,no.mjj,wl,at,pti,philip morris,d.acknowledging plaintiffs contention that a motivating purpose behind the was to create a cartel with its attendant supracompetitive profits and that the states were motivated by a desire to share in these profits,we nonetheless stated that the parties motives are generally irrelevant and carry no legal significance.id.at footnote omitted citing noerr,at.instead,we noted that the petitioning invoked the states traditional powers to regulate the health and welfare of their citizens.see id.accordingly,in bedell we granted immunity to the majors.id.at.
as noted previously,plaintiffs argue that immunity is applicable to shield private parties but that it is inapplicable to defendants because immunity for state actions,if any,must be found in the state action doctrine that applies to a state implementation and enforcement of an antitrust injury under the supreme court decision of parker brown.the district court concluded that by instituting a lawsuit on behalf of pennsylvania against the tobacco companies,defendant fisher was petitioning the courts to recover damages which the commonwealth and its citizens have sustained as a result of the unlawful and concerted actions of the tobacco companies.mariana fisher,d,citation omitted.because the arose from a petition in proceedings before other governmental agencies authorized to resolve such issues,defendants were entitled to immunity.id.
in support of that conclusion,we note that defendant fisher was among the dozens of attorneys general across the country who filed suit against the tobacco companies,effectively petitioning the judiciary.in trucking unlimited,the supreme court made explicit that the doctrine immunizes petitioning directed at any branch of government,including the executive,legislative,judicial,and administrative agencies.at.in bedell,we held that the settlement that arose from the tobacco lawsuits was petitioning for purposes.at.
plaintiffs argue that immunity can not apply because petitioning immunity can not apply to a public entity.they provide no persuasive authority.in the one case they cite,video int l,cable communications,cir,the plaintiff did not seek to impose liability on the defendant city based on petitioning activity but instead sued the city based on its own zoning enforcement decisions.thus,the statement in that opinion that it is impossible for the government to petition itself,hardly serves as authority for us.more important,this court in herr pequea,cir questioned on other grounds by united artists theatre circuit,twp.of warrington,cir,rejected the proposition in video int l that petitioning immunity can not apply to a public entity.
in herr,a land developer sued a township and three of its supervisors alleging that the township violated his substantive due process rights through a campaign to obstruct his development project.at.the action of the government defendants was participation in proceedings before various courts and the lancaster county planning commission,the department of environmental review,the environmental hearing board,and the zoning hearing board.id.although herr involved constitutional claims,not an antitrust claim,we stated that the doctrine was not limited to the antitrust arena,id.at,and concluded,over a dissent,that the government officials were entitled to immunity as public officials sued in their individual capacities.id.at.we acknowledged that we could not find a case addressing whether a municipal corporation is entitled to such immunity,but predict ed that the supreme court would hold that it is.id.although the dissent in herr relied on video int l,the majority distinguished it because it did not involve a situation,as in herr,where the plaintiff sought to impose liability on a municipality for petitioning a distinct public entity authorized by state law to resolve land planning issues.id.at.
plaintiffs argue that unlike herr,this action does not implicate defendants petitioning activity and they do not seek to recover damages,but only an injunction against defendants in their official capacities.but the basis for their claim is that the is a contract or combination that violates the sherman act.if the government officials have immunity for entering into the msa,that immunity must extend to complying with and enforcing its provisions.like the defendants in herr,defendants in the current case petitioned governmental entities authorized to resolve the pertinent issues here the courts and the legislature in an attempt to advance the goals of pennsylvania residents.in bedell,we found the majors participation in the settlement agreement to be petitioning.at.if the majors role in that agreement is petitioning,the role of the state actors,who actually initiated the chain of events leading up to the by initiating the lawsuit and lobbying the legislature,surely must be petitioning.
although immunity typically applies to private,not public,actors,this would not be the first time an appellate court has applied such immunity to public actors.both the ninth and second circuit courts of appeals have extended immunity to government actors.see,manistee town center city of glendale,cir miracle mile assocs.city of rochester,cir.in miracle mile,the second circuit held that the city of rochester petitions to state and federal agencies opposing expansion of a regional shopping center were immunized under without a discussion of the public versus private dichotomy.id.at.however,the ninth circuit examined the issue in some detail in manistee.
plaintiff,manistee town center,purchased and renovated a rundown shopping mall.manistee,at.when unsuccessful in attracting major retail tenants to the mall,the plaintiff began to explore alternative lease arrangements which were opposed by defendants,the city of glendale and the mayor,city manager,and two city council members.id.defendants sought to prevent the plaintiff efforts to lease space to certain lessors by encouraging residents and the local press to vocally oppose use of the space and by lobbying government officials of the county.id.at.when manistee town center lease arrangements fell through,it filed a complaint against defendants,in their official capacities,pursuant to and.id.the district court dismissed plaintiff claim on immunity grounds.id.
in affirming the dismissal,the ninth circuit acknowledged that the applicability of immunity to government actors was a question of first impression.id.at.the court reasoned that extending such immunity to state actors is consistent with the representative democracy rationale enunciated by the supreme court in noerr,as g overnment officials are frequently called upon to be ombudsmen for their constituents whereby they intercede,lobby,and generate publicity to advance their constituents goals.id.in holding that immunity extended to defendants,the court concluded that this form of petitioning is nearly as vital to democracy as petitioning by private citizens.id.
we know of no supreme court or federal appellate case holding that can not apply to government actors,and are persuaded by the reasoning employed by the manistee court.governmental petitioning is as crucial to the modern democracy as is that of private parties.accordingly,we agree with the district court that by instituting a lawsuit against the tobacco companies on behalf of the commonwealth and lobbying the legislature to pass the tsaa,defendants engaged in petitioning activities that qualify for immunity.
immunity notwithstanding,defendants argue that they are also eligible for the state action immunity recognized by the supreme court years ago in parker.thus,we consider defendants claims as to parker immunity.
parker immunity 
defendants argue with considerable vigor that they also are entitled to state action immunity stemming from the supreme court decision in parker.plaintiffs counter that because the bedell court found no parker state action immunity for the majors,we are bound to find no parker immunity for the states.
it is indeed true that this court strictly adheres to its internal operating procedure which provides it is the tradition of this court that the holding of a panel in a precedential opinion is binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules the holding in a precedential opinion of a previous panel.court en banc consideration is required to do so.it is also well established that a subsequent panel is not bound by dictum in an earlier opinion.see,burstein ret.account plan for employees of allegheny health educ.and research,cir.
in bedell,once we held that the majors were immune from antitrust liability under the doctrine,we recognized that our analysis could end here.nonetheless,we continued by stating,b ut the district court found parker immunity,so we will address it as well.at.from this comment,one may deduce we recognized that our subsequent discussion on parker immunity was unnecessary to the holding in bedell and that arguably the state action discussion was dicta.if bedell had concluded that the majors were immune under the parker doctrine as well as under,it would have been an alternate ground for the holding,and therefore not dicta.see united states ex rel.caruso zelinsky,cir we note first that an alternate holding has the same force as a single holding it is binding precedent.but bedell did not so conclude.at.we therefore turn once again to our opinion in bedell to examine whether its rejection of the applicability of parker immunity for the majors was dicta or whether it binds us to reject parker immunity for the state defendants.
in bedell,we embarked on a thorough discussion of the rationale and scope of the parker immunity doctrine.we rescribe only the highlights of that discussion.we characterized as well established that a ntitrust laws do not bar anticompetitive restraints that sovereign states impose as an act of government.id.at quoting parker,at.in parker,the supreme court held that the california agriculture prorate act,a state statute restricting competition among food producers in california by imposing a market sharing scheme,did not violate the sherman act.at.since then,the court has consistently held that the federal antitrust laws are subject to supersession by state regulatory programs.see,ftc ticor title ins,d.
the parker doctrine is grounded in federalism and respect for state sovereignty.bedell,at.as explained in bedell,the interest in protecting the acts of the sovereign state,even if anticompetitive,outweighs the importance of a freely competitive marketplace.id.at.therefore,clear congressional intent is required before a federal law will be held to invalidate state programs because an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to congress.parker,at.
as we acknowledged in bedell,w hen a state clearly acts in its sovereign capacity it avoids the constraints of the sherman act and may act anticompetitively to further other policy goals.at.for example,in hoover ronwin,d,the court considered the claim of an unsuccessful candidate for admission to the arizona bar that the members of arizona admissions committee violated the sherman act by artificially reducing the numbers of competing attorneys in the state.id.at.quotation omitted.the court held that defendants actions with regard to the bar examination grading formula could not be divorced from the arizona supreme court exercise of its sovereign power,and thus defendants were immune under parker.id.at.it cautioned,however,that conduct that is not directly that of the state legislature and judiciary requires closer analysis for purposes of parker immunity to ensure that the anticompetitive conduct of the state representative was contemplated by the state itself.id.at.in bedell,we stated that when it is uncertain whether we should treat an act as state action because it has been neither approved nor authorized by the state,courts should apply the test enunciated by the supreme court in california retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d.at.
to qualify as state action under the midcal test,the challenged restraint must,first,be one that is clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,and,second,the resulting antitrust violation must be actively supervised by the state.id.at.quoting city of lafayette louisiana power light,d.in bedell,we recognized that it is unnecessary to undertake a midcal analysis if the alleged antitrust injury was the direct result of a clear sovereign state act.at.
illustrative is our decision in massachusetts sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir,a case in which an unaccredited law school that failed to receive accreditation filed an antitrust suit against the american bar association aba alleging a group boycott.we reasoned that any potential antitrust injury arising from the inability of plaintiff graduates to take bar examinations was the result of state action because it is the state,and not the aba,that makes the decision as to bar admissions.id.at.we concluded that because the states are sovereign in imposing the bar admission requirements,the aba was immune from liability under parker,and the midcal test urged by plaintiff was inapplicable.id.at.
nonetheless,in bedell we did apply the midcal test.although we recognized that one could find direct state action foreclosing the application of midcal because the was a negotiated settlement by state attorneys general,and the state legislatures were responsible for passing the qualifying statutes to enforce important components of the agreement,we stated,it would appear that the anticompetitive injury here resulted from the tobacco companies conduct after implementation of the msa,and not from any further positive action by the states.bedell,at.
because this court in bedell examined precisely the same facts and the same documents and concluded that we must apply the midcal test,we believe we are not free to decide to the contrary.
in applying midcal first prong,we concluded that it is evident the multistate settlement agreement was backed by clearly articulated state policy.id.at footnote omitted.we believe that conclusion is unassailable and,of course,it applies equally in this case.it was our analysis of the second midcal prong that led us to conclude that the majors were not entitled to parker immunity.in that connection,we stated that t he essential inquiry of the actively supervised prong is to determine if the anticompetitive scheme is the state own.id.quoting ticor title,at.we cited patrick burget,d,for the proposition that active supervision requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties,thereby ensuring that a private party anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy rather than the party own interest.bedell,at.we concluded that t he states actively and continually monitor the implementation of portions of the msa,id.at,but we were not convinced that the states satisfy midcal active supervision prong because the states supervision does not reach the parts of the msa that are the source of the antitrust injury.id.at.
it is arguable that in determining that the majors were not entitled to parker state action immunity,the bedell court placed too little significance on the states role in the implementation of the msa.plaintiffs principally complain about the rise in cigarette prices following the msa.bedell recognized that the state has immunity for its role in negotiating,entering into,and enforcing the msa,but noted that the contains no provision giving the state responsibility to supervise cigarette prices.as the court stated in bedell,it is clear the msa empowers the tobacco companies to make anticompetitive decisions with no regulatory oversight by the states.specifically,the defendants are free to fix and raise prices,allegedly without fear of competition.id.at.
however,the absence of such a provision is as much state action as are the provisions incl
