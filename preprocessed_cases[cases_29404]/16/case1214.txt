opinion of the court 
the primary issue in this appeal concerns a dispute over the interpretation of and compliance with two words best efforts in a comprehensive written agreement between two sophisticated business entities,an insurance agency and its underwriter.george pegula agency agency,cga management corporation management,george pegula pegula,barbara pegula,and monumental life insurance company monumental entered into an asset and restructuring agreement on december,agreement agency brought an action in in a state court against monumental which was removed to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania alleging a breach of the agreement.agency claimed that monumental failed to use its best efforts to market insurance programs to catholic golden age cga members.cga is an organization of senior citizens who are catholic.after a trial,the district court held that agency did not prove that monumental failed to satisfy its obligations under the agreement.the district court,additionally holding that pegula wilfully breached the agreement,imposed personal liability on the pegulas under the terms of the agreement.agency and the pegulas were ordered to pay plus interest of,costs of suit,and attorneys fees of.
agency timely filed motions under fed.civ.proc.and challenging the district court findings,and moved to disqualify the trial judge under a.after hearing the recusal motion,the district court denied it.the court subsequently denied all of agency motions,except that it vacated its finding of personal liability against george and barbara pegula.on april,agency and management filed petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on november,during the pendency of this appeal,agency and management moved this court to substitute john martin,trustee in bankruptcy,as party in interest and to amend the caption accordingly we granted the motion.

neither party contests the district court findings of fact,so they are the best source of the history of the dispute before us.
breach of contract 
background 
catholic golden age cga is a pennsylvania corporation offering various benefits to its members,senior citizens of the catholic faith primarily over years old.one of cga popular benefits is the opportunity to purchase various types of health and life insurance.pegula was instrumental in establishing cga,and is listed on its letterhead as founder.
as agency counsel explained at oral argument,cga itself had no employees,only a board of directors advised by pegula and attorneys representing its interests.cga is essentially a shell that is run by management,which is owned by pegula.by written agreement dated november,cga appointed agency as its exclusive agent to market and administer insurance products to cga members,including billing and collecting premiums.cga also gave management the exclusive right to offer services to cga members.management assumed responsibility for developing membership in cga and for managing its affairs.between and,agency marketed to cga members health insurance products including medicare supplement med supp,hospital indemnity,major illness,home health care,cancer and skilled nursing coverage,and whole life insurance.agency created all of the promotional material stating that cga was the sponsor.there was a direct relationship between agency sales of insurance products to cga members and management success in enrolling new cga members.agency sales to cga members peaked in,when insurance premiums for new policies totaled almost million.
agency fortunes decreased dramatically in the early as sales of new insurance failed to materialize.between and,the annual premiums paid to agency shrank over one third,from to,due in large part to the aging cga membership.agency commission income declined accordingly.a federal law limiting the portion of each med supp premium dollar available for payment of overhead expenses,marketing,and agent commissions also contributed to agency financial difficulties.
beginning in the early,monumental underwrote the insurance products marketed and administered by agency.during the,agency incurred substantial debt to barclays american business credit,barclays and to monumental.in,monumental,barclays,agency,and pegula restructured their financial relationships.as of october,agency owed monumental approximately million.agency defaulted in and,so in october,monumental,barclays,agency,pegula,and management entered a memorandum of understanding.immediately prior to entering this memorandum of understanding,monumental purchased barclays note,becoming the sole principal creditor of agency with a total obligation outstanding of over million.on december,the restructuring agreement,which is at issue on this appeal,was executed.the agreement replaced the memorandum of understanding.
only the provisions of the december,agreement relevant to this appeal are stated here.the agreement restructured agency debt obligations,conditionally relieved george and barbara pegula of personal liability for the agency outstanding debt obligation,made agency responsible for marketing cga membership,and assigned to monumental the administration and marketing of its insurance products to cga members.agency and management both controlled by george pegula agreed to diligently use their respective best efforts to market cga memberships.agency was required to obtain new cga members by december,new cga members by december,and new cga members for each of years,and.failure to generate the required new cga members constituted an event of default under the agreement monumental relief was limited to retention of commissions payable to agency.
the agreement required pegula to create a fund devoted exclusively for marketing purposes to obtain new members for cga he was required to use best efforts to initially establish the fund before march.agency was required to provide monumental with a written marketing plan by december of each year the plan had to project cost breakdowns,marketing objectives,and a pro forma detailed accounting of projected membership development expenses and revenues.pegula deliberate failure to prepare the required plan was deemed an event of default.
under of the agreement,agency ceded to monumental the marketing of t he current cga life and health insurance programs underwritten by monumental or any of its affiliates.appx.continues 
provided that monumental any of its affiliates licensed in all of the states in which it is determined by monumental and cga that products are to be marketed to cga members,monumental shall underwrite and be responsible for all new marketing of existing cga insurance programs and will underwrite and market all new life and health insurance programs,as well as annuity programs to be made available to cga members.monumental agrees to use its best efforts to actively market insurance and annuities where agreed upon by cga and monumental to the cga members.
if it is determined by monumental that a particular form of life,health,or annuity product will not be underwritten by monumental or any one of its affiliates after receiving a request from cga to offer such a product,agency shall then be permitted to place that particular insurance program,as to that benefit and product structure,with another insurance company if monumental determines that it or any of its affiliates will underwrite and offer a new product,monumental shall use its best efforts to offer such product to substantially all cga members located in each state where the product is approved by the appropriate governmental authorities.emphasis added 
the agreement relieves george and barbara pegula from personal liability for the loan balances owing monumental,provided that the pegulas did not engage in fraud,wilful or wanton misfeasance,malfeasance or nonfeasance,or deliberate subversion of the intent of the agreement.
the price of any insurance product must first cover the amount the insurance company must pay to its insureds based on the claims received.for med supp insurance,of the premiums for such policies must cover claims or the difference between and the claims cost must be refunded to insureds in subsequent years.if a company claims cost exceeds,there is no mechanism for an insurance company to recover that additional percentage the insurer profit margin is reduced.insurance companies use a ratio called tap mc to price insurance products and to evaluate whether their marketing activities are successful.tap represents total annualized premium mc represents marketing costs.monumental tap mc goal for med supp for cga was for other products it ranged from to.was a reasonable tap mc goal.the lower the response rate for a particular mailing or marketing campaign,the fewer policies are issued,and each policy must cover a higher percentage of the marketing costs.in creating and implementing a marketing campaign,agency never used the tap mc ratio to determine.
to market an insurance product in a state,an insurance company must be licensed to market insurance in that state,the product must be approved by the state,and,in some states,the approval of the group to which the company sells must also be obtained.in,monumental was licensed to sell insurance in all states,but it could not market med supp in two states.monumental maintains a contracts and compliance department responsible for obtaining product approval in all states.
for various reasons,monumental did not offer insurance products to individuals over years of age.accordingly,approximately of the cga membership consisted of individuals to whom monumental had no product to market.
monumental agency marketing efforts and results 
in,monumental developed and tested special creative kits for cga for some of its products not med supp,tested telemarketing on med supp coverage,and conducted direct mail marketing for all products other than its accident,death dismemberment,hip,and skilled nursing products.monumental mailed marketing pieces to cga active and inactive members.monumental spent marketing insurance programs to cga members it received in insurance policy premiums from cga members.agency was paid in commissions from new business generated by monumental.agency met its obligation of enrolling at least members in.
in,monumental contracted with an outside entity to create a new insurance solicitation kit.the kit failed,however,and was abandoned.agency failed to meet its required enrollment goal of new cga members.monumental mailed marketing pieces to cga members.monumental spent in marketing insurance programs to cga members it sold in insurance policy premiums and paid agency in commission.
in,monumental tested a gender specific cancer insurance product,marketed a more affordable med supp product to an expanded age bracket,and experimented with a family care product.in that year,monumental mailed marketing pieces to cga members,spending.monumental earned in insurance premiums from cga members and,determining that agency breached the agreement in failing to reach the cga membership goals,retained all agency commissions.
other facts relevant to agency breach 
between and,monumental negotiated advertising rates in the cga world magazine.an agreement could never be reached because cga wanted over for advertisements normally costing monumental.monumental never advertised its products in the cga magazine.
in,pegula expressed an interest in telemarketing med supp,monumental responded that it would pursue expansion of its current efforts if pegula proved that his past efforts had been successful.pegula did not produce the requested information after repeated requests.
pegula never created the marketing fund required under the agreement.in,the only year that agency met its member recruitment requirement under the agreement,it spent more to achieve the new members than it received in dues.when agency proposed its membership plan for,it projected that expenses would again exceed dues revenue.upon questioning,agency defended the propriety of membership development not being economically.because agency finances were so poor and the membership marketing plan very costly,agency did not have the funds to conduct the membership marketing campaign.agency also failed to conduct any membership marketing effort in,neither did it meet the minimum of new cga members required of it in,or meet the minimum of new cga members in.
agency failure to submit a membership development plan when due,or to submit a marketing plan that could withstand reasonable objection by monumental,also was held to constitute breach of the agreement.monumental rejected the marketing plan.the district court found other breaches of the agreement by pegula and agency not directly relevant to this appeal.
monumental performance 
between and,monumental worked to obtain approval for its products in all states.it expended money for new marketing solicitations for cga,often employing marketing experts.it marketed insurance products for cga that it did not offer for other associations.monumental instituted an expensive computer system that personalized med supp insurance solicitations and employed an experienced telemarketer to market med supp insurance to cga members.monumental changed its affiliates so it could offer cheaper med supp insurance.it offered to use pegula suggested telemarketing strategy if pegula offered evidence that it had been successful,and provided input into agency marketing plans,including suggesting that agency target new memberships in states where there was no large cga membership and where agency had not previously marketed insurance.
though agency does not appeal any of the district court findings of fact,it sets forth many examples of monumental deficient performance.agency contentions can not be taken seriously because it has not appealed any of the court findings of fact.we owe great deference to findings of fact not challenged on appeal.appellant brief spends time trying to convince us of the unreasonableness of the district court findings without having challenged their accuracy or validity on appeal.
four months before the plaintiffs filed this action,cga filed a similar action against monumental concerning the agreement.see catholic golden age monumental life ins,cga action or cga.cga complaint involved the same principals,witnesses,insurance products,and trial judge as are involved in the instant case.attorney george clark represented cga attorney james rodgers rodgers,of dilworth,paxson,kalish kauffman dilworth,represented monumental.after being assigned the cga action,the trial judge on august,sua sponte informed the parties that he had been affiliated with the dilworth firm as an associate from through,and as a partner from through.the judge had joined dilworth at the same time as had attorney rodgers in they both had become partners.the judge worked for the firm in the scranton office rodgers worked in its philadelphia office.in,the judge terminated his association with dilworth his financial arrangements with the firm ceased in october,and he had never represented monumental during his affiliation with dilworth.the judge explained that his disqualification may be appropriate based on an appearance of partiality,but informed the parties that if they desired to waive the ground for disqualification,they could.all parties filed timely written waivers with the clerk of court and judge vanaskie continued to preside over the cga litigation.
on december,monumental removed the instant action from the state court to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.because of its relationship to the cga action,this case was assigned to judge vanaskie.the first conference between the judge and counsel was held on march,by telephone.lawrence ludwig ludwig,counsel for agency,and james rodgers from dilworth,counsel for monumental,participated.it is disputed whether in that conference the district judge advised counsel of his potential conflict judge vanaskie and rodgers claim that disclosure was made and oral waivers obtained.counsel for agency claims disclosure was not made.neither the case management order nor the docket entries reflect any disqualification in the underlying action.nor do ludwig notes of the march,conference call record a disqualification discussion.counsel for agency claims that he did not know that judge vanaskie conditionally disqualified himself in cga until after the trial in this case,when judge vanaskie held a conference call on january,to schedule a hearing in response to agency rule motion for disqualification 
it appears undisputed that barbara pegula verrastro,pegula daughter,was corporate designee of cga during the cga litigation.ludwig represented cga during the settlement negotiations and depositions in the cga litigation.it is also undisputed that the cga action arose out of the same agreement as the instant action,and that cga,agency,and pegula are is the founder of and advisor to cga and is a principal of the agency.judge vanaskie made full disclosure in the cga action of his past association with the dilworth firm and its termination,and pegula and ludwig knew of judge vanaskie participation in the cga action.
counsel for agency disclosed at oral argument before this court that cga is essentially a shell corporation with a board of directors and attorneys.cga is essentially operated by management.for example,it appears from the record that pegula was a required attendee at the settlement conferences in cga,even though neither he nor agency were parties in the action.
there are three issues on appeal whether the district court committed reversible error in excluding parol evidence of agency understanding of best efforts in the agreement whether the district court violated the recusal statute,and whether the district court erred in vacating the portion of its judgment that had imposed personal liability on george and barbara pegula for agency contractual damages.first,however,we turn to the consequences of agency and management recent bankruptcy filings.
agency and management bankruptcy 
on april,agency and management filed petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the right to appeal is part of the debtors estates.see a.only agency and management trustee can pursue their appeals unless the trustee has abandoned the appeals.see a.on december,the trustee,john martin,esquire,moved for substitution to pursue the appeal and amendment to the caption of the case.we granted the motion.therefore,the appeal is not abandoned and we proceed to the merits.
best efforts 
the district court excluded extrinsic evidence of the parties understanding of the extent of monumental obligation to use its best efforts to market its insurance products to the cga membership.the court rendered its decision,making findings of fact and conclusions of law without reference to evidence of contemporary facts or discussions concerning the parties understanding of best efforts when the agreement was entered.
the district court interpretation of contract law,the admissibility of parol or extrinsic evidence,or whether the contract is ambiguous,receives plenary review.see sumitomo machinery alliedsignal,cir commonwealth of transp.parks.where a party makes known the substance of the evidence it desires to introduce,we review the district court decision to exclude the evidence for an abuse of discretion.see narin lower merion school,cir.
in interpreting a contract,a court must first consider the intent of the parties as expressed in the words used in the agreement.see mellon bank,aetna business credit,cir.if parties have integrated their agreement into a single written memorial,all prior negotiations and agreements in regard to the same subject matter,whether oral or written,are excluded from consideration.see nicolella palmer.parol evidence is excluded to preserve the integrity of written agreements by refusing to permit the contracting parties attempt to change the meaning of the contract through the use of extraneous information.see in re columbia gas system,cir.when a written contract is clear and unequivocal,its meaning must be determined by its contents alone.see mellon bank,at citing east crossroads center.agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous with the adoption of a writing are admissible,however,to establish the meaning of ambiguous terms in the writing,whether or not the writing is integrated.see mellon bank,at olympia hotels johnson wax dev,cir inquiry into preliminary discussions precluded unless necessary to disambiguate the contract proteus books,cherry lane music,cir richard lord,williston on contracts ed.if the contract terms are ambiguous or incomplete,and extrinsic evidence is examined,interpretation of the contract becomes a question of fact,unless the extrinsic evidence is conclusive.see in re minnesota power light company.
a term is ambiguous if it can have two or more reasonable meanings.see sumitomo,at mellon bank,at.if a reasonable alternative interpretation is suggested,even though it may be alien to the judge linguistic experience,objective evidence in support of that interpretation should be considered by the fact finder.mellon bank,at.in determining whether a contract term is ambiguous,we must consider the actual words of the agreement,as well as alternative meanings offered by counsel,and extrinsic evidence offered in support of those alternative meanings.see paul fire and marine ins.lewis,cir.
best efforts has been widely held to be an ambiguous contract term.see,airways group,british airways plc,grant board of,d.in airways,the court explained that under new york law,to the extent that the term best efforts is ambiguous,and criteria by which to measure the parties best efforts are lacking,the extrinsic circumstances concerning the parties understanding of that term may be considered by the finder of fact.airways group.at.best efforts depends on the factual circumstances surrounding an agreement.see baseball club assocs.northeastern baseball,cir.however,in olympia hotels johnson wax dev,cir,the court reasoned that a best efforts clause in a contract with an integration clause could not be illuminated by parol evidence.the olympia court stated that best efforts is a familiar term in contract parlance,and its meaning is especially plain in a case such as this where the promisor has similar contracts with other promisees.in such a case best efforts means the efforts the promisor has employed in those parallel contracts where the adequacy of his efforts have not been questioned.id.at.
in this case,the district court concluded that monumental exercised its best efforts to market its products to the cga membership,reasoning that monumental exercised its business judgment to decide to which cga members it would market.the district court defined best efforts by reference to good faith and sound business judgment.by excluding agency offer of extrinsic evidence,the district court concluded that best efforts was not ambiguous and could be construed by reference to case law and surrounding facts.the district court held that monumental exercised its best business judgment in its marketing in the face of agency default.monumental telemarketed and hired consultants even when their results were disappointing,and expended substantial amounts on marketing in a diligent and consistent effort to uphold its end of the bargain.to the extent monumental got off to a slow start in,the district court reasoned that agency slow provision of cga membership lists contributed at least in part to the delay.
agency argues it would have produced extrinsic evidence showing that monumental promised the following before the written agreement was executed dave rutkowski of monumental met with pegula on or about august,and stated that monumental efforts at marketing insurance products to cga members would result in significant new commissions and at least in renewal commissions to agency in the first year on or about september,micky feldman,attorney for monumental,represented that monumental would advertise in cga world magazine as much as or more than pegula had done in the past,and that monumental would spend substantial sums to build insurance sales to cga members in conversations between september and december,paul latchford of monumental assured pegula that approvals in no sell states would be aggressively sought,and that monumental marketing efforts would be aggressive in all states on october,latchford and don loren of monumental told pegula that monumental had a new marketing campaign to aggressively market products in all states and at an october,meeting,latchford insisted that monumental was capable of maintaining the same marketing level pegula had maintained.
agency also claims that a monumental officer said monumental could do much more business than agency because it was licensed to sell in all states and had marketing expertise.agency also claims it was prepared to offer evidence of monumental acknowledgment of an obligation to market to all cga members,not just members that could meet its profit goals none of agency evidentiary offerings suggest that monumental bound itself to invest in marketing efforts it knew would be unprofitable.nor do agency offerings,taken as true,upset the district court conclusions of law.
the agreement was fully integrated.the agreement also contained a provision stating that i n the event of any inconsistency between this agreement and those prior agreements,this agreement shall control and any inconsistent terms or provisions in those prior agreements shall be deemed null and void.section of the agreement is unambiguous,based on a reasonable reading of the agreement in the context of the surrounding facts and circumstances.
precedent treats best efforts as a form of good faith and sound business judgment.see national data payment systems meridian bank,cir considering best efforts in the context of appellee sale of a business to appellant,and holding that it requires diligence and an elevated duty of good faith.the district court holding in the instant case that monumental exercised sound business judgment,diligence,and good faith is supported by the record.agency and pegula did not define best efforts to state clearly monumental marketing obligation in the absence of such a definition,the district court interpretation of the term is consistent with the surrounding facts and circumstances of the agreement.
section frequently states if monumental determines,implying that there is an element of discretion in monumental duty to market to cga members.best efforts is a dynamic notion.monumental best efforts in were certainly changed when congress amended the laws concerning med supp insurance.no reasonable reading of best efforts compels monumental to market to all,or even to substantially all of the cga members,regardless of age.monumental did not compromise its right to exercise sound business judgment in its marketing programs.its efforts,from working to obtain approval for its products in all fifty states to substantial investment in computers and marketing consultants,but constrained by targeted tap mc ratios,evince good faith,fair dealing,and diligence.the district court properly rejected extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.
even if the district court had erred as a matter of law by not admitting extrinsic evidence of the parties intended meaning of best efforts,the error would have been harmless.under fed.civ.proc,n o error in the exclusion of evidence is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating,modifying,or otherwise distributing a judgment or order,unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.the district court issued a careful and thorough decision none of its findings of fact were contested on appeal.the district court findings and conclusions of law concerning monumental best efforts are convincing,and we are satisfied that they would not reasonably be affected by the evidence agency offers.had the extrinsic evidence been admitted,monumental would in all probability have responded that it never would have agreed to be forced to market to all cga members,regardless of the losses in so doing,the absence of their insurability and eligibility,especially when its goal was to recoup funds from agency and the pegulas.
even if agency proposed evidence was taken as true and unrebutted,the district court could have reasonably concluded that monumental exercised best efforts because nothing agency offered suggests that monumental was bound to make repeated losing investments in marketing plans.for agency theory to prevail,we must believe that monumental bound itself to make repeated unprofitable marketing paying inflated advertising rates in the cga magazine to marketing to cga members for whom monumental offered no products or from whom monumental would obtain little,if any,profit.in light of monumental goal to recoup the more than million owing to it by agency,such a conclusion is illogical.if agency contentions were true,it should have appeared in the text of the agreement it did not.we see no abuse of discretion by the district judge in excluding agency evidence.
agency argues that the district judge impermissibly failed to notify counsel of his relationship with monumental law firm,and failed to disqualify himself under e the district judge disqualified himself in the cga action,but purportedly failed to offer his disqualification in the instant action.agency claims that the district judge failure to offer the same disqualification in this action constituted reversible error.
in reviewing agency contention on appeal that the district court improperly denied its motion for recusal,it is appropriate that we view this motion in its proper perspective.agency alleges no conflict of interest on the part of the judge indisputably,there is none.agency,even after a lengthy and arduous trial,asserts no bias or prejudice on the part of the judge,and,on appeal,challenges none of the judge findings of fact.although this proceeding followed on the heels of the earlier and related cga case,agency made no motion for recusal before trial.
notwithstanding that all of these considerations suggest that plaintiff motion is a desperate effort to overturn an adverse decision,agency argues that its motion for recusal deserves favorable consideration because judge vanaskie sua sponte offered to recuse himself in the prior cga trial because of his former relationship with the dilworth firm.the implication of that argument is that the judge must a fortiori recuse himself in this case.
although the judge offered to recuse himself in the cga action,he did so out of excess caution.the only applicable section of the recusal statute under the circumstances is a which,at the same time,sets forth the pertinent standard of review any judge of the united states,shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.see also liteky united states,d massachusetts school of law at andover american bar,cir.by the time the judge issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law,six years had elapsed since his resignation from the dilworth firm.there were no circumstances showing any lingering,disqualifying relationship and nothing to suggest to any reasonable person an appearance of impartiality.his unnecessary and even improvident disqualification in the cga was a matter of record,as was the waiver.furthermore,judge vanaskie history of previous employment and partnership in the dilworth firm had been published in his profile contained,since his elevation to the court,in volume c of justices and judges of the united states courts.
agency argument,when distilled,amounts to nothing more than a whisper that the judge participation in this trial,in light of his prior recusal,has an appearance of impartiality.it certainly had no such appearance to agency,an intensely interested party,because it claims it knew nothing of the prior recusal until after this trial,although it is hardly possible to accept such a representation in light
