this consolidated appeal presents the question of whether a labor contractor contract to hold harmless and indemnify a vessel operator for injuries,sustained by that contractor employees while riding on the operator vessel,is supported by consideration when the vessel operator owes a duty to an oil company to transport those same employees.we conclude that the contract is supported by consideration and is enforceable.
production management industries,pmi,a labor contractor that provides labor and other support services for the oil and gas industry in the gulf of mexico off the louisiana coast,entered into contracts with various oil companies to provide workers for the oil companies rigs.chevron,chevron and matrix oil and gas matrix neither of which is a party to this the two oil companies that contracted with pmi in the instant cases.as part of their agreements with pmi,chevron and matrix contracted to provide transportation for pmi workers from the shore to the rig.the oil companies contracted with seacor marine seacor,a company that owns and operates vessels used in oilfield operations on the louisiana ocs to deliver equipment,supplies and personnel including pmi employees to the rigs.
on december,chevron and seacor signed a blanket agreement.this agreement,subject to unilateral cancellation by either party,set the general terms that would apply to future vessel charters.the blanket agreement created no obligation on the part of either party to enter into a charter for a vessel.on october,chevron entered into a of the seacor vessel the sylvia f this time charter incorporated the terms of the december blanket agreement.on april,seacor entered into a blanket agreement with energy logistics,eli.on june,eli chartered the seacor vessel,the shirley g and incorporated the terms of the april blanket agreement.eli subchartered the shirley g to gulftran,gulftran on december.the next day,gulftran subchartered the vessel to matrix.therefore,unlike chevron,matrix never directly contracted with seacor.
seacor,knowing that its obligations under the charter agreements with the oil companies would probably involve transporting pmi employees,contacted pmi directly and insisted that it would not transport any pmi employees until pmi signed a vessel boarding and utlization agreement hold harmless vba.by the vba terms,the provisions of this form contract apply when a seacor vessel transports a contractors employees.the vba stated that,in exchange for pmi employees being ferried on seacor vessels,pmi would name seacor as an additional insured under pmi comprehensive general liability cgl policy with waiver of subrogation rights and deletion of the cgl watercraft.after some deliberation,pmi signed the vba on july.
on december,plaintiffs johnson and hoffpauir were injured while transferring between matrix operated platforms and the shirley plaintiff fleming was injured while transferring from a chevron platform to the sylvia f on february.
the three injured pmi employees brought separate suits against seacor.in all three cases,seacor filed complaints against both pmi and gray insurance gray,pmi cgl insurer,seeking defense and indemnity based on the vba.each of the three plaintiffs eventually settled against the direct defendants and trials went forward on seacor claims against pmi and gray.
as pmi insurance carrier for the time relevant to these cases,gray routinely furnished insurance certificates reflecting the nature and extent of pmi insurance coverage to pmi contractors.gray,at pmi request,sent an insurance certificate to seacor.at the time pmi asked gray to send seacor an insurance certificate,gray was unaware of the existence and contents of the vba.
the individual suits filed by plaintiffs johnson,hoffapauir,and fleming were assigned to three different district judges.motions for summary judgment were filed in all three cases seeking a resolution of whether the vba was supported by adequate consideration and was enforceable.the district courts decisions split on the issue of whether consideration supported the vba.in johnson seacor,judge haik found the agreement supported by consideration in hoffpauir seacor,judge doherty ruled that the vba failed for lack of consideration.in fleming grand isle shipyard,the third case,judge lemelle did not reach the issue.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.taita chem,westlake styrene,cir.
the most significant issue on appeal is whether seacor can enforce the vba.gray argues that the vba is unsupported by consideration and unenforceable because seacor owed pmi a preexisting duty,under the seacor contract with the oil companies,to transport pmi employees to the oil platforms.under the preexisting duty rule,a promise to do that which the promisor is already legally obligated to do is.according to gray,seacor blanket charter with the oil companies create a duty on seacor to transport pmi employees to the matrix and chevron platforms.gray provided summary judgment evidence that pmi employees would have received transportation from seacor even if the vba was never signed and,indeed,continued to receive such transportation after pmi officially withdrew from the vba.
all of the most influential treatises urge courts to avoid using the preexisting duty rule if even minimal consideration supports the contract.indeed,corbin strongly cautions courts against relying on this rule in formulating their decisions.
a court should no longer accept this rule as fully established.it should never use it as the major premise of a decision,at least without giving careful thought to the circumstances of the particular case,to the moral desserts of the parties,and to the social feelings and interests that are involved.
joseph perillo helen bender,corbin on contracts,at revised edition.it is well accepted that the mere exchange of promises is ordinarily sufficient to satisfy the requirement of consideration.claude rohwer anthony skrocki,contracts in a nutshell,at ed.if there is any legal detriment incurred by the promisee that can be viewed as a bargained exchange for the promisor promise,that is sufficient.in addressing the existence or of consideration,courts have not concerned themselves with the adequacy of fairness of the consideration but only with finding the presence of some legal detriment incurred as part of a bargain.
thus,even if a contract does not require any performance that would not have been done in the absence of the contract,as long as the contracting parties gain some legally enforceable right as a result of the contract which they previously did not have,consideration is present.see morrison flying service deming national bank,cir.see also restatement second of contracts d but the tendency of the law has been simply to hold that the performance of contractual duty can be consideration if the duty is not owed to the promisor.
in morrison flying service,the leading case on the subject of sufficiency of consideration,cisco aircraft,cisco contracted with the forest service to provide aerial spraying of timber land in montana.cisco then contracted with morrison flying service morrison for the provision of gas,oil,and some of the chase aircraft necessary for the performance of the contract.prior to beginning work on the contract,cisco assigned all the proceeds of the contract to deming national bank deming in exchange for deming financial support of the project.the president of morrison,armed with knowledge of this assignment,wrote to deming to ensure that deming would pay morrison when morrison fulfilled its obligations under the contract with cisco.deming provided morrison with written confirmation that,once the forest service paid the amount due cisco,deming would remit morrison share of the proceeds.morrison then proceeded to perform its duties under the subcontract with cisco.the resolution of this case required the circuit to determine whether adequate consideration supported deming promise to morrison.the court,relying on the restatement and corbin,held the contract enforceable.to support its holding,the court cited two reasons for finding that consideration su
