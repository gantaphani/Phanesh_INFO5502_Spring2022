audeliz lebrón alc appeals from a judgment in favor of lamex foods,lamex,which the district court entered after consolidating a preliminary injunction hearing with a bench trial on the merits under federal rule of civil procedure a.the appellant argues that the district court abrogated its right to a jury trial by failing to provide indisputably clear notice of its intent to consolidate.see const.amend.vii see also.a permitting the consolidation of a preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits,but noting that the court must preserve any party right to a jury trial.
although we appreciate the district court efforts to resolve the parties dispute in an efficient and timely manner,we agree with alc that the court inadequate notice of its intent to consolidate abrogated alc right to a jury trial.rejecting appellant other arguments,we vacate the judgment in part and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
lamex is a minnesota corporation that facilitates the sale of food from manufacturers to suppliers and vendors worldwide.around february,lamex entered into a business relationship in which it purchased frozen chicken from george farms,george and resold the product to alc,a puerto rico corporation that supplies frozen food products to supermarkets and other retailers throughout the commonwealth.
the parties business relationship encountered an obstacle around january,when alc insurance underwriter dropped the corporation from its coverage.lamex sought from alc a replacement security,which alc provided in the form of a standby letter of credit for drawn on first bank,a puerto rico financial institution.in turn,alc requested from lamex a matching unsecured credit for.lamex corporate policy prohibited such matching,but in an effort to preserve the parties relationship,steve anderson,the president of lamex,encumbered his personal funds to provide alc with the matching credit.
in november,however,the parties cordial relationship came to an end when alc stopped paying lamex money owed.by that time,alc,without remunerating appellee,had received shipments of frozen poultry totaling over million in value.after myriad informal attempts to collect the delinquent invoices from alc failed,lamex canceled alc account,halted shipment on orders of poultry designated for alc,and placed the poultry into cold storage in various facilities in puerto rico and on the mainland.lamex also cashed in the letter of credit from first bank.
alc responded by filing suit in the commonwealth superior court in san juan,naming as defendants lamex,george,and first bank,among others,and alleging violations of puerto rico dealers contract act of law,laws ann.tit,which prohibits a principal from terminating a business relationship with a dealer without just cause,euromotion,bmw of,cir.after alc suit had been filed,but before had been completed,lamex brought the instant action in federal district court,naming as defendants alc and its president,audeliz lebrón.
in its december,complaint,lamex sought to recover the remainder of the monies owed to it and asked that the corporate veil be pierced to hold lebrón personally liable for alc debt should the corporation be unable to pay in full.furthermore,lamex requested a declaratory judgment stating that it was not a principal for law purposes or that even if it were a principal,it had just cause to terminate its relationship with alc.finally,lamex sought a preliminary injunction barring alc from continuing a smear campaign against lamex,in which alc purportedly interfered with lamex attempts to find other buyers for the poultry by telling potential buyers that lamex and george poultry products were entangled in a lawsuit.lamex complaint contained a jury demand for all of its legal claims.
district court proceedings 
the first hearing and status conference 
on january,the district court convened an initial hearing for the purpose of deciding lamex motion to reconsider an order granting defendants extended time to answer the complaint.after inquiring into the nature of the parties dispute and discovering that their conflict involved the collection of outstanding debt,the court warned the litigants that you can not drag a case like this for a year or two,because there no point,and encouraged them to settle.in the interim,the court put the case on an expedited schedule.it gave defendants one day to respond to the complaint.additionally,the court established what it characterized as a streamlined discovery process,ordering the parties to exchange all pertinent documents by january and to depose two key witnesses steve anderson and audeliz lebrón by january.
on january,lamex filed a motion to convert its request for a preliminary injunction,which it had submitted in its complaint and in a separate motion dated january,into a demand for a permanent injunction.the court,in an order issued on january,g ranted the motion in the sense that the preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,if available,shall be considered in a consolidated hearing as requested.
soon after,the court received notice that the parties did not finish the depositions on january,as ordered.lebrón deposition was cut short after he refused to answer questions relating to issues addressed in lamex prayers for declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction.at a status conference six days later,the court reviewed the transcript of lebrón deposition,concluded that defendants were obstructing the discovery process,and sanctioned them by ordering them to pay for any expense lamex incurred for the thwarted deposition.at the conclusion of the status conference,the court advised the parties that the preliminary injunction hearing,which was originally set for february,would be advanced to january,the very next morning.
the injunction hearing 
decrying behavior it characterized as parties playing hardball to avoid certain obligations,the court began the preliminary injunction hearing by emphasizing that it was committed to help ing the parties resolve this whole situation in a professional manner 
i am here to do the right thing,and that the reason why i got really upset with you people yesterday,and that the reason i said that if you had not taken my advice to do discovery the right way,with the purpose of trying to resolve the situation,i was going to then take the law in my own hands and force it,shove it upon you,a solution there is no way that i going to allow a case like this to drag for months and months when you have those amounts of money due and owing for chicken,basically,okay and i am not going to allow this kind of argument to linger without some sort of arbiter,j udge or whoever,telling you what the story is.
the court then informed the parties that if i get at some point in time during this hearing that i should convert this into a trial on the merits,then i will do it.he advised them that even though we are proceeding under a preliminary injunction situation,if the issues are as simple as i think they are,i going to take this matter and resolve it altogether,one shot.when lamex reminded the court of its motion to convert the preliminary injunction hearing into a permanent injunction hearing,the court replied,you already heard what i said.if i think as we progress that that what i should do,i going to do it.i just giving you fair warning.
the court then proceeded to take the testimony of anderson.at the conclusion of its president testimony,lamex again moved to have the hearing be treated as a permanent injunction hearing in response,the court stated,i told you that i was considering doing precisely that,the consolidation but i will not make that decision until i have heard all the evidence.
when the hearing reconvened after a lunch recess,lamex requested that the court at least enter an order for a preliminary injunction.the court admonished lamex counsel for making this request,reminding her that it wanted to hear all the evidence before proceeding counsel,if you do give me what i need,i going to just deny your motion.simple as that.defendants in turn moved for a judgment on partial findings under federal rule of civil procedure c,on the ground that because they had already consigned money to the superior court,the amount in controversy was insufficient to give the federal court subject matter jurisdiction.as an alternative ground for their rule c motion,defendants argued that lamex failed to meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction.see narragansett indian tribe guilbert,cir reciting the preliminary injunction inquiry,which requires consideration of the likelihood of success on the merits,the potential for irreparable injury,the balance of equities for and against an injunction,and the effect on the public interest.the district court found both grounds unpersuasive and denied the motion.
audeliz lebrón and two employees of george then testified,the latter two by phone.at the close of their testimony,defendants renewed their rule c motion,adding a new argument that lamex had failed to show irreparable harm in as much as ample evidence has been presented that the money that was allegedly owed has already been consigned and given to the puerto rico court.the district court asked defendants whether they would object to a motion filed tomorrow to disburse that money immediately to lamex,to which defendants initially responded in the negative.but they subsequently equivocated,telling the court,if the amounts are the same,then lamex can retire the money.
the court then had the following colloquy with counsel 
the court this is what we going to do.i find that this is a very simple case.i thought it was a lot more complicated.it an extremely simple case.
the only issues here are,number one,what kind of intervention this f ederal c ourt can have in the context of the relations between these parties as it pertains to law,having plaintiff being the one who initiated the case.
that number one.and it could be as claimed by way of injunctive relief or,more probable than not,perhaps declarative judgment,if any,that could be the alternative.
and then the other question is whether there is any issue with the payment that is due and owing supposedly.that all.
does everybody agree that those are the issues plaintiff,are those the issues 
counsel for lamex yes,your honor.
counsel for alc yes,your honor.
the court i think what i told you at the beginning,that i could consolidate this into one thing,is going to happen.i do think i need anything else.all i need to do is sit down with this evidence and figure out which rights each party has to this.any objection to this 
counsel for lamex your honor,i do have any objection to that.
the court do you have any objection to that 
counsel for alc no,your honor.
after the injunction hearing 
a week later,the court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of fees lamex incurred as a result of alc failure to pay its outstanding invoices.
the next day,february,the court issued an opinion and order disposing,on the merits,of all of the claims made in lamex complaint.the court denied lamex requests to pierce the corporate veil and for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.however,it granted lamex request for a declaratory judgment absolving lamex from liability under law.furthermore,it ordered defendants to pay the total amount due to lamex and ordered the superior court of san juan to release the money alc consigned 
after its motion for reconsideration was denied by the district court,alc timely appealed before us,it argues that the district court failed to provide unambiguous notice of the rule a consolidation and,in so doing,violated its right to trial by jury as an additional matter,alc asks us to vacate the court order of sanctions for its conduct.
right to a trial by jury 
the supreme court has long counseled that m aintenance of the jury as a body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.dimick schiedt.for this reason,once a party files a proper demand for a jury trial on its legal claims,see,that demand must be honored unless the parties expressly consent to withdraw the demand,see,or subsequently waive their jury trial right by either expressly or implicitly agreeing to a bench trial,see venture tape mcgills glass warehouse,cir coxcom,chaffee,cir.
in this instance,lamex made a general demand for a jury trial with respect to all the legal claims pled in its complaint,and alc was entitled to rely on that demand.in re n cases,cir where one party has made a demand,others are entitled to rely on the demand with respect to issues covered by the demand and need not make an independent demand of their own.alc says that it did so rely and,never having received clear notice from the district court of its intent to consolidate,its participation in the january hearing was limited to the issue of injunctive relief.it expected that lamex legal claims,including the declaratory judgment related to law would be resolved at a later point before a jury lamex counters that the district court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits after providing adequate notice,and that alc implicitly waived the right to a jury trial by actively participating,without objection,in that consolidated proceeding.
inadequate notice of rule a consolidation 
rule a states,in relevant part before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction,the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the preliminary injunction hearing.a.although the rule facilitates the generally admirable objective of saving time and duplication of effort,there are hazards inherent in fully disposing of cases in such an expedited fashion among them incomplete coverage of relevant issues and failure to present all relevant evidence.caribbean produce,sec y of health human,cir see also of camenisch,d noting that a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits,and concluding that i n light of these considerations,it is generally inappropriate for a federal court at the preliminary injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.such risks are especially acute in cases that turn on credibility determinations,as a truncated hearing will often limit the parties opportunity to present and thoroughly examine witnesses.for this reason,our law demand s that a trial court provide indisputably clear notice to the parties before approving consolidation.francisco sánchez esso standard oil,cir quoting caribbean produce,at see also camenisch,at.noting that the parties should normally receive clear and unambiguous notice of consolidation either before the hearing commences or at a time which will still afford the parties a full opportunity to present their respective cases quoting pughsley lake shore drive coop,cir.
failure to provide indisputably clear notice of consolidation can constitute reversible error even if the right to a jury trial is not at issue see caribbean produce,at charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.o rdering consolidation during the course of a preliminary injunction hearing is reversible error when little or no notice is given of this change and the effect is to deprive a party of the right to present his case on the merits.the stakes are even higher where,as here,the surprise consolidation would result in the deprivation of a party right to prosecute or defend the remaining legal claims before a jury.in these situations,we indulge every reasonable presumption against construing the parties participation in the consolidated hearing as waiver.aetna ins.kennedy.see also garcía ayala lederle parenterals,cir emphasizing that the right to a jury trial is constitutionally protected and casual waivers are not to be presumed.
in this case,the court gave the parties contradictory signals as to its intent.at the parties first appearance before the court,which took place on january,lamex requested,and the court scheduled,a hearing on lamex motion to enjoin defendants from interfer ing with lamex course of dealing with other puerto rico businesses and performing other acts in detriment of lamex goodwill,name,and reputation.on january,the court granted lamex motion to consolidate and agreed to consider the preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,if available in a consolidated hearing.this order,which was the only written order mentioning consolidation,was plainly not a rule a order.on the eve of the january hearing,the court,despite its january order,was still referring to the next morning proceedings as a preliminary injunction hearing,and the hearing was captioned as such.up to this point,the court and the parties seemed to be in agreement that only the plea for injunctive relief was before the court 
the confusion began the next day.at the start of the preliminary injunction hearing,the court warned the parties i f i get at some point in time during this hearing that i should convert this into a trial on the merits,then i will do it.it advised them that even though we are proceeding under a preliminary injunction situation,if the issues are as simple as i think they are,i going to take this matter and resolve it altogether,one shot.this statement might provide the requisite notice of rule a consolidation if not for the court subsequent comments.in the next breath,the court offered a different view of its intentions when it responded in the following way to lamex reminder that it had requested that the preliminary injunction hearing be converted to a permanent injunction hearing you already heard what i said.if i think as we progress that that what i should do,i going to do it.this succeeding statement implied that the court intention was only to consolidate the hearing for preliminary injunctive relief with the hearing for permanent injunctive relief,as lamex requested,and not to reach the merits of the remaining claims.later,the court shored up this inference when,in response to lamex reminding the court of its january order,the court stated,i told you that i was considering doing precisely that,the consolidation.in sum,during the hearing,the court made three references to consolidation of those three references,only the first mentioned the merits of the other claims,and the later two implied that it expected only to consolidate the proceedings for preliminary injunctive relief with those for permanent injunctive relief.
at the very end of the preliminary injunction hearing,the court compounded the confusion by stating that i think what i told you at the beginning,that i could consolidate this into one thing,is going to happen,without clarifying what it meant by consolidating this into one thing.it then asked whether the parties objected to this,to which the parties answered in the negative.not once during this colloquy did the court explicitly state that it intended to dispose of all the issues on the merits or that it was proceeding under rule a.
the court contradictory and vague statements do not satisfy the overriding requirement of indisputably clear notice of the court intention to consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits.caribbean produce,at.indeed,statements less ambiguous than those voiced by the district court have been held to be inadequate.see,attorneyfirst,llc ascension entm t,cir per curiam unpublished holding that the comment that the preliminary injunction stage,if i do it right,will be the end of the fight,did not constitute the kind of clear and unambiguous notice required by rule a woe cuomo,cir concluding that the court oblique references to the dispositive nature of the proceedings,including the statement that it wanted to finally close this case o nce and for all,at least at this level,did not provide adequate notice pughsley,at holding that a court instruction for counsel to put on your total case did not provide adequate notice of consolidation,as p laintiffs counsel could reasonably have understood the judge as merely requiring a presentation of the remainder of plaintiffs total case in support of their pending motion for a preliminary injunction.from the court statements,the parties reasonably could have understood,as alc claims that it did,that only the issue of injunctive relief was before the court,and that by consolidation,the court meant that it would treat the preliminary injunction hearing as a permanent injunction hearing 
lamex suggests that we may infer the requisite notice from the district court summary of the issues before it as one,what kind of intervention this court can have in the context of the relations between these parties as it pertains to law,and two,whether there is any issue with the payment that is due and owing supposedly.these comments,however,do little to clarify the scope of the issues actually at stake.by what kind of intervention this court can have in the context of the relations between these parties as it pertains to law,the court reasonably could be understood as pondering whether it could provide injunctive relief without addressing the law issues.nor could the reference to the payment that is due and owing supposedly be construed unambiguously as notice of consolidation.that comment came on the heels of defendants renewal of its motion for judgment on partial findings,see.c,in which they argued that because they had already acknowledged their debt and consigned money to the local court,lamex could not meet the irreparable harm prong of the test for a preliminary injunction alone or in context,these statements do not constitute indisputably clear notice of the court intent to resolve all the issues on the merits.
no implicit waiver of the jury trial right 
given the court failure to provide indisputably clear notice of consolidation,it becomes far more difficult for lamex to argue that alc implicitly waived its right to a jury trial.we have held that active participation both leading up to and during a bench trial,combined with a failure to specifically object to the lack of a jury,amounts to a waiver of the jury trial right.coxcom,at.this rule of reflects our judgment that a losing party who has been accorded an opportunity to present its full case before a court should not be allowed to reassert a right to trial by jury after a bench trial.see also royal am.managers,irc holding,cir adopting the implicit waiver rule because i t would be patently unfair and,in effect,an ambush of the trial judge on appeal if appellant were allowed to lodge an early demand for a jury,participate in a bench trial without objection,and then assign as error the failure to honor the jury demand second and third alterations in original quoting united states beechcraft aircraft model king air,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
alc behavior during the hearing simply was not consistent with lamex assertion that alc fully and vigorously participated in what it understood to be a bench trial on all the remaining legal issues.venture tape,at quoting beechcraft aircraft model king air,at.to the contrary,because it was not clearly notified of the court intent to adjudicate all of the issues on the merits,alc conducted itself as though it were participating in a preliminary injunction hearing.during the january proceeding,alc acquiesced to liberal rules of evidence and procedure.it only called one witness and presented two exhibits,neither of which were in direct support of its claim that lamex could be held liable as a principal under law indeed,alc conducted minimal discovery in the barely period between the commencement of the federal suit and the injunction hearing prior to the hearing,alc had not even deposed a single representative of lamex or george.
in arguing its initial rule c motion,alc framed its argument in terms of the test for preliminary injunctions additionally,when arguing that lamex lacked a probability of succeeding on the merits,alc specifically pointed out that there is a hearing on the state case that is scheduled for february.finally,in renewing its motion at the end of the hearing,alc argued that injunction is a remedy for a person to claim a right when there is no other alternative,and that this equitable remedy was not necessary here because the parties would soon be trying their law case in state court.from these statements,it is evident that alc understood that the law issue was not being litigated fully during the injunction hearing but instead would be resolved at a later point,either before a jury in federal court or as part of its state lawsuit.
neither the status of the jury trial right nor the protections afforded it by the courts or the federal rules is diminished when a district court employs the consolidation mechanism provided by rule a.in fact,the rule explicitly requires that even when consolidation is ordered,the court must preserve any party right to a jury trial.a,and appellate courts have held that a party agreement to a properly noticed consolidation of trial on the merits with a hearing for a preliminary injunction by itself in no way amounts to a waiver of the right to jury trial.new windsor volunteer ambulance corps,meyers,cir quoting heyman kline,cir see also bowles bennett,cir noting that e ven assuming that plaintiffs counsel had agreed to consolidate,that,alone,would not be an express waiver of the right to jury trial.where,as here,the district court fails to provide indisputably clear notice of its intent to consolidate,with the effect that a party does not understand itself to be participating in a trial on the merits and conducts itself accordingly,we can not infer a waiver of the jury trial right.see royal am.managers,at of course,a party should not be held,by reason of its participation in the nonjury proceedings,to have waived the jury trial right unless the party was on notice that the trial court was planning to adjudicate the dispositive issues of fact.quoting beechcraft aircraft model king air,at see also white mcginnis,cir.this is not a situation in which a losing party is attempting a second bite at the apple.coxcom,at.rather,alc has not even had its first full bite.
we conclude that the district court erred in failing to provide indisputably clear notice of its intent to consolidate under rule a and,in so doing,abrogated alc right to a jury trial.accordingly,we vacate the court judgment with respect to the claims for declaratory judgment and to pierce the corporate veil and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.because alc conceded the amount and existence of the debt owed to lamex,we affirm the district court monetary judgment in favor of lamex 
discovery related sanctions 
appellant challenges the district court order imposing sanctions upon it for its failure to comply with discovery obligations.district courts have authority for decisions.torres puerto rico,cir.we therefore step softly when reviewing the imposition of sanctions,intervening only when there has been an abuse of discretion.id.quoting united states v.one bmw,cir.
pursuant to its authority under federal rules of civil procedure f and b,the court ordered alc to pay the costs and attorney fees lamex incurred in the deposition of audeliz lebrón.it did so upon finding that lebrón was to the questions of lamex counsel during his deposition,and that through his vexatious conduct he placed obstacles to the taking of the deposition in violation of the rules of civil procedure.here,as below,appellant attempts to justify lebrón behavior by asserting that he only refused to answer questions that he thought were beyond the scope of the deposition this representation is belied by the deposition transcript,which shows that lebrón was obstructionist and hostile to lamex counsel most benign questions additionally,as the district court pointed out in its sanctions order,it did not order limited discovery and thus lebrón and alc had no grounds to believe that the deposition was limited in scope.finally,even if alc or lebrón had justifiable concerns regarding the scope of the deposition,the federal rules provide a way for them to register those objections without holding up the deposition.see.c.given lebrón behavior,the district court was well within its discretion in imposing sanctions.
for the reasons set forth,we affirm the court imposition of sanctions against alc affirm the court monetary judgment in favor of lamex vacate the court judgment with respect to lamex claims for a declaratory judgment and to pierce alc corporate veil and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
so ordered.
lamex also moved,in the alternative,for summary judgment,see,arguing that anderson testimony,combined with lebrón deposition,was sufficient to resolve the claims in its favor.the motion was denied.
according to the district court,alc owed lamex monetary relief in the sum of in poultry delivered interest on that amount,calculated at for every month alc account is in arrears and storage fees totaling.the lamex already received by drawing on first bank letter of credit would be credited toward the total amount owed,as would the held in consignment by the san juan court.
lebrón,in his personal capacity,is not a party to this appeal.
appellant raises two additional issues related to this argument.it contends that the rule a consolidation deprived it of the opportunity to conduct meaningful discovery.it further asserts that the court relied on inappropriate evidence,in particular testimony obtained remotely via telephone,in adjudging credibility and reaching a decision on the merits.because we vacate the judgment,we do not reach these subsidiary arguments.
although lamex law claim was framed as a declaratory judgment,appellant argues,and lamex does not disagree,that law controversies are quintessentially legal,and not equitable,and thus can be heard by a jury.this court has not held that law is an action to which the seventh amendment attaches however,because the parties here are in agreement on this issue,we accept that position for the purposes of this case.
as it turns out,during the injunction hearing,defendants conceded the existence and amount of the debt owed to lamex and told the court that i f the amounts that lamex claims is owed are the same as that alc consigned to the puerto rico court then they can retire the money.this admission left only two legal claims the declaratory judgment and the piercing of the corporate veil.
the issue of the adequacy of notice of consolidation under rule a can arise independently of a dispute over the waiver of the jury trial right and has constitutional implications beyond the seventh amendment.k mart oriental plaza,cir it is apodictic that the district court power in ordering consolidation must be tempered by the due process principle that fair notice and an opportunity to be heard must be given the litigants before the disposition of a case on the merits.quoting charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.here,however,alc argues the adequacy of notice in relation to the seventh amendment jury trial right.under the circumstances of this case,we think that is an appropriate way to analyze the issue.
indeed,the crux of alc defense against the imposition of sanctions at the status conference was that lebrón justifiably refused to answer lamex counsel questions because they pertained to the law claim and not to the preliminary injunction.
it is not clear why lamex insisted on renewing a motion that had already been granted on january.nor is it clear why the court made no reference to its january order.these oddities confirm the confusion that permeated the proceedings.
in responding to lamex,the court again did not acknowledge the terms or existence of its january order.instead,it stated i told you that i was considering doing precisely that,the consolidation.consolidation does mean that the result is going to be favorable to you or to them.consolidation is a technical procedural i will not make that decision until i have heard all the evidence.i want to receive more evidence.i need to hear you.i need to hear the other side,too.then i decide.
notably,even lamex behaved in ways consistent with this understanding lamex reiterated its jury trial demand for its legal claims,pressed the court at various points to convert the hearing from one for preliminary
