the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,imposes rigid restrictions on confirmation of awards issued by an arbitral entity in a signatory country.in the case before us,the district court appropriately issued a confirmation judgment.however,some variances in the specific directions of execution on the judgment differ from those in the award and will be modified to conform more closely to its text and to the circumstances that presently exist.
the stephen and mary birch foundation,is a delaware corporation birch.in,it entered into an agreement to buy luna luna,an exhibit composed of artwork created by approximately thirty renowned artists.one of the plaintiffs,andre heller,organized the exhibition.
the original sellers of luna luna were andre heller,stefan seigner and heller werkstatt gesmbh,an austrian limited corporation.after the sale agreement was executed,admart ag,a swiss corporation,replaced werkstatt,although it remained liable for completing the contract.we will refer to andre heller,stefan seigner,heller werkstatt gesmbh and admart ag collectively as admart.
the sale agreement,executed on june,stated that the aggregate price was million including a fee for the united states license rights for the various works of art.birch paid million,leaving due million after delivery of luna luna to san diego,california and million after termination of the construction and,but no later than march.
the agreement,governed by swiss law,provided for arbitration of any disputes in zurich.admart agreed to provide evidence of the authenticity of the art and to indemnify birch from all claims from the artists,prior owners and lessees.admart further promised to deliver luna luna in materially and legally good standing with clear title.the agreement gave birch the right to examine the basic contracts between admart and the artists.
andre heller and stefan seigner provided personal guarantees for in case admart was not in a position to fulfill the agreement.in the event of a dispute over the use of luna luna,admart could replace any single object by another one of similar artistic level and standard,within a reasonable length of time.
on july,the parties entered into an addendum to the agreement that included confirmation that each of the artists had conveyed ownership and use of the original artwork to admart as well as the right to transfer the artwork to.the amendment warranted that admart agreements with the artists would not restrict birch ownership of luna luna or its use within the united states.
contending that it had not received sufficient documentary evidence of admart clear title to luna luna,birch sent a notice of recission on october.admart denied any breach of contract and the parties commenced arbitration in zurich.
the swiss arbitration panel issued its final arbitral award in the award.the panel concluded that birch recission was invalid because admart had no obligation to provide clear title until the date of delivery of luna luna,and because birch was aware that admart ownership of the works of art was limited in various respects such that demand for clear title was never intended by the parties.
birch contended that it could not display and operate luna luna in the united states without exposing itself to litigation with the artists.in response,the arbitrators indicated that they were persuaded by admart success in obtaining twenty seven supplementary declarations from the artists which,according to the panel,specifically referr ed to the transfer of luna luna to birch and specif ied that luna luna should have all rights of use of the copyrights droit moral for the artists sic work in the usa further,the arbitration panel emphasized that the sales agreement contained an indemnity provision as well as a statement that,in the event there was a problem with one of the artist agreements,admart would substitute a similar piece of art.
the award directed birch to pay admart the outstanding balance of million million within thirty days of the date of the award on simultaneous exchange of the artwork and an additional million after luna luna had been set up,but no later than eight months following the date of the award.a setoff against the million payment was allowable only for sic amount for which on the due date a claim by birch is pending in another arbitration.birch was also directed to pay interest and storage fees.
as an alternative,the award authorized admart to deposit the property with a storage company in vienna after days from the date of the award.upon this action,the million would become due and payable.
the parties engaged in some unsuccessful efforts to comply with the award.then,birch appealed to the swiss federal supreme court complaining,among other grounds,about the arbitrators refusal to allow inspection of the goods before transfer.the swiss court affirmed the award on february,observing,inter alia,that the million holdback was intended to adjust any claim for damage to the goods.the court did not rule on enforcement of the award per se.
in june,while the swiss appeal was pending,admart filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware asking that the award be confirmed under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,et.the district court stayed the confirmation proceedings pending the swiss court decision.
in,birch representatives attempted to examine the art in vienna,but admart allegedly denied them access.birch then filed a petition to enforce the award in the austrian courts.that petition was dismissed in may,apparently on the ground that,as the loser in the arbitration,birch lacked standing to seek enforcement of the award.
while the austrian case was pending,birch filed a request for a second arbitration in switzerland,claiming damages for admart failure to comply with the award.on march,the panel for the second arbitration decided it had jurisdiction over several of birch claims for damages to the art and loss of profits for the period of time since the award was delivered in.that panel has not yet ruled on the merits of those claims.
the district court lifted its stay of the confirmation proceedings in.when the proceedings resumed,birch filed a request for production of the art based on evidence suggesting that several pieces had been repaired or improperly stored.the district court denied the motion because the award did not include such relief.
on january,the district court required birch to confirm that the monies required for satisfaction of the award had been deposited in an account for the benefit of admart.in turn,admart was to submit to the district court a description of the condition and location of the artwork.in its responsive affidavit,admart explained that a few pieces of art needed minor restoration and four pieces had been destroyed by fire or had fallen apart.in addition,admart noted that the shipping license for luna luna had expired so the containers holding the art could no longer be used.birch submitted the affidavit of thierry ador,its attorney.he averred that several years earlier,birch transferred funds to his control so that the funds could be used to pay admart ag to resolve birch dispute with admart.ador confirmed that the funds had been placed in interest bearing bank accounts now holding in excess of usd 
on june,the district court confirmed the award and issued the following order 
on or before july,birch shall pay the total of to admart,plus whatever interest said monies have earned since their deposition with theirry ador birch attorney in switzerland the court declines to order any further interest,given the circumstances of this dispute.
within hours of receipt of said payment,admart shall deliver to birch the containers holding the artwork admart shall be prepared to repair the minor damage to the artwork sustained during the many years it has been in storage due to this dispute 
we begin our discussion with a threshold issue.birch has argued that we should stay these proceedings pending resolution of the arbitration currently under way in switzerland.in addition,birch filed with this court a separate motion to adjourn the decision on enforcement of the arbitration award.birch claimed that the issues before this court overlap with those before the swiss arbitration panel and that we should stay our proceedings to avoid a conflicting ruling.
article vi of the convention states in relevant part 
if an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in article v e,the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may,if it considers it proper,adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award 
birch argues that it made an application for the setting aside or suspension of the arbitration award by instituting the currently pending swiss arbitration proceedings.
we decline the request to adjourn the appeal on enforcement of the award and will affirm the district court decision to deny further delay.in,helge berg,cir,the court of appeals for the first circuit considered a district court decision not to adjourn proceedings to enforce one arbitration award while a second arbitration proceeding was pending.the issues pending in arbitration partially overlapped those pending as part of the enforcement suit.on appeal,the court held that the district court erred in refusing to adjourn the suit as to the issues implicated by the pending arbitration.with respect to the issues no longer contested,however,adjournment was not appropriate and the enforcement proceedings should continue.id.at.
it is clear that the issues to be arbitrated in switzerland do not overlap those in the case before us which is limited to enforcement of the award.by contrast,the claims before the arbitration panel involve actions or harm that birch has alleged occurred after the award was rendered.such claims are not within the ambit of admart suit to confirm the award.
the swiss arbitration panel reached the same conclusion when admart sought to stay the arbitration until this case was completed.the arbitration panel rejected admart motion in a june,order in which it stated that the issues in the arbitration proceedings are different from those before us.the panel noted that it would adjudicate all the claims currently before it,regardless of whether we enforced the award.
because the issues here are distinct from those in the pending swiss arbitration proceedings,the arbitration is not an attempt to set aside or suspend the award.we will,therefore,proceed to decide the issues before us.
birch has appealed asserting that the district court improperly modified the award by abrogating simultaneous performance,failing to require the artist documentation be transferred,failing to honor the million hold back and failing to stay confirmation in light of the pending second arbitration proceeding in switzerland.admart counters that birch waived its argument that the opinion of the swiss federal supreme court supports concurrent performance.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the convention.standard bent glass glassrobots oy,cir.
in,the united states acceded to the convention and supplemented its action through the enactment of legislation.see et.as the supreme court explained,the principal purpose for acceding to the convention was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.scherk,d see also china minmetals materials import export,chi mei,cir general electric deutz ag,cir.consistent with the policy of favoring enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,parties have limited defenses to recognition and enforcement of an award as set out in article v of the convention.
under the convention,a district court role is must confirm the award unless one of the grounds for refusal specified in the convention applies to the underlying award.compagnie noga et v.the russian federation,cir.
article v provides that 
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that 
a the parties to the agreement referred to in article ii were,under the law applicable to them,under some incapacity,or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,failing any indication thereon,under the law of the country where the award was made or 
b the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case or 
c the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration,or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration,provided that,if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted,that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced or 
d the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,or,failing such agreement,was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place or 
e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that 
a the subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country or 
b the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.
to carry out the policy favoring enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,courts have strictly applied the article v defenses and generally view them narrowly.see china minmetals,at.
in yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,toys r us,cir,the court emphasized the limited power of review granted to district courts under the convention.the court examined the distinction between awards rendered in the same nation as the site of the arbitral proceeding and those rendered in a foreign country.the court concluded that more flexibility was available when the arbitration site and the site of the confirmation proceeding were within the same jurisdiction.id.at.however,the c onvention is equally clear that when an action for enforcement is brought in a foreign state,the state may refuse to enforce the award only on the grounds explicitly set forth in article v of the convention.id.at.
yusuf observed,t here is now considerable caselaw holding that,in an action to confirm an award rendered in,or under the law of,a foreign jurisdiction,the grounds for relief enumerated in article v of the convention are the only grounds available for setting aside an arbitral award.id.at.thus,mistake of fact and manifest disregard of the law do not justify setting aside an award.id.citing m c erwin behr gmbh,kg,cir.
in the same vein,in parsons whittemore overseas,societe generale de du papier rakta,cir,the court of appeals reviewed the grounds for refusal contained in the convention and said that the public policy defense is available only where enforcement would violate the forum state most basic notions of morality and justice.id.at.similarly,the court noted that an award can not be enforced under the convention where it is predicated on a subject matter outside the arbitrator jurisdiction,but the convention does not sanction the arbitrator construction of the parties agreement.id.at.
parsons whittemore adhered to a close reading of an arbitral award text,but the court considered,on its merits,a party contention that the judgment contained an arithmetical error.id.at.the plaintiff contended that the district court had failed to include in its judgment the amount of due from th
