opinion of the court 
we confront here the interplay between the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention,adopted june,and the federal arbitration act faa,et.we also address the propriety of sanctions awarded in the related litigation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgments of the district court confirming the arbitration award and denying one of the requested rule sanctions,but we reverse its judgment awarding the other rule sanction.
factual and procedural history 
a.the reinsurance treaties 
two pennsylvania insurers,legion insurance company and villanova insurance company collectively,the primary insurers,entered into reinsurance with the underwriting members of syndicate at lloyd for the year of account the reinsurers the primary insurers are now in liquidation,and they are represented in these actions by their statutory liquidator,joel ario,the insurance commissioner for the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
four reinsurance treaties are at issue here,all with identical language in the relevant provisions,differing only in the limits and types of coverage provided.the first relevant provision governs arbitration,and it is reproduced here in its entirety 
arbitration 
as a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder,any dispute or difference between the primary insurers and the reinsurers relating to the interpretation or performance of this agreement,including its formation or validity,or any transaction under this agreement,whether arising before or after termination,shall be submitted to binding arbitration,with the exception of matters requiring resolution by way of injunctive relief.
upon written request of any party,each party shall choose an arbitrator and the two chosen shall select a third arbitrator.if either party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days after receipt of the written request for arbitration,the requesting party may appoint a second arbitrator.if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the selection of a third arbitrator within thirty days of their appointment,each of them shall name three individuals,of whom the other shall decline two,and the selection of the third arbitrator from those remaining named individuals shall be named by the federal district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.all arbitrators shall be disinterested in the outcome of the arbitration.each party shall submit its case to the arbitrators within thirty days of the appointment of the third arbitrator.
the parties hereby waive all objections to the method of selection of the third arbitrator,it being the intention of both sides that the third arbitrator be chosen from those submitted by the parties.
the arbitrators shall have the power to determine all procedural rules for the holding of the arbitration,including but not limited to inspection of documents,examination of witnesses,and any other matter relating to the conduct of the arbitration.the arbitrators shall interpret this agreement as an honorable engagement and not as merely a legal obligation,they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.the arbitrators may award interest and costs,but in no event shall punitive or exemplary damages be awarded.each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall share equally with the other party the expense of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration.
arbitration hereunder shall take place in philadelphia,pennsylvania unless both parties otherwise agree.except as hereinabove provided,the arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the uniform arbitration act as enacted in pennsylvania.
the second relevant provision is the provision,reproduced in part below 
service of suit clause usa nma 
it is agreed that in the event of the failure of reinsurers hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder,the reinsurer hereon,at the request of the reinsured,will submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within the united states.nothing in this clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of reinsurers rights to commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the united states,to remove an action to a united states district court,or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the united states or of any state in the united states.
b.the coverage dispute and arbitration 
years after the reinsurance treaties were signed,a dispute arose between the primary insurers and the reinsurers.the reinsurers asserted that the primary insurers were not underwriting the business as described in the initial placement materials,the pool risks were not what the reinsurers expected them to be based on the primary insurers prior representations.the reinsurers alleged that the primary insurers underwrote their business in a manner that,while increasing premium volume for the primary insurers,also exposed the reinsurers to increased risk.a september audit by the reinsurers purportedly exposed these problems.
the reinsurers argued that they had suffered substantial losses as a result of the primary insurers misconduct,and they refused to pay the claims of the primary insurers.the primary insurers responded by demanding arbitration on september,in the hope of recovering their share of losses under the reinsurance treaties,what the primary insurers believed was owed to them by the reinsurers under the treaties.
the parties agreed that the dispute was arbitrable,and they proceeded to arbitration.the primary insurers asked the arbitration panel to award it the full amount due under the reinsurance treaties,plus interest.the reinsurers argued that the treaties should be rescinded and thus,their obligations to pay the primary insurers extinguished based on eight separate legal theories the primary insurers denied the contentions.broad discovery was conducted,resulting in document production,depositions,and expert reports the parties submitted briefs and a evidentiary hearing was held in which both parties made opening and closing statements,and thoroughly examined and witnesses.
the testimony of one witness in particular,ian crane,though only a small part of the arbitration proceedings,factors prominently in our case.crane was an employee of the managing agent for the reinsurers,and he participated in the underwriting of the treaties at issue here.he testified to the circumstances under which he received the placement materials from the primary insurers and the effect of those materials on underwriting.however,he did not specifically recall the precise communications between the primary insurer and the reinsurers,and he did not recall his exact knowledge and thoughts at the time of the reinsurance underwriting.instead,he based his testimony on documents including three documents that are not part of or cited in the reinsurance treaties,but are communications between the primary insurers and the reinsurers and their agents that he saw years ago during the placement process.
following the discovery,briefing,and evidentiary hearing,the arbitration panel issued an award rescinding three of the four treaties.on the rescinded treaties,the reinsurers were relieved of any obligation to pay losses owing on the remaining treaty,the reinsurers were ordered to pay losses owing.this award was a unreasoned award,as the panel neither provided the rationale for its decision nor gave any indication of the evidence on which its decision was based.
litigation 
the primary insurers have been in liquidation proceedings in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania since.following the arbitration award,on august,ario as liquidator on behalf of the primary insurers filed a motion to confirm in part,and to vacate in part,the award as part of the liquidation proceedings.shortly thereafter,the reinsurers removed the case to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to the removal provision in and filed a motion to confirm the award.the parties do not dispute that the award falls under the convention they part on whether the faa and convention enabling legislation contained in chapter of the faa applies including see standard bent glass glassrobots oy,cir listing four factors to determine whether an arbitration agreement falls under the convention.
on september,ario filed a motion to remand the case to state court,which the reinsurers opposed.ario motion was premised on the argument that the parties had selected the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act puaa.et,to govern the arbitration.therefore,he argued,the parties had opted out of the faa in its entirety including,and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.that court denied the motion to remand in a opinion,easily conclud ing that it had jurisdiction over the case pursuant to because the case related to an arbitration award falling under the convention.it reasoned that the authority cited by ario did not address the court jurisdiction,and ario had not even attempt ed to address why it lack ed jurisdiction under the real test for making that determination.
having failed in his attempt to remand the case,ario continued to pursue his motion to vacate the award in opposition to the reinsurers motion to confirm the award.he argued that the parties had opted out of faa vacatur standards in favor of the standards set forth by the puaa.applying his interpretation of the puaa vacatur standards,he urged that the award be vacated based on perceived weaknesses in crane testimony and other documentary evidence.the district court denied ario motion to vacate the award and granted the reinsurers motion.it concluded that review was governed by the faa,not the puaa.applying the faa and confirming the award,it rejected ario contention that there was no evidence to support the award.
following the district court rulings,the reinsurers moved for sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure against ario and his counsel,pepper hamilton,for both the motion to remand,and the motion to vacate the award.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.finding no basis in existing law for ario to assert there was no jurisdiction,and noting that ario did not argue that he was trying under rule b to extend or modify existing law,or create new law,the court decided that the imposition of attorney fees was an appropriate sanction.it also determined that the rule sanction would fall on ario attorneys alone and not on ario.however,the district court did not find a rule violation on account of the filings contesting the arbitration award because,in the court view,it was legally and objectively reasonable for ario to challenge the award on the basis that crane had no personal recollection of the circumstances leading up to the reinsurance agreements.
these consolidated followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
as we explain below,the district court had jurisdiction under and.we have jurisdiction over the consolidated appeals under.
we exercise plenary review over the denial of a motion to remand to the extent that the underlying basis is a legal question,as it is here.werwinski ford motor,cir.in reviewing a district court order confirming an arbitration award,we assess its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.china minmetals imp.exp.chi mei,cir.
we review a district court decision to grant or deny rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.simmerman corino,cir.this means we evaluate the court factual determinations,legal conclusions,and choice of an appropriate sanction with substantial deference,considering not whether we would make the same precise determinations,but only whether those determinations are contrary to reason or without a reasonable basis in law and fact.id.at.an example of abuse of discretion occurs when a district court base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.analysis 
removal to federal court was proper under 
while ario agrees that the award is subject to the convention,he argues that the parties agreed to waive chapter of the faa the convention implementing legislation in its entirety,precluding removal of this case to federal court.citing to supreme court and third circuit cases,his argument essentially has two prongs the parties can and did opt out of the entire faa such that they are not subject to its strictures and even if the faa applies,the arbitration provisions here included a clear and unequivocal expression of intent to opt out of the removal provision in.we disagree.
parties can not opt out of the faa and the convention implementing legislation 
ario argues that the language in the reinsurance treaties referencing the puaa supplanted the faa in its entirety.but though the faa allows parties to choose arbitration standards,they can not opt out of the faa.accordingly,the parties here could not have opted out of the faa,notwithstanding language that refers to the puaa in the reinsurance treaties.
the faa is divided into three chapters,two of which are implicated here.chapter the domestic faa,is a set of default rules designed to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.volt info,bd.of trs.of the leland stanford junior.chapter the convention implementing legislation,by contrast,is intended to secure for united states citizens predictable enforcement by foreign governments of certain arbitral contracts and awards made in this and other signatory nations.suter munich reins,cir citation omitted.
the domestic faa simply requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate,like other contracts,in accordance with their terms.volt,at citations omitted.it does not prevent the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the domestic faa itself.id.at.thus,when parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa.id.
we have interpreted the faa and volt to mean that parties may contract to arbitrate pursuant to arbitration rules or procedures borrowed from state law,and the federal policy is satisfied so long as their agreement is enforced.roadway package,kayser,cir citing volt,at,abrogated in part on other grounds by hall,llc mattel.
this is not because the agreements cease being subject to the faa,but is instead because the faa permits parties to specify by contract the rules under which arbitration will be conducted.id.quoting volt,at.thus,enforcement of an agreement to use state rules and procedures in lieu of the federal default rules is not because the parties have chosen to be governed by state rather than federal law,but because federal law requires that the court enforce the terms of the agreement.id.emphasis in original.but while parties may opt out of the faa default rules,they can not opt out of faa coverage in its entirety because it is the faa itself that authorizes parties to choose different rules in the first place.
although volt and roadway addressed only the domestic faa,the principles undergirding those decisions apply to the convention implementing legislation.an agreement by parties to apply the rules and procedures of state law neither operates as an opt out of the domestic faa nor as an opt out of the convention implementing legislation.it is federal law that allows the parties to make and enforce agreements that fall under the faa or the convention.accordingly,we reject ario argument that the faa,in its entirety,is inapplicable here.
the parties did not clearly and unambiguously agree to waive the right of removal 
though the parties may not opt out of and are governed by the faa,it is still possible to waive specifically the right of removal under.see suter,at.though not discussed by the parties or the district court in the prior proceedings,on appeal the parties acknowledge controlling precedent on the question of whether a right of removal under may be waived by agreement of the parties.in suter,we noted the strong and clear preference for a federal forum,a policy that will be best served by resolving any ambiguity in contract language against waiver of the right of removal.id.we therefore applied a strict standard,holding that there can be no waiver of a right to remove under the convention act,in the absence of clear and unambiguous language requiring such a waiver.id.
suter involved a provision in which a party had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the united states.id.at.we held that provision to be ambiguous with respect to the question of a waiver because the service of suit clause does not explicitly waive removal rights,and a defendant may remove a case after submitting to the jurisdiction of the state courts and complying with all necessary requirements to give the state courts power over the suit,as required by the service of suit clause.id.at alterations in original citation omitted.indeed,because a ll matters would be determined in accordance with the practice and law of the court chosen by the plaintiff in the sense that all state courts follow the removal law established by congress,the right of removal was consistent with the contractual language.id.alterations in original citation omitted.
we are aware of only one decision from our sister circuit courts that has found a clear and unambiguous waiver of the right to remove pursuant to.see ensco int l,certain underwriters at lloyd,cir.there,a divided panel of the court of appeals for the fifth held that a provision in an insurance policy met the clear and unambiguous standard where the parties agreed that a ny disputes arising under or in connection with the insurance policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of dallas county,texas.id.at emphasis added.the judges in the majority each found the words exclusive jurisdiction to be sufficiently express,clear,and unambiguous to be a waiver of rights.id.at smith,id.at owen,concurring in the judgment.any other interpretation would read the word exclusive out of the contract,id.at smith,j,and ignore the meaning of exclusive,id.at owen,concurring in the judgment.
ario contends that there is similar clear and unambiguous language in the reinsurance treaties arbitration provisions expressing the parties agreement to waive the right of removal.he argues that because the parties agreed that the arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the puaa,this waived the reinsurers and ario right to remove to federal court under.
we disagree that this was sufficiently clear and unambiguous to effect a waiver.not only do the arbitration provisions not make any mention of removal,the lone provision in the reinsurance treaties to refer to removal,the provision,explicitly states that n othing in it constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of reinsurers rights to remove an action to a united states district court.nor is there any language akin to exclusive jurisdiction that is fundamentally incompatible with the preservation of the right to remove.far from expressing a clear and unambiguous waiver of the right to remove,the reinsurance treaties expressly preserve it.
to the extent that ario argues that this language disavows removal only with respect to anything else in the provision and not the entire agreement,we disagree.it would be,to say the least,for the reinsurers to preserve expressly in one provision what ario argues they waived implicitly in another.we do not read the agreement to reach that illogical result.we conclude that the parties did not agree to waive their rights,and thus affirm the district court denial of the motion to remand.
b.the faa provides the applicable vacatur standards 
the parties disagree as to the applicable vacatur standards.ario argues that the puaa applies,while the reinsurers argue that the faa applies.we agree with the reinsurers.
though this award falls under the convention,which ordinarily provides extremely limited grounds for vacatur,the faa provides the applicable and slightly broader vacatur standards for this award.we conduct our analysis in two steps first,we explain why the faa vacatur standards presumptively apply to convention awards rendered and enforced in the united states and second,we determine that the reinsurance treaties do not show the parties clear intent to substitute the puaa vacatur standards for those of the faa.
in the absence of clear intent to the contrary,the faa vacatur standards apply to a convention award rendered and enforced in the united states 
under the convention,a district court role is must confirm the award unless one of the grounds for refusal specified in the convention applies to the underlying award.admart ag stephen mary birch,cir see also.article v of the convention sets forth the grounds for refusal and courts have strictly applied the article v defenses and generally view ed them narrowly.admart ag,at.accordingly,if vacatur is limited to the grounds listed in the convention,ario would have little chance of success.we have recognized,however,that there is more flexibility when the arbitration site and the site of the confirmation proceeding were within the same jurisdiction.id.citing yusuf ahmed alghanim sons toys r us,cir.
in yusuf,the court of appeals for the second circuit concluded that there are very different regimes for the review of arbitral awards in the country in which,or under the law of which,the award was made,and in other countries where recognition and enforcement are sought.at.after conducting a thorough analysis of both regimes,it concluded that the faa vacatur standards applied to the convention award it was reviewing because the arbitration award was made in the united states.id.
we previously adopted the second portion of yusuf in admart ag,holding that,in an action to confirm an award rendered in,or under the law of,a foreign jurisdiction,the grounds for relief enumerated in article v of the convention are the only grounds available for setting aside an arbitral award.at quoting yusuf,at.we therefore looked only to the limited article v grounds when reviewing a foreign convention award.but unlike admart ag,in this case the convention award was rendered in the united states.therefore,we must decide whether to adopt the first portion of the yusuf decision and its articulation of the available grounds for vacating a convention award rendered in the united states.
the yusuf court held that,under article v e of the convention,the courts of the united states are authorized to apply united states procedural arbitral law,the domestic faa,to nondomestic convention awards rendered in the united states.at see also convention art.v e recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused if the award has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.accordingly,the yusuf court concluded,t he convention specifically contemplates that the country in which,or under the law of which,the award is made,will be free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.at.we agree with this interpretation,and now adopt it.
this reasoning is also consistent with,also part of the convention implementing statute,in which congress explicitly provided for the application of the domestic faa to the extent that it did not conflict with the convention.see chapter of the faa applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter to the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter or the convention as ratified by the united states.when both the arbitration and the enforcement of an award falling under the convention occur in the united states,there is no conflict between the convention and the domestic faa because article v e of the convention incorporates the domestic faa and allows awards to be set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which that award was made.here,because the arbitration took place in philadelphia,and the enforcement action was also brought in philadelphia,we may apply united states law,including the domestic faa and its vacatur standards.
there was no clear intent to apply the puaa vacatur standards 
as discussed above,the domestic faa allows parties to agree to apply state law enforcement mechanisms in lieu of the faa default rules.of course,t he faa is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards,and parties may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law.hall,at t he faa standards control in the absence of contractual intent to the contrary.roadway,at quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton.
we require the parties to express a clear intent to apply state law vacatur standards instead of those of the faa.see id.at.we chose the clear intent standard because it furthered the faa goal of enforcing parties actual bargains,and we concluded that the default application of the faa caused fewer problems than application of other standards in the absence of clear intent.id.at we must,therefore,decide which error is worse wrongly concluding that parties intended to opt out,or wrongly concluding that they did not.in light of the faa history,we believe that the former is worse than the latter.thus,the parties here must show clear intent to apply the puaa vacatur standards in order to displace those of the faa.we also noted in a dictum that i t is not particularly difficult,for example,to provide that any controversy shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the puaa.id.at.we observed that this would impose minuscule transaction costs.id.
in applying the clear intent standard,we look to the reinsurance treaties to determine what the parties actually agreed to use as the vacatur standards.again,of particular importance are the arbitration provisions and the provision.we conclude that while there is a plausible argument that the parties may have agreed to apply puaa standards,it falls short of the clear intent we demand.
ario relies on language in the reinsurance treaties that resembles language we suggested in the roadway dictum noted above might satisfy the clear intent standard the arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the puaa.standing alone,this might suggest that the parties agreed to use the puaa vacatur standards.however,this is not the only sentence in the arbitration provisions of,nor does it contradict other sentences in,the reinsurance treaties relating to the enforcement of any resulting award.
for example,the reinsurance treaties contain a provision.as we recently observed,provisions complement arbitration clauses by establishing a judicial forum in which a party may enforce arbitration.century indem.certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir.the reinsurers contend that the provision here is the only provision to address judicial enforcement of the parties rights.reinsurers br.at emphasis in original.while we may not agree that it is the only such provision,it does specifically refer to enforcement of the arbitration award in state and federal courts.see,i n the event of the failure of reinsurers hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder,the reinsurer will submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within the united states.this provision does not contain any reference to the operative law,but it does address enforcement of any arbitration award by establishing a judicial forum for enforcement.of importance is that it also does not affirmatively elect to apply puaa vacatur standards in that forum.
by contrast,the arbitration provisions on which ario relies strongly imply that they are concerned with only the conduct of the arbitration itself,not judicial enforcement of a resulting award.the five paragraphs of arbitration provisions go into great detail as to the scope of the arbitrators power,the selection of the arbitrators,the procedural rules for conducting the arbitration,an honorable engagement section casting aside judicial formalities,limits to the types of damages,and the site of arbitration.reading the last paragraph of the arbitration provisions in this context leads us in the majority to conclude that they address solely the rules and procedures applicable to the conduct of the arbitration,not its enforcement,the applicable vacatur standards 
as previously stated,we err on the side of concluding that parties do not intend to opt out of the faa scheme.in the face of the reasonable inferences that the arbitration provisions were concerned solely with the conduct of the arbitration itself,and the provision was concerned with judicial enforcement of any arbitration decision,we believe that the parties did not have a clear intent to apply the puaa vacatur standards in lieu of the faa standards.we thus apply the faa vacatur standards and not those of the puaa.
c.the award is confirmable under the faa vacatur standards 
ario argues that,even if the faa vacatur standards apply,the arbitration panel had no ground on which to base its interpretation of the reinsurance treaties and exceeded its powers.because crane did not personally recall the negotiations that led to the underwriting,ario argues,the arbitration award must be vacated because it is irrational.applying the faa vacatur standards,we disagree and affirm the district court judgment confirming the award.
the faa vacatur standards 
vacatur under the faa is governed by.if the faa vacatur standards apply,as they do here,these are the only grounds that can support vacatur.see hall,at.four narrow grounds are provided in the statute 
in any of the following cases the united states court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
the sole basis ario asserts for vacation of the award is irrationality,and he makes no contention of any corruption,fraud,partiality,or misconduct the first three grounds.the irrationality standard comes from the fourth ground,the exceeded their powers provision.see mut.fire,marine inland ins.norad reins,cir noting that the court function in confirming or vacating a commercial arbitration award is severely limited and interpreting what is now a alteration in original citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.we review the form of the relief awarded by the arbitrators to determine if the form of the arbitrators award can be rationally derived either from the agreement between the parties or from the parties submissions to the arbitrators,and we do not revise the terms of the award unless they are completely irrational.id.citation omitted.
so deferential is the irrationality standard under the faa that we may not overrule an arbitrator simply because we disagree t here must be absolutely no support at all in the record justifying the arbitrator determinations for a court to deny enforcement of an award.united transp.union local suburban transit,cir citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.it should be clear that the test used to probe the validity of a n arbitrator decision is a singularly undemanding one.id.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.conversely,ario faces a steep uphill battle to show that the arbitration award rendered here was completely irrational and could not be supported on any theory of relief.
vacatur is not warranted 
ario contends that the award must be vacated because crane testimony and the reinsurers other immaterial documentary qualify only as.appellant br.at.notably,he does not argue that there was an actual lack of testimony or evidence,but claims that it was as if the reinsurers had no witness at all to support their defense s in response to each of the eight theories they offer and ario must disprove to justify the arbitration award.id.
in essence,ario arguments express discontent with the weighing of evidence by the arbitration panel.their premise is that the evidence uncovered during discovery including documents,deposition transcripts,and expert reports,the testimony and argument presented to the arbitrators during a evidentiary hearing,and the substantial briefing submitted by both parties,were not sufficient to justify the award.yet ario has not demonstrated why that voluminous record before the arbitration panel could not rationally lead to the arbitration award on any of the eight theories advanced by the reinsurers instead,he focuses solely on whether the evidence should have been given any weight at all.
as a reviewing court,we do not act to correct factual or legal errors made by an arbitrator,and we will uphold an award even if the arbitrator engaged in improvident,even silly,factfinding,major league umpires ass am.league of prof l baseball clubs,cir citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted applying a,so long as the arbitrator did not act completely irrational ly,mut.fire,at internal quotation marks omitted.while ario may find the evidence unpersuasive,we can not say that the arbitration panel was completely irrational in crediting the testimony of crane and the other documents presented to the panel that ario considers to be.accordingly,we affirm the district court confirmation of the arbitration award.
rule sanctions were not warranted 
we conclude with the parties regarding rule sanctions entered against pepper hamilton,ario counsel.as stated above,the district court imposed sanctions against the firm for its motion to remand,but declined to impose sanctions for its motion to vacate.because sanctions were not warranted for the filing of either motion,we reverse the award of sanctions for contesting jurisdiction in the motion to remand,and we affirm the denial of sanctions for the motion to vacate the award

the district court granted the motion for rule sanctions based on ario motion to remand,in which he argued that because the volt and roadway decisions allow parties to choose the applicable law and thus opt out of portions of the faa,by choosing the puaa the parties had opted out of as well,divesting the court of jurisdiction.the district court found a rule violation because it believed the cases cited by ario were clearly distinguishable,as they did not address jurisdiction or the convention,only the domestic faa.in imposing sanctions,the court found ario argument that the parties choice of law divested the court of jurisdiction had simply no basis in existing law and was clearly without merit,though it did not identify any authority to the contrary.it apparently believed that parties could not opt out of and waive their right to a federal forum 
while the district court may have distinguished volt and roadway or considered them not on point,that does not make an argument premised on those cases sanctionable under rule.nothing in those cases expressly forecloses ario argument,and though ultimately unpersuasive,it was not patently unmeritorious or frivolous.with volt and roadway as the only two pole stars for its decision and in the absence of directly contrary authority,there was equally no basis in existing law for the court to conclude that parties could not opt out of and divest a federal court of jurisdiction.as noted,rule sanctions are reserved for correcting litigation abuse.this was not such an instance.though we affirm the district court denial of the motion to remand,we reverse its decision to grant rule sanctions for the motion to remand,as the motion to remand was not patently lacking in merit.
the district court did not award rule sanctions based on the motion to vacate the award.while we ultimately disagree with ario assertion that the puaa applies here because the language in the reinsurance treaties did not state a clear intent to do so,his argument was not patently unmeritorious or frivolous.as discussed above,under the faa parties can indeed opt to apply state vacatur standards instead of federal standards.likewise,although ario faced a difficult burden to demonstrate that the award was completely irrational under the faa vacatur standards,the failure to do so does not detract from his argument that the award should be vacated under the puaa.viewing the district court determinations with substantial deference as we must,simmerman,at,it did not abuse its discretion.accordingly,we affirm its decision not to award sanctions for the motion to vacate.
we affirm the district court denial of the motion to remand,its denial of the motion to vacate,and its denial of the motion for sanctions for the filing of the motion to vacate the award.we reverse its grant of the motion for sanctions for the filing of the motion to remand.
i am pleased to join judge ambro majority opinion for the court in most respects,but i would hold that the parties reinsurance treaties evince a clear intent to adopt the vacatur standards of the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from part iii b of the court opinion.
what divides the panel is a disagreement over which body of law governs judicial review of the disputed arbitration it be the federal arbitration act faa,or the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act puaa.ann.the difference between the scope of judicial review of an arbitration award pursuant to the federal arbitration act and the scope of review available under pennsylvania law has commanded the attention of this court for over years,ever since,when i authored the primary opinion of the court in ludwig honold manufacturing fletcher,cir comparing vacatur standards of the faa with those of puaa statutory predecessor.the faa standards still rigorously limit judicial intervention,requiring challengers to show the award was completely irrational,a near prohibitive burden.mut.fire,marine inland ins.norad reinsurance,cir see also a.under the puaa,by contrast,a court may modify or correct an award that is contrary to law.ann.d a.
the determination of applicable law turns on whether the arbitration provisions of the parties reinsurance treaties evince a clear intent to impose the vacatur standards of the puaa over the presumptively applicable standards of the faa.see roadway package,kayser,cir.as we explained in roadway,this clear intent standard is intended to protect parties rights to contract for applicable law 
t he rule we announce will preserve and facilitate the ability of parties to contract around the default federal standards.sophisticated parties,those who employ experienced lawyers to draft their contracts will soon learn that a generic clause is not enough.assuming that both parties genuinely wish to be governed by standards other than the faa,requiring something more will impose minuscule transaction costs.it is not particularly difficult,for example,to provide that any controversy shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act.
id.at emphases in original.as a general matter,applying the clear intent standard so strictly as to functionally preclude parties from contracting for standards is contrary to roadway attempt to fashion a rule protecting parties right to determine the substantive law governing arbitration of their disputes and judicial enforcement vel non of any arbitral award.as the supreme court explained,
a rbitration under the act is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.just as they may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted.where,as here,the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa.

on my reading,the language of the treaties suggested that the parties intended to be bound by standards borrowed from state law,roadway,at,with sufficiently clear intent.the treaties mandate,in relevant part 
a ny dispute or difference between the reinsured and the reinsurers relating to the interpretation or performance of this agreement or any transaction under this agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the puaa.

i also can not agree with the majority conclusion that the clause can be read to abrogate the arbitration clause wholesale adoption,by plain language,of the rules and procedures of the puaa.a clause is a mechanism to assist implementation of an arbitration award by establishing a judicial forum for the enforcement of the award clauses are profoundly distinct from clauses,and i can not adopt the majority stretch of the canons of logical inference to conclude that a clause,without more,may dictate the choice of substantive law by omitting an affirmative declaration of what standard should govern judicial review of arbitral awards.this qualifies,i believe,as the fallacy of non sequitur our court has recently rejected just such an attempt to interpret a clause to mandate the form of s clauses do not negate accompanying arbitration clauses indeed,they may complement arbitration clauses by establishing a judicial forum in which a party may enforce arbitration.century indem.certain underwriters at lloyd,london,subscribing to retrocessional agreement,cir emphasis added.clauses are simply not intended,nor are they designed,to select governing substantive law,absent the inclusion of an affirmative provision.accordingly,the failure of the clause in question to explicitly adopt the puaa vacatur standards does not even suggest,much less compel,a finding that the parties contractual adoption of the rules and procedures of the puaa to govern arbitration of any dispute or difference excepts the rules for judicial review of contested awards.
in my view,the plain language of the arbitration provision demonstrates a sufficiently clear intent to impose all the rules and procedures of the puaa,including the vacatur rules.ann.d a.i would remand these proceedings to the district court for reconsideration of the motion to vacate under the vacatur provisions of the puaa.for the foregoing reasons,i respectfully dissent from the reasoning and conclusion of part iii b of the court opinion.
reinsurance treaties are a type of reinsurance contract.a treaty reinsurer agrees to accept and insure an entire block of insurance business both existing policies and as yet unwritten policies.instead of assessing the individual,existing risks being reinsured,the reinsurer evaluates the overall risk of the pool that is to be reinsured as the policies are written.thus,any representations by the primary insurer about the pool of risks are material to the reinsurer decision to reinsure the block of is in contrast to facultative reinsurance,where a reinsurer assesses the characteristics of each policy to determine whether to reinsure the individual risks as presented.see generally river ins.cigna reins,cir explaining the difference between treaty reinsurance and facultative reinsurance.
