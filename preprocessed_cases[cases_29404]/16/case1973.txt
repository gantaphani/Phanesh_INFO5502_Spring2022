scott eungard,a salesman,seeks commissions on products and services ordered by a client on the same day he was fired.because ambiguity in eungard compensation agreement precludes summary judgment for open solutions,we reverse and remand.
in june,open solutions acquired eungard previous employer,liberty fitech.after the acquisition closed,open solutions gave eungard the title of area vice president,but his job description remained the same he sold computer software,systems and hardware to banks and credit unions in the great lakes region.
during eungard first year of employment with open solutions,he began pitching a sale to aurgroup financial credit union.later that year,in march or april,aurgroup collaborated with another credit union to form the shared resources technology group.eungard maintained responsibility for landing a contract with aurgroup and shared responsibility with kelly bannevans for landing a contract with shared resources.eungard performed initial groundwork on both prospects.yet when aurgroup sought concessions eungard lacked authority to make,mark roberson vice president of national sales at open solutions became involved.
in june,eungard traveled to ohio with bannevans and roberson to finalize the aurgroup and shared resources sales contracts.by the end of the day on june,negotiations had gotten pretty heated.according to eungard,roberson was placing tremendous pressure upon the clients to get the contract signed on june because open solutions wanted to make its targets.roberson,eungard claims,employed used car tactics,and the negotiations basically ended when roberson tossed the contract across the table and told aurgroup cio to execute the agreement and see what happens from there.the meeting ended without a signed contract.that evening,eungard dropped roberson off at the dayton airport before he drove home to detroit.before leaving,roberson told eungard to stay engaged with the contracts.
eungard never had the opportunity.as it turns out,his supervisor,george mcgourty,was not pleased with eungard,who had not completed any sales during his first year of employment and who had no promising prospects aside from aurgroup.on the morning of july,less than hours after eungard left dayton,mcgourty terminated him for poor performance and allegedly promised that his commissions would be paid.
over the same two days that mcgourty planned and implemented eungard discharge,roberson exchanged several emails with aurgroup management to resolve their disputes.the parties soon came to terms,and aurgroup and shared resources signed the contracts on the evening of july hours after eungard was fired.for reasons that remain unclear,the clients backdated their signatures to june.aurgroup and shared resources mailed the contracts and a check to open solutions and faxed a copy of that preliminary check,dated july,on the same day.open solutions received the contracts in the mail and signed them on july.
in the following weeks,eungard and open solutions exchanged emails and voice messages regarding eungard request for commissions and mcgourty alleged promise that the commissions would be paid.open solutions eventually paid eungard the first half of the commission for the aurgroup contract,initially saying it was being paid per the comp plan,but later saying it was being paid as part of a business decision designed to avoid litigation.eungard demanded the other half of the aurgroup commission and his share of the shared resources commission,but the company refused.
eungard sued open solutions in michigan state court,claiming its refusal to pay the full commissions breached their contract,violated the michigan sales representatives commission act,violated the doctrine under michigan law and breached an implied contract.open solutions,a delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in connecticut,removed the suit to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction eungard is from michigan,after which both parties moved for summary judgment.the court ruled for the company,holding that,a s of the time of plaintiff termination,the agreements were not yet finalized or signed,that the second halves of the commissions were not due to be paid to him until after his termination and that eungard statutory,and claims lacked merit.
two provisions of the company sales commission plan govern these claims.the first establishes a schedule for commission payments 
commissions will be calculated on the commissionable agreement value,then paid over the following schedule 
in the month following agreement signing 
the remaining,the month following conversion.
the second describes the commission payment process for employees who leave the company 
if an area vice president employment with open solutions is terminated,either voluntarily or involuntarily,all of the employee closed orders as of their termination date will be reviewed for calculation of commission payments based on their status as of that date only the amount due to be paid at termination will be paid.no additional amounts will be paid after termination.
this case raises several questions about the meaning of these two provisions did the orders close by eungard termination date were the commission payments on those contracts,which were schedule d to be paid in the month after signing,due to be paid at eungard termination were the commissions,which were schedule d to be paid following conversion,due did eungard earn any of the shared resources commissions and does michigan law expand eungard rights to commissions beyond the contractual terms we look at each question in turn.
were the orders closed under the sales commission plan,open solutions had a duty to review only closed orders as of eungard termination date.so if the orders were not closed as of july,the company had no duty.reasoning that the orders were not fully executed when the company discharged eungard,the district court granted summary judgment to the company.
we disagree.under michigan contract law,the sales contracts that the company prepared for aurgroup and shared resources constituted offers,which the clients accepted when they signed the contracts.see,mckain moore,holding an agreement was binding even in the absence of the offeror signature.so far as open solutions was concerned,once the clients signed the contracts and mailed their checks on the evening of july,it had enforceable contracts.no doubt,parties may say that a contract will not go into effect until all parties have signed it,see palman reynolds,but that is not what these parties said they said the contract would be binding upon execution and delivery by client.even if the clients promises to pay did not suffice as consideration to create binding contracts,which does not appear to be the case under michigan law,see garlock motz tire rubber,p romises may be a good consideration for promises,the fact that aurgroup mailed a check to open solutions and faxed a copy of that check on july made those orders binding as of july.
nor did open solutions failure to sign the agreements until july prevent them from being closed orders.the term order connotes action on the part of the buyer,requesting goods or services on the seller proposed terms,see webster third new international dictionary defining order as a formal written authorization to deliver materials,to perform work,or to do both,and does not turn on the seller formalization of an already submitted request or for that matter on whether the buyer could enforce the contract against the seller.otherwise,the contract would give the company the immediate benefit of a binding contract without the simultaneous burden of commission payments until it chose to close the reading of the contract that not only is rife with the potential for abuse but also does not respect the contract terms.
were the commissions due at termination the more difficult question is which,if any,of eungard claimed commission payments were due to be paid at termination.emphasis added.relying on the due at termination language as well as the fact that the company fired eungard before the clients signed the contracts,the company contends it need not
