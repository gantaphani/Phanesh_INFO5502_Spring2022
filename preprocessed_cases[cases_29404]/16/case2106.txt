this case involves state and federal claims for breach of express and implied warranties on a damon intruder motor home the motor home or the rv manufactured by damon corporation damon and purchased by alvery pack.primarily the parties dispute whether defects in the motor home continued to exist during the period under warranty,whether the claimed defects were covered under damon warranty,and the length of time the motor home was out of service for repairs.
pack appeals the district court order granting damon motion for summary judgment on his express and claims under both state law and the magnuson moss warranty act mmwa,as well as his claims under the michigan consumer protection act mcpa.on appeal,pack argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of damon as to his claim because the evidence he has put forth creates a question of fact as to damon failure to cure defects under warranty and as to the failure of the essential purpose of the warranty because damon failed to make repairs within a reasonable time and as to his claim because michigan law does not require privity to maintain an claim against a remote manufacturer.pack further asserts that if this court reverses on either of these claims,it will be necessary to reverse the dismissal of his mmwa and mcpa claims.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse in part the district court judgment with regard to the claim and reverse the district court judgment with regard to the claim.we remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on september,plaintiff alvery pack purchased the subject motor home from general rv center grvc in brownstown,michigan.the cost of the rv,including financing,totaled.
the rv was accompanied by a limited warranty from damon,under which damon 
warrants that this recreational vehicle will be free from defects in material and workmanship attributable to damon for a period of one year or miles this limited warranty covers only materials,components or parts of the rv manufactured and finally assembled by damon in the event that a defect in materials or workmanship is found to exist,damon will provide for the repair or replacement of such defective material s or workmanship at no charge damon obligation to repair or replace defective materials is the sole obligation of damon under this limited warranty.
at damon warranty.the rv was under warranty from september,until september.
pack began experiencing problems with the motor home immediately after the purchase date.he alleges that a variety of defects put the rv out of service for a total of days in the first year and that it required nine separate service dates for repairs.
on september,pack instituted this lawsuit against damon and grvc in wayne county circuit court in michigan,alleging breach of express and implied warranties under state law and the mmwa,violations of the mcpa,revocation of acceptance,breach of contract,and rescission.defendants removed the case to the eastern district of michigan on the basis of the federal claim.the district court dismissed the claims against grvc because pack had a valid arbitration agreement with that defendant and granted both of damon motions for summary judgment,dismissing the claims against damon as well.plaintiff then timely commenced this appeal.
ii.analysis 
plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment to damon on his express and claims under state law and the mmwa and his claims for violations of the mcpa.

express warranty 
a warranty is an express warranty under the michigan uniform commercial code 
as the michigan supreme court has not ruled on whether a warranty constitutes an express warranty under the michigan uniform commercial code mucc,we look to decisions of the michigan court of appeals,which are binding authority in federal courts in the absence of any michigan supreme court precedent.hampton united states,cir.in several cases,the michigan court of appeals has assumed without discussion that a warranty constitutes an express warranty under the mucc.see,krupp pm eng g,honeywell,severn sperry,kelynack yamaha motor.
the michigan supreme court would likely also interpret a warranty extended by a remote manufacturer to be an express warranty under the mucc.under the mucc,an express warranty is created by a n affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.mcl a.this does not limit the extension of express warranties to direct sellers,and the mucc definition of a who sells or contracts to sell goods does not indicate that a seller is restricted to one who directly sells goods to the consumer.id.d.moreover,damon refers to its warranty as an express written limited warranty.at damon warranty.given this,the warranty likely formed part of the basis of the bargain,and thus it qualifies as an express warranty.
breach of the express warranty 
pack alleges several continuing defects for which damon is responsible and which damon failed to repair or replace,as well as one defect,the leaning of the motor home,that was not repaired within a reasonable time,thus causing the warranty to fail of its essential purpose.
a.a question of material fact exists as to damon failure to cure several defects.
damon limited warranty on the rv ran for one year from the date of purchase,september.pack claims that there were eight defects that arose during this period that remained uncorrected rust loose gasket rear monitor malfunctions dashboard clock and cigarette lighter malfunction outside shower does not work properly fog light fills with water and is corroded bedroom does not close completely and abnormal popping noise from front end while driving at his deposition,pack testified that both the clock and the fog light had been corrected as to the other problems,namely the rust,loose gasket,rear monitor,outside shower,bedroom,and the popping noise,pack deposition testimony and affidavit indicate that these defects persisted despite damon repairs.
to rebut these contentions,damon puts forth an affidavit from jason quillen,grvc service manager,and an expert report from michael bukowski,grvc service shop foreman.although the district court relied on both the bukowski report and the quillen affidavit,the bukowski report is unsworn and thus is hearsay,which may not be considered on a motion for summary judgment.see sutherland.dep t of treasury,cir.moreover,quillen credentials as an expert as to either rv mechanics or the damon limited warranty are not clear from the record.in any event,quillen affidavit does not defeat pack contentions.first,quillen does not deny the existence of the popping noise,the rust,or the shower problem.second,as to the two,quillen affirms that the problems did not exist at the time of the inspection,may,however,the condition of the motor home on that date is not dispositive as to whether the were repaired within the period under warranty.
given that circumstantial evidence suffices to prove a defect,see caldwell fox,and that the facts should be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,pack has come forward with sufficient evidence to raise a question of material fact regarding failure to cure the following defects the gasket,the bedroom,the rear monitor,the popping noise,the rust,and the shower.
questions of material fact exist as to whether some of the continuing defects are covered under the damon warranty.
damon warranty covers materials,components or parts of the rv manufactured and finally assembled by damon.at damon warranty.the warranty specifically excludes from coverage i tems added or changed after the rv leaves damon damage resulting from n ormal wear and usage damage to otherwise warranted components or parts caused by environmental corrosion and a ny material,component,or part of the rv that is warranted separately by its manufacturer,including the chassis id.at.
of the defects for which a question of material fact exists regarding damon failure to two,the rear monitor,the popping noise,the rust,and the question of material fact regarding coverage under the warranty has been raised as to the and the rust.the shower problem is caused by a restricter that pack added to the rv from a prior motor home,and thus it is excluded from coverage.as for the monitor,the warranty exempts from coverage component parts that are separately warranted and includes a nonexhaustive list of such parts.although the monitor is not named on the list,it is of the same kind as the excluded items listed,and quillen affirmed that it was excluded as a component part covered under separate warranty.pack has not provided evidence to rebut this contention.pack admitted that he did not know the cause of the popping noise and has no evidence suggesting coverage by the warranty.this,combined with a lack of evidence concerning the persistence of this defect suffices for damon to have met its burden on this defect.
damon has failed to meet its burden to show that the are not under damon warranty neither appears to fall under any exception to damon warranty.the damon warranty claim form noting that damon fixed the loose gasket on the rv in march before pack bought the unit also tends to show that the are covered under warranty.finally,although the warranty excludes coverage of damage resulting from n ormal wear and usage and environmental corrosion,which typically might exclude rust,the rust problem existed prior to pack purchasing the rv.this indicates that there might be a defect beyond corrosion or normal usage,and thus pack has raised a genuine issue of fact as to the warranty coverage of the rust.
therefore,there are issues of material fact regarding defects related to the gasket,the bedroom,and the rust,and thus the grant of summary judgment on the breach of express warranty as to those claims was inappropriate.
failure of essential purpose 
further,pack argues that he is not required to prove continuing defects because damon limited warranty failed of its essential purpose,which would allow him relief beyond the limited warranty.although the mucc allows a warranty agreement to limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable,mcl a,where an exclusive or limited remedy fail s of its essential purpose,the buyer is entitled to other remedies.id.b.
repairs or replacements must be completed within a reasonable time.
pack is entitled to relief on his claim of failure of essential purpose if he can show that damon failed to repair or replace defects in the rv for which it was responsible within a reasonable time.see kelynack,at holding that where a manufacturer extends a warranty,it does not have an unlimited time to make the repairs,but rather must repair or replace the parts within a reasonable time.in kelynack,the michigan court of appeals found that the warranty on a motorcycle had failed of its essential purpose due to unreasonable delay where the motorcycle became completely inoperable after ten weeks in the plaintiff possession,then remained at the dealer for over three months,and was finally returned to the plaintiff when the weather precluded its use.see also krupp,at holding that a warranty failed of its essential purpose because the item was out of service for eighteen months and was not entirely repaired for three years.
time out of service raises a disputed issue of material fact.
although the record is not clear on the number of days the motor home was out of service,a view of the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party reveals that the motor home was out of service for days in the first year of ownership on its face,this appears to be an unreasonable time,and thus if these facts were proven at trial,damon warranty would likely be found to fail of its essential purpose.
damon attempts to rebut pack claims by arguing that the repairs that took the most substantial amount of time were not covered under damon warranty.damon alleges that the leaning problem that led pack to have his truck serviced at least twice and led to the longest servicing,from april,until august,was caused by the chassis,and thus was not covered by the warranty.however,pack has raised a question of material fact as to the cause of this defect by producing evidence that the defect was a coach problem,and thus under warranty.a ford work order states right side sitting about inches lower th a n left and conversion package is all on right side bathroom,tanks.no suspension problem.at gorno ford invoice.this indicates that the problem is with the coach,which is covered by the warranty,and not the suspension,which is part of the chassis.a grvc work order indicates that this was a coach problem,and that damon authorized the coach to be shimmed to correct the problem.although quillen affirmed that he found no leaning when he inspected the rv,pack complaint regarding the leaning problem goes to the delay in its repair,not its continuing defectiveness,and thus the rv condition on the date of its inspection is immaterial 
claims do not require privity under michigan law 
the michigan supreme court has not yet ruled on whether privity is required to bring an claim under the mucc.where a federal court is deciding an issue of state law that has not been decided by the state highest court,the federal court should determine how the state highest court would decide the issue were it faced with it.see meridian mut.ins,at.the federal court should heed the decisions of the intermediate appellate state courts except where the federal court is persuaded that the highest court of the state would not so decide,id.citing comm r estate of bosch,d,and the federal court may consider applicable dicta of the state highest court,angelotta am.broad,cir.
the mucc provides that u nless excluded or modified,a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind,and that g oods to be merchantable must be at least such as are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.mcl.the mucc does not mention any privity requirement to bring a claim under this provision.id.d.
michigan law has not settled whether privity is required to bring an claim under the mucc.in,prior to the adoption of the mucc the michigan supreme court reversed its traditional privity requirement for claims in an opinion that criticized the privity requirement at length.spence three rivers builders masonry supply.the michigan supreme court followed spence s repudiation of privity in several subsequent decisions.see hill harbor steel supply,piercefield remington arms,manzoni detroit bottling.
spence and its progeny have been cited with approval after the adoption of the mucc to hold that privity is not required to sustain an claim for economic losses.see,southgat
