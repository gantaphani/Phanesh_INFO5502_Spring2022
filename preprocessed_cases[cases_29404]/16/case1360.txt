the effective date of the lease was october.on december,potomac investment informed wmata that it was exercising its rights under section a of the ground lease to terminate the ground lease.by the same letter,potomac advised wmata that it reserves all rights it has under the right of first refusal agreement wmata responded by a letter dated december,that it believed that potomac no longer had any rights under the first refusal agreement or any further liability to potomac.on april,wmata filed the present suit in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment and an order to quiet title 
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court denied summary judgment to potomac investment and granted summary judgment to wmata.potomac investment appealed.
on appeal,as it did below,potomac investment argues that by terminating the lease agreement,it failed to lease the subject property within the meaning of section of the first refusal agreement.consequently,according to potomac investment,it is entitled to the benefit of a reinstated right of first refusal under section of the first refusal agreement.
