gentek building products appeals a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of company.gentek originally sued in state court,alleging that provided gentek with a defective coating material for steel and aluminum siding that gentek manufactures.removed the suit to federal court,contending that gentek claims fell within the ambit of the act,which provides remedies for certain warranty claims involving what it defines as consumer products.as the case proceeded to summary judgment,stated that the coatings at issue were not consumer products,and the district court ultimately granted summary judgment on gentek claims.additionally,the court granted summary judgment on its counterclaim for amounts owed for the coatings it provided.gentek contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the only basis for jurisdiction was allegedly false statement in its notice of removal that the suit involved a consumer product.alternatively,gentek contends that the district court erred in calculating prejudgment interest awarded to on its counterclaim.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
gentek is a commercial manufacturer of steel and aluminum siding.is a commercial manufacturer of paints and coating products.for some years,gentek and its predecessors purchased certain coatings from and applied them to steel and aluminum in the fabrication of its siding.some of these coatings allegedly failed by cracking,chipping,or peeling,subjecting gentek to customer complaints and warranty claims.gentek filed suit against in ohio state court,raising various claims,including breach of warranty,related to the allegedly failed coatings.
removed the suit to federal court,contending that the trade commission improvement act,provided federal jurisdiction.the act provides a federal remedy for certain warranty breaches related to what it defines as consumer products.in its notice of removal,stated that the coating at issue is a consumer product and that the act applied.gentek did not challenge the removal.gentek then amended its complaint to state expressly,in addition to the claims,a claim under the act.then counterclaimed for gentek alleged failure to pay for the disputed coatings.
the case proceeded to the stage.first moved for partial summary judgment on gentek claims and on counterclaim.the district court granted these motions,awarding in prejudgment interest to on its counterclaim for the that gentek failed to pay for the coating.
then moved for summary judgment on the claim.argued,among other things,that the district court earlier rejection of gentek state warranty claims required rejection of gentek claims.alternatively,contended that gentek failed to meet requirements.for example,stated contrary to its earlier statement in its notice of removal that the coating is not a consumer product as defined by.joint appendix ja.in response,gentek argued that,because removal to federal court was based on earlier statement that the coating was a consumer product,this new statement showed that removal was improper and that the district court lacked jurisdiction,there was no claim.
the district court granted summary judgment,noting that its earlier ruling rejecting gentek warranty claims also defeated gentek claim.further,the court rejected gentek argument regarding jurisdiction,explaining that jurisdiction existed under based on gentek amended complaint.the court explained that,although determined,after discovery,that the act does not apply to this action,that determination does not serve to divest the court of jurisdiction.ja.
gentek appealed.contended that gentek is not the real party in interest and that this court therefore lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.in december,this court rejected that argument,concluding that gentek has standing.gentek.prods,slip op.at cir,order.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
gentek contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction.this court reviews de novo a district court exercise of jurisdiction.green ameritech,cir.to assess gentek contention,we begin with first principles of removal jurisdiction.
defendants sued in state court generally may remove the suit to federal district court if the district court has original jurisdiction over the suit.a except as expressly provided by act of congress,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.thus,lawsuits involving federal questions are removable any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction found on a claim or right arising under the constitution,treaties or laws of the united states shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties.b.
to determine whether a claim arises under federal law,a court,under the rule,generally looks only to the plaintiff complaint.palkow csx,cir citing gully first bank.and louisville nashville mottley.if the complaint relies only on state law,the district court generally lacks jurisdiction,and the action is not removable.id.this makes the plaintiff the master of the complaint the plaintiff may simply avoid federal jurisdiction by relying exclusively on state law.caterpillar williams,d.
the supreme court has developed a limited exception to the rule the doctrine.palkow,at.if congress intends that a federal statute should completely preempt an area of state law,any complaint alleging claims under that area of state law is presumed to allege a claim arising under federal law.id.citing metro.life ins.taylor,d.the complaint may thus be removed to federal court and will be treated as alleging a federal cause of action,notwithstanding that,on its face,the plaintiff complaint alleges only a cause of action.id.
but the doctrine is a limited exception to the rule.id.at.the supreme court has demonstrated a reluctance to extend application of the doctrine,largely limiting its finding of complete preemption to a handful of federal statutes,the most widely recognized of these being the labor management relations act,a lmra and the employee retirement income security act,a erisa.id.citations omitted.as will be discussed below,the act does not completely preempt state law.
if a plaintiff believes that removal is improper because the complaint does not arise under federal law,the plaintiff may challenge removal,including by moving to remand the matter to state court.yet the plaintiff may waive the right to bring this challenge if the jurisdictional defect is ultimately cured.a series of frequently cited decisions illustrate the contours of the law in this area.
in brough united steelworkers of america,st cir,the plaintiff employee brought negligence claims in state court against the defendant,who removed the action to federal court,claiming that the duty it owed to the plaintiff was derived from federal law.the court denied the plaintiff motion to remand to state court.id.the plaintiff amended his complaint to add a federal claim,and the court later granted the defendant motion for summary judgment.id.at.the first circuit held that,although federal jurisdiction did not exist at the time of removal making the removal improper,the amendment cured the jurisdictional defect and amounted to a waiver of any objection to the denial of remand clearly plaintiff can not be permitted to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court,and then disclaim it when he loses.id.at accord tolton am.biodyne,cir citing brough for the proposition that a mending a complaint after removal cures a jurisdictional defect.
one year later,the supreme court faced a similar situation of improper removal in grubbs general electric credit,d though,unlike brough,there was no objection to the removal,a motion to remand to state court.the court held that an erroneous removal need not cause the destruction of a final judgment,if the requirements of federal jurisdiction are met at the time the judgment is entered.caterpillar lewis,d discussing grubbs,at.under those circumstances,the validity of the removal procedure followed may not be raised for the first time on appeal.id.quoting grubbs,at.emphasis removed accord tolton,at noting that,under grubbs,plaintiffs could not challenge removal after having summary judgment granted against them.
the seventh circuit followed these general principles in bernstein,cir.there,the defendants removed the plaintiff complaint the district court then denied the plaintiff motion to remand the plaintiff amended the complaint,adding a federal claim and the court granted summary judgment to the defendants.id.at.although the seventh circuit determined that the plaintiff complaint was not removable,it followed brough and held that the plaintiff waived his right to challenge that removal once jurisdiction existed via the amended complaint.id.at.a fter the plaintiff motion to remand was denied,judge posner explained,he threw in the towel,as it were,and filed an amended complaint in federal court that included an unmistakable federal cause of action id.accordingly,once he decided to take advantage of his involuntary presence in federal court to add a federal claim to his complaint he was bound to remain there.id.
the supreme court revisited these issues in in caterpillar lewis,reaffirming that a plaintiff who fails to object to removal waives any challenge to that removal once a jurisdictional defect is cured and a federal court enters judgment.at.but the court also held perhaps contrary to broader statements in brough and bernstein that a plaintiff who timely objects in that situation may least under certain the removal.id.there,the defendant removed a suit,purportedly based on diversity jurisdiction.id.at.the plaintiff objected and moved to remand to state court the district court denied this motion,and the case proceeded to a jury trial ending in a verdict for the defendant.id.at.on appeal to this court,we determined that diversity was not complete at the time of removal.id.at.accordingly,even though the nondiverse defendant was dismissed before judgment,we vacated the district court judgment.id.
the supreme court reversed.the court first explained that although grubbs instructs that a judgment can stand even when removal was improper,grubbs was not dispositive of the question whether a plaintiff,who timely objects to removal,may later successfully challenge an adverse judgment on the ground that the removal did not comply with statutory prescriptions.id.at.then,acknowledging that the plaintiff had preserved his objection to improper removal,the court nonetheless held that the plaintiff arguments run up against an overriding consideration.once a diversity case has been tried in federal court,with rules of decision supplied by state law under the regime of erie tompkins,considerations of finality,efficiency,and economy become overwhelming.id.at.the court also emphasized that,for the judgment to stand,jurisdiction must exist at the end of the day and case.id.at.because the jurisdictional defect lack of diversity was cured at the time of judgment,the court held that we erred by vacating the judgment.id.at.
cases since caterpillar show its limits although the considerations of finality outweighed the plaintiff objection to improper removal there,those considerations are not always weighty if there is a final judgment.the fifth circuit addressed that situation in waste control specialists llc envirocare of texas,cir.there,the court held that a plaintiff objection to improper removal based on purported jurisdiction preserved the objection even though the plaintiff eventually amended its complaint to state a federal claim despite that the court entered judgment against the plaintiff based on a rule b motion to dismiss.id.at.the court explained that the caterpillar court concerns about finality and economy were particularly focused on diversity which the federal court applies the state law exactly as a state court arguably were not implicated where,as in waste control,a state court would treat the plaintiff claim differently from the federal question that claim purportedly involved.id.at.additionally,the court explained that it was greatly influenced because there was no trial on the merits,a notion that encompasses dismissal as well as a full bench or jury trial.id.at.the court accordingly held that the plaintiff,despite amending its complaint to state a federal claim and then losing on a motion to dismiss,preserved its objection to the improper removal.id.at.the court therefore vacated the district court judgment for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.
from these cases,the following general framework emerges where removal is improper but a final judgment issues with jurisdiction existing at that time if the plaintiff did not move to remand to state court,the judgment stands grubbs even if the plaintiff moved to remand,the judgment will stand so long as considerations of finality and economy are compelling particularly where a diversity case proceeds to summary judgment or trial,as in caterpillar but the judgment might not stand if the plaintiff moves to remand and those finality and economy considerations are less significant such as in a case that is dismissed before summary judgment,as in waste control even if the plaintiff amended the complaint to state a federal claim.this all assumes,of course that jurisdiction exists at the time of judgment if not,the judgment must be vacated.caterpillar,at.despite a federal trial court threshold denial of a motion to remand,if,at the end of the day and case,a jurisdictional defect remains uncured,the judgment must be vacated.citing.h.
as discussed below,these principles reveal that the district court judgment here should stand gentek waived any challenge to improper removal,and no jurisdictional defect existed at the time of judgment.because of gentek waiver,we do not consider whether the principles of finality and economy discussed in caterpillar would otherwise suggest that the judgment not stand.
gentek waived any challenge to removal by failing to move for remand 
gentek filed suit in state court raising only claims.then removed the case to federal court,contending that gentek state warranty claims were really claims.in particular,stated that the coating amounted to a consumer product under the act.instead of challenging the removal by moving to remand to state court,gentek simply amended its complaint to explicitly state the claims.
says gentek accordingly waived any challenge it has to jurisdiction at the time of removal,now that there is a final judgment.cites a number of the cases discussed above for the proposition that a plaintiff who does not move to remand a case after removal waives any objection to removal if jurisdiction exists at the time of judgment.but none of those cases involve a plaintiff who claims,as gentek does here,that the defendant false statement was the sole basis for i removal and,in turn,ii the amendment of the complaint that later provided federal jurisdiction.it makes sense to bar a plaintiff from challenging removal when the plaintiff voluntarily accedes to it but it is less clear that,assuming the defendant statement is fraudulent,a plaintiff is stuck with purportedly federal pleadings based on the defendant fraud.in short,gentek would ask,how could we expect it to object to a removal built on a defendant false statement when gentek did not know the statement was false 
these questions matter,however,only if we presume as the parties appear to that alleged misrepresentation regarding consumer products forced gentek into federal court.but that is simply not the case.gentek of master of its complaint.could have lied about the consumer product and made plenty of additional lies suggesting that gentek had other federal claims,but gentek remained free to allege solely state claims in state court.even if the coatings were consumer products,had gentek moved to remand instead of amending its complaint,the district court would have granted the motion.first,it would not appear that some substantial,disputed question of federal law was a necessary element of one of the state claims.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.additionally,although gentek claims might be similar to claims under the act,that act,unlike the lrma and erisa,does not completely preempt state law.see automobile importers of am.minnesota,cir chrysler texas motor vehicle,cir in re general motors.engine interchange,cir but see wolf ford motor,cir holding that the act preempts state warranty claims.accordingly,a district court would grant a plaintiff motion to remand a case that raises solely state claims when the defendant removes based on the act.see,woods nissan north,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.april,granting plaintiff motion to remand where defendants removed based on act and plaintiff complaint raised no federal claims and complaint was not artful pleading to avoid complete preemption smith am.alternative ins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,granting plaintiffs motion to remand where defendants removed based on act and plaintiffs elected to proceed in state court exclusively relying on state law,and noting that warranty act claims do not fall into th e category of claims that are completely preempted hinton daimler chrysler servs.north am.llc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,granting plaintiff motion to remand after defendant removed based on act because plaintiff complaint merely referred to the act as providing a standard of care for state claims greene motors,d granting plaintiff motion to remand after defendant removed based on act because plaintiff complaint merely referred to standards as further evidence of violations.thus,this court would face a more difficult situation if a defendant made a false statement related to claims that would be completely,a statement that would bring the claims within the ambit of the duping the plaintiff to accede to what appeared to be the federal court exclusive jurisdiction.in that case,the plaintiff might have a strong argument to say it did not waive a challenge to jurisdiction,because it would never have had a it reasonably believed the defendant go to state court.
here,however,the removal was of anything gentek simply could have shown the district court that was the case and been back in state court.instead,gentek voluntarily amended its complaint to explicitly state federal claims under the act.thus,gentek did just throw in the towel in a fight against removal it never even entered the ring.it has therefore waived its argument that removal was improper.the only question,then,is whether the district court had jurisdiction at the time of judgment if so,the judgment must stand.see grubbs,d.
jurisdiction existed at the time of judgment 
although gentek waived its argument that removal was improper,this court still must verify that jurisdiction existed at the time of judgment.as the case proceeded to summary judgment,stated,contrary to its notice of removal,that the coating was not a consumer product under the act.contends,however,that assessing jurisdiction is a simple quick look at the amended complaint shows that gentek stated,explicitly,a claim.thus,says,jurisdiction exists based on the allegations alone regardless of their truth.gentek,on the other hand,contends that,because the allegations regarding the consumer product were ultimately not true,there never was jurisdiction.
view that courts assess federal jurisdiction based solely on allegations in the complaint is not without exception.in world,a defendant could lie about a fact that creates a federal claim,a plaintiff could file a complaint based on that fact,and,ipso facto,federal jurisdiction would exist.under this reasoning,a plaintiff could come up with its own lie to create federal jurisdiction and then file complaints in federal court,facing no jurisdictional problems.
though the parties do not explicitly say so,what really is at issue here is a jurisdictional challenge to the allegations in the complaint.rule b motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction generally come in two varieties a facial attack or a factual attack.ohio life ins.united states,cir.a facial attack on the jurisdiction alleged in the complaint questions merely the sufficiency of the pleading.id.when reviewing a facial attack,a district court takes the allegations in the complaint as true,which is a similar safeguard employed under b motions to dismiss.id.if those allegations establish federal claims,jurisdiction exists.
where,on the other hand,there is a factual attack on the jurisdiction alleged in the complaint,no presumptive truthfulness applies to the allegations.id.when a factual attack,also known as a speaking motion,raises a factual controversy,the district court must weigh the conflicting evidence to arrive at the factual predicate that does or does not exist.id.in its review,the district court has wide discretion to allow affidavits,documents,and even a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve jurisdictional facts.id.citing williamson tucker,cir and mortensen first fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.
questions of removal similarly may involve facial and factual inquiries.when ruling on a motion to remand,a court generally looks to the plaintiff complaint,as it is stated at the time of removal,and the defendant notice of removal.see,miller grgurich,cir.but federal courts may look beyond the pleadings to assess challenged facts this may occur,for example,when the defendant alleges that the plaintiff fraudulently joined defendants to destroy diversity jurisdiction.moore federal practice e ii.in that context,the court may employ a procedure to examine affidavits and deposition testimony for evidence of fraud.id.citing great plains trust morgan stanley dean witter,cir.
but a district court engages in a factual inquiry regarding the complaint allegations only when the facts necessary to sustain jurisdiction do not implicate the merits of the plaintiff claim.garcia copenhaver,bell,cir.if,on the other hand,an attack on jurisdiction also implicates an element of the cause of action,then the district court should find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of the plaintiff claim.id.quoting williamson,at emphasis added.this provides a greater level of protection to the plaintiff who in truth is facing a challenge to the validity of his claim the defendant is forced to proceed under rule b or rule both of which place greater restrictions on the district court discretion id.quoting williamson,at.as a general rule a claim can not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because of the absence of a federal cause of action.id.quoting williamson,at.the exceptions to this rule are narrowly drawn,and are intended to allow jurisdictional dismissals only in those cases where the federal claim is clearly immaterial or insubstantial.id.quoting williamson,at.we follow these principles.see moore lafayette life ins,cir quoting williamson and explaining that when the basis of federal jurisdiction is intertwined with the plaintiff cause of action,the court should assume jurisdiction over the case and decide the case on the merits but id.at cook,dissenting noting that if the disputed question determines whether the plaintiff is a proper party,such as whether the plaintiff is a participant under erisa,the district court should address first that jurisdictional question.
as mentioned,contends that we should look to nothing more than the allegations in the amended complaint,assume their truth,and conclude jurisdiction exits.but this is the process for a facial attack the question here is factual.nobody disputes that the allegations in gentek amended complaint,referring to the coating as a consumer product under the act,raise a federal claim on their face.the question is whether the coating really is,factually,a consumer product.
although this case presents the unusual situation of the plaintiff,gentek,essentially raising a factual attack on its own complaint,this posture does not alter that any factual attack,and by whomever,intertwined with the merits of gentek claim.accordingly,the district court had jurisdiction.to establish claim,a plaintiff must show that the item at issue was a consumer product.this disputed fact therefore goes to the merits.see miller willow creek homes,cir affirming district court grant of summary judgment,which was based on con
