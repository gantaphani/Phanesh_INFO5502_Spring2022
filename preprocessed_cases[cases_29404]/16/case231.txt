background 
because this appeal follows a dismissal for failure to state a claim,we draw the facts from the complaint and those documents fairly incorporated into it.see sec tambone,cir en banc nisselson lernout,cir.
the defendant,vertex pharmaceuticals,is based in cambridge,massachusetts.in the spring of,an executive search firm acting on its behalf contacted anthony artuso to gauge his interest in changing jobs.the plaintiff,then a highly paid executive at a rival pharmaceutical company,turned a deaf ear to these initial overtures.but the defendant persisted,and negotiations soon began.
the defendant stressed the availability of challenging work it envisioned that the plaintiff would assume major responsibility in the marketing of a promising new drug.it also painted a glowing picture of the prospects for lucrative financial rewards in that regard,it proposed that the plaintiff would receive and stock part of a generous compensation package.
the plaintiff ultimately succumbed to these blandishments and,on june,the parties signed the agreement.its terms are of paramount importance here.
the agreement specified that the plaintiff would serve as an employee of the defendant with the title of for strategic planning.it displaced the earlier negotiations through an integration clause,which stated that the agreement would constitute the complete agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant regarding employment matters and will supersede all prior written or oral agreements or understandings on these matters.
as to compensation,the agreement provided for a hiring bonus,an annual base salary,and equity.this equity included the following 
restricted 
you will receive a restricted stock grant pursuant to vertex stock and option plan.one quarter of the restricted shares will vest on each anniversary of your employment start date for as long as you remain employed by vertex.any shares that have not vested at the end of your employment will be forfeited.
in addition to your restricted stock grant,you will be granted a stock option pursuant to vertex stock and option plan the common stock subject to your stock option will vest in quarterly installments over four years.
the specific terms and conditions of the equity grants will be set forth in grant agreements,which,among other things,will incorporate the terms and conditions of vertex stock and option plan.
the stock and option plan incorporated by reference into this portion of the agreement provided in pertinent part 
except as otherwise provided in the applicable stock agreement,if a participant ceases to be an employee with the company before the participant has exercised all stock rights,the participant may exercise any stock right granted to him or her to the extent that the stock right is exercisable on the date of such termination of service.any such stock right must be exercised within three months after the date of the participant termination of service 
in addition,the agreement stipulated that the plaintiff would be allowed to participate in the defendant performance bonus program.the agreement cited that participants in this program were eligible to receive cash bonuses at the end of each calendar year.awards were pegged to of an employee base salary,modified by a factor in the range of.the factor depended on the performance of both the employee and the company.in the end,however,bonus awards were at the discretion of the company board of directors.the agreement did not circumscribe this discretion in any way.
the plaintiff worked under the agreement for some sixteen months,beginning on july.during this interval,he received glittering performance reviews and the defendant experienced exceptional growth some of which was tied to the marketing of the new drug.
despite this auspicious beginning,the relationship did not last.on december,the plaintiff was told that,as part of a reorganization,his position would be eliminated and his employment terminated.the defendant assured the plaintiff that this decision was unrelated to any shortfall in his job performance.the denouement came swiftly the plaintiff last day of work was december.
at the time of the plaintiff departure,some of his stock options had vested.the defendant afforded him the opportunity to exercise those options.asserting that he was entitled to more,the plaintiff sought to receive his unvested stock options.he also asked for a prorated bonus for calendar year.the defendant rejected both of these requests.
invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,the plaintiff brought suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.he sought through the suit to obtain damages to compensate him for the loss of the unvested stock options and the denial of a prorated bonus.his complaint propounded claims for negligent and intentional misrepresentation,promissory estoppel,breach of contract,and breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the defendant moved to dismiss all of the plaintiff claims.
on june,the district court granted the defendant motion.the court,ruling from the bench,concluded that nothing in the agreement entitled the plaintiff to either the unvested stock options or a prorated bonus.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court disposition of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.see centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir.in conducting that review,we accept as true all facts set forth in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader favor.tambone,at.
with certain exceptions not relevant here,a complaint only needs to contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.although there is no need for detailed factual allegations,bell atl.twombly,the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting twombly,at.accordingly,a complaint must include more than a rote recital of the elements of a cause of action it must include factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.if the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager,vague,or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture,the complaint is open to dismissal.tambone,at citing twombly,at.
pleading standards are one thing substantive law is another.in a diversity case,pleading standards are a matter of federal law.see hanna plumer,alt.concepts,synopsys,cir.substantive law has a different source a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the substantive law of the forum state.erie tompkins.this includes application of the state conflict of law principles,klaxon stentor,so the choice of state law is not always mechanical.
for present purposes,we may eschew a choice of law analysis.in determining which state law applies,a diversity court is free to honor the parties reasonable agreement.see borden paul revere life ins,cir.in this case,both parties have acknowledged that massachusetts law controls.we accept that plausible premise.
with this backdrop in place,we turn to the task at hand.this appeal,as framed by the plaintiff,boils down to two sets of claims.first,he contends that the defendant refusal to afford him the benefit of the unvested stock options and to pay him a prorated bonus worked a breach of the agreement.second,he contends that these same failures breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.we address these sets of claims separately.
