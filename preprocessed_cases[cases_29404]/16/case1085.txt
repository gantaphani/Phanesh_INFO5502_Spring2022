opinion of the court 
norfolk southern railway norfolk southern and its customer basell usa basell agree that basell breached a contract that existed between them.they disagree,however,as to whether the breach was material and whether it constituted a of which would have entitled norfolk southern to terminate the contract.on judgment motions,the district court held that norfolk southern did not have the right to terminate the contract,explicitly concluding that the breach was not material and implicitly ruling that there had been no repudiation.norfolk southern now appeals both of these aspects of the district court order.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we will vacate the district court summary judgment order in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural history 
basell manufactures plastic pellets at a production facility in west lake charles,louisiana,and contracts with others,including norfolk southern,to transport those pellets to customers throughout the united states.there is no single rail carrier that can offer freight transport all the way from the west lake charles facility to destinations in the eastern united states.the bnsf railway company bnsf and the union pacific railroad union pacific both serve west lake charles,but do not serve destinations in the eastern united states.conversely,norfolk southern and csx transportation company csx both serve destinations in the eastern united states,but do not serve west lake charles.therefore,all rail deliveries to the eastern united states are by service,involving both an origin carrier and a destination bnsf or union pacific transports the pellets from the west lake charles facility to a rail interchange,where it hands off the railcars to either norfolk southern or csx for the second leg of the trip.
this traffic divides into three categories 
competitive rail direct both norfolk southern and csx are capable of transporting the pellets all the way from the rail interchange to the end customer by rail.
captive rail direct only norfolk southern or csx is capable of transporting the pellets all the way from the rail interchange to the end customer by rail.
truck terminal the end customer either must receive,or prefers to receive,the pellet delivery by truck instead of by rail either norfolk southern or csx transports the pellets from the rail interchange to a terminal,where it then transfers them to trucks for final delivery.
norfolk southern and basell entered into a contract in early under which norfolk southern promised to charge basell a rate below the published tariff rate in exchange for basell using norfolk southern for of certain deliveries originating in west lake charles from february through may according to basell,the minimum volume commitment was of the aggregate rail direct,captive rail direct,and truck norfolk southern was capable of making,excluding any truck deliveries where the end customer was more than miles from the nearest norfolk southern terminal.according to norfolk southern,the minimum volume commitment was of the aggregate competitive and captive rail direct deliveries that it was capable of making,and also of the truck deliveries where the end customer was less than miles from the nearest norfolk southern terminal 
basell fulfilled its minimum volume commitment in,and.however,it fell short in when it entered into a contract obligating it to use csx for shipments originating in west lake charles.basell expert calculated that in basell used norfolk southern to deliver of the traffic covered by their contract,instead of the promised.the shortfall consisted entirely of rail direct and not a single truck terminal delivery.
norfolk southern does not dispute the figure,but emphasizes that,in breaching the contract,basell provided it with only of the competitive rail direct traffic,and that this number is the proper focus for determining the magnitude of the breach.norfolk southern urges that it agreed to charge basell discounted rates across the for captive order to secure the competitive traffic originating in west lake charles,for which basell could have chosen to use either norfolk southern or csx.since basell would have received the captive traffic even without the contract,it maintains that the diverted competitive traffic is what is most relevant in evaluating the breach.
basell entered into a contract with csx beginning in february.it is undisputed that compliance with its contractual obligations to csx caused its failure to meet its minimum volume commitment to norfolk southern.although the details of basell contract with csx are not clearly set forth in the record before us the parties agree that basell promised to use csx as the destination carrier for of a pool of deliveries that overlapped somewhat with the pool of west lake charles deliveries covered by basell contract with norfolk southern.in order to fulfill its minimum volume commitment to csx,basell diverted to csx competitive rail direct traffic for which it was already contractually bound to use norfolk southern.
the procedural history of the case as it progressed in the district court is somewhat complex,with a variety of claims and counterclaims asserted along the way.originally,norfolk southern sued for a declaratory judgment that basell should have been paying the tariff rate for all transport services that norfolk southern had provided it since june,which included deliveries originating in west lake charles and three other basell facilities,and money damages for basell failure to pay the tariff rate.norfolk southern then amended its complaint to add a claim for breach of contract.basell filed counterclaims for a declaratory judgment in its favor,quantum meruit,unfair competition,and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relations.it appears from the record that it was not until roughly two months before the bench trial that norfolk southern learned of basell contract with csx,during the deposition of samuel slovak,a basell employee responsible for transportation procurement.less than one month before trial,in a stipulation filed with the district court,norfolk southern withdrew its original two counts and basell withdrew its quantum meruit counterclaim.less than one week before trial,norfolk southern notified the court and basell for the first time of two key changes in its litigation strategy first,it was no longer pursuing any claim related to facilities other than west lake charles and,second,it was now asserting that basell breach of the parties west lake charles contract was material and that,therefore,norfolk southern could treat that contract as terminated.however,with the parties in agreement that there was a west lake charles contract and that basell had breached it,the district court did not concern itself with the state of the pleadings and ordered judgment motions.
the issues before the district court on summary judgment centered on whether norfolk southern should be permitted to terminate the contract and,if not,whether the proper remedy for the breach was lost profits or liquidated damages.norfolk southern argued that contract termination was appropriate because basell materially breached repudiated its contract with norfolk southern by entering into the february contract with csx.this was the first time that norfolk southern raised the issue of repudiation 
the district court concluded that basell breach was not material and that,therefore,norfolk southern could not terminate its contract with basell it did not address norfolk southern repudiation argument.however,the court determined that there was an immaterial breach and that the appropriate remedy was measured by lost profits.it awarded norfolk southern for lost profits incurred through june,which was the estimate of lost profits that basell had submitted to the court as part of its motion for summary judgment norfolk southern estimate had been.the court found the estimates to be strikingly similar and chose the higher of the two,without explanation.norfolk ry.basell usa,wl,at.july,the court also ordered that basell would be liable for any additional lost profits incurred by norfolk southern during the remaining eleven months of the contract as a result of any ongoing breach of the minimum volume commitment.
norfolk southern continues to seek a ruling that it is entitled to terminate the contract because basell breach was material,or,alternatively,because basell conduct amounted to a repudiation.norfolk southern urges that under either scenario it would then be entitled to difference between the tariff rate and the discounted rate for all deliveries originating in west lake charles that it made for basell after basell entered into its conflicting contract with csx.

material breach

a the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected 
b the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived 
c the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture

whether the breach of a contract is material is generally an issue of fact.saienni g c capital group,wl,at.may,richard lord,williston on contracts ed.however,a s is true of virtually any factual question,if the materiality question in a given case admits of only one reasonable answer because the evidence on the point is either undisputed or sufficiently lopsided,then the court must intervene and address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.gibson city of cranston,cir accord saienni,wl,at williston on contracts,supra.thus,in certain situations,it can be appropriate to determine the issue of material breach at the summary judgment stage 
the district court correctly identified the restatement factors,but,we conclude,erred in concluding that no reasonable fact finder could find that basell breach of its volume commitment is a material breach.norfolk ry.basell usa,wl,at.july.it focused almost exclusively on the second factor,and failed to consider adequately whether and how each of the five factors could be viewed by a reasonable fact finder as supporting norfolk southern material breach argument.evaluating each factor and the record as a whole in the light most favorable to norfolk southern,we conclude that the district court erred in ruling on summary judgment that basell breach of the west lake charles contract was not material.
before applying the first restatement factor,which focuses on the deprivation of the benefit bargained for,it is helpful to consider how both the customer and the supplier benefit from a requirements contract like the one between basell and norfolk southern.the customer gets the assurance of a source of supply for a particular good or service,perhaps for a fixed price,without having to commit ahead of time to purchasing a fixed quantity of that good or service.joseph perillo helen hadjiyannakis bender,corbin on contracts ed.the supplier benefits,even though the actual amount of business that it will receive under the contract is uncertain,because it locks in a customer for a set percentage if not all of whatever quantity the customer ends up requiring.id.here,the percentage was of basell shipments.
regarding the first factor,the district court found that,a long with three years of full performance,the fact that basell shortfall is only underscores the limited extent to which norfolk southern has been deprived of the benefit it reasonably expected from the contract.norfolk ry,wl,at.however,norfolk southern argues that it bargained for nearly all the and that it would not have agreed to give basell a discounted rate,below the published tariff rate,if not for the minimum volume commitment.it reasonably expected in exchange for the guaranteed discounted delivery services and,it urges,quite simply,is not.moreover,norfolk southern contends,the figure is deceptive because the majority of that consists of captive rail direct traffic that basell had no choice but to provide to norfolk southern.it maintains that it discounted its rates for all of basell traffic,including the captive rail direct traffic,so as to capture the competitive traffic.according to norfolk southern,it reasonably expected that the agreement for of all traffic meant that it would receive the vast majority of the competitive rail direct traffic originating from the west lake charles facility,whereas,due to basell breach,it only received of it.further,while basell had fully performed for three years before its breach,over two years remained on the contract once the shortfall began basell made no indication that it would again fulfill its minimum volume commitment.a reasonable fact finder could credit these arguments and find that norfolk southern was substantially deprived of the benefit that it had reasonably expected when entering into the west lake charles contract,such that the first restatement factor suppo
