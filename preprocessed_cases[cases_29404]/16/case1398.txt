prime insurance company prime appeals the district court refusal to grant its motion for judgment as a matter of law,renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,and relief under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure following a jury verdict in jimmy myrick myrick favor for breach of contract and a bad faith cause of action under south carolina law.it also appeals jury consideration of the district court grant of sanctions,attorney fees,and prejudgment interest.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse in part the decisions of the district court and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.because we decide on the merits all necessary points raised,we do not address rules and.
in may,jimmy myrick and donald brandt planned to start a logging business with each other.entry into the logging business requires three pieces of equipment a fellerbuncher,a skidder,and a loader brandt already owned a skidder model franklin and a fellerbuncher model.myrick bought a loader hood model in june in anticipation of this venture.
greg matthews matthews,a local insurance agent for american interstate insurance company american interstate,helped set up general liability and workers compensation insurance for the new business,but american interstate did not write the required kind of property and casualty insurance matthews therefore contacted johnson insurance associates johnson insurance to place this coverage.johnson insurance,in turn,contacted mga insurance company,which issued the insurance effective june.soon after,myrick and brandt decided to abandon the venture,and they canceled this insurance without penalty.the three pieces of equipment insured were the franklin skidder,the hood loader,and the fellerbuncher.
myrick subsequently,later in the summer of,decided to enter business on his own,and he called his new business palmetto timber products.because he already owned a loader,he only needed to acquire a fellerbuncher and a skidder for his business.myrick bought a used model barko fellerbuncher on july,for and spent to repair the engine to place it in service.he also acquired a model timberjack skidder in august.myrick hired caroline harper rivers as palmetto secretary.he then called matthews to arrange insurance on his three pieces of equipment.
matthews again indicated he could not write the insurance he would have to refer the insurance request to johnson insurance.myrick told matthews the three pieces of equipment to insure and that his secretary,rivers,would give him the required serial numbers.matthews stated that he would provide the pertinent information to johnson insurance,including the serial numbers for the three pieces of equipment.conflicting stories emerged at trial regarding which serial numbers were relayed to matthews.rivers testified that she telephoned matthews the following serial numbers 
fellerbuncher 
matthews testified that rivers may have telephoned only the addition of a new skidder,and also that he was uncertain whether it was myrick who called him,or myrick secretary,rivers.
a fax dated june,from myrick to matthews was produced at trial.the document originally was sent by myrick to matthews regarding insurance for equipment of the abandoned joint venture.handwritten notations by matthews replace the skidder from the franklin model to the timberjack model.no notations regarding the loader and fellerbuncher were made.on september,matthews relayed myrick request for insurance and forwarded the fax with his notations to johnson insurance.
woodrow wilson power,power,a for johnson insurance,filled out an application for coverage from prime on a scheduled inland insurance policy with the information he received from matthews.the application for insurance scheduled the following items 
fellerbuncher 
this application listed brandt one brandt owned for purposes of the abandoned joint venture.myrick did not own this fellerbuncher.he never saw the completed application.neither party disputes that the effective date of the policy of insurance was september,for the listed equipment.
on september,myrick barko fellerbuncher was destroyed by fire prior to his receipt of any verification information regarding the insurance.myrick called matthews that day to tell him of the loss.
on september,prime learned of the loss,and myrick received a letter from johnson insurance requesting premium payments and attaching certificates of insurance.conflicting stories emerged regarding which certificates of insurance were included.myrick stated that certificates were included only for the loader and the skidder.waller,of johnson insurance,stated that her file indicated that three certificates had been sent out on september,one for a fellerbuncher.
on september,power called prime and indicated in a voice mail to rick lindsey,prime president,that the destroyed fellerbuncher was not the scheduled fellerbuncher prime then sent mitchell bazen bazen,an independent adjuster,to investigate the claim.bazen concluded that the fellerbuncher destroyed by the fire was not scheduled in the policy.
on september,myrick paid his premium.on september,lewis hansen hansen,claims manager for prime,wrote to myrick denying coverage for the barko fellerbuncher.hansen stated that an insurance contract existed between the parties but that the insurance policy listed a fellerbuncher instead of a barko fellerbuncher.
on october,myrick received an insurance certificate for a fellerbuncher,with brandt,a loss payee.myrick subsequently scheduled a fellerbuncher effective on october,and the premium increased 
after the denial of the claim,myrick complained to the south carolina department of insurance about prime failure to investigate the claim,explaining that he had no interest in the fellerbuncher listed in the policy.south carolina forwarded the letter to prime,and prime responded to the letter.south carolina subsequently wrote to myrick indicating that it was taking no further action.
on december,myrick filed a complaint in south carolina state court alleging breach of contract and bad faith.prime the action to the district court,answered the complaint,and filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment regarding its under the policy because the destroyed fellerbuncher was not scheduled on the policy.
during discovery,prime did not produce its complete underwriting and claims file to myrick.the request for the file was the subject of a motion to compel filed by myrick on april.prime produced a part of the files,but during a subsequent deposition,myrick discovered that a tape recording,and electronic information had not been produced.the tape had not yet been transcribed,and thus was not part of the file initially.additionally,the other information was housed on the of a computer,and prime stated that it inadvertently forgot to print the information out.before trial,and upon a motion for sanctions,the district court imposed sanctions and allowed myrick to question prime witnesses before the jury regarding the failure to disclose the documents immediately.
on july,prime moved for summary judgment because myrick barko fellerbuncher was not scheduled under the policy.prime motion was denied,and the matter was tried on february and.at the close of the plaintiff case,prime moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court denied the motion.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for breach of contract and awarded in damages.it also found in favor of the plaintiff on the cause of action for bad faith and awarded in punitive damages.
the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict,and prime moved for a new trial or judgment as a matter of law on february.on april,the district court denied the motion.the district court granted myrick unopposed motion for prejudgment interest and attorney fees.the district court calculated interest on the judgment from september,to february,at an interest rate of per year,a total of.the attorney fees and costs added an additional to the verdicts.
prime subsequently moved the district court for an order,pursuant to rules and to alter or amend the court april order.a hearing was held on may,and the court denied rule and motions.the court then entered a second amended judgment on may,which reaffirmed the jury verdict for actual and punitive damages,prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.prime timely appealed from this order.
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.see bank of montreal signet bank,cir.if a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion based on the evidence or if the verdict in favor of the party would necessarily be based upon speculation and conjecture,judgment as a matter of law must be entered.see crinkley holiday inns,cir.if the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference,a jury issue is created and a motion for judgment as a matter of law should be denied.see hofherr dart indus,cir.in making this determination,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see hofherr,at.
breach of contract 
we first address whether the district court erred in denying prime motion for judgment as a matter of law and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on myrick breach of contract claim.the only instructions given to the jury with respect to the breach of contract count and as to the agency relation of the various people connected with this claim were in the special verdict form and instructions appearing below,to which objection was not and is not made 
as to the claim for breach of contract,we,the jury,unanimously find 
for the defendant 
and as to the breach of contract claim and agency,the court instructed the jury 
i will now instruct you on the rules of law that apply in this case.plaintiff has two claims or causes of action.the first claim is for breach of contract.in order for the plaintiff to recover under a breach of contract theory the plaintiff must establish three essential elements by the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence.
one,that the parties entered into a binding insurance contract under which the defendant in return for the plaintiff timely payment of insurance premiums agreed to provide insurance for the plaintiff.two,that the defendant breached or unjustifiably failed to perform under the insurance contract.and three,that the plaintiff suffered damage as a direct and proximate result of the breach.
an insurance broker is primarily the agent of the person first employing him,and where the broker is employed to procure insurance,he is the agent of the insured.however,whether the broker represents the insured or the insurer depends upon the facts of each case.
the fact that a broker may receive a commission from the insurer for placing insurance does not change his character as agent of the insured when he is employed by the insured.moreover,a broker acting solely on behalf of the insured has no authority to bind the insurer.an insurance agent who is an agent of the insured can be converted into an agent of the insurer where there is evidence which creates an inference that the broker was acting at the instance or request of the insurer.
a party asserting agency as a basis of liability must prove the existence of the agency by the greater weight of the evidence,and the agency must be clearly established by the facts.the test to determine agency is whether the purported principal has the right to control the conduct of his alleged agent.
agency may not be established solely by declarations and conduct of the alleged agent,but such declarations and conduct are evidence which you may consider in connection with other evidence that may establish the alleged agency.agency may be proved by circumstantial evidence showing a course of dealing between the parties.
the authorized acts of an agent are by their nature the acts of the principal.by operation of law an agent exercise of authority is regarded as the execution of the principal continuing will.an agent conducting business with the authority of the principal binds the principal to the same extent as if the principal personally made the transaction.the principal would be directly liable to the third party on the transaction.in other words,the law considers that what a person does through his agent he has done himself.
a principal may be liable to third persons for fraud,deceit,concealment,misrepresentation,negligence and other malfeasance and omissions of duty of the agent acting within the scope of the agency although the principal did not authorize,participate in or know of such misconduct.
the relationship of agency need not depend upon express appointment by the alleged principal and acceptance by the purported agent.agency may be implied from the words and conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the particular case.
the facts of this case establish that myrick sought insurance for a fellerbuncher and that prime intended to insure a fellerbuncher owned by myrick.the facts further show that,during the relevant time period,myrick only had an interest in one,a barko model.in its answer and at trial,prime admitted that a policy for insurance existed between prime and myrick.there was also no dispute that this policy of insurance covered a loader,a skidder,and a fellerbuncher for myrick company.it was also undisputed that the fellerbuncher named in the policy was brandt model and not the barko model that myrick owned.because prime conceded that a policy for insurance existed between the parties,this case hinged on whether the erroneous of the fellerbuncher was material to the risk involved in this scheduled policy 
under south carolina law,an erroneous description of property in an application for property insurance may avoid coverage when the erroneous description is material to the risk.see hinson catawba ins,holding that premium rate less than what would have been charged if address had been correct was material to risk and barred formation of a contract because the minds of the parties did not meet.the question of materiality is for the jury to decide unless the record conclusively establishes that the misdescription materially affected the risk assumed by the insurer.see lanham blue cross blue shield.
prime argues that any misdescription in a scheduled policy bars coverage.we disagree.although we recognize that the policy stated,this policy covers the property described in the commercial inland marine schedule,prime has not offered south carolina authority holding that any erroneous description in a scheduled policy bars coverage.we decline to hold that the south carolina courts would so hold.
because south carolina has not held that any erroneous description bars coverage under a scheduled policy,we examine the evidence to determine whether the jury could have concluded that the erroneous description was not material.the jury heard evidence from roger day day,the vice president of prime.in response to a hypothetical question regarding whether an erroneously described fellerbuncher under a policy could still be covered,day testified,coverage could exist where an error has been made that was not material to the risk and the bargain as a hypothetical matter.power testified that the premium amounts in the policy were based on the value of the equipment.specifically,he stated that the insurance value is a rough indication of what the actual cash value on the property is.myrick testified that he paid for the used fellerbuncher and put into it approximately or in initial repairs to ready the machine for service.the policy provided coverage for up to total price myrick paid for the barko fellerbuncher.the jury could have reasonably concluded that prime did not have an increased risk because the insured amount was the actual cash value of the barko fellerbuncher.based on this information,it was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that a misdescription of the fellerbuncher in the policy did not make a material change in the policy.indeed,in denying the defendant motion because materiality had not been conclusively established,the district court correctly observed based on the evidence presented at trial,that the two fellerbunchers were comparable and there was no increase in risk by the addition or the substitution of the second fellerbuncher,and therefore there does not appear to be a material change in the policy.
because a jury looking at the evidence presented to it could conclude that the erroneous description of the fellerbuncher was not material to the risk of the insured in the policy,we affirm the district court denial of prime motion for judgment as a matter of law as well as its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.the judgment of the district court on the verdict of the jury awarding to myrick for prime breach of contract is accordingly affirmed.
in this connection,we should say that it is perfectly apparent from the statement of facts in part i of this opinion that somewhere along the line the fellerbuncher owned by brandt and previously insured by myrick and brandt through matthews and johnson insurance got placed in the schedule of the insurance policy involved in this case due to some mixup,the exact nature of which is not disclosed in this record.the jury had to believe that three pieces of equipment were included,as shown by the testimony of myrick and myrick secretary,otherwise there could have been no policy which admittedly existed.but whether the correct information was given by mathews to power,of johnson insurance,who filled out an application and gave it to prime insurance,the record does not disclose.a mistake was made somewhere,but where the record does not show.and no instructions on the law,other than those we have set forth above,were given to the jury or requested.thus,the matter was left entirely in the hands of the jury,so the only real and fundamental question is whether or not the evidence supports the verdict.we hold that it does.
we next address whether the district court erred in denying prime motion for a judgment as a matter of law and renewed judgment as a matter of law on myrick bad faith cause of action.we conclude that it did.
under south carolina law,an insured may assert against his insurance company a cause of action for the breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.see nichols state farm mut.auto.ins.this obligation includes a good faith duty to investigate the claim.see flynn nationwide mutual ins.the elements of an action for breach of the covenants of good faith and fair dealing in an insurance contract under south carolina law are the existence of a mutually binding contract of insurance between plaintiff and defendant a refusal by an insurer to pay benefits due under the contract resulting from the insurer bad faith or unreasonable action in breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract that causes damage to the insured.see steak house,generali ins,enumerating the elements of a claim for bad faith refusal to pay benefits under an insurance contract.if the insured proves the insurer conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of his rights under the contract,the insured also may recover punitive damages,but if there is a reasonable ground for contesting a claim,there is no bad faith.see crossley state farm automobile ins.
prime has admitted that there was an insurance contract in effect in this case and prime did refuse to pay under it.the question we address here is whether under south carolina law,there was cause to send the issue of prime bad faith to the jury.the supreme court of south carolina has held that i f there is a reasonable ground for contesting a claim,there is no bad faith.crossley,at.we are of opinion and hold that existence of the scheduled policy in which the destroyed fellerbuncher was not listed provided a reasonable ground to prime to deny the claim.therefore,we should reverse the district court refusal to grant judgment as a matter of law on this claim unless prime violated a duty to investigate this claim.see flynn,at.
evidence produced at trial established that the fellerbuncher listed in the policy was not the fellerbuncher that burned.on september,power left a phone message to prime indicating that the fellerbuncher that burned was not the item listed in the policy.bonnie clark,the claims coordinator for prime,then sent a letter to bazen,an independent adjuster,requesting him to investigate and to verify the year,model,make,and serial number of the destroyed equipment.at trial,power testified that the report of bazen concluded that the fellerbuncher named in the policy was not,in fact,the barko model fellerbuncher that was destroyed by fire.a letter introduced at trial that was sent by hansen,prime claims manager,to myrick denied coverage on this ground.specifically,the letter stated 
the schedule of the insurance policy listed a hydro ax fellersbuncher sic with a serial number of.the damaged machine that you have reported was a fellersbuncher sic which is a different machine entirely than the one that you have insured because it was a different year model barko sic and had a different serial number of this lead s us to the logical conclusion that prime insurance syndicate should deny coverage to this case based upon the facts we are aware of at the present time.
prime adequately investigated the claim and closed its investigation upon receipt of bazen report.this was an adequate investigation under the circumstances.although a jury ultimately found prime liable on the policy because of the erroneous description,we can not hold that its actions in investigating the claim were done in bad faith.the same remarks we made above with respect to who caused the mistaken description in the policy and why it was caused apply here.even after a trial when all of the people involved testified,the record is uncertain as to exactly what happened.the district court made no finding to that effect,and neither do we.on this record the insurance company should not be held to have more or different information than that disclosed at trial,which does not support a finding of bad faith.accordingly,the judgment of the district court entering judgment for the plaintiff on the special verdict claim for bad faith is reversed.
for the same reasons,we also conclude that prime conduct was not willful or in reckless disregard of myrick rights under the contract.accordingly,we remand the case to the district court with instructions to vacate the jury award of in punitive damages.
we discuss briefly the other points raised in this appeal.
the district court awarded in interest.in south carolina such an award of interest is a proper element of damage in the discretion of the trial court.jacobs american mut.fire ins.we are of opinion and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in this award.
the district court awarded attorney fees and costs in the amount of to the plaintiff.such an award is by virtue of ann.supp.this code section provides that such an award of attorney fees be made upon a refusal by an insurance company to pay within days without reasonable cause or in bad faith.because we have vacated the judgment for bad faith,and are of opinion that the fact that the fellerbuncher burned was not the same fellerbuncher appearing in the policy was a reasonable cause to deny payment,the award of attorney fees is vacated.
the only objection to the introduction of evidence preserved on appeal was that the district court permitted the jury to consider its decision holding prime guilty of failing to comply with discovery rules.while this is a question of relevance,prime takes exception because it claims that such was not relevant to prime decision to deny coverage,and complains of permitted argument that such was evidence of bad faith.br.while such evidentiary rulings as to relevance are within the discretion of the district court,and this was discretion on top of discretion in awarding sanctions,we express no opinion on the question raised here because,even if erroneous,any error was harmless because we have decided prime decision to deny coverage was not made in bad faith and was reasonable.so the objection is dismissed as moot.
the dissent is based largely,even if not wholly,on its definitely implied,although not openly advocated,disagr
