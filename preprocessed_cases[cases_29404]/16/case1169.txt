factual background and procedural history 
acorn technology fund,was formed in new jersey in as a small business investment company sbic under section c of the small business investment act sbia of,c,which is administered by the sba.acorn general partner was acorn technology partners,a new jersey company run by john torkelsen.in early,torkelsen convinced the barracks to invest in acorn beginning with a subscription agreement subscription executed on april.as part of the solicitation,on march,torkelsen sent a letter to the barracks indicating that he was willing to do two things to make it easier for you to subscribe allow them to pay only upon signing a subscription agreement,followed by annually over the next three years and waive any penalties which would be imposed by the sba if the barracks failed to fully pay the balance on their subscription agreement.the barracks returned a signed subscription agreement on april,along with a check for and a letter reciting that you acorn partners have agreed that if i choose to discontinue investing i will maintain my existing position without penalty.the barracks also signed a limited partnership agreement,section of which permitted the general partner,with the consent of the sba,to reduce a defaulting limited partner partnership share to the amount of capital actually contributed.
the barracks timely paid the first two installments of subscription,bringing their paid capital investment to.on september,they signed a second subscription agreement subscription and promised an additional.in,though,the barracks decided to exercise their granted in the waiver discontinue investing without penalty,and froze their total investment at.
in a matter initially unrelated to the barracks,the united states brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on january,against torkelsen,his wife and son,and his business associate,under the mail fraud injunction act,et.united states torkelson et.the suit alleges that the torkelsens used acorn to obtain million in federal funds from the sba,then invested the money in companies they controlled and ultimately diverted it into their own accounts.on january,the united states filed the instant suit to have acorn placed in receivership based on violations of the sbia.the district court appointed the sba receiver on january,as authorized by.as part of the receivership order,the district court imposed a stay on all civil litigation involving acorn,the receiver,or any of acorn past or present officers,directors,managers,agents or general or limited partners,unless specifically permitted by the court.order for operating receivership,united states acorn technology fund,receivership order.

iii.analysis 
in this circuit we have not yet addressed the standard for a district court to use when considering whether to lift a receivership stay of litigation.both parties have urged this court to adopt the standard laid out by the ninth circuit in sec wencke,cir wencke i,and sec wencke,cir wencke ii collectively,wencke.for the reasons set forth below,we accept this invitation.
wencke standard 
in a trilogy of cases in the early,the ninth circuit laid out factors a district court should consider when deciding whether to partially or wholly lift a stay of litigation entered pursuant to a receivership order.the court in wencke i affirmed the inherent power of a district court to enter a valid stay of litigation effective even against nonparties to the receivership action.at the court then addressed,somewhat abstractly,the relevant issues presented when deciding whether to exempt a party from the litigation bar.id.at.the wencke ii court,faced with an appeal of the district court refusal to lift the same stay of litigation,set forth a test to be used by a district court 
w hether refusing to lift the stay genuinely preserves the status quo or whether the moving party will suffer substantial injury if not permitted to proceed the time in the course of the receivership at which the motion for relief from the stay is made and the merit of the moving party underlying claim.
wencke ii,at.
in reviewing a district court refusal to lift a different receivership stay of litigation,the ninth circuit reaffirmed the three wencke factors and clarified that they differ from the normal criteria used by courts for preliminary injunctions.sec universal,cir.the test simply requires the district court to balance the interests of the receiver and the moving party t he interests of the receiver are very broad and include not only protection of the receivership res,but also protection of defrauded investors and considerations of judicial economy.id.
we agree.given how rare receiverships are,it is not surprising that we have not yet faced this exact issue or that few courts around the country have done so.the purposes of a receivership are varied,but the purpose of imposing a stay of litigation is clear.a receiver must be given a chance to do the important job of marshaling and untangling a company assets without being forced into court by every investor or claimant.nevertheless,an appropriate escape valve,which allows potential litigants to petition the court for permission to sue,is necessary so that litigants are not denied a day in court during a lengthy stay.
a district court should give appropriately substantial weight to the receiver need to proceed unhindered by litigation,and the very real danger of litigation expenses diminishing the receivership estate.at the same time,we agree with the wencke courts that the interests of litigants also need to be considered.far into a receivership,if a litigant demonstrates that harm will result from not being able to pursue a colorably meritorious claim,we do not see why a receiver should continue to be protected from suit.wencke ii,at reversing the district court refusal to lift the stay,seven years into the receivership when the receiver was about to distribute assets and thereby disturb the status quo of the estate.on the other hand,very early in a receivership even the most meritorious claims might fail to justify lifting a stay given the possible disruption of the receiver duties.
we note that when it is asked to lift a stay it would usually be improper for a district court to attempt to actually judge the merits of the moving party claims at such an early point in the proceedings.a district court need only determine whether the party has colorable claims to assert which justify lifting the receivership stay.see wencke ii,at.if it appears that a claim has no merit on its face,that of course may end the matter.but,if a claim may have factual development may be necessary to assess district court will have to address the other wencke factors.
the experiences of other courts dealing with the wencke standard are instructive.to the best of our knowledge,district courts in three other circuits besides the ninth,when considering whether to lift a receivership stay of litigation,have adopted or used the wencke standard to guide their inquiry.a maryland district court partially lifted a stay to allow a foreclosure action against property on which the receivership estate also had a judgment lien.united states esic capital.the district court admitted that the receivership was only two years old,but concluded that the merits of the asserted claim were substantial,and that the movant would suffer substantial injury if the claim were not allowed to proceed.id.at.the district court noted that a simple foreclosure action would be painless for all concerned.id.at.a new york district court stated that it would have compare d the interest of the receiver and the moving party,but found it unnecessary where the receiver did not object to the partial lifting of a stay.united states first wall sbic,june,dist.lexis,at quoting esic capital.at,which cited universal financial for the wencke premise.
most recently,a district court in illinois refused to lift a stay of litigation where the receivership had only been in place for three months,the estate finances were complex,and the movants could not show that they would suffer substantial injury absent permission to sue.ftc bancorp,wl,dist.lexis.the bancorp court relied solely on the first and second wencke factors,while appearing to assume that the claim might have merit.id.at see also ftc med resorts int l,finding that the first and second wencke factors,which tipped in the direction of maintaining the receivership stay,outweighed the admittedly strong merits of the asserted claim.ninth circuit courts also have continued to use the standard.see,sec capital consultants,llc,wl,dist.lexis sec tlc invs.trade,d sec am.capital,cir.lexis npo.
after consideration of the wencke factors and their application by courts which have subsequently followed the standard,we are of the view that the wencke test strikes an appropriate balance between allowing a litigant to choose the timing of his day in court,and respecting the purposes of a receivership stay.accordingly,we adopt the wencke standard for use in determining whether to lift a receivership stay.in the future we will review a district court decision on whether to lift the receivership stay for abuse of discretion,just like any other choice of procedures chosen by a district court to effectuate a receivership proceeding.see black,at am,at accord wencke ii,at in reviewing the district court application of this test and ultimate decision,we apply an abuse of discretion standard.
since the district court did not use wencke despite the urging of the parties,we must decide whether to remand this case.we agree with the ninth circuit that w here the claim is unlikely to succeed and the receiver therefore likely to prevail,there may be less reason to require the receiver to defend the action now rather than defer its resolution.wencke i,at.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that the barracks claims against the sba must fail as a matter of law,and that their mismanagement claims can only be brought derivatively and therefore also fail as a matter of law.as a result we have no need to send these claims back to the district court for consideration under wencke,and we will affirm the district court refusal to lift the stay as to these claims for that reason.as described below,although the district court erred in concluding that the barracks fraud in the inducement claim was derivative,the record is sufficiently developed to allow this court to apply the wencke standard to that claim.
claims against the sba 
the barracks would like to assert two classes of claims against the sba first,against the sba as a preferred limited partner of acorn for breach of fiduciary duties allegedly owed to the barracks as partners and second,against the sba for breach of its statutory and regulatory duties as regulator of acorn,an sbic.motion of leonard lynne barrack for partial lifting of receivership stay injunction,united states acorn tech.fund.the district court concluded that the receivership stay should not be lifted to allow the assertion of these claims because they were without merit as a matter of law.order denying motion to modify stay at,united states acorn tech.fund,district court order.we agree,and will affirm the district court as to any claims against the sba.
the federal tort claims act,b,et,is the exclusive method for suing an administrative agency in tort for monetary damages.the discretionary function exception bars 
any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation,whether or not such statute or regulation be valid,or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.
a emphases added.
the barracks claims against the sba for breaching statutory and regulatory duties obviously fall within the discretionary function exception and can not be maintained.the barracks argue that their other claims against the sba were not based on the sba actions as regulator,but on the sba actions as a preferred limited partner of and investor in acorn.the sba supposedly learned that the torkelsens were looting and otherwise mismanaging acorn,but failed to tell the other investors,thereby depriving them of this superior information and the opportunity to stop investing.the sba also,according to the barracks,erred by not imposing sanctions after these misdeeds were discovered.these actions allegedly breached a fiduciary duty owed by the sba to partners therefore,the barracks claim,the suit is not barred by the discretionary function exception.unfortunately,the barracks have shown no support for this distinction,nor can we find any.
the sba provides leverage to a limited partnership sbic in part by buying participating securities and becoming a preferred limited partner.the sba does gain payment priority over other limited partners,as the barracks stress.g.all sbics are also required to supply information to the sba,and the sba must examine each sbic every two years.b c the sba inevitably,therefore,has superior information to the other investors in an sbic.this informational advantage is solely the result of the sba position as regulator,however,as is the sba mere presence as a preferred limited partner.the barracks acknowledge this fact,but still assert that suit against the should stand.appellant br.at.the barracks produce no precedent or support for this position beyond bare assertions.any suit based on this superior information is fundamentally based on the as investor.even if a preferred limited partner owed a fiduciary duty to other limited partners,the barracks suit against the sba can not be characterized as against another acts challenged here were taken by the sba pursuant to its regulatory duties.
we next address whether the sba actions here involved discretion,or merely ministerial acts unprotected by the discretionary function exception.the district court concluded that all of the sba acts in question involved decision s committed to the sound d
