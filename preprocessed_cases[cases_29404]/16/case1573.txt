precious flowers limited precious flowers,or the vessel owner owned a vessel,the nalinee naree,and time chartered the vessel to ibn agrotrading gmbh ibn.the time charter included a london arbitration clause.the rice or the shipper bought rice to ship to togo.it voyage chartered the vessel from ibn to ship the rice,but the vessel allegedly had unseaworthy hatch covers and the rice was damaged.the voyage charter required arbitration in new york,and the bill of that would have issued,had the vessel not sailed early and the cargo not been damaged due to a storm,incorporated the terms of the voyage charter.precious flowers insurance company issued a letter of undertaking to the rice company,claiming jurisdiction in district court in houston.the rice company brought suit in district court against precious flowers,ibn,and the vessel,seeking damages and making a motion to compel arbitration in new york and to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.the district court denied the motion and did not decide the liability issues.the rice company appealed.
precious flowers,a philippine company,was the record owner of the vessel the nalinee naree.it time chartered the vessel to the disponent owner ibn,a german company.ibn then voyage the vessel to the rice company.the rice company bought rice that it planned to ship from lake charles,louisiana to togo.it loaded approximately metric tons of its rice onto the vessel but had to leave port early because of the impending hurricane rita.it was forced to dock in houston,and it later discovered that seawater had pierced the hold,allegedly due to unseaworthy hatch covers,and had damaged the rice.precious flowers gave the rice company a letter of undertaking from its protection and indemnity club,stating that jurisdiction of the suit would be in houston.the rice company filed suit in district court under rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure permitting designation of a pleading as an admiralty or maritime claim,providing original admiralty or maritime jurisdiction in district court,and of the federal arbitration act,providing district courts with jurisdiction to direct arbitration for complaints brought for libel and seizure of a vessel.it listed the vessel,ibn,and precious flowers as defendants,alleging that it had sustained damages of.in a separate motion,the rice company moved to compel arbitration in new york and stay the proceedings pending arbitration.
precious flowers filed a claim of owner in its in rem capacity arguing,inter alia,improper venue,lack of in personam jurisdiction,and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.it restricted its appearance to an in rem defense under rule e of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims,reserving all other defenses.it also pled defenses under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa in its answer to the rice company original complaint.the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration.
whether arbitration ought to be compelled turns on three contracts.first,there is a voyage charter of september,between ibn,the time of the vessel,and the rice company,the charterers.the terms of this voyage charter are incorporated into a second bill of lading or cargo contract.finally,there is the september,time charter,a contract between ibn,the disponent owner,and precious flowers,the record owner of the vessel,for one from lake charles to togo,duration about days.
the time charter between precious flowers and contains a rider clause b,a broad arbitration clause requiring that all disputes arising out of this contract shall be arbitrated in london.the parties rejected rider clause a,a new york arbitration clause,by striking out each line of the clause and providing for london arbitration in clause b.the time charter also allows the charterers of the vessel ibn to act on behalf of precious flowers,providing,
bills of lading 
a the master shall sign the bills of lading for cargo as presented in conformity with mates receipts.however,the charterers ibn may sign bills of lading on behalf of the master,with the owner prior written authority,always in conformity with mates receipts,without prejudice to this charterparty.
see also clause 
b all bills of lading shall be without prejudice to this charter party and the charterers shall indemnify the owners against all consequences or liabilities which may arise from any inconsistency between this charter party and any bills of lading signed by the charterers or by the master at their request.
bills of lading 
charterers their agents are hereby authorized by owners to sign on master owner behalf bills of lading as presented in conformity with mate receipts records without prejudice to this.
in case the original of lading are not available upon vessel arrival at discharging port for any reason,the master is to release the entire cargo to the charterers order against presentation by charterers or their agents of a single letter of indemnity with wording as per owners standard p i club form,signed by charterers only.
the voyage charter between ibn and the rice company is a contract.the parties struck out the term owners when that term first appears and replaced owners with ibn agrotrading gmbh hamburg as.the charter describes the rice company roseville california as the charterers.throughout the rest of the voyage charter the parties use the term owners and charterers.precious flowers is not a party to the voyage charter.the voyage charter,like the time charter,contains an arbitration clause but requires arbitration in new york rather than london,providing,
that should any dispute arise between owners and charterers,the matter shall be referred to three persons at new york,one to be appointed by each of the parties hereto,and the third by the two so chosen,their decision or that of any two of them shall be final,and for the purpose of enforcing any award,this agreement may be made a rule of the court.the arbitrators shall be commercial men.the arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the society of maritime arbitrators,of new york.
the third contract,a congen form bill of lading,provides,all terms and conditions,liberties and exceptions of the charter party,dated as overleaf,including the law and arbitration clause,are herewith incorporated.
the rice company as the shipper claims that because precious flowers,the vessel owner,permitted ibn in its time charter to execute bills of lading on the owner behalf pursuant to the time charter,and because ibn would have executed the bill of lading for the rice voyage,the owner is contractually bound to the bill of lading and the voyage charter incorporated into the bill of lading requiring new york arbitration.precious flowers argues that ibn can not prove that ibn would have signed the bill of lading on behalf of precious flowers and that even if ibn signed for precious flowers,the new york arbitration clause does not apply to precious flowers.the time charter between ibn and precious flowers only permits ibn to sign bills of lading on behalf of precious flowers without prejudice to precious flowers.furthermore,precious flowers is not a party to the voyage charter requiring new york arbitration,it argues,and it never agreed to arbitration.precious flowers argues,
there was no evidence presented that precious flowers ever intended,agreed,or consented to any party having authority to bind it to new york arbitration in contravention of the broad london arbitration clause in the time charter.
the shipper,in addition to arguing that the bill of lading binds the vessel owner to arbitration,provides two other lines of argument for compelling new york arbitration.first,it alleges that the term owner in the voyage charter containing the new york arbitration clause is ambiguous,and that the term could be construed to include precious flowers.second,it argues that because the disponent owners of the vessel ibn signed the voyage charter with the new york arbitration clause,any in rem disputes involving the vessel must also be arbitrated.in other words,it argues that the voyage charter compels the vessel to arbitrate and also requires the representative of the vessel to arbitrate.it would be impractical and senseless,urges the rice company,to require arbitration and allow a separate in rem proceeding in district court in that once arbitrated,the award can not be challenged in district court.along these same lines,it argues that because precious flowers filed a claim on behalf of its vessel after the rice was damaged and would potentially benefit from the bill of lading,it is estopped from arguing that the bill arbitration clause does not apply.
the district court concluded that the new york arbitration clause of the voyage charter does not bind the vessel owner but rather its disponent owner ibn,and that there is no contract binding precious flowers to new york arbitration.nor does the in rem fiction of the vessel as defendant bind the vessel owner,the court held the vessel can not be construed as an owner or charterer against whom the new york arbitration clause may be enforced.the rice company appealed.we will affirm.
reviewing de novo the district court refusal to compel arbitration,we first address the voyage charter terms and the shipper claim that the voyage charter is ambiguous and includes precious flowers.when interpreting the terms of the charter party,
we must construe a charter according to the intent of the parties as manifested by the whole instrument rather than by the literal meaning of any particular clause taken by itself.
a ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.in determining whether ambiguity exists,we view the disputed term in the context of the entire charter party.in so doing,we find no ambiguity.
as we have observed,the parties,in the second line of the voyage charter,struck out the term owners and inserted the term ibn agrotrading gmbh hamburg as.the remainder of the text refers to owners.the only mention of the ship owners is in clause,war risk,providing,for the purpose of this clause,the words a owners shall include the ship owners,bare board charterers,disponent owners,manager or other operators who are charged with the management of the vessel,and the master 
we think it clear from line,where the parties replaced owner with ibn agrotrading gmbh hamburg as,and the use of the term owner throughout the rest of the contract that owner is the ibn,and not precious flowers.ship owners are specifically referenced in only one clause,and precious flowers did not sign the contract.we are persuaded that the parties to these instruments unambiguously structured their relationship such that the vessel owner was not a party to the voyage charter containing the new york arbitration clause 
we now turn to the rice company claim that because precious flowers permitted ibn to sign bills of lading on behalf of the master,the bill of lading that would have issued would have been signed by ibn as an agent of precious flowers and would have bound precious flowers to new york arbitration.the rice company,as part of this claim,argues that in interpreting the language of the arbitration clause incorporated into the bill of lading,we should not consider whether the language of the arbitration clause is broad or narrow,as that is allegedly an outdated analysis.
t he question of arbitrability is to be decided by the court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties.both the bill of lading and the voyage charter are contracts the voyage charter signed by ibn and the rice company contains a new york arbitration clause,and the bill of lading that would have issued incorporates the arbitration clause.the parties do not dispute that the bill of lading incorporated the clause,but precious flowers argues that the rice company has presented no evidence showing that ibn would have signed on behalf of the master and would have made precious flowers a party to the bill of lading.ibn could have signed for itself,as disponent owner.and even if there were proof that ibn would have signed as precious flowers agent rather than signing for itself,the time charter permits ibn to sign on behalf of the master only without prejudice to precious flowers.
even assuming that the bill of lading would have been issued by ibn on behalf of precious flowers,for which there is no evidence in this case we are not persuaded that precious flowers would have been bound by the new york arbitration clause incorporated into the bill of lading,given the terms of the new york arbitration clause.
the new york arbitration clause is not broad,as it provides t hat should any dispute arise between owners and charterers,the matter shall be referred to three persons at new york.contrary to the rice company claim,we do recognize the distinction between a broad and narrow arbitration clause.in sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican national oil pemex,we held that an arbitration agreement providing,any dispute or difference between the parties arising out of this charter shall,at the request of either party,be referred to three arbitrators was of the broad type and that arbitration should apply we followed the second circuit holding that 
s imply stated,a court should compel arbitration,and permit the arbitrator to decide whether the dispute falls within the clause,if the clause is broad.in contrast,if the clause is narrow,arbitration should not be compelled unless the court determines that the dispute falls within the clause.specific words or phrases alone may not be determinative although words of limitations would indicate a narrower clause.the tone of the clause as a whole must be considered.
even where an arbitration provision is broad,requiring arbitration of a ny and all differences and disputes arising out of this charter,we have declined to reverse a district court order to stay arbitration,holding that where a complaint is not the result of a difference or dispute arising out of the charter,the parties can not be compelled to arbitrate 
the new york arbitration clause in the voyage charter applies only to disputes between owners and charterers and as we have discussed,the term owners in the voyage charter refers to ibn as the disponent owner,not to precious flowers as the vessel owner.arbitration agreements apply to nonsignatories only in rare circumstances.where some written agreement to arbitrate exists,federal courts have recognized s ix theories for binding a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement a incorporation by reference b assumption c agency d ego e estoppel and f beneficiary.the rice company argument,generously construed,urges three of these theories.by alleging that precious flowers bound itself to the charter party by allowing ibn to sign the bill of lading incorporating the voyage charter terms on its behalf,the rice company alleges a combination of incorporation by reference and agency.as we will explain,it also alleges that because the vessel benefits from any defenses contained in the bill of lading,precious flowers is estopped from arguing that it is not subject to the arbitration clause incorporated into the bill of lading.
bills of lading commonly incorporate charters and bind the signatories to the charter terms we have found arbitration clauses to be binding even where the terms of incorporation were not entirely clear,but that was when there was no chance that the parties were confused as to whether arbitration would apply in matters maritime the question of whether nonsignatories may be bound by an arbitration clause incorporated into a bill of lading is seldom reached.
outside of the maritime context,we have consistently held that where parties have not signed an arbitration agreement,they can not be compelled to arbitrate.who is actually bound by an arbitration agreement is a function of the intent of the parties,as expressed in the terms of the agreement.in del webb construction richardson hospital authority,a hospital authority contracted with an architect to supervise a construction project.the contract provided for arbitration the authority signed two other contracts with the construction contractor,and these contracts also contained arbitration clauses we held that the architect could not be compelled to participate in arbitration between the hospital authority and the construction contractor because the architect and construction contractor had not agreed to arbitrate disputes between them.in bridas,an argentinian energy corporation made an agreement with a turkemenian production association,which represented the government of turkmenistan,to produce hydrocarbon we held that an arbitral tribunal did not properly exercise jurisdiction over the government of turkmenistan where the government was not a signatory to the contract containing the arbitration clause 
at the same time,the core principle that the faa does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so is not offended by principles of agency familiar to the law of contracts.directly put,where an agent signs a contract requiring arbitration,the principal is bound by the arbitration requirement that said,the distinction between a general grant of authority to sign on behalf of the master and a grant that is conditioned by a requirement that the agent sign the bill of lading without prejudice to the charter party is.where a charter party contains fixture language similar to the language here,providing that charterers shall indemnify owners from all consequences arising out of master or agents signing bills of lading in accordance with charterers instructions,the fourth circuit has held that the charterer assumes exclusive responsibility for issuance of bills of lading.precious flowers and ibn time charter provided that ibn could sign bills of lading without prejudice to precious flowers and that charterers shall indemnify the owners against all consequences or liabilities which may arise from any inconsistency between this charter party and any bills of lading signed by the charterers or by the master at their request.
precious flowers expressly rejected a new york arbitration clause in its time charter with ibn and opted for a broad london arbitration clause,granting ibn the authority to sign on its behalf only without prejudice to precious flowers the voyage charter arbitration clause was not broad and applied only to any dispute aris ing between owners ibn,the disponent owners and charterers the rice company,and precious flowers limited the authority of agents in signing bills of lading.together,these circumstances persuade us that the bill of lading did not bind precious flowers the district court did not err in holding that the bill of lading does not bind precious flowers to the voyage charter mandatory arbitration clause.
finally,we turn to the rice company claim that if the bill of lading contains any arbitration clause,the in rem vessel and the in personam representative of the vessel must be compelled to arbitrate.the rice company similarly alleges that by filing a claim of owner for the vessel in its in rem capacity,precious flowers is estopped from arguing that it is not subject the arbitration clause the rice company reasons that m aritime law expressly forbids a party from issues in an in rem proceeding against a vessel if those issues were decided in a previous arbitration and that 
i mplicit in this prohibition is the requirement that the vessel claimant arbitrate a dispute that is in any way subject to arbitration.without this implicit requirement,a vessel claimant would be allowed to arbitrated issues in subsequent district court litigation.
adopting this reasoning would compel nonsignatory vessel owners to arbitrate and would violate the principle that d ue to its inherently contractual nature,arbitration may be ordered only for a dispute that the parties have agreed to arbitrate.the second circuit case cited by the rice company,thyssen,calypso shipping,holds that a party that was properly compelled to arbitrate in personam may not later bring an in rem claim in court to attempt to cure its in personam claim that failed in arbitration it does not hold that a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement may be compelled to arbitrate simply because that party brings an in rem claim for the vessel or because a bill of lading with an arbitration clause was issued for the vessel.
as precious flowers argues,the in rem proceeding exists so that the vessel itself can be held liable for a debt that creates a maritime lien.the ship is its own entity in the in rem proceeding and the owner bears no personal liability.this is so even where an agent has signed on behalf of the master of the vessel a lthough signature as agent of the vessel may confer in rem jurisdiction over the vessel once it sets sail with the cargo,it does not confer in personam jurisdiction over the owner.the sailing of the vessel ratifies the bill of lading but does not automatically confer jurisdiction over a vessel owner nor does a vessel owner claim of owner automatically subject the owner to in personam jurisdiction 
we have anticipated that arbitration of a portion of a dispute will lead to duplicated efforts and inefficiency if the dispute,once arbitrated,must then be resolved in court with nonsignatory parties but we have held that any inconvenience or duplication of effort is a consequence of having agreed to arbitrate.specifically,duplication of effort,redundant testimony,and the possibility of inconsistent findings are the risks that parties to an arbitration clause must be considered to have contemplated at the time they struck their bargain.the relevant federal law requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.this is so notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement,meaning that parties subject to arbitration will have to issues with 
although this result may be inconvenient to the rice company,we may not force precious flowers,as an in rem or in personam complainant or defendant,into an arbitration agreement that precious flowers did sign.it is the case that precious flowers,by bringing a claim of owner and arguing defenses under cogsa and the common law after the rice company filed a complaint with the federal district court in houston,did not avail itself of the benefits of the vessel bill of lading before litigation commenced the district court did not err in so finding and in holding that direct benefit estoppel did not apply.
the rice company suisse bought the rice,and its parent company,the rice company roseville,chartered the vessel.we refer to both as the rice company or the shipper.
a bill of lading is a document which is signed by the carrier or his agent acknowledging that goods have been shipped on board a specific vessel that is bound for a particular destination and stating the terms on which the goods are to be carried.hale container line,houston sea packing,cir quoting thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law at ed.
a charter party is a specialized form of contract for the hire of an entire ship,specified by name.a time charter provides for the charterer to obtain the vessel for a fixed period of time,and under a voyage charter,the charterer obtains the vessel for the length of a voyage.keytrade usa,ain temouchent,cir quoting thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,ed.the contract between ibn and the rice company refers to ibn as the owners,meaning that ibn time chartered the vessel from precious flowers and then voyage chartered the vessel to the rice company.the contract between ibn and the rice company is a voyage charter.the flowers contract is a time charter.
precious flowers limited,owners and gmbh hamburg,germany charterers signed the contract.
clause b provides,in part,london all disputes arising out of this contract shall be arbitrated at london and,unless the parties agree forthwith on a single arbitrator,be referred to the final arbitrament of two arbitrators carrying on business in london who shall be members of the baltic mercantile shipping exchange and engaged in shipping,one to be appointed by each of the parties,with power to such arbitrators to appoint an umpire.no award shall be questioned or invalidated on the ground that any of the arbitrators is not qualified as above,unless objection to his action be taken before t
