lansdowne on the potomac homeowners association sued openband,a group of interlocking entities that provides cable services to the lansdowne on the potomac real estate development the homeowners association alleged that openband entered into a series of contracts that conferred upon open band the exclusive right to provide video services to the development,in violation of an order of the federal communications commission prohibiting such exclusivity arrangements.the district court agreed,declaring the challenged provisions null and void and permanently enjoining their enforcement.because the contract provisions prohibit competing cable providers from accessing the lansdowne development in patent violation of the fcc order,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,congress enacted the cable television consumer protection and competition act cable act,stat.congress made several findings in passing the act,among them that most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems that this lack of competition had led to undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and that cable prices were rising almost three times faster than the rate of inflation.cable act a,stat.at.the act accordingly made it unlawful for a cable operator to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices,the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any other operator from providing services to consumers.b.the act also authorized the fcc to prescribe regulations to specify particular conduct that is prohibited by this provision.id.c.
pursuant to that authority,the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in march soliciting comments on the propriety of a practice popular among cable operators the use of exclusivity clauses that grant the operator exclusive access for providing video services within a particular multiple dwelling unit mdu.exclusive service contracts for provision of video services in multiple dwelling units and other real estate developments,fcc rcd.proposed.in response,the fcc received comments revealing that exclusivity clauses have the clear effect of barring new entry into mdus by video providers and that such clauses were widespread and increasing in their use.exclusive service contracts for provision of video services in multiple dwelling units and other real estate developments,fcc rcd,exclusivity order.commenters also highlighted the injuries that exclusivity clauses inflict upon consumers,such as increased prices,lower quality,and a reduced menu of cable channel options.see id.the fcc thus concluded that exclusivity clauses cause significant harm to competition and consumers and that the harms of such clauses outweigh their benefits.id.
based on this record,the fcc unanimously adopted the exclusivity order at issue in this case.the order sets forth the following rule n o cable operator shall enforce or execute any provision in a contract that grants it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service alone or in combination with other services to a mdu.any such exclusivity clause shall be null and void.exclusivity order codified at a.
in,a partnership of virginia land developers created the lansdowne community development lcd,a limited liability company with the purpose of developing a residential community known as lansdowne on the potomac in loudoun county,virginia.the lansdowne development comprises roughly acres of land,upon which some individual homes are built.although lansdowne residents own their own homes,all residents share an interest in common areas that require central management.lcd therefore created appellee,the lansdowne on the potomac homeowners association lhoa or the homeowners association,to provide for the management of the development and amenities such as video,phone,and internet services.
in the process of planning the development,lcd engaged dean,a virginia technical services contractor,to design and install telecommunications systems in the community.for its part,according to dean ceo,the company sought from lcd the exclusive right to provide telecommunication services to lansdowne.dean created a number of corporate entities and entered into a series of contemporaneous,interlocking contractual arrangements to achieve this end.
the structure of this whole enterprise was a convoluted one.with respect to the corporate entities,dean formed openband at lansdowne obl,a limited liability company with the purpose of developing and administering telecommunication services at lansdowne.obl had two members a wholly owned subsidiary of dean called openband spe obs,which dean created for the purpose of holding its interest in obl,and a subsidiary of lcd called lcd communications dean also formed openband multimedia,llc obm,which is an open video system operator that provides video and internet services to lansdowne and other virginia communities.lastly,dean formed openband of virginia obv,which provides phone service to virginia communities,including lansdowne.obl,obs,obm,obv,and m.dean are all defendants and appellants in this case collectively,openband 
with respect to the contractual arrangements,three are of particular relevance.first,lcd granted a deed of easement to obl on may,entitled the exclusive easement for telecommunications services at lansdowne on the potomac.lhoa is named as a party to the deed as the future owner of the property.lhoa ratified the easement acting through its who was also president of lcd,which controlled lhoa at the time by its express terms,the deed grants to obl exclusive easements for the purpose of constructing,operating,maintaining,adding to,altering,or replacing collectively administering or administer telecommunications infrastructure for the collection,provision,and distribution of video,telephonic,internet,data services,or other communications,data or media collectively utilities.the deed provides that the exclusive easements shall be deemed to reserve solely to obl the rights to administer utilities on,under and across the property such that no other person or entity shall be entitled to administer any utilities on,under or across the property without the written consent of obl.the deed also prohibits lhoa from grant ing any easement to administer any utilities on,under or across the property to any other party.
the second arrangement at issue is the covenants,conditions,and restrictions for lansdowne on the potomac the cc rs,dated june.the cc rs include a provision expressly recognizing obl exclusive easements for access to and the installation,construction,and operation of a private utility and telecommunication system.the cc rs refer to obl exclusivity in several other places,including a provision declaring that obl rights with respect to the private utility system and the services provided through such private utility system are exclusive,and no other person may provide such services to the property.
finally,obl entered into a contract with the homeowners association on july,entitled the agreement to obtain telecommunication services tsa.under the tsa,lhoa engaged obl to provide platform services,or basic video,phone,and internet services that homeowners receive,as well as optional premium services.the tsa grants obl the right to provide or arrange for the provision of the platform services to homeowners so that lhoa shall not engage any other provider of platform services.the tsa also incorporates the cc rs which incorporate the easement as described above by prohibiting lhoa from amend ing the cc rs such that the amendment would have a materially adverse effect on obl.
in terms of its actual delivery of telecommunications services,obl purchases services from its affiliates video and internet from obm and telephone from obv and resells them to lansdowne homeowners.obl also separately sells its services to lhoa itself for purposes of the potomac club,a community center and office space that the homeowners association maintains on the property.in accordance with the terms of the easement,cc rs,and tsa described above,no cable provider other than obl has the infrastructure necessary to deliver services to the development.as one dean executive explained,the entire agreement was set up so that we could have our infrastructure in that fashion,that is,through a blanket easement over the lansdowne community.
after obl began providing cable to lansdowne,residents began complaining about the quality of its service.one homeowner,marvis aleem,noted that obl picture quality was frequently pixilated and the channel,both in terms of quantity and offerings was inferior to those of other video providers.another homeowner,tim mccoy,complained of obl poor picture quality,channel,equipment technology,and customer service.mccoy described a number of specific problems with obl video service.for example,during the second half of the super bowl,portions of his screen pixilated,or froze,despite the fact that mccoy had complained to obl about pixilation problems previously.mccoy also experienced synchronization problems,where a particular channel would display the correct video feed accompanied by a different channel audio feed.
in response to these complaints,the homeowners association began investigating alternative providers in.one member of lhoa board of directors had discussions with verizon,which demonstrated an interest in providing services to the development.however,a verizon employee subsequently emailed the lhoa board member expressing concern that obl exclusive easements would prevent it from build ing out on or otherwise access ing the property.another competing video service provider,comcast,is contractually required to make cable services available to lansdowne residents under the terms of its franchise agreement with loudoun county.the franchise agreement excuses this requirement,however,in developments like lansdowne that are subject to claimed exclusive arrangements with other providers.it is undisputed that neither verizon nor comcast has formally asked obl to grant it a subeasement to build its own infrastructure.however,as one dean official testified,would we object to verizon coming into the community and running their infrastructure i would say that we would.
in august,lhoa filed suit against openband in the eastern district of virginia,alleging a variety of claims under federal and state law.openband moved to dismiss,and the district court agreed as to all of the federal counts but one the homeowners association claim that certain clauses in openband contractual arrangements provide it with the exclusive right to deliver video services in violation of the fcc exclusivity order following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment on this claim.on june,the district court ruled in favor of the homeowners association.the court thus issued an order permanently enjoining obl,obm,obs,and dean from enforcing any video service exclusivity provision against lhoa or lansdowne residents,and declaring all such provisions null and void.
openband then filed the instant appeal.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,asking whether,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to openband,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and lhoa is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
before reaching the merits of lhoa claim,we must first address some threshold questions of justiciability.for i f a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it,or expounding the law in the course of doing so.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.openband claims both that lhoa lacks standing to bring this action and that the suit is not ripe for our review.see id.at noting that standing and ripeness both originate in article iii case or controversy language.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three requirements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,the plaintiff must show that it has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and imminent second,the injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant challenged conduct and third,it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.openband asserts that lhoa can not satisfy any of these requirements,but for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
with respect to the element of injury,lhoa is a direct consumer of obl video services,which lhoa purchases for the potomac club.although openband does not dispute that a cognizable injury would exist if it were actually to prohibit lhoa from contracting with a competing provider,openband contends that lhoa has suffered no injury here because n othing in the tsa or other agreements precludes lhoa from doing so.appellants br.
this contention is impossible to square with the plain terms of the challenged agreements.to start,obl deed of easement unambiguously bars lhoa from engaging another provider of video services.in fact,the deed blockades other providers from accessing the property to build the infrastructure necessary for delivering service in the first place.to that end,obl owns exclusive easements for the purpose of constructing or operating infrastructure for the provision,and distribution of video services.the deed states that these exclusive easements shall be deemed to reserve solely to obl the right to construct infrastructure for such services and that no other person or entity shall be entitled to do so without obl consent.and the deed expressly prohibits lhoa from grant ing any easement to any other party for the purpose of building such infrastructure.
the cc rs likewise prevent lhoa from contracting with a competing video provider.for example,the cc rs state that obl rights with respect to the private utility system and the services provided through such system are exclusive,and no other person may provide such services to the property.moreover,the exclusivity clauses in the cc rs are incorporated into the tsa,which prohibits lhoa from amend ing the cc rs such that the amendment would have a materially adverse effect on obl.
openband has also admitted that the whole purpose of its agreements was to preclude lhoa from contracting with competing cable providers the very result that openband now seeks to disclaim.for example,openband conceded in the district court that obl easement effectively bar s other providers of wired services from lansdowne.defs.br.in supp.of mot.to dismiss.dean executive vice president testified that nobody else has infrastructure within the community to deliver wireline service.when asked why that was so,the executive candidly answered,b ecause the entire agreement was set up so that we could have our infrastructure in that fashion.
recognizing the futility of its contention that its various arrangements do not bar the homeowners association from engaging competing providers,openband changes tack and raises a second argument as well that the mere existence of an exclusivity clause gives rise to no injury at all unless the clause is actually enforced.appellants reply br.that would be surprising news to the fcc,which enacted the exclusivity order based on its express finding that exclusivity clauses cause significant harm,in particular that they deny consumers the benefits of lower prices,more channels,and improved quality of service.exclusivity order.significantly,the fcc found that these injuries occur not only where exclusivity clauses are actually enforced,but rather by virtue of their very existence because such clauses deter new entrants from even attempting to enter the market.id.emphasis added.as the fcc explained,a rule that left exclusivity clauses in effect would allow the vast majority of the harms caused by such clauses to continue for years.id.it is for this reason that the order declares any exclusivity clause null and void without regard for whether it has been enforced.id.
because openband exclusivity clauses preclude lhoa from engaging an alternate provider of video services for its club house,producing the precise injuries that the fcc identified in enacting its exclusivity order,we hold that lhoa has suffered a cognizable injury for purposes of article iii standing.
the second element of standing requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that its injuries are fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendants.lujan,at.openband argues that any injury suffered by lhoa is not caused by it,but rather by the independent,intervening actions of third parties not before the court to wit,the decisions by competing companies not to offer video service to lansdowne.
this argument ignores the reason why competing cable providers have not offered services to lhoa the existence of openband exclusivity clauses.openband mistake,in other words,is to equate injury fairly traceable to the defendant with injury as to which the defendant actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.bennett spear,d.but as the supreme court has explained,the causation element of standing is satisfied not just where the defendant conduct is the last link in the causal chain leading to an injury,but also where the plaintiff suffers an injury that is produced by the determinative or coercive effect of the defendant conduct upon the action of someone else.id.at.
that is what has occurred here.the record is replete with evidence that obl exclusivity arrangement caused competing cable providers not to offer lhoa their services.for starters,an lhoa board member testified that during her discussions with verizon,the company indicated that it wanted to come down into lansdowne and lay cable and service the lansdowne residents.to that end,verizon sent the homeowners association a letter identifying the services it could offer along with pricing options.yet after verizon analyzed obl exclusive easement,the cc rs,and the tsa,the company concluded that it could not provide service to lansdowne because nothing verizon has seen would give us a green light to build out on or otherwise access the property.
similarly,lhoa produced the franchise agreement between loudoun county and comcast.under that agreement,comcast is required to make service available to all residential dwelling units in the county,with the exception that it shall not be required to serve potential subscribers in developments like lansdowne that are subject to claimed exclusive arrangements with other providers.thus,as with verizon,comcast decision not to offer video to lansdowne is fairly traceable to openband challenged exclusivity arrangements.and although it took place before the fcc issued the exclusivity order,we also note that when adelphia sought to provide service to lansdowne in,obl denied its request,citing its exclusive easement.see uca,llc lansdowne cmty,llc,d.we therefore hold that lhoa has established the second element of the article iii standing inquiry.
turning to the third standing requirement of redressability,our task is to determine if it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at quoting simon.welfare rights,d.openband contends that it is entirely speculative whether an order nullifying obl exclusivity clauses will redress lhoa injuries because the courts can not order any alternative provider to provide service or even negotiate with lhoa.appellants br.
we do not agree.the record reveals that an order declaring obl exclusivity clauses null and void and enjoining obl from enforcing them would indeed be likely to redress the lack of competition and accompanying quality,price,and menu of channel harms that lhoa currently suffers.as discussed above,comcast franchise agreement with loudoun county requires it to make cable service available to all residential dwelling units in the county.comcast has not fulfilled this obligation because its franchise agreement excuses the requirement in cases where a development is subject to claimed exclusive arrangements with other providers.thus,once obl exclusivity arrangement is eliminated,so too will be comcast reason for declining to provide service to lansdowne.a favorable court ruling here is therefore not only likely to redress lhoa injuries,but will necessarily do so.having successfully established,causation,and redressability,lhoa has standing in this case 
we turn next to a second article iii threshold question whether this dispute is ripe for adjudication.the doctrine of ripeness prevents judicial consideration of issues until a controversy is presented in and concrete form.miller brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to determine if a case is ripe,we balance the fitness of the issues for judicial decision with the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
with respect to the fitness criterion,it is settled that a case is fit for judicial decision when the issues are purely legal and when the action in controversy is final and not dependent on future uncertainties.id.openband protests that this case is not fit for resolution because there is no proof that obl denied access to its easement or refused to grant a subeasement to anyone.appellants br.openband asks this court to wait to decide this case because openband might yet decide in the future to relinquish its claim to the exclusive right to provide video services at lansdowne.
this argument fails for two reasons.to begin,openband position is unsupported by the record.the homeowners association has produced evidence that openband has no intention of voluntarily abandoning its exclusivity.as already mentioned,an dean executive stated on the record twice that obl would,if asked,deny verizon access to its easement.another executive testified that the entire purpose of obl contractual arrangements was so that nobody else would have infrastructure within the community to deliver wireline service.eliminating the exclusive easement,the executive stated,would place our entire business model at risk.
in the face of these undisputed statements,we find openband claim of factual uncertainty completely untenable.openband argument amounts to little more than a formalistic contrivance.the case is not ripe,it complains,because it may at some point in the future gratuitously renounce its claim of exclusive access to the development.yet openband has fought this entire litigation to preserve that very exclusivity,stating repeatedly on the record that it has no intention of giving it up.
moreover,even if there were some reason to think that obl might abandon its exclusivity and allow competitors to access lansdowne,that future prospect would not assist our resolution of the actual issue before this court.babbitt united farm workers union,d.as noted earlier,the question here is whether obl exclusivity clauses,as written,violate the exclusivity order.whether obl enforces those clauses in the future is of no consequence because the order declares any provision in a contract that grants a cable operator the exclusive right to provide any video service null and void.exclusivity order.thus,whether obl clauses unlawfully grant it the exclusive right to provide video service is a legal question that is,in a sense,frozen in time the answer does not change no matter how actively or passively obl chooses to exercise that right.
turning to the hardship prong of the ripeness inquiry,we find this to be a straightforward case.the hardship prong is measured by the immediacy of the threat and the burden imposed on the plaintiff.charter fed.sav.bank office of thrift supervision,cir.here,the hardship could not be any more immediate because of obl exclusivity,lhoa and its residents are presently unable to avail themselves of the quality,price,and menu of channel advantages of a competing provider.see miller,at finding hardship prong satisfied where challenged action of the defendants had already caused immediate harm to plaintiffs.
so too is the burden imposed substantial.each day that passes without judicial resolution is another day that lhoa and its homeowners go without the opportunity to obtain service from a competitor,despite the fact that the exclusivity order declares that any exclusivity clause shall be null and void.while cable service may not be a matter of life and death,it is an important aspect of life for many americans.consider the plight of lansdowne homeowner tim mccoy,who,unable to contract with a competing provider and having already paid obl for his service,watched the second half of the super bowl in a state of apprehension that the video feed would freeze at any moment,as had happened before.such homeowner concerns,especially in the absence of any need to await further factual developments,render this case ripe for our review.
satisfied that article iii poses no obstacle to suit,we next consider openband argument that lhoa claim falls outside the scope of the private right of action conferred by b.that provision states i f any person fails or neglects to obey any order of the commission any party injured thereby may apply to the appropriate district court of the united states for the enforcement of such order.b emphasis added.
the district court held that lhoa may sue under this provision,reasoning that the exclusivity order qualifies as an order of the commission because it specifically defines the rights and obligations that a litigant can enforce.openband argues that this was error for two reasons.first,it contends that b permits enforcement of only adjudicatory orders,not rulemaking orders.in the alternative,openband asserts that even if b permits enforcement of some rulemaking orders,those that define the rights and obligations of litigants the exclusivity order is not such an order.again,however,we find openband arguments unpersuasive.
we begin with the question of whether b ever permits parties to sue for enforcement of fcc rulemaking,as opposed to adjudicatory orders.openband suggests that the answer is no because while the plain terms of b authorize enforcement of any order of the commission,the administrative procedure act defines the term order to mean the whole or a part of a final disposition of any agency in a matter other than rule making,emphasis added.
we are not persuaded.to begin,the apa definition of an order does not control in this context because b predates the apa by nearly twelve years,and the apa definitions are only mandatory in the context of the apa itself.see definitions apply f or the purpose of this subchapter.moreover,as the ninth circuit explained in hawaiian telephone,at,when congress wanted to incorporate apa definitions into the communications act,it did so expressly for example,explicitly defining the term adjudication by reference to the apa three times in a c.that congress did not do so with regard to the term order in b shows that it did not intend for the apa limited definition of that term to apply here.
interpreting the phrase any order of the commission in b to encompass rulemaking orders also respects the venerable principle of statutory construction that identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.powerex reliant energy,d.in cbs,united states,the supreme court construed the exact phrase at issue here,any order of the commission,to include some fcc rulemaking orders in the context of a,which provides a right of action for setting aside an fcc order.openband has offered no persuasive explanation for why this interpretation of any order of the commission should not also apply in the context of b,the immediately prior provision.we thus hold that b right of action to enforce any order of the commission can encompass both fcc adjudicatory and rulemaking orders.in so holding,we align ourselves with a majority of circuits to consider the question.see,alltel.pub.serv.comm n,cir hawaiian.pub.utils.comm n,cir.but see new england.public utils.comm n,cir.
our holding that b can extend to rulemaking orders does not,however,end the analysis.as we explained in cgm,llc bellsouth telecommunications,not all rulemaking orders are created equal for purposes of b private right of action only those that require a defendant to take concrete actions may be enforced,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the reason for this rule is if a rulemaking order merely announces agency findings or broad policy considerations without actually imposing specific obligations on identifiable entities,a b action to enforce that order would present a court with nothing but generic abstractions to enforce.
thus,for example,in cgm,we rejected a plaintiff attempt to enforce under b a rulemaking order that laid out policy considerations and public feedback.id.at.in fact,the order at issue in cgm made clear that parties were free to voluntarily contract around the relevant fcc rules and that state regulatory commissions not the fcc had the final authority to create binding obligations on the parties.id.in light of these facts,we had no choice but to conclude that the plaintiff in cgm had no rights and the defendant no duties under the fcc order involved in that case.id.at.
openband contends that the same result should obtain here because the exclusivity order impose s no obligation on any named party,confer s no rights to any named party,and,in fact,name s no parties or entities at all.appellants br.this argument misses the mark.for one,openband badly misconstrues the controlling legal principle by focusing on whether the order expressly names the precise parties involved in this litigation.no court has taken such a crabbed view of the rulemaking orders subject to b.and for good reason.the crucial distinction between adjudication and rulemaking is that adjudications resolve disputes among specific individuals in specific cases,whereas rulemaking affects the rights of broad classes of unspecified individuals.yesler terrace cmty.council cisneros,cir.to require a rulemaking order to expressly and presciently name the parties in advance would fatally undercut the fcc power to regulate via general and prospective rules,i.
consequently,as we explained in cgm,the ultimate test is simply whether the fcc order in question sets forth specific rights and obligations of the litigants.at.the exclusivity order satisfies this test.the order identifies the precise actions that openband is prohibited from taking no operator of an open video system may enforce or execute any provision in a contract granting it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service.exclusivity order.it defines openband rights in such exclusivity clauses accordingly a ny such exclusivity clause shall be null and void.id.the order likewise identifies the rights of lhoa and homeowners as part of a centrally managed residential real estate development that shall not be the subject of any exclusivity clause.id.we therefore hold that the exclusivity order is sufficiently specific in defining the rights and obligations of these litigants to be enforceable under b.cgm,at 
we arrive at last at the question of whether the challenged clauses in the easement,cc rs,and tsa actually run afoul of the fcc order.resolving this question involves.first,we must decide whether obl is an open video system operator such that its agreements are subject to the order to begin with.exclusivity order.if it is,we must then ask whether the challenged clauses are provision s in a contract granting obl an exclusive right to provide video service in violation of the order.id.
openband asserts that the answer to both of these questions is no,but its arguments as to why ring hollow.obl seeks first to evade the fcc definition of an open video system operator by structuring its business operations among several related,interlocking entities in a kind of elaborate corporate shell game.obl likewise seeks to avoid the exclusivity order flat prohibition on exclusivity clauses in any contract by splitting up its exclusive arrangement into an assortment of interconnected and placing its critical exclusivity provisions in a deed of easement that it contends is not a contract reached by the fcc proscription.for the reasons that follow,we reject both of these efforts to circumvent the plain terms of the exclusivity order.
we start with the question of whether obl is an operator of an open video system,or ovs,within the meaning of the fcc order.the answer matters because the order renders null and void exclusivity clauses that are entered into by entities that are subject to,among which ovs operators are included.exclusivity order,c a stating that ovs operators are subject to.our inquiry is limited to whether obl satisfies the definition of an ovs operator because obl is the only that is party to the agreements at issue.
to decide whether obl is an ovs operator,we begin with the applicable regulatory definition.the fcc has defined an o pen video system operator to include 
any person defined by to include corporations or group of persons who provides cable service over an open video system and directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such open video system,or otherwise controls or is responsible for the management and operation of such an open video system.
b.openband does not dispute that obl satisfies most of this definition.its sole contention is that obl can not be said to provide cable service either as a person in its own right or as part of a group of persons.b.the district court ruled against obl in both respects,and we agree for the reasons below.
openband argues first that obl is not itself a person who provides cable service because the cable service in question is actually that of its affiliate,openband multimedia,or obm,who openband concedes is an ovs operator.openband therefore contends that it is only obm who provides cable service to lhoa and the homeowners obl merely arranged for the provision of that service by purchasing it from obm and reselling it to lansdowne.appellants br.
we can not accept openband argument.to start,because neither congress nor the fcc have defined the term provide,we give the term its ordinary meaning.see schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d.the ordinary meaning of provide is to make available or to furnish.random house dictionary of the english language ed.obl satisfies this definition because it is undisputed that obm sells video service to obl,which then uses its own connection lines,cables,and other infrastructure to transmit that video into lansdowne,thereby making available or furnishing it to homeowners.
openband argument to the contrary is premised on the misguided view that the entity that is the initial link in a chain of delivery is the only one that can be said to provide the thing delivered.but that is not what provide means if angela tells bob how to drive to the park,and bob relays those instructions to carmen,all would agree that bob,no less than angela and perhaps more has provided instructions to carmen.furthermore,openband argument refutes itself,since obm who openband admits provides cable service is not actually the initial link in the delivery chain obm instead contracts with video content providers who deliver programming that obm in turn transmits to obl.we therefore hold that obl qualifies as an ovs operator under b because it is itself an entity that provides cable service.
alternatively,even if obl is not itself a person that provides cable service,it is undoubtedly part of a group of persons that does.b.in defining an ovs operator to include not just individual entities,but also groups of entities that provide cable service,the fcc definition appears to envision precisely this type of scenario,where a corporate parent like dean divides up the functions of an ovs operator across its subsidiaries such as obm and obl.thus,as already described,obm is able to deliver video to obl end customers in lansdowne only by using obl physical infrastructure.obm also has no direct contact with those customers it is instead obl who has contracted with customers to resell obm services.obl and obm thus operate together,functionally and contractually,in an integrated manner as a group of persons who provides cable service over an open video system,b.
openband responds that treating obl and obm together as an ovs operator under the group of persons prong of the fcc definition proves too much because under such an approach,lhoa and its members also are ovs operators.appellants reply br.openband is mistaken.for one thing,lhoa and its homeowners are not a part of the same group of persons as obm and obl because unlike obm and obl,lhoa and the homeowners are not affiliated subsidiaries of dean.for another,there is no evidence that lhoa or its homeowners satisfy the definitional requirement of own ing a significant interest in the ovs.b.nor is there any evidence that lhoa or the homeowners somehow control or are responsible for the management and operation of the ovs.id.put simply,there is no reason to read the fcc group of persons definition of an ovs operator so broadly as to sweep up individual homeowners the definition is instead designed to fit exactly the kind of division of labor that exists here between corporate affiliates like obl and obm.
openband tosses up one final contention as to why obl should not be bound by the exclusivity order that the regulatory definition of an ovs operator in b does not matter anyway.this is so,openband suggests,because a directs ovs operators to obtain certification from the fcc.thus,in openband view,only an entity that has received such certification can be an open video system operator.appellants br.
yet again,openband is mistaken.its error this time is to ignore the obvious difference between a definition and a duty.the statutory obligation that an entity should certify with the fcc as an ovs operator is plainly the latter a does not purport to define what an ovs operator is,but rather identifies something that an ovs operator should do.thus,a states that a n operator of an open video system shall qualify for reduced regulatory burdens if the operator of such system certifies to the commission that it complies with the commission regulations.
moreover,to read a certification requirement as somehow delimiting the kinds of entities that constitute an ovs operator would lead to absurd results.it would permit,for example,an entity to avoid all regulations applicable to ovs operators simply by refusing to certify with the fcc.in addition to defying logic,such a result can not be squared with the text of the very statute that openband relies on,which entitles an operator of an open video system to qualify for reduced regulatory burdens if it certifies with the fcc,not more.a emphasis added.
in sum,we reject openband attempt to circumvent the fcc definition of an ovs operator.openband arguments hinge,at bottom,on the belief that it can evade unambiguous federal regulations by playing a shell game in which it divides up corporate functions so that one entity obtains certification from the fcc as an ovs operator,while a separate entity enters into exclusivity agreements.we reject the notion that the exclusivity order may be defeated through such a meaningless expedient.to allow that outcome would create a blueprint for regulatory circumvention,effectively enabling every ovs operator to engage in exactly the kind of exclusive access arrangement that the fcc found to deter competition and cause consumers considerable harm.we decline openband invitation to be a party to that result.
having decided that obl is an ovs operator bound by the fcc order,we consider finally whether obl arrangements contravene that order.we start with the language of the order,which states that no ovs operator shall enforce or execute any provision in a contract that grants it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service alone or in combination with other services to a mdu.any such exclusivity clause shall be null and void.exclusivity order.open band has conceded,at various points,that most of this definition is satisfied.openband does not dispute,for instance,that lansdowne is an mdu protected by the order.openband also admitted before the district court that its easement though not the tsa effectively bar s other providers of wired services from lansdowne.defs.br.in supp.of mot.to dismiss.
notwithstanding these concessions,openband claims that it has not violated the exclusivity order.its argument involves two steps.first,openband asserts that each of the challenged arrangements the tsa,cc rs,and easement should be segregated and considered separately from one another before determining whether any of them actually violates the order.second,openband contends that none of the ind
