curtis adkins filed suit against labor ready,and labor ready mid atlantic,collectively labor ready alleging violations of federal and state labor laws.labor ready responded with a motion to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by adkins.the district court granted the motion,adkins labor ready,d,and dismissed the case.because the arbitration agreement is enforceable and all of adkins claims are arbitrable,we affirm.
labor ready is a temporary employment agency that provides manual day labor to companies throughout the united states.it has hundreds of dispatch offices,all of which operate under a strictly regimented work today,paid today employment procedure.temporary employees report to work at the labor ready office before the start of the workday,where they wait on the premises until jobs are assigned to them.they receive work tickets at the home office and then travel to a labor ready customer job site.at the end of each workday,the customer signs the employees work tickets,whereupon the employees return to labor ready to receive immediate payment.employees can choose payment either by check drawn upon a bank or by cash.for cash payments,a fee of between one and two dollars is deducted.
adkins alleges that labor ready dispatch and payroll procedures violate the federal fair labor standards act flsa,et,west virginia minimum wage and maximum hours standards for employees,et,and west virginia wage payment and collection act,et.he brought this suit as a proposed flsa class action,filing approximately consent forms from current and former labor ready employees wishing to join the action as plaintiffs.
adkins contends that labor ready employees were statutorily entitled to payment for waiting time at labor ready dispatch office,travel time between that office and the assigned workplace,and time spent undergoing required training.further,he claims that if this amount of time was added to each employee workweek,many employees would be entitled to overtime pay.he also alleges that labor ready employees were entitled to compensation for the cost of commuting to and from job sites at the prevailing rate of per mile.additionally,he asserts that labor ready means of payment,involving a deduction for cash payment,was itself contrary to law.
labor ready filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings based on an arbitration agreement signed by adkins and every other labor ready employee.this agreement,contained in labor ready policy regarding dispatch procedures,employment and arbitration the policy,must be signed by all potential employees as part of the job application before they may join labor ready pool of temporary workers.the policy is contained within an enclosed box on the employment application.it provides in pertinent part 
i understand that my employment with labor ready,is on a basis.that is,at the end of the work day,i will be deemed to have quit unless and until i request and receive a work assignment at a later date.
i agree that any disputes arising out of my employment,including any claims of discrimination,harassment or wrongful termination that i believe i have against labor ready and all other employment related issues excluding only claims arising under the national labor relations act sic or otherwise within the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board will be resolved by arbitration as my sole remedy.the arbitration shall be conducted by the american arbitration association under its commercial arbitration rules and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.i understand that labor ready also agrees to arbitrate in the same manner any claims which the company believes it has against me.
i have read and agree to the above statements.
relying on the federal arbitration act faa,labor ready argues that the arbitration agreement was valid,covered adkins claims,and should be enforced.
the district court agreed and ordered the parties to submit adkins claims to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement.the court then dismissed the action on the ground that all of the issues presented in the suit were arbitrable.see choice hotels int l bsr tropicana resort,cir.adkins appeals.
the faa reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.underlying this policy is congress view that arbitration constitutes a more efficient dispute resolution process than litigation.hightower gmri,cir.accordingly,due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration,and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.volt info.sciences,bd.of tr.of leland stanford,d.
the faa requires a court to stay any suit or proceeding pending arbitration of any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration.this provision is mandatory.a district court therefore has no choice but to grant a motion to compel arbitration where a valid arbitration agreement exists and the issues in a case fall within its purview.united states bankers ins,cir.
thus mindful of the clear federal directive in support of arbitration,hightower,at,we proceed to the analysis of the district court order compelling arbitration.
in the fourth circuit,a litigant can compel arbitration under the faa if he can demonstrate the existence of a dispute between the parties,a written agreement that includes an arbitration provision which purports to cover the dispute,the relationship of the transaction,which is evidenced by the agreement,to interstate or foreign commerce,and the failure,neglect or refusal of the defendant to arbitrate the dispute.whiteside teltech,cir.adkins contests the second element,denying the existence of a binding contract to arbitrate this dispute.
it is clear that even though arbitration has a favored place,there still must be an underlying agreement between the parties to arbitrate.arrants buck,cir.whether a party agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute is a question of state law governing contract formation.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.we turn initially,therefore,to west virginia contract law to determine whether the employment application mandates arbitration of adkins claims as a contractual matter.we review the trial court decision on this issue de novo.see arnold united.lending.
adkins first argues that there was no exchange of consideration to support the formation of a contract based on the employment application.by its terms,however,the arbitration clause requires both adkins and labor ready to arbitrate any claims either might have.because no consideration is required above and beyond the agreement to be bound by the arbitration process for any claims brought by the employee,johnson circuit city stores,cir,labor ready promise to arbitrate its own claims is a fortiori adequate consideration for this agreement.
adkins argues that this promise was illusory but advances no convincing reasons to support this assertion.his contention that labor ready has no reciprocal rights against its employees under worker protection provisions,while obviously true,does not by itself demonstrate that labor ready promise to arbitrate its own claims is meaningless.at bottom,adkins appears to contend that labor ready could possess no conceivable claims against its employees,ignoring the fact that in every employment relationship,each side bears reciprocal obligations to the other.see,d employment relationship employee liable to employer for any profit received as the result of a breach of employee duty of loyalty.there was plainly adequate consideration here to support the formation of a contract.
adkins also asserts that the employment agreement was an unconscionable contract of adhesion under west virginia law.he points to evidence in the record that many of the plaintiffs did not complete high school,were paid at or near the minimum wage by labor ready,live in neighborhoods,and did not know what arbitration was when they signed the employment application.he further notes that labor ready is a large,sophisticated,international corporation that generated more than million in revenues during the year before this suit was brought.in light of this gross disparity in bargaining power and the nature of the employment application,he argues that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable.
a ruling of unconscionability based on this analysis alone could potentially apply to every contract of employment in our contemporary economy.the west virginia courts recognize that it is not the province of the judiciary to try to eliminate the inequities inevitable in a capitalist society.troy mining itmann coal.unconscionability in west virginia therefore requires both gross inadequacy in bargaining power and terms unreasonably favorable to the stronger party.id.at internal citations omitted.a finding that the transaction was flawed still depends on the existence of unfair terms in the contract.a litigant who complains that he was forced to enter into a fair agreement will find no relief on grounds of unconscionability.arnold,at quoting troy mining,at.
we therefore review the contract for any unfair terms,bearing in mind that the grounds for revocation must relate specifically to the arbitration clause and not just to the contract as a whole.hooters of america,phillips,cir.adkins claim of unfairness hinges on his argument that the arbitration agreement forecloses redress of his underlying substantive rights.the agreement,however,does no such thing.
certainly no agreement to arbitrate can be construed on its face as an inherent waiver of a litigant statutory rights.the entire point of the faa was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at english common law.gilmer lane,d.there is thus a clear federal command that courts can not treat arbitration in general as an inferior or less reliable means of vindicating important substantive rights.mitsubishi motors soler,d.nor is there any allegation that this specific arbitral forum is so procedurally unfair as to inject substantive bias into the process itself.hooters,at.
instead,adkins argues that the arbitration clause forecloses redress of his rights because it effectively precludes access not only to the courts,but even to the arbitration forum itself.he contends it does so by the interaction of two factors the fee structure of labor ready arbitration procedure and its preclusion of class actions.adkins claims that arbitration costs are so high and the amounts at stake for each individual plaintiff so low that no plaintiff would be willing to gamble on victory in arbitration he further asserts that plaintiffs can not circumvent this problem by aggregating their claims for the sake of economic efficiency because labor ready arbitration procedure does not permit class actions.
it is certainly possible that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.green tree fin.randolph,d brooklyn sav.bank.contractual waiver of flsa rights void as against public policy.however,where a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.green tree,at.adkins has not come close to satisfying that burden here.
adkins makes no showing of the specific financial status of any of the plaintiffs at the time this action was brought.he provides no basis for a serious estimation of how much money is at stake for each individual plaintiff.in fact,he does not even provide any evidence about the most basic element of this challenge the size of the allegedly prohibitive arbitration fee itself.adkins plea that he could not do this because the district court cut off discovery is unconvincing.it was within his power to obtain this information by simply investigating the option of arbitration in the first place.he can not seriously claim to be in court because the arbitration fee is too high at the same time that he pleads ignorance about what the actual amount of the arbitration fee might be.
nor are we moved to a contrary conclusion by the fact that two district courts have found specific provisions in other arbitration agreements to be unconscionable.giordano pep,moe jack,wl,in re knepp.merely listing fees incurred in cases involving other arbitrations does not indicate that adkins himself would in fact have incurred substantial costs in the event his claim went to arbitration.green tree,at.
adkins failure to carry his burden of proof under green tree renders his further complaint about the inability to bring a class action moot.as the third circuit has held,simply because judicial remedies are part of a law does not mean that congress meant to preclude parties from bargaining around their availability.johnson west suburban bank,cir truth in lending act claims are arbitrable even if class action mechanism is unavailable see also randolph green tree fin,cir same.adkins points to no suggestion in the text,legislative history,or purpose of the flsa that congress intended to confer a nonwaivable right to a class action under that statute.his inability to bring a class action,therefore,can not by itself suffice to defeat the strong congressional preference for an arbitral forum.
adkins third contractual challenge lies in his assertion that the contract is grounded in a mutual mistake.specifically,he argues that the parties were mistaken about whether the contractual relationship actually terminated at the end of each day.the policy provides that at the end of the work day,employees will be deemed to have quit unless and until they request and receive a work assignment at a later date.adkins argues,however,that we have previously held this same deemed to have quit provision to be without legal force.see nlrb labor ready,cir deemed to have quit clause does not terminate employee status under nlra provisions guaranteeing employees right to unionize.in light of that decision,adkins argues,the realities of the workplace at labor ready were different from the terms and conditions set out in the employment application.he contends that this constitutes a mutual mistake as to a material assumption which underlies a contractual agreement.
even if adkins interpretation of nlrb labor ready were correct,this argument misconceives the nature of mutual mistake.in west virginia,the doctrine of mutual mistake applies where parties enter into a contract while laboring under a mistake of material fact.capitol megginson,quoting brannon riffle,emphasis added.but the court decision in nlrb labor ready was a conclusion of law,not a determination of fact.we can not accept the novel proposition that litigants can use a court reading of a contract as a bootstrap to invalidate that same contract on the basis of mutual mistake.such a principle would render the act of judicial contract interpretation equivalent to rescission whenever one party disagrees with the outcome.neither of the cases cited by adkins support his argument.mcginnis cayton,mistaken appraisal of value of natural gas bluestone coal bell,mistaken belief about existence of coal veins on leased property.both cases involved mutual mistakes of fact,and adkins fails to allege any mistake of fact in this case.
adkins next contends that even if the arbitration agreement initially created a binding contract,that contract terminated at the end of the first day and therefore does not require arbitration of his claims.he begins with the incontestable proposition that the faa applies only to written agreements to arbitrate a dispute.he further notes that the only written agreement in this case was the policy that adkins signed on his first day at labor ready.since that policy also included the deemed to have quit clause,adkins contends that the contract necessarily terminated at the end of that first with it,any agreement to arbitrate.moreover,he argues that even if the terms of the original oral contract implicitly rolled over to a new oral contract commencing at the start of each working day,any such contract was not written and is therefore not covered by the faa.
this argument confuses
