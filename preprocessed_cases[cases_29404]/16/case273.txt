background 
in august,mueller chief executive officer dale smith offered bukuras a position as the company general counsel.smith offer letter provided for a base salary of,an annual bonus equal to four percent of the company shared bonus pool,and other benefits,including severance benefits as outlined in mueller draft executive severance pay policy.a copy of that policy was attached to the offer letter.bukuras accepted,and began work as mueller general counsel in october.
two years later,in the fall of,mueller owners,dlj merchant banking partners dlj,contemplated selling the company through a private auction.in connection with this effort,bukuras informed smith in january that,in his opinion,the company was legally obligated to pay him upon termination the benefits described in the severance policy attached to smith august offer of employment,and that those payments were among the obligations that needed to be disclosed to prospective bidders.smith,who had never submitted the draft policy to mueller board of directors for approval,disagreed with bukuras and the conflict became heated.smith invited bukuras to resign.
looking to resolve the matter,bukuras sent a memorandum to mueller board of directors in which he summarized his version of the disagreement with smith and informed the board of his preference to remain with the company through the proposed sale,provided he could execute a new employment agreement so that everyone would be on the same page regarding his severance benefits.the board agreed and,after negotiations in which both bukuras and the company were represented by counsel,the parties executed a new employment agreement,which became effective in early february.
under the terms of the employment agreement the agreement,mueller undertook,among other things,to pay bukuras an increased annual salary of at least and,under the heading bonus,an annual bonus,payable at the conclusion of each fiscal year,equivalent to not less than of the bonus pool applicable to compensate executive management of the company.agreement,hereinafter,the bonus provision.in addition,the agreement provided that if the company terminated bukuras for any reason other than cause 
t he employee shall be entitled to severance compensation in an amount equal to the sum of a eighteen months salary at the rate then in effect,plus b one hundred fifty percent of the bonus paid or payable to the employee for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs.
id.d emphasis added hereinafter,the severance provision.receipt of this severance payment was expressly conditioned on bukuras execution of a general release of claims against the company,and a model release was appended to the agreement.further,in exchange for the severance benefits described in the agreement,bukuras agreed to forgo certain transaction benefits that the board was then considering awarding to certain employees in connection with a change of control transaction expected to be consummated during fiscal year fy.id.c 
at the time he entered into the agreement,bukuras had received annual bonuses for each of his two years at mueller.in both years,the bonuses were conditioned on the company meeting certain financial targets,measured in terms of earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation,and amortization or,ebita.based on those targets,the company allocated a pool of money for division among eligible senior executives according to the terms of their employment.for example,for fy the company set an earnings target of million ebita and a bonus pool of.when the company hit its mark,bukuras received a bonus,which was equal to four percent of the pool,per the terms outlined in smith initial offer letter.for fy,bukuras received a bonus of,calculated according to the same methodology.following the execution of the revised agreement,under which bukuras was entitled to a larger five percent share of the annual bonus pool,he received a bonus for fy and a bonus for fy,with both bonuses calculated according to the same formula used in previous years.in every year of his employment,bukuras received his annual bonus following the conclusion of the fiscal year,a delay which was necessary to allow the company auditors to review its earnings.
the auction process contemplated by dlj was unsuccessful and did not result in the sale of the company in.as a result,smith and bukuras strained relationship continued.however,in late,dlj began the process for another private auction in a second attempt to sell the company.in april,anticipating the sale,mueller board passed several resolutions relating to the compensation of key executives,including a resolution setting the ebita target and bonus pool for fy according to the same methodology used in previous years.
walter industries walter emerged as the successful bidder at auction and,on june,mueller and walter signed a definitive merger agreement,which was conditioned on,among other things,antitrust review by the federal trade commission ftc,see,a process expected to take several months.closing was set to occur within two days of the satisfaction of all conditions set forth in the merger agreement.however,the merger agreement provided that if the conditions were not satisfied within six months of the june signing,the agreement would terminate and walter obligation to purchase the company would expire.
also on june,the board passed a resolution setting aside a pool of up to million for the payment of a transaction bonus.at closing,this pool would be allocated to bukuras,certain members of the management team,and legal personnel involved in bringing the transaction to a close the transaction bonus was intended to provide an incentive to the employees,some of whom understood they would likely be terminated following the sale,to remain with the company until the merger was complete.the transaction bonus was also meant to reward those employees for their efforts in bringing the transaction to a successful close.bukuras expected to receive a million transaction bonus,equal to ten percent of the pool,if and when the deal went through.
following the execution of the merger agreement,on advice of outside counsel,bukuras and other employees agreed to submit certain anticipated change of control payments,including the transaction bonus and any severance compensation,for shareholder approval in order to avoid a tax penalty.as general counsel and also,since june,chief compliance officer,bukuras was responsible for overseeing the preparation of shareholder solicitation and disclosure documents related to these payments.in july,bukuras legal department prepared spreadsheets which identified the anticipated severance compensation and transaction payment s for certain employees.the final spreadsheets,dated july,calculated bukuras anticipated severance payment as,using only his salary and,explicitly,his estimated fy annual bonus.the spreadsheets did not include the transaction bonus in the severance calculation instead,it was identified in a separate column in the spreadsheet.the figures in the spreadsheet were based on the assumption that the merger would close in fy and that the employees would be terminated in that year.
charts based on these spreadsheets,and containing the same or materially similar disclosures,were reviewed and approved by mueller board and,on august,submitted to the company shareholders for approval.the shareholder disclosures indicated that the estimated severance payments were calculated by reference to an estimated annual bonus payable for the fiscal year emphasis added.the shareholders approved the payments as outlined in the disclosures.
in early september,the ftc notified mueller of early termination of its approval process,which mueller outside counsel had previously opined would likely not occur until mid to late november,fy.the ftc approved the merger.on september,smith sent a letter to bukuras stating,in relevant part 
w e are anticipating that the sale of mueller water products to walter industries will occur on monday,october i been allowed the privilege of rewarding certain of our employees that have been involved in the sale process and whom have expended significant extra time and energy in bringing this transaction to a successful close.
therefore,upon the completion of the transaction on monday,october,you will be receiving as a special bonus for your contribution to this transaction.
hereinafter,the september letter.the merger closed as expected on october,first business day of fy bukuras was wired the million transaction bonus.
in early november,bukuras was terminated without cause.in connection with his termination,and as an express condition for receiving his severance payment,bukuras signed a broad,general release of all claims against the company,including claims arising from his severance of employment.
in december,bukuras received his annual,bonus for fy in the amount of.however,bukuras had agreed,for tax purposes,to defer receipt of his severance compensation until six months after his termination.thus,it was not until may that bukuras received his severance payment of,which was based on times his annual salary and times his fy annual bonus.the million transaction bonus he had received on october,was not factored into the calculation of his severance payment.
on may,bukuras sent a letter to smith calling attention to the company failure to include the termination bonus in the calculation of his severance payment and requesting a response,which he never received.
procedural history 
bukuras filed a lawsuit in massachusetts state court on september,which mueller removed to federal court.in his first amended federal complaint,filed in february,bukuras asserted several causes of action,including breach of contract,fraud,unjust enrichment,deceit,and negligent misrepresentation.six of the claims were based,at least in part,on the company alleged failure to provide bukuras with stock options commensurate with those awarded to other senior executives.another claim,for breach of the agreement,was based on mueller failure to include the transaction bonus in the calculation of his severance payment.mueller responded by filing a counterclaim alleging that bukuras had breached the general release when he filed suit,and moved to dismiss bukuras complaint in its entirety.the district court granted the motion to dismiss all of bukuras claims but the claim for breach of contract based on mueller calculation of his severance compensation.
the parties subsequently filed for summary judgment on both the claim and counterclaim,and on august,the district court issued its decision.see generally bukuras,dist.lexis.first,the court granted mueller motion,and denied bukuras motion,on bukuras contract claim,concluding that the contract was unambiguous and that the bonus described in the agreement severance provision referred exclusively to the company annual,bonus and did not include the transaction bonus.second,the court granted bukuras motion,and denied the company motion,on mueller counterclaim,holding that the release did not include within its scope bukuras cause of action based on improper calculation of the severance payment,which was unliquidated at the time he signed the release.in addition,it held that the release was an affirmative defense to bukuras claims,but did not give rise to an agreement not to sue capable of supporting mueller claim for damages.both parties now appeal.

iii.discussion 
alleged breach of the severance provision 
the agreement severance provision obligated mueller to pay bukuras upon termination one hundred fifty percent of the bonus paid or payable to the employee for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs.this dispute centers on the meaning of the bonus as used in this provision.
bukuras contends that the bonus captures both his fy annual bonus and the transaction bonus he received in connection with the successful merger with walter in fy.he takes two steps to reach this conclusion.first,he contends that the transaction bonus was paid or payable for fy because,according to smith september letter,the transaction bonus was paid for his contribution to the successful merger with walter,and all his work towards that end occurred in fy.second,bukuras argues that,in contrast to the annual bonus described in the bonus provision,the parties left the term bonus in the severance provision undefined and therefore to its plain and ordinary meaning,which he asserts comprehends both his fy annual bonus and any additional funds over and above his salary which were paid or payable to him for that year.therefore,he insists,mueller breached its obligations under the severance provision when it failed to include of the transaction bonus in his severance payment.
