background procedural history 
supplies industrial control products and services worldwide.specifically,manufactures compressors and turbines for large industrial applications such as oil and gas operations.also makes its own control products that regulate the turbines,compressors,and other machinery it sells.in,hired dennis mezzatesta to join its controls business.at the time mezzatesta was hired by,most industrial operations had two types of control systems one for the machinery and another to control the balance of the plant operations.although had previously only sold machinery control systems,it planned to enter the plant or process control market.and mezzatesta set out to develop a new type of control system,through the trax project,that could perform both the machinery and plant control functions.to protect the confidential information related to trax,required its employees to sign confidentiality agreements.in particular,mezzatesta was required to sign a code of conduct,pledging to protect the company confidential information and avoid conflicts of interest.
mezzatesta was responsible for overseeing the trax project,including the negotiation of supply agreements for the hardware and software components that were to make up the control system.mezzatesta recommended to that apix,was the best hardware supplier for the project.subsequently,in january,entered into a supply and distribution contract with apix to create a hardware component that would meet the trax product specifications.the contract granted the exclusive right to sell products containing the apix hardware in a defined area of application,which involved primarily new machinery control systems apix also gave the right to sell control products using the apix hardware in all other markets worldwide.
because apix would have access to the trax specifications developed by and other proprietary information,the contract contained provisions intended to impose a confidential relationship between the parties chris tsipouras,acting in his capacity as an officer of apix,signed the contract acknowledging that was entrusting apix with trade secrets and other confidential information.
unknown to,on the same day that apix signed the contract with,apix signed another contract with virtual automation,a company that had been formed by mezzatesta and another associate for the purpose of marketing a controls product that could simultaneously perform machinery and process controls.formed while mezzatesta was still working for,virtual automation was to use hardware that was substantially the same as the hardware apix sold to.
in july,paul fairbanks,mezzatesta supervisor at,discovered the existence of virtual automation when he picked up a piece of paper trash in the parking lot.the scrap of paper turned out to be a virtual automation price list for what appeared to fairbanks to be trax items.fairbanks immediately initiated an investigation.after learning of fairbank discovery,mezzatesta resigned,taking with him electronic data relating to the trax project.upon his resignation from,mezzatesta immediately began working for apix,where he continues to work today.
during his investigation,fairbanks inquired as to tsipouras knowledge of virtual automation.tsipouras denied having done any business with virtual automation.however,it was discovered that tsipouras had not only signed a contract with virtual automation,but was also a stockholder in the company,holding a seat on virtual automation board of directors.
in august,filed suit in state court for injunctive relief to prevent virtual automation and others from cloning its product.after the case,filed suit in october in united states district court for the southern district of texas against multiple defendants,including apix,mezzatesta,and tsipouras.asserted various claims against the defendants including,among others,rico,trade secret misappropriation,common law misappropriation,fraud,and breach of contract.apix counterclaimed that had breached its contract with apix.
after a three and week trial,the jury found for on its common law misappropriation claim against apix,on its fraud claims against tsipouras and mezzatesta,and on its breach of contract and civil theft claims against mezzatesta.the jury also found that breached its contract with apix and awarded apix in damages and in attorney fees.the jury awarded compensatory damages on its fraud and misappropriation counts in the amount of million,the value of its lost development costs.the jury also awarded against mezzatesta for breach of his employment contracts with and civil theft.in addition,the jury assessed punitive damages in the amount of against mezzatesta,against tsipouras,and awarded in attorney fees.on april,the district court entered judgment on the verdict.
shortly after judgment was entered,apix,tsipouras,and mezzatesta filed motions for judgment as a matter of law,to amend the judgment,or for a new trial.in addition,filed a motion seeking injunctive relief against apix.on july,the district court denied all parties pending motions.subsequently,on july,apix,tsipouras,and mezzatesta filed their notices of appeal.filed its notice of on august.

discussion 
whether the district court erred in denying apix motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on misappropriation claim.
on appeal,apix contends that it did not misappropriate product because never had a finished product apix never made a product with features planned to include in its proposed product apix never sold its own product that claimed was a trax clone and apix simply planned to combine its own hardware with publicly available software that neither made nor planned to use in the future,which apix claims is not misappropriation.
the elements of a cause of action for unfair competition by misappropriation in texas are i the creation of plaintiff product through extensive time,labor,skill and money,ii the defendant use of that product in competition with the plaintiff,thereby gaining a special advantage in that competition,a free ride because defendant is burdened with little or none of the expense incurred by the plaintiff,and iii commercial damage to the plaintiff.united states sporting,johnny stewart game calls,writ denied.
taking these elements and each of apix arguments in turn,we first look at apix claim that never had a finished product.apix contends that because the trax project was never completed,there was no final product to misappropriate.this court,however,has previously determined that the texas misappropriation law is specially designed to protect the sweat equity that goes into creating a work.alcatel usa,dgi,cir.it appears from the evidence presented at trial that expended substantial time and expense towards the trax project.as stephen carr,an expert witness,testified,came up with the plan to do the product,the specifications for the product,and that where the essence of a product is,in the work,in the contribution of.based on this court previous interpretation of what is protected under state misappropriation law and the evidence elicited at trial,it appears clear that a final product is not required before it can be misappropriated,and therefore,apix first argument fails.
second,apix argues that it never made a product using features planned on using in the trax product.apix again bases its argument,in part,on the premise that it could not have used features from the trax product because the trax features were unfinished at the time of trial.however,there is evidence that apix planned to use the trax technology to create a competing control product to be sold through virtual automation.specifically,exhibits presented at trial demonstrated the similarities between the trax product and virtual automation product materials,including the manner in which the products were marketed.in addition,expert testimony revealed that the differences between the and apix control products were only superficial.as such,there was sufficient evidence presented at trial supporting the jury conclusion that apix used technology features associated with the trax product in its own control system products.
third,apix claims it never sold its own product,and therefore,it did not use it in competition with.currently,there are no published cases interpreting the term use as that term is applied in the texas common law definition of misappropriation.however,there is an analogous argument that the term use,as defined in the common law tort of misappropriation,includes activities other than the actual selling of the product.for example,in forscan dresser,dist,writ denied,a case involving the misappropriation of trade secrets with facts resembling those present here,the defendant made an argument similar to apix,specifically arguing that it had not made commercial use of the misappropriated information however,the texas court of appeals rejected this argument,finding that the defendant attempts to market the product satisfied the commercial use requirement 
in this case,there was testimony that mezzatesta and apix were already taking orders for sales of the clone product even before mezzatesta resigned from.in addition,evidence proffered at trial revealed that apix and mezzatesta were prepared to give away the product to gain the competitive advantage of entering the new control market before.it is undisputed that apix was actively marketing its competing product at least six months before trial.therefore,based on apix marketing activities and the fact that it was already taking product orders,we find that apix did in fact use the trax technology.
in its fourth argument,apix claims that it simply planned to combine its own hardware with publicly available software that neither made nor plans to use in the future.however,as discussed previously,the evidence presented at trial indicated that,not apix,was responsible for coming up with the idea for the control system,investing the time,labor,skill,and money to design the specifications,modify the existing hardware and software components,and conduct the alpha testing of the product.
in sum,there is sufficient evidence to affirm the district court order denying apix motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on misappropriation claim.
ii.whether the district court erred in denying chris tsipouras motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on fraud claim.
on appeal,tsipouras contends that failed to produce evidence supporting its claim that tsipouras intended to allow virtual automation to sell apix hardware in competition with.tsipouras argues that in its contract with virtual automation,apix expressly prohibited virtual automation from selling the hardware in area of application,and therefore,can not be liable for fraud.responds by pointing to the fact that on the same day tsipouras signed the contract with giving rights to sell the hardware worldwide and exclusive rights to sell the hardware in area of application,tsipouras also signed a distributorship agreement with virtual automation giving virtual automation exclusive worldwide rights to distribute the same hardware,including in area of application.
based on a review of the two contracts,they can not be reconciled.although tsipouras claims to have prohibited virtual automation from selling hardware in area of application,the relevant contract provision expressly states that virtual automation shall not sell to,it sic subsidiaries and affiliates in the area of application.emphasis added.therefore,virtual automation still appears to have the right to compete with in its area of application as long as virtual automation sells to buyers other than.this right conflicts with the exclusive right granted by tsipouras on behalf of apix to.
based on the fact that the contract between and apix directly conflicts with the distributorship agreement between virtual automation and apix,and that both contracts were signed by tsipouras on behalf of apix on the same day,the evidence is sufficient to support the district court denial of tsipouras motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on fraud claim.
iii.whether the district court erred both in allowing expert to testify on lost profits and in denying apix and tsipouras motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of lost profits.
apix and tsipouras argue that the district court erred in allowing the testimony of two witnesses called by in support of its lost profits damage.meherwan boyce,called as an industry expert,and thomas jollay,an accountant.at trial,boyce estimated the market penetration that trax product would have had,and jollay opined that,based on boyce estimate,suffered lost profits in the amount of million.apix and tsipouras contend that under daubert merrell dow,d,the district court improperly admitted boyce testimony as scientific knowledge.apix and tsipouras address in detail the daubert factors,arguing that boyce estimates should be excluded.
in response,insists that the lost profits analysis is irrelevant because it had no impact on the judgment.argues that the jury rejected the lost profits analysis and instead only awarded its million development costs.in addition,asserts that a daubert challenge can not support reversal because,at most,admission of the testimony at issue would amount to harmless error.
the district court determination of admissibility of expert evidence under daubert is reviewed for abuse of discretion.martin mobil exploration producing,cir citing moore ashland,cir en banc.erroneous admission of expert testimony is subject to a harmless error analysis.martin,at united states matthews,cir.moreover,pursuant to,this court is bound to disregard any errors,including the admission of expert testimony,that do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.bell swift,cir.the burden of proving substantial error and prejudice is upon the appellant.id.
even if the district court erred in allowing witnesses to testify concerning lost profits,this testimony had little or no effect on the jury verdict.the jury awarded only its million development costs and divided that amount among three defendants against mezzatesta,against tsipouras,and against apix.testimony at trial revealed that development costs and claim for lost profits were distinct and separable from one another.in addition,the jury charge specifically makes a distinction between compensatory damages and lost profits.the jury appears to have taken into account the testimony of boyce and jollay,evaluated the validity of the lost profits analysis,and subsequently rejected that analysis.therefore,because the jury did not award any of its lost profits claim,even if the district court erred in admitting the lost profits testimony,such error would be harmless.
iv.whether the evidence at trial conclusively established that apix incurred in damages in addition to the awarded by the jury for breach of its contract with apix.
the jury found that breached its contract with apix by retaining certain hardware components provided by apix without remitting payment.apix claims that although the jury correctly determined that breached its contract with apix and awarded apix for failing to pay apix for the hardware received,the contract also imposed minimum purchase obligations on specifically,apix argues that at the time of trial failed to purchase of apix hardware as required by the contract.apix asserts that it invested to upgrade its manufacturing capabilities so that it could produce the quantities agreed to purchase.in addition,apix maintains that by focusing on its contract with and giving up on other business opportunities,it was severely damaged.
insists that the minimum purchase provisions in its contract with apix were not intended to go into effect until the trax product was complete.paul fairbanks,the manager of control system operations,also testified that minimum purchase obligations were directly tied to exclusive right to purchase,use,and sell apix hardware in area of application.in other words,according to,to maintain its exclusive right granted by apix,had to purchase the minimum quantities as set forth in the contract 
in the absence of an error of law,this court reviews the district court award for damages for clear error only.in re liljeberg,cir.if the award of damages is plausible in light of the record,a reviewing court should not reverse the award even if it might have come to a different conclusion.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found that breached its contract with apix.in awarding damages,however,the jury determined that was only liable to apix for,the value of the apix hardware that received but did not pay for.as for minimum purchase obligations,the jury instructions specifically inquired as to the amount of money,if any,that would fairly and reasonably compensate apix for its damages,if any,that were proximately caused by failure,if any,to meet its minimum purchase obligations under the contract.the jury answered this question by awarding apix nothing.
apix fails to provide this court with any compelling reason to overturn the jury damage award for breach.additionally,given that the jury also found that tsipouras,an apix officer,was liable for defrauding on the same contract,the determination that apix should not benefit under the minimum purchase obligation provision is certainly appropriate.thus,the minimum purchase obligation damage award,or lack thereof,was not clear error.
whether the district court erred in denying mezzatesta motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on fraud and contract claims.
mezzatesta argues that produced no evidence that his alleged fraud or breach of contract caused injury,damage.mezzatesta recognizes that alleged two different types of damages at profits and lost investment.mezzatesta contends that both of these damage theories were premised on claim that mezzatesta used virtual automation to clone the trax product.he argues,however,that because the evidence at trial established that virtual automation never made a product,never suffered damages,and therefore,its fraud and breach of contract claims fail as a matter of law.
among the essential elements of fraud is a showing of injury suffered because of the fraud.c c partners sun exploration prod,writ denied.the absence of this element will prevent recovery for fraud.id.the measure of damages in a fraud case is the actual amount of the plaintiff loss that directly or proximately results from the defendant fraudulent conduct.tilton marshall.the desired end is actual compensation for the injury,not lost profits.c c partners,at.
based on evidence presented at trial,determined that its trax product was going to be preempted in the new controls market by mezzatesta product by at least six to eight weeks.therefore,because this preemption would effectively cause to lose its profitability,it abandoned the trax project,incurring investment costs up to that time.alternatively,presented evidence that it would have suffered damages even if it had attempted to continue with the trax project.specifically,there was evidence that had tried but was unable to locate suitable substitute hardware from a new vendor.also established that it had budgeted neither the funds nor the time to start the trax project over with a new hardware supplier.therefore,although mezzatesta and virtual automation did not ultimately complete and sell an end product that they could have placed in direct competition with,the evidence supports the jury conclusion that mezzatesta fraudulent acts caused to prematurely withdraw from the market,thereby suffering the loss of its investment costs.
breach of contract 
mezzatesta also argues that this court should reverse the district court denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on breach of contract claim.again,the sole basis for mezzatesta appeal on the breach of contract issue is his contention that did not suffer injury.the jury found that mezzatesta breached his fiduciary obligations imposed by his employment contract with by using virtual automation as a vehicle to clone trax product.as part of his employment agreement with,mezzatesta assigned all rights to any inventions or designs that he made,conceived or created,either solely or jointly with others that related to business directly or indirectly,or that were developed using materials or facilities.in addition,mezzatesta agreed to keep secret and confidential confidential information,both during his employment and afterward.
mezzatesta also signed a code of conduct whereby he acknowledged that he was required to protect confidential and trade secret information.pursuant to the code of conduct,he agreed to avoid situations in which his personal interests conflicted with those of,including holding an interest in any company that might become either a competitor or a supplier of.
the damages suffered by as a result of mezzatesta breach of contract are similar in nature to the damages suffered because of mezzatesta fraud.we find that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to make a reasonable determination of damages as a result of mezzatesta breach of contract,and we conclude that the jury award is not clearly erroneous 
vi.whether the district court erred in denying dresser rand motion for judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim against apix.
at the close of apix and before the case went to the jury,counsel for orally moved for judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim against apix,which the district court immediately denied.the issue went before the jury,which ultimately determined that apix did not breach its contract with.on its,cites two reasons in support of its contention that apix breached its contract when it assigned distributorship responsibilities to virtual automation.first,maintains that its contract with apix clearly prohibits apix from appointing a third party,such as virtual automation,to act as a distributor within area of application.second,argues that the plain language of the contract expressly precludes apix grant to virtual automation of the exclu
