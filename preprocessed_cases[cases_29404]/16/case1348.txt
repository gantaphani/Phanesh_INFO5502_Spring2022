the parties eventually agreed to the appointment of james constable,a lawyer in baltimore,maryland,as arbitrator.the discovery process was contentious and,throughout the prehearing process,dataquick had difficulty determining its damages because refused to turn over relevant documents detailing the underlying transactions.the arbitrator eventually issued an april,order requiring to disclose documents that would be sufficient for the arbitrator and dataquick to determine,with a substantial degree of certainty,the number of transactions involving resale distribution of dataquick data.the arbitrator also informed that a negative inference might be drawn if withheld documents that should have been disclosed.
on april,wrote to dataquick stating that it was withdrawing its claim from the arbitration effective immediately.notwithstanding this representation,no formal withdrawal request was sent to the arbitrator.during a conference call with the arbitrator on april,however,orally requested permission to withdraw its claim.the arbitrator explained to that it could withdraw its claim but that its withdrawal would not end the arbitration of dataquick counterclaim.id.at.the arbitrator then suggested that remain in the case so as not to jeopardize its position.id.after this conference call,made repeated attempts to delay the proceedings,including requesting a california state court to enjoin the arbitration proceedings,failing to timely disclose witness lists and exhibits,and moving to disqualify the arbitrator.during a prehearing conference call on may,counsel again asserted that was withdrawing from the proceedings.the arbitrator explained that had a right to withdraw,but that the arbitration proceedings would continue as to dataquick claims.counsel then summarily withdrew from the conference call.
on may,the arbitration hearing commenced in baltimore.after dataquick gave its opening statement,in which it stated its intention to use the testimony of scott steele the owner of from a prior trial in maryland to prove dataquick damages,steele,who was present,ordered his counsel to immediately leave the hearing.during the exchange that followed,the arbitrator strongly encouraged to stay and participate in the arbitration proceedings.he also explained that the proceedings would continue without and,absent its participation,he might not be able to fully understand any defenses may have against dataquick claims.steele and his counsel then left the arbitration hearing with their exhibits and witnesses.
the arbitration hearing proceeded,and dataquick submitted over exhibits and five witnesses during the course of the proceeding.all of the exhibits used by dataquick were documents had disclosed during discovery.dataquick also used steele testimony and expert testimony from a prior case litigated in a maryland state court,styled steele software systems first union national bank first union.in that matter,had sued first union national bank first union on a breach of contract claim.alleged therein that first union had failed to use the system as frequently as required in their contract.during trial of that dispute,relied on evidence regarding the total transactions that it had the capability of performing for first union from january through december.based on the evidence,the jury awarded a verdict of more than million against first union.

on august,the arbitrator issued the award,which underlies the district court proceedings and this appeal.in devising the award,the arbitrator found that had breached the agreement and that steele had deliberately misled dataquick into believing that had never achieved the amount of monthly sales necessary to trigger a per transaction calculation of fees.the arbitrator also drew a negative inference against because of its efforts to withhold information from him and dataquick.he then determined,a fter reviewing the evidence,including exhibits and testimony and the record of the first union case,that the number of fee generating transactions would result in fees of at least per month from july,through december,per month for,per month for,per month for,per month for,per month for and per month for.as a result,the arbitrator,after making deductions for fees previously paid by,awarded dataquick the sum of,plus prejudgment interest of,on its breach of contract claim against.
the arbitrator also found that had been unjustly enriched by the jury verdict in favor of in the first union trial.although received its award of damages in that case on the basis of projected transactions with first union,the arbitrator found that these transactions would have used dataquick database.the arbitrator concluded that because had been paid for a product for which dataquick would have been entitled to a transactional fee,dataquick was entitled to be compensated for those transactions under the theory of unjust enrichment.he therefore awarded dataquick ten percent of first union jury verdict,minus some reductions,for an additional sum of.the arbitrator then awarded dataquick additional unjust enrichment damages of for improper use of dataquick database after the agreement had been terminated.thus,dataquick was awarded a total of from,plus attorney fees and costs of arbitration.

judicial review of an arbitration award in federal court is substantially circumscribed.patten signator ins.agency,cir.in fact,the scope of judicial review for an arbitrator decision is among the narrowest known at law because to allow full scrutiny of such awards would frustrate the purpose of having arbitration at quick resolution of disputes and the avoidance of the expense and delay associated with litigation.apex plumbing supply,supply,cir.indeed,as we have emphasized,in reviewing such an award,a district or appellate court is limited to determine whether the arbitrators did the job they were told to whether they did it well,or correctly,or reasonably,but simply whether they did it.remmey painewebber,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing on appeal a district court denial of a motion to vacate an arbitration award,we review de novo the court legal rulings.patten,at.any factual findings made by the district court in affirming such an award are reviewed for clear error.peoples sec.life ins.monumental life ins,cir.
in order for a reviewing court to vacate an arbitration award,the moving party must sustain the heavy burden of showing one of the grounds specified in the federal arbitration act or one of certain limited common law grounds.patten signator ins.agency,cir.the federal arbitration act provides that a court may only vacate an arbitration award on one of the following grounds 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.the permissible common law grounds for vacating such an award include those circumstances where an award fails to draw its essence from the contract,or the award evidences a manifest disregard of the law.patten,at.
contends in this appeal that the district court should have vacated the award to dataquick under several of the permissible statutory or common law bases.specifically,asserts that a portion of the award was not drawn from the essence of the agreement,the arbitrator manifestly disregarded relevant law,the award was procured by undue means,the arbitrator was partial,the award was procured by arbitrator misconduct,and the arbitrator exceeded his power in making the award.we address each of contentions in turn 
first,contends that the portion of the award predicted on the first union jury verdict should be vacated because it can not be rationally derived from the agreement.as we have recognized,an arbitration award can be vacated by a district court if it fails to draw its essence from the agreement.patten,at.such a circumstance can arise when an arbitrator has disregarded or modified unambiguous contract provisions or based an award upon his own personal notions of right and wrong.see id.an arbitration award,however,does not fail to draw its essence from the agreement merely because a court concluded that an arbitrator has misread the contract.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also postal serv.am.postal workers union,cir a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.internal quotation marks omitted.
asserts that the first union aspect of the award was not drawn from the essence of the agreement because it contradicts the clear language thereof.in so doing,relies on two provisions of the agreement.first,it contends that this portion of the award contradicts the clear language of the agreement because the arbitrator awarded damages based upon constructive sales,when the agreement provides that was to pay dataquick only when actually accessed and billed dataquick data.see agreement.on this point,however,ignores the agreement explicit provision that can not commercially exploit dataquick database.see id.as found by the arbitrator,without dataquick data,would not have been able to offer its services to first union and thus would not have prevailed against first union on its breach of contract claim.given that claimed ownership of dataquick data during the first union litigation,the related unjust enrichment damages were justifiably drawn from the provision of the agreement that prohibits commercial exploitation of dataquick data.
next,contends that the unjust enrichment aspect of the award contradicts the clear language of the agreement because it limits the types of damages dataquick can recover.specifically,the agreement provides that i n no event,shall either party be liable for any indirect,incidental or consequential damages,including,but not limited to,lost income or lost revenue.agreement.para
