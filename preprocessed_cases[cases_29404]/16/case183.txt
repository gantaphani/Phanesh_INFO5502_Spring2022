this case involves a clash between two federal entities and two different important values.the national labor relations act nlra a,a,imposes on the united states postal service usps the duty to bargain collectively,which includes the obligation to furnish relevant information to a labor union for purposes of collective bargaining.nlrb acme indus.the privacy act,b,meanwhile,imposes on usps the obligation to protect the privacy of its employees personal information unless they consent to disclosure.
the national labor relations board found that usps committed an unfair labor practice under section a and a by refusing to provide the national postal mailhandlers union,local,with the personal aptitude test scores of usps employees unless the union first obtained their consent.both sides agree that the test scores are relevant to the union for collective bargaining purposes and could be disclosed with appropriate employee consent.
the board unfair labor practice finding,on which it seeks enforcement,rests on its reasoning that no privacy interests are at stake in this case and so no balancing of interests was required as between the union interest in the information and the employees interest in privacy.usps argues that its employees have a substantial privacy interest in their test scores,recognized under federal law.
we vacate and remand the board decision,and hold that the usps employees have a legitimate and substantial privacy interest in their test scores and that the board,accordingly,is required to engage in the balancing of interests omitted from its original analysis.
usps requires all applicants for its mail handler position to take psychological aptitude test,test.this test has been developed by usps own industrial psychologists and has proven an effective way of measuring usps applicants job performance potential in certain job practice areas.test is designed to measure the test taker cognitive skills and general mental ability,as well as his or her personal characteristics,as they relate to conscientiousness,interpersonal skills,professional service orientation,and dealing with work pressures and demands.
passing scores on test range from to points.once the test is scored,an applicant who is eligible for them may receive an additional five to ten points as a veteran preference.the combined test score and veteran preference if any are added to reach the applicant final rating.after calculating each applicant final rating,usps places each applicant name,date of birth,standing,exam date,applicable veteran points,basic test score,and final combined rating onto the official usps hiring register for the year in question.
in,usps announced job openings for mail handler positions in the caribbean district,including several openings in the san juan office in puerto rico.some applicants subsequently took test of these passed and were placed on usps hiring register.under standard usps procedure,human resources considered the three applicants for each job opening in the district.the san juan post office hired new employees from these applicants.
the national postal mailhandlers union,local,represents postal service workers and is the exclusive bargaining agent for mail handlers in the caribbean district.under usps regulations,and the current agreement between usps and local,usps must compute its new employees seniority rankings under properly established past principles,rules and instructions.after successfully completing a day trial period,new employees are assigned a seniority rank,which corresponds to their first day of work.
sometime after the san juan office assigned seniority rankings to its group of new employees,several members of this group who were veterans approached the president of local with an unfair employment complaint.they raised their concern that within the group of new employees,employees had begun work earlier and thus received higher seniority rankings than veteran employees,despite the fact that the veteran employees had applied for their positions earlier than had the employees.in response to this complaint,the president of local requested from usps the hiring register,as well as the register information for the group of new employees 
because the usps hiring register identifies applicants test scores as well as other personal information,its contents are kept strictly confidential by usps pursuant to the federal privacy act.see.under the privacy act,any information contained within a federal agency system of records may not be disclosed by any means of communication,to any person or entity except upon prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains,or unless the disclosure falls within one of several enumerated exceptions.b.of these,the privacy act routine use exception permits disclosure of a record for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.b,a.
this exception is limited,however,by the requirement that agencies define specific routine uses and publish these,subject to notice and comment,in the federal register in advance of invoking them.e.
usps has published a list of eleven routine uses,under which usps employee records may be disclosed.privacy act of,system of records.included in this list is a qualified exception for disclosure to labor organizations,a s required by applicable law when needed by that organization to perform its duties as the collective bargaining representative of the usps employees in an appropriate bargaining unit.id.
under these regulations,and due to its concerns about the privacy of its applicants and employees,usps elected not to provide local with the requested information.usps offered to release the information contained in the register with respect to any individual from whom local obtained consent.
local rejected this offer,as well as usps offer to supply a redacted version of the register,and filed an unfair labor practice charge under section a and a of the nlra.the administrative law judge found in favor of local,and ordered usps to furnish the union with the complete hiring register.postal,case ca,wl alj.
the national labor relations board affirmed the judgment and a portion of the administrative law judge order,on different grounds,but narrowed the order,directing usps to furnish the union with the register information for only the applicants usps actually hired.postal,wl.
usps argued before the administrative law judge and the board that federal law permitted it to condition disclosure of employee test scores on employee consent.it argued that the privacy act routine use exception allows disclosure pursuant to the nlra only where required by law.because the supreme court held in detroit edison nlrb,that the nlra does not require unconditional disclosure of psychological aptitude test scores,usps argued that it was not obligated to release employee test scores unconditionally under the routine use exception.
the board rejected this argument on the grounds that the underlying confidentiality interest raised by usps failed.the board distinguished detroit edison on the grounds that the employer in that case had made an express promise of confidentiality to its employees.it reasoned that usps,quite the opposite from promising employees that it would keep their test scores confidential,provided employees with several privacy act notices warning them that their scores could be released to a labor union when needed by the union for collective bargaining.postal,wl,at.the employees,the board found,thus had had no legitimate expectation that their test results would remain confidential.id.
the board reasoned that employees must receive an explicit promise of confidentiality in their scores from their employer to acquire an expectation of privacy.id.as a result,the board did not engage in any further balancing of the interests or address whether consent was a reasonable condition of disclosure.id.
because the ultimate issue is one of proper interpretation of a supreme court opinion,our review is de novo.with regard to the board interpretation of detroit edison,a court of appeals is not obligated to defer to an agency interpretation of supreme
