plaintiff goodrich goodrich appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendant united states filter filter upon for summary judgment in a diversity action for breach of a stock purchase agreement governed by new york law.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand for trial.
this case concerns competing interpretations of a single provision of a stock purchase agreement the agreement.goodrich and filter entered into the agreement on february.pursuant to the agreement,goodrich conveyed to filter of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of arrowhead industrial water,arrowhead or aiw,then a goodrich subsidiary.section g of the agreement provides that 
buyer filter covenants to compensate seller goodrich for any income tax paid by seller with respect to income accrued and included in seller taxable income,but not paid to seller prior to closing 
after the closing,goodrich demanded reimbursement of certain tax payments from filter,pursuant to section of the agreement,and filter refused.this simple description,however,belies a much more complex chain of events.
both goodrich and filter had experience in negotiating similar transactions when they entered into negotiations regarding the agreement.goodrich drafted section g of the agreement.although four versions of the agreement were drafted,filter representatives never discussed or proposed any modification to section g and it remained unchanged throughout the course of negotiations over the agreement.
both goodrich principal negotiator,steven esakov,and its principal tax advisor,george sherwood,testified that section g was intended to deal with the problem of taxes on accrued but unpaid income,such as receivables.the agreement called for the buyer to acquire arrowhead on a basis.thus,any cash received by arrowhead after the closing would belong to the.both arrowhead and goodrich were consolidated,accrual taxpayers at the time of the sale,however.as a result,goodrich included any income accrued by arrowhead prior to closing in goodrich consolidated tax returns,even though goodrich would never receive the cash pertaining to that accrued income since it would be received by arrowhead after filter purchase of arrowhead.therefore,goodrich claims it included section g in the agreement because,according to sherwood,it was fair to ask filter to pay the taxes that came as a result of income that goodrich had accrued as part of its consolidated tax returns but for which it had not received cash.goodrich included the section in the agreement after such a provision had been proposed by the seller in another agreement in which goodrich was the buyer.goodrich assumed that filter understood goodrich interpretation of section g and anticipated some discussion of the section during negotiations or questions from filter if filter did not understand the provision.
the transaction closed on april.after closing,an issue remained concerning a purchase price adjustment,resulting in implementation of an audit process.the issue was resolved over the course of nine months and with four amendments to the agreement.section g was not discussed by the parties during this process.
in,goodrich was in the process of finalizing its tax returns for including tax returns for arrowhead,a member of its consolidated group for the first part of.on july,sherwood,goodrich vice president of tax administration,informed kevin spence,filter vice president and chief financial officer,that in accordance with section g of the agreement,filter was required to compensate goodrich for any income tax paid by seller with respect to income accrued and included in seller taxable income,but not paid to seller prior to closing.the letter estimated that filter owed goodrich million on account of tax on accrued but uncollected income at april,the accounts receivable.
on october,sherwood sent a second letter to spence.this time goodrich included an invoice representing the billing for the federal and state income tax paid by goodrich.goodrich claimed that such income accrued amounted to roughly million dollars in arrowhead accounts receivable that goodrich included in its gross income from,resulting in payment of in income tax.
filter returned correspondence denying that it owed any money to goodrich pursuant to section g of the agreement.filter interprets section g as pertaining not to accounts receivable,but to money that arrowhead owed goodrich for services rendered prior to closing of the sale.the first time filter offered this interpretation of section g was during spence deposition in this case.the interpretation was not raised in filter letters responding to goodrich correspondence or in filter answer to the complaint,all of which stated other reasons for filter refusal to pay.
the term accounts receivable is not included in section g and was never used by goodrich as a term in the drafting of section g.in addition,section g does not mention arrowhead.other sections of the agreement placed tax obligations on goodrich,in particular,section a and section b i.goodrich sherwood asserted that section g was a carve out from goodrich retention of all tax liabilities,but filter notes that no language was used in section g,or in any of the other relevant sections concerning tax liabilities.
filter maintains that goodrich own records showed that arrowhead had operated at a loss and generated no taxable income,but nevertheless goodrich demanded an amount equal to roughly of goodrich entire corporate tax payment,claiming that it paid this amount as income taxes solely on the accounts receivable income from arrowhead.
goodrich filed its complaint on december.on february,a case management plan was entered,placing the case on an expedited track with discovery to be completed by may.counsel were directed to confer and prepare written stipulations as to uncontested facts to be considered on for summary judgment.if the case could not be brought to a prompt conclusion on summary judgment a trial was to be conducted.
the parties submitted a joint statement of undisputed material facts the joint statement.the joint statement was divided into two parts one highlighting facts in filter favor and the other highlighting facts in goodrich favor.the parties stated that they had different views as to which undisputed facts are material.in addition,the parties planned for the possibility that summary judgment might be denied,noting that supplementation of the joint statement might be required for purposes of trial.on the basis of the joint statement,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.on january,the district court permitted both parties to supplement the record.on april,the parties conducted the deposition of george sherwood,goodrich vice president of tax administration,and filed supplemental memoranda in support of their for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted filter motion for summary judgment and denied goodrich.
in granting filter summary judgment motion,the district court relied on two independent bases for its decision.first,the court found that,as a matter of contract interpretation,section g could not have the meaning urged by goodrich when considered in the context of the contract as a whole.specifically,the court noted that goodrich retains all tax liability under section b of the agreement and that section g does not refer to accounts receivable and does not use language.the court also noted that language was used in other portions of the agreement.second,the court found that goodrich did not offer proof that it actually paid income taxes on arrowhead accounts receivable.the district court found that arrowhead operated at a loss during the first quarter of,that it had no taxable or net income during the period,and that arrowhead loss resulted in a tax credit for goodrich.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard employed by the district court.see national enterprises,smith,cir citing moore philip morris,cir kraus sobel corrugated containers,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,this court views the factual evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see national enterprises,at.to prevail,the must show sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.see klepper first am.bank,cir citing celotex catrett,d.a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the.id.at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
the standard of review poses unique issues in this case because the parties filed for summary judgment.goodrich argues that the district court misapplied the summary judgment standard in granting filter motion for summary judgment.before addressing the merits of the case,we will discuss the issues presented by goodrich regarding the district court application of the summary judgment standard.these issues shed light on the proper analysis a court should apply when faced with for summary judgment in a case relating to a contract dispute.
on appeal,goodrich submits only that it was improper for the district court to grant filter motion,not that the district court should have granted goodrich.goodrich argues that the district court decision should be reversed and that the dispute should be submitted to a jury on the basis that there are genuine issues of material fact.
we have held that t he fact that both parties make motions for summary judgment does not require the court to rule that no fact issue exists.begnaud white,cir cited with approval in cherokee ins.blanch,cir.in taft broadcasting united states,cir,this court reversed an order granting summary judgment on for summary judgment and a stipulated factual record.the court noted that,on for summary judgment,the court must evaluate each party motion on its own merits,taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.id.at.differentiating between for summary judgment and a trial on a stipulated record,the court stated that the filing of for summary judgment does not necessarily mean that the court is free to treat the case as if it was submitted for final resolution on a stipulated record.ibid.the court denied both motions for summary judgment,determining that it was possible to draw inferences in either direction.ibid.
goodrich argues that the district court improperly weighed the interpretations of the agreement offered by goodrich and filter and chose one over the other,rather than applying the summary judgment standard to each interpretation to determine if,under either interpretation,no genuine issues of material fact existed.specifically,goodrich takes issue with the district court statements that goodrich and filter agree that summary judgment is appropriate and goodrich has carried its burden of proving their interpretation of the agreement.we will address goodrich arguments regarding each of these statements in turn.
with regard to the first issue,goodrich contends that,contrary to the district court statement,it did not agree that summary judgment was necessarily appropriate.goodrich notes that the joint statement of undisputed material facts recognized that the parties disagreed as to what undisputed facts were material and indicated that a trial might be required to resolve the case.filter points out,however,that there were no facts in dispute and that all the facts were undisputed by stipulation.filter argues that genuine issues of material fact can not be created simply on the basis that the parties may disagree as to which undisputed facts are material.
goodrich arguments are more persuasive.it was not necessary for the district court to resolve the case at summary judgment solely because the parties filed for summary judgment and presented a joint statement of undisputed material facts.when parties file for summary judgment,the making of such inherently contradictory claims does not constitute an agreement that if one is rejected the other is necessarily justified or that the losing party waives judicial consideration and determination whether genuine issues of material fact exist.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.a trial court may conclude,when reviewing the undisputed material facts agreed upon by the parties and drawing all inferences,in turn,for the party,that a genuine issue exists as to those material facts,in which case the court is not permitted to resolve the matter,but rather,must allow the case to proceed to trial.see itco michelin tire,commercial,cir the district court in this case could have ruled,as it did,that one party sufficiently demonstrated that no genuine issue of material fact existed.the court also could have ruled,however,that neither party met its burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact existed when all inferences were drawn,in turn,for the party,such that it would be proper for the case to go to trial.therefore,summary judgment was not necessarily appropriate solely because the parties filed for summary judgment 
goodrich second argument is based on the district court statement that goodrich has carried its burden of proving their interpretation of the statement.goodrich characterizes this case as relating to a dispute regarding contractual intent.the district court statement and filter arguments on appeal characterize the case as a dispute regarding contractual interpretation.
both sixth circuit and new york case law indicate that disputed issues of contractual intent are factual issues not to be resolved at summary judgment.see united states,cir reversing summary judgment order and stating that issues regarding parties intent,with respect to agreements or contracts,present interpretative issues traditionally understood to be for the trier of fact terry barr sales agency,cir reversing summary judgment order in re riconda,for summary judgment denied where intent bearing on the contested provision was at issue superintendent of ins.harbour assurance,for summary judgment denied,and matter remanded for hearing,where trial court should have accepted extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intent.
goodrich argues that it was improper for the district court to resolve the case at summary judgment because sufficient evidence was presented demonstrating the difference in the contractual intent of the parties.this court has held that when the probative weight and effect of testimony and documentary evidence concerning the intent of the parties is at issue,the case is unsuitable for summary judgment.terry barr sales,at.goodrich argues that,instead of declaring the case unsuited for summary judgment,the district court improperly weighed the evidence and made credibility determinations by ruling that goodrich did not carr y its burden and that goodrich interpretation of section g was strained and tenuous.see ingram city of columbus,cir reversing summary judgment order in favor of defendants in suit and holding that where there is evidence favoring both sides neither the district court nor this court may make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence talley bravo pitino restaurant,cir reversing summary judgment order in favor of employer in employment discrimination action and stating,the role of the judge at the summary judgment stage is not to weigh the evidence.
filter responds by arguing that genuine issues of material fact do not exist simply because opposing litigants argue for different interpretations of the same contractual provision.see tennessee consol.coal united mine workers of,cir difference in interpretation of contract terms by two parties does not render summary judgment inappropriate aviation dev,plc c s acquisition,civ.ajp,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,assertion by one party that it interprets contract language differently does not create triable issue of fact.
the arguments presented by goodrich and filter are both correct and frame our task in analyzing this case on appeal.while goodrich correctly notes that disputed issues of contractual intent have survived for summary judgment on the basis that they are questions of fact,filter correctly points out that disputed issues of contractual interpretation can be resolved at summary judgment on the basis that they are questions of law.we must determine then,as we consider the merits of this case,whether the parties dispute over section g of the agreement is an issue of contractual intent or an issue of contractual interpretation.
the first basis upon which the district court rested its judgment for filter was the parties interpretation of section g of the agreement.although the court stated that section g is unclear and ambiguous,the district court ruled that the issue was one of contractual interpretation,instead of intent,and that filter should prevail because goodrich could not support its interpretation of section g as a matter of law.the court stated that,while goodrich interpretation of section g is plausible,the clause itself is vague and unclear.the court determined that while section g may be ambiguous when read on its own,it is not ambiguous when read in the context of the entire contract.
we disagree.the language of the agreement is ambiguous as to the meaning of section g both in the context of the section itself and the agreement as a whole.as a result,it was improper for the district court to rule in favor of filter as a matter of law on the basis that goodrich could not support its interpretation of the agreement.the contractual language supports both parties arguments as to the interpretation of section g.therefore,the trial court should have considered the intent of the parties,looking to extrinsic evidence as a means of assisting it in determining the parties intent.our review of the evidence presented indicates that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to what the parties intended by including section g in the agreement.
first,we will discuss the applicable new york law.second,we will explain why it was improper for the district court to rule in favor of filter as a matter of law on the basis of contractual interpretation.third,we will examine the evidence presented by the parties as to contractual intent.
in space imaging europe,space imaging,d,the court outlined the proper analysis for a contract dispute under new york law.first,the court must decide whether the contract is ambiguous.id.at.a contractual provision is ambiguous whenever it admits of more than one interpretation when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in a particular trade or business.id.at citations omitted.a contract is not considered ambiguous when the language has a definite and precise meaning,unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself,and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.ibid.citations omitted.
if a court determines that language of a contract is ambiguous,external evidence of the parties intent is admissible.in assessing issues of contract construction,a court is to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties as revealed by the language they chose to use.ibid.citations omitted.summary judgment is permissible when the language of the contractual provision at issue is unambiguous.ibid.summary judgment also is permissible when the contractual language is ambiguous but the extrinsic evidence creates no genuine issue of material fact and permits interpretation of the agreement as a matter of law.ibid.citations omitted.
the district court granted filter motion for summary judgment on the basis that goodrich could not support its interpretation of section g as requiring filter to reimburse goodrich for goodrich tax liability on accrued income,such as accounts receivable,that would not be received by arrowhead until after closing.the court determined that while section g may be ambiguous when considered on its own,it is not ambiguous when considered in light of the entire agreement.the district court reasoning is faulty on a number of grounds.
first,the district court noted that under new york law,when a court is presented with two conflicting interpretations of a clause in a contract it should look to find an interpretation that gives meaning to all terms of the contract and leaves no clause without meaning.see galli metz,cir.the district court noted that when section g is read in light of the entire agreement,it conflicts with section b,which states that goodrich has maintained all tax liability.yet,by claiming that section b addresses the issue of all tax liability,the district court essentially renders section g meaningless,yielding the result that the district court purportedly intended to avoid.
filter interpretation of section g does not sufficiently resolve this question either.filter interprets section g as pertaining to reimbursement of goodrich for income taxes paid by goodrich for services rendered by goodrich to arrowhead before closing.yet,according to the district court ruling,filter interpretation would also be subsumed by section b,on the basis that goodrich has maintained all tax liability under that section.moreover,the district court ruling runs contrary to the interpretative principle that specific language prevails over general language in a contract.see tishman lipp,delta airlines,it is a familiar principle of legal construction that the specific provisions of a contract are to be given preference over the general provisions,and if there is a conflict between the two any reconciliation should give full effect to the more specific.bank of,kvaerner,i f there is an inconsistency between a general provision and a specific provision of a contract,the specific provision controls.
second,the district court stated that a lthough goodrich interpretation of section g is plausible,the clause itself is vague and unclear.the court noted that the agreement does not define income accrued nothing in the agreement would have notified filter that income accrued included accounts receivable and section g makes no reference to accounts receivable of arrowhead.these arguments only support the conclusion that section g is ambiguous and may lend itself to one or more meaning,for which external evidence as to the parties intent may appropriately be considered.the arguments do not support the proposition that filter should prevail as a matter of law.all inferences must be drawn in goodrich favor when considering filter summary judgment motion.the fact that goodrich interpretation of section g is plausible supports goodrich argument that the clause relates to filter reimbursing goodrich for goodrich tax liability relating to arrowhead accounts receivable.when all inferences are drawn in goodrich favor,the facts relied upon by the district court were not sufficient for the district court to have found in favor of filter at summary judgment.
third,the district court stated that the parties could have included language that is used in other portions of the agreement.goodrich argues,however,that sections g and b are physically and logically separated,so there was no need to include language carving out section g from section b.filter cites other sections that use language,suggesting that goodrich should have used such language in section g.goodrich responds that the sections cited by filter are linked by proximity and topic to other sections,making language appropriate in those cases.in addition,goodrich notes that there are other portions of the agreement in which the parties do not use language when they conceivably could or should have used such language.the lack of language in section g is not a sufficient basis for ruling in favor of filter.the lack of such language only supports the conclusion that section g is ambiguous.
finally,the district court relied on the doctrine of contractual interpretation that when choosing between two plausible interpretations of a contract,it is preferable to choose
