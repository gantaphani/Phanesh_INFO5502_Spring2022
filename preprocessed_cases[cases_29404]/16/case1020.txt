opinion of the court 
appellant karen cappuccio appeals an unfavorable jury verdict on her complaint under the truth in lending act tila,et,against appellee e trade for its failure to properly notify her of her right to cancel her home mortgage.cappuccio challenges various aspects of the jury instructions,including the district court directive that because her signature was on the notice of right to cancel,something more than just her testimony is needed to rebut the presumption that she received the notice.because we find no basis in tila or the federal rules of evidence for this portion of the instruction,and because we do not find the error to be harmless,we will vacate the verdict and remand for a new trial on her rescission claim.
background 
in,appellant karen cappuccio sought to refinance the mortgages on her home in hellertown,pennsylvania,while interest rates were low.she had two existing mortgages on her home a year loan and a year loan.cappuccio hoped to combine these two loans into a single mortgage with a lower monthly payment and interest rate,while receiving an additional to with which to make home improvements.later,at trial,cappuccio sought to introduce evidence that she had specifically sought a year mortgage in the amount of approximately,but was precluded from doing so by an evidentiary ruling of the district court.
while exploring the options for refinancing,cappuccio responded to an advertisement on the internet by providing information about her existing mortgages as well as the type of refinancing she was interested in obtaining.shortly thereafter,she received a phone call from an individual named kirk ayzenberg,who was a loan agent for a brokerage firm called prime capital funding llc prime capital.ayzenberg told cappuccio that he had received her information and could help her obtain the kind of loan she was interested in.shortly after,prime capital submitted a universal residential loan application on behalf of cappuccio to lender countrywide bank,na for both a year loan and a year loan.prime capital also submitted a loan application on behalf of cappuccio to lender first magnus financial first magnus for a year loan.cappuccio later testified that she did not want two separate mortgages on her home and that prime capital did not tell her that it was submitting applications for two different loans.
after receiving cappuccio loan application,countrywide generated a new application which resulted in an offer of a year adjustable,negative amortizing loan with a interest rate ceiling and an initial one month teaser rate of.countrywide did not inform cappuccio that it was not processing the original loan applications,nor that it was offering her a more complex and expensive mortgage.first magnus financial rejected the application it was sent by prime capital and instead it provided cappuccio with a year interest loan that included a balloon payment due at the time of the last loan payment.first magnus did not notify cappuccio of the differences between the loan it offered her and the loan for which she had applied.
the lenders,countrywide and first magnus,hired mak abstract as the title agent to close cappuccio loans.mak abstract then hired maureen krajczar,a notary in bethlehem,pennsylvania,to act as the closing agent.ayzenberg told cappuccio that she would meet with krajczar on the evening of november,at krajczar house,in order to go through all of the paperwork for the closing.cappuccio testified that she and krajczar sat at krajczar kitchen table,alone together,as krajczar passed cappuccio various documents one at a time,directed her attention to the signature page,asked cappuccio to sign,date here,sign,date here,sign,date here for each,before taking the documents away.app.cappuccio testified that the process felt rushed and very hasty,and that krajczar never explained any of the documents to her.she further testified that when she asked krajczar questions,krajczar stated that she had to remain neutral and therefore could not answer them.cappuccio acknowledged at trial that she signed a notice of right to cancel hereinafter a notice for each loan on the night of the closing,but testified that she did not understand what they meant or signified at the time she signed them.
the notices stated 
your right to cancel 
you are entering a transaction that will result in a mortgage,lien or security interest your home.you have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction,without cost,within three business days from whichever of the following events occurs last 
the date of the transaction,which is november,or 
the date you receive your truth in lending disclosures or 
the date you receive this notice of your right to cancel.
if you cancel by mail or telegram,you must send a notice no later than midnight of november,or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three events listed above.if you send or deliver your written notice to cancel some other way,it must be delivered to the above address no later than that time.
acknowledgment of receipt by signing below,i,the undersigned,hereby acknowledge that on the date listed above i received two completed copies of this notice of right to cancel in the form prescribed by law advising me of my right to cancel this transaction.
cappuccio testified that about minutes after she arrived,having completed all of the paperwork,she left krajczar house without any documents from the closing in her possession.krajczar could not recall any of the details of cappuccio closing,but testified that in accordance with her normal practices and countrywide policy,she is confident she would have given cappuccio the correct number of copies of the notices and truth in lending statement to take with her from the closing.krajczar also testified that,typically,a closing like cappuccio that involved two loans would take an hour and a half to two hours.
according to cappuccio,by november,when the loan proceeds were disbursed,she had not yet received copies of the notices or truth in lending statements.she testified that a ups package from mak abstract arrived the next day,november,containing a check,loan documents,a single copy of the notice,and a truth in lending statement for the countrywide loan.cappuccio observed that the terms of the loan listed were not what she expected.she also saw the bolded date,november,which she incorrectly read as the last day for her to rescind her loan.she therefore believed it was too late to cancel the loan.
cappuccio further testified that two copies of the notice and a truth in lending statement for the first magnus loan arrived in a ups package on november.she stated that an additional check came in a separate envelope.cappuccio again mistakenly believed that she could no longer rescind the loan because november had passed.in contrast,michael kuldiner,owner of mak abstract,testified that the two ups packages they sent to cappuccio each contained only one check,no notices or other loan documents,and that he has never sent loan documents to borrowers in the manner cappuccio described.
on august,cappuccio,through her counsel,sought to rescind both loans.countrywide and e trade bank,the assignee of the first magnus loan,both refused to honor her claimed rescission or make restitution.cappuccio then filed suit.
b.the trial 
cappuccio brought claims against the lenders,countrywide and first magnus,for damages,rescission,and injunctive relief under tila common law fraud statutory fraud under the pennsylvania unfair trade practices consumer protection law utpcpl,and violations of the adverse action notice requirement of the equal opportunity act eoa.cappuccio also brought claims for damages,rescission,and injunctive relief under tila against appellee e trade,the assignee,and homecoming financial llc,the servicer of the first magnus loan hereinafter jointly referred to as e trade finally,cappuccio brought claims for statutory fraud under the utpcpl against the title agent,mak abstract,the broker,prime capital,and the loan agent,kirk ayzenberg,as well as common law fraud against the latter two.
a jury trial was held in september.as to the fraud claims,the jury awarded cappuccio a verdict in the amount of against countrywide for common law fraud and statutory fraud under the utpcpl,as well as including in punitive damages for violations of the adverse action notice requirement of the eoa.cappuccio did not bring those same fraud claims against e trade because it was only the assignee of the loan,not the original lender.
as to the tila rescission claim,cappuccio sought to prove that she did not receive the notices of her right cancel at the closing,and further,that to the extent she did receive the notices in the mail after the closing,they were not clear and conspicuous because they listed the wrong final rescission date and because they were received only after the loan funds had been disbursed,thus triggering a extension of her right to rescind the mortgages.
to determine whether the district court erred when it instructed the jury that something more than just cappuccio testimony was needed to rebut the presumption that she received the notice,we set forth the verdict sheet the jury considered along with the instructions given by the district court.as to the tila rescission claim,the verdict sheet asked the jury the following questions 
do you find by the preponderance of the evidence that the first magnus defendants provided cappuccio with two copies of the notice of right to cancel on november,the date of the loan closing 
answer yes no 
if the answer to question is yes,please stop,you are finished with the tila section 
do you find by the preponderance of the evidence that the first magnus defendants provided cappuccio with two copies of the notice of right to cancel after november,the date of the loan closing 
answer yes no 
if the answer to question is yes,please continue to question,if the answer to question is no,please continue to a question regarding statutory damages.
if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the first magnus defendants provided cappuccio with two copies of the notice of right to cancel after november,do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the notices would have clearly and conspicuously informed a reasonable consumer of his or her right to cancel the loans 
answer yes no 
if the answer to question is yes,please stop,you are finished with the tila section 
app emphasis added.
instruction of the jury instructions directed the jury as follows with regard to question 
tila presumption 
where the borrower signs a document acknowledging that she received two copies of the notice of right to cancel,a presumption that she actually did receive them arises.a presumption shifts the burden of proving a particular fact to the party opposing its existence.in a tila case,something more than just the testimony of the borrower is needed to rebut the presumption that she received two copies of the notice.in addition,the lender does not have to give the borrower two copies of the notice at the closing.it can satisfy its obligations under tila by mailing it to the borrower after the closing.
since plaintiff signed an acknowledgement that she received two copies of the notice from both countrywide and the first magnus defendants on november,she is presumed to have received the copies.
app emphasis added.
the jury answered yes to question on the verdict sheet,finding that cappuccio had received the notices on november.as a result,the jury never reached questions or,returning a verdict in favor of the lenders on the tila claim.on march,the district court,notwithstanding the verdict,dismissed all claims against countrywide pursuant to a settlement it had reached with cappuccio.that same day the district court entered judgment in favor of e trade on the tila rescission claim.although on march,the district court granted cappuccio motion for an entry of default judgment against the remaining defendants,prime capital,ayzenberg,and mak abstract,and scheduled a hearing to determine damages,in october cappuccio voluntarily dismissed her claims against those defendants,apparently to hasten her appeal against e trade.
a.the motion to dismiss the appeal.
as a threshold matter,e trade moves to dismiss cappuccio appeal.it argues that the district court issuance of a default judgment against prime capital,ayzenberg,and mak abstract on march,resolved the last remaining claims in the case,and was therefore the court final order,despite the fact that the district court did not characterize it as such.e trade contends that this makes cappuccio october,notice of appeal untimely under federal rule of appellate procedure a a,which permits days to appeal a final order.
the initial flaw in e trade argument is that although judgment had been entered as to all claims and all defendants on march,there had been no determination of the amount of damages owed by each of the defaulting defendants.we have previously recognized that,i t is a rule of appellate jurisdiction that where liability has been decided but the extent of damage remains undetermined,there is no final order.dejohn temple,cir quoting apex fountain sales,kleinfeld,cir.here,because the district court was still in the midst of determining the extent of damage,cappuccio argues there was no final order until october of,when she voluntarily dismissed her claims against the defaulting defendants.
e trade responds by noting that cappuccio sought damages from the defaulting defendants in the liquidated amount of,which the jury had awarded her on her utpcpl claim against countrywide.doc.e trade argues that because the liability of the three defaulting defendants is joint and several with countrywide,the remaining allocation of damages between those parties was a mere ministerial task of setting off from the the amount that countrywide had paid in its settlement and allocating the remainder to the defaulting defendants.e trade cites to hattersley bolt,cir,where we held that regardless of the allocation of damages among defendants,when both liability and the total amount of damages owed have been established for those defendants,payment awaits only a future ministerial order,and finality is not lacking.id.at.
we do not find hattersley to be applicable,however,because the district court here still had more than a ministerial task before it.although the defaulting defendants argued at the damages hearing and in their subsequent filings that they were entitled to a set off from liability equal to the amount cappuccio had already received in her settlement with countrywide,cappuccio disputed this contention in her opposition to the motion to strike the default judgments,arguing that the jury awarded her in damages based on countrywide fraudulent actions alone,which were different from the actions that the defaulting defendants were alleged to have taken.doc.while we need not determine which party would have prevailed on this question,the important point for purposes of finality is that the district court had not yet ruled on this question of law and therefore,unlike hattersley,it had more than a mere ministerial task before it.even if e trade were correct that cappuccio position as to the set off was clearly wrong,it is important that the finality of a judgment not rest on the parties often subjective views of whether a damages issue is a close one,on the one hand,or easily resolved,on the other.the rule in hattersley must be narrowly limited to those circumstances where the remaining task for the district court is truly ministerial,in the sense of requiring no independent legal judgment.a broader rule would prove both impractical and unfair,forcing appellants to make uncertain and risky determinations about whether a judgment is truly final.see grider keystone health plan central,cir the finality requirement should be given a practical rather than a technical construction.quoting firestone tire rubber risjord,d.accordingly,hattersley is not controlling here and there was no final order until october of cappuccio appeal is timely 
b.the truth in lending act 
congress expressly provided that the purposes of enacting tila were to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit practices.a.we have paraphrased tila purpose by stating that congress enacted tila to guard against the danger of unscrupulous lenders taking advantage of consumers through fraudulent or otherwise confusing practices.ramadan chase manhattan,cir.accordingly,because tila is a remedial statute and should be construed liberally in favor of the consumer.id.
with certain exceptions not present here,tila requires that a creditor in a consumer transaction disclose various items of information,including,among other things the identity of the creditor the amount financed the finance charge the annual percentage rate the sum of the amount financed and the finance charge,or total of payments the number,amount,and due dates or period of payments scheduled the total sale price and explanations and definitions of the foregoing terms.see.
in addition to the required disclosures,tila generally permits a consumer borrower to rescind a loan transaction that results in the creditor taking a security interest in the borrower principal dwelling.in re porter,cir citing a.the default period during which the borrower may rescind the loan is intended to provide a cooling off period during which consumers can change their minds id.at citing a.the creditor must clearly and conspicuously disclose the borrower rescission rights and provide forms for the borrowers to do so,in accordance with regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board.id.at citing a.the board regulations require lenders to deliver to borrowers two copies of a notice of the right to rescind,and the notice must clearly and conspicuously disclose 
the retention or acquisition of a security interest in the consumer principal dwelling.
the consumer right to rescind the transaction.
how to exercise the right to rescind,with a form for that purpose,designating the address of the creditor principal place of business.
the effects of rescission,as described in paragraph d of this section.
the date the rescission period expires.
id.citing b.this regulation,at et,is also known as regulation in re cmty.bank of north,cir.under the statute and regulations,if the lender notice is proper,the borrower right to rescind lasts for three days.in re porter,at.the official staff interpretations of regulation z,supp.i,cmt.b,provides that the lender may deliver the notice after the transaction,but that if it does so,the rescission period of three days will not begin to run until the notice is given.further,the rescission period extends to three years if the required notice and material disclosures the annual percentage rate,are not delivered.in re porter,at citing a and f.it is cappuccio primary contention that the lenders failed to timely provide her with compliant notices,thus triggering this extension of the rescission period.
finally,of relevance here,when a borrower signs a written acknowledgment of receipt of the aforementioned disclosures required by tila,his or her signature does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.c.this provision was the basis for the district court instruction to the jury that cappuccio was presumed to have received the notices and that something more than her testimony was necessary to rebut that presumption.
c.the presumption of receipt 
whether the instruction was erroneous 
cappuccio argues that the district court erred when it instructed the jury that i n a tila case,something more than just the testimony of the borrower is needed to rebut the presumption that she received two copies of the notice.app 
federal rule of evidence provides the default rule for rebutting a presumption in a civil case.rule states 
in all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by act of congress or by these rules,a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption,but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion,which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.
in other words,unless congress or the rules of evidence provide otherwise,a presumption in a civil case imposes the burden of production on the party against whom it is directed,but does not shift the burden of persuasion.mccann newman irrevocable trust,cir see also in re g i holdings,cir same.under this theory,called the thayerwigmore bursting bubble theory of presumptions,the introduction of evidence to rebut a presumption destroys that presumption,leaving only that evidence and its inferences to be judged against the competing evidence and its inferences to determine the ultimate question at issue.mccann,at quoting mckenna pac.rail,cir.this view of rule is widely accepted.id.at collecting cases and treatise sources.but see wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,disagreeing with the majority view.
further,the quantum of evidence needed to burst the presumption bubble under rule is also minimal,given that the presumption only effect is to require the party contesting it to produce enough evidence substantiating the presumed fact absence to withstand a motion for summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law on the issue.mccann,at.we have previously held that a single,affidavit or witness testimony,when based on personal knowledge and directed at a material issue,is sufficient to defeat summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law.see,kirleis dickie,mccamey chilcote,cir.this remains true even if the affidavit is in the sense of supporting the affiant own legal claim or interests.id.here,cappuccio testimony related directly to a material issue in her tila claim whether she received two copies of a notice of the right to rescind her first magnus loan when she left krajczar house on the night of the closing.her testimony was also obviously based on her personal knowledge and was in no way conclusory.accordingly,under rule,her testimony would appear to be sufficient to burst the presumption bubble,leaving the decision of whether to credit her testimony,or that of e trade witnesses,to the jury.
however,by its own terms,rule of evidence states that it applies only where not otherwise provided for by act of congress accordingly,e trade could support the district court presumption instruction if it could show that congress otherwise provided for a stronger presumption than that provided for by default under rule.yet e trade cites to no language in tila or any other act that would demonstrate congress intent to create a stronger presumption.nor is there any such language in regulation to the contrary,cappuccio convincingly argues that the language in c,does no more than create,indicates that the provision is intended to construct the weakest form of presumption possible.further,cappuccio argues that elsewhere in tila,congress used plain and unambiguous language to create stronger presumptions when it intended to do so.for instance,b provides that in determining whether an assignee has acquired an obligation under tila,written acknowledgement of receipt by a person to whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to this subchapter shall be conclusive proof of the delivery thereof emphasis added.cappuccio persuasively concludes that the words,does no more than,indicate an intent to apply the normal presumption provided for by rule of evidence,and not something more than that.
in sum,because of the plain language of tila,and the resulting conclusion that congress did not intend something other than a rule presumption to apply,we hold that the testimony of a borrower alone is sufficient to overcome tila presumption of receipt.
harmless error 
e trade argues that even if the district court erred in requiring something more than cappuccio testimony to rebut the presumption of receipt,that error was harmless,given that cappuccio presented to the jury something more than just her testimony that she never received the notices on the night of the closing.specifically,it references the november overnight ups envelope from first m
