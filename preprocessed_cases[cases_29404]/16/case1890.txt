background 
the material facts of this matter are not in dispute.the relationship between local and was governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba.section of the cba authorizes all grievances arising under or relating to the interpretation of the cba to be subject to arbitration,provided that a mutually satisfactory adjustment is not arrived at between the union agent and the employer representative.the cba also governs union activity,and states in section b that w hen a member of the union leaves the employer to take full time employment with the local union,he shall after the completion of such employment with the local union return to his former position and his seniority shall continue uninterrupted.
although the cba governs a variety of employee benefits,it does not cover the employees pension plan.instead,the cba explains in section that a qualified pension plan would be provided by and would be covered by a separate document,which was entitled retirement plan for certain hourly employees of,pension plan.the pension plan not only details the administration of pension benefits,but also establishes an alternate mechanism for resolving grievances related to pension rights.section of the pension plan provides a comprehensive procedure by which claims of eligibility for participation in the pension plan or receipt of benefits are to be submitted to and resolved first by the plan director and,in the event of a denial,by an appeals committee.the section also states that the director and the appeals committee both have full and exclusive authority and discretion to apply,interpret and construe the provisions of the plan 
jerry vincent had been an employee of for many years before leaving his employment with the company to serve as an elected official of local.after serving an uninterrupted period of employment with local,vincent returned to employment with for one day,was paid for five weeks of vacation,and voluntarily terminated his employment the next day.during his last few months of employment with local,vincent had initiated the process to obtain his retirement benefits,seeking full entitlement of benefits upon notice of retirement.he asserted that his return to following his term with local restored his full seniority rights under the collective bargaining agreement.
after his claim was denied,vincent filed an appeal with the appeals committee,which also was unsuccessful.vincent then filed a written grievance alleging that violated his rights under section of its current collective bargaining agreement with local,ibt by refusing to permit him uninterrupted seniority for all purposes,including pension.after an unsuccessful meeting with a local official and the local director of operations to resolve the matter,an arbitrator was selected to hear and decide vincent grievance.however,following review of the file,attorney sent a letter to local asserting that to the extent vincent grievance raised a claim for pension benefits,the grievance was not arbitrable under the labor contract because pension eligibility and benefits are controlled by the terms of the separate pension plan and,therefore,is subject exclusively to the claims procedures established in the pension plan.in a series of letters following this communication,attorney sought clarification of the exact nature of vincent grievance and informed local that did not agree to submit any question related to vincent pension benefits to the arbitrator.counsel also informed the union that if it planned to pursue the pension claim in arbitration,it would need to file a claim in federal court to compel arbitration of the pension claims.the parties then agreed to suspend the planned hearing before the arbitrator.
a few months later,counsel for local sent a letter to counsel for that it was prepared to arbitrate the matter.attorney responded,denying arbitrability of any pension claim contained within the grievance and noting that vincent pension claims had been conclusively decided by the appeals committee.local filed the underlying complaint,arguing that refusal to arbitrate the grievance violated the cba and seeking to compel to arbitrate.the district court concluded that vincent grievance was not arbitrable and granted summary judgment in favor of.local timely filed this appeal,seeking reversal of the district court order and entry of an order directing to arbitrate vincent grievance.

in this case,local filed the complaint on november.contends that the statute of limitations began to run with a series of letters it sent in february and march of.while all of the letters stated that did not agree to arbitrate issues related to pension benefits,all of the letters also requested that local clarify the exact nature of its grievance.further,a march letter from to the arbitrator stated that the parties agreed to postpone the arbitration hearing date.because all of these communications seek additional information,and none indicate a position that believed negotiation or settlement was not feasible,local claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.
