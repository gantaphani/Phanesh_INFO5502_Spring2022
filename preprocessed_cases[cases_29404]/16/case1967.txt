this is an appeal from the district court review of a order in a chapter proceeding.giant eagle,as lessor,appeals the decision disallowing its claim for damages arising from a bankrupt lessee rejection of a lease for personal property,which was disallowed on the basis that a substitute lease for that property,if fulfilled,would have mitigated the claimed damages,as lessee,appeals the decision granting the lessor administrative expenses in the form of rent payments,from the petition date until the date.ultimately,we reverse with respect to the disallowance of future rent and remand to the district court,for further remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.we affirm the order granting as an administrative expense the rent due for the period from the petition date until the rejection of the lease.
on may,signed leases with giant eagle,and valu eagle associates,whereby would pay per month and per month for the use of certain warehouse equipment owned by giant eagle and valu eagle,respectively this warehouse equipment included shelving,conveyor belt systems,lift trucks,batteries,and specialized racking and selection equipment used in moving and selecting inventory.both leases had the same term,which meant that they were scheduled to terminate on september.
on september,filed for bankruptcy.for the next several july,continued to use the warehouse equipment to count,document,and dispose of the inventory it had remaining in the warehouse,and continued to pay at least partial rent during that time.on july,the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing the sale of substantially all of assets,which led to final inventory counts and liquidation sales.on september,formally rejected the equipment leases.giant eagle claimed administrative expenses,based on the rents due on the leases during that time 
also,pursuant to the leases,rejection,breach obligated it to pay liquidated damages equal to the present value of all future monthly payments outstanding,calculated based on a seven percent discount rate.as of september,there were monthly payments remaining on each lease and the present value of those payments was calculated at and,for the giant eagle and valu eagle leases,respectively.
on october,giant under a duty to mitigate the damages resulting from breaches of the substitute leases with snyder drugstores,whereby snyder would pay the same rent that had previously agreed to pay,for the use of the same warehouse equipment.although these new leases covered the same equipment for the same price,these leases were separate from and independent of the prior lease agreements between giant eagle and was no assignment,assumption,release,novation,or waiver of leases.these leases also had a duration and termination date different from the original leases.
the new leases with snyder were for,until october.but,on september,snyder filed bankruptcy,and on november,after using the equipment for just a little over one year,snyder formally rejected the leases.snyder paid overdue rent,from october to november,as administrative expenses,totaling and,on the giant eagle and valu eagle leases,respectively.in addition,based on the determination from snyder bankruptcy proceeding that unsecured creditors would receive six percent of the value of their unsecured claims,snyder paid giant eagle six percent of the present value of the future rents and,on the giant eagle and valu eagle leases,respectively.
after snyder rejected the leases,giant eagle was unable to lease the equipment to any other prospective lessees it turns out,there were no other prospective lessees,so they chose to reuse some,sell some,and scrap the rest giant eagle filed claims in bankruptcy proceeding requesting administrative expenses in the form of rents due from september,until september,less the amounts had already paid and liquidated damages for monthly lease payments due for the lease term remaining after september,less the amount mitigated,the amounts received from the snyder leases and the subsequent of the equipment.objected to these claims,but only in part.
agreed that giant eagle was entitled to administrative expenses for the unpaid rents for the period from september,to july,during which was using the equipment exclusively,and these values were not then,and are not now,in dispute.but pharmor objected to the claim for the period from july to september,to equipment was being used for giant eagle benefit.explained that,after the bankruptcy court ordered dissolution of its remaining assets on july,used the warehouse equipment only to inventory the merchandise remaining in the warehouse and a significant portion of that merchandise was eventually sold to giant eagle at a deep discount.hence,contends that the equipment was used for giant eagle benefit.also contends that giant eagle had obtained the right to prevent from accessing the warehouse or using the equipment,even though giant eagle had not actually exercised that right.
agreed that giant eagle was entitled to liquidated damages resulting from the rejection of the leases for the period from september until october,during which time giant eagle was indisputably suffering actual damages but objected to the claim for the period after october,when giant eagle entered into its new lease agreements with snyder.
thus,the disputed portion of giant eagle claims can be summarized as follows 
the parties stipulated to all of the pertinent facts and submitted the case to the bankruptcy court for a decision on their cross motions for summary judgment.
the bankruptcy court first addressed the lease damages and agreed with,concluding that giant eagle had fully mitigated its damages by the warehouse equipment to snyder.therefore,the court concluded that was not liable for any damages occurring after giant eagle obtained the replacement mitigating leases the court acknowledged that the bankruptcy code,a,authorizes a to court reject an unexpired lease and treat it as though the debtor had breached it immediately before the petition date.id.at g.because the bankruptcy code does not address how to calculate damages for such a,in re highland superstores,cir,the bankruptcy court looks to state law,to the extent that it does not conflict with the bankruptcy code,butner united states,d.pennsylvania provides the controlling law in this case,pursuant to the leases express provisions.
pennsylvania law provides a lessor on the receiving end of a lessee breach with four possibilities for establishing damages,depending on the circumstances d ispose of the goods and recover damages retain the goods and recover damages or in a proper case recover rent.a internal citation form altered.in addition,the lessor might e xercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract,seek liquidated damages.a.regardless of the approach,the lessor has a duty to mitigate the damages and can not claim damages that could reasonably have been avoided.see in re paskorz.
the bankruptcy court framed the argument as follows the parties dispute over the amount of lessors rejection damages centers on whether snyder failure to fulfill the snyder lease obligations revived debtor duty under its leases.the an absence of any case law on this this a matter of timing and held 
o nce a lessor mitigates its damages by the equipment,the lessor can not claim damages from the debtor for the period covered by the new if subsequently the new lessee defaults in its obligations to the lessor.to hold otherwise would require the court to attempt to forecast the viability of each lessee in a mitigating lease to determine if the mitigation will be successful.
the court then criticized giant eagle,declaring that giant eagle fully mitigated its damages under the leases when it the equipment to snyder,and giant eagle made its own business decision in leasing to snyder and must live with this choice.
the court proposed that if it were to allow the subsequent breach of a mitigating lease to revive a debtor obligations under the original lease,it would create uncertainty by forcing the breaching lessee to wait anxiously for the duration of its rejected lease term,because it would owe damages at some unknown and unpredictable time in the future,if the mitigating lease subsequently failed force the lessor to sue the original breaching lessee,even after mitigating,in order to protect itself against the specter of a failed mitigating lease and the expiration of the statute of limitations governing the original breach of lease render the breaching lessee a guarantor of,or with,the subsequent mitigating lessee and put the lessor in a better position than it would be under the original lease,by allowing it to recover from both the original breaching lessee and subsequent mitigatory breaching lessee.the court allowed giant eagle a general unsecured claim for one month of rent on both leases,to cover the time between pharmor september,rejection and snyder october,lease signing,but disallowed the remainder of the claim on the theory that giant eagle had mitigated.
the bankruptcy court next considered the administrative rent claims and found in favor of giant eagle,concluding that,despite claims of inequity,the simple fact was that whatever exercised its business judgment by choosing not to reject the equipment leases when it rejected the warehouse lease on july.consequently,t he equities of this case do not permit to escape its duty to pay giant eagle for administrative rent from july,until the lease rejection date of september.the court awarded giant eagle these administrative expense claims.
giant eagle appealed to the district court,see a,and.in its opinion,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision on equipment lease damages,concluding that none of the cases cited by giant eagle demonstrate that lease obligations could be revived after they were mitigated and supplanted by the new leases with snyder.the district court agreed with and quoted from the bankruptcy court opinion but did not cite any law or engage in any reasoning or analysis of its own.
the district court,quoting from in re at home,cir explaining the requirement as applied to d,which covers leases of real property,also affirmed the bankruptcy court decision on administrative rent,holding that d makes clear that the debtor must perform all obligations owing under a the obligation to pay rent at the contract the lease is rejected.and,citing in re,the court reasoned that,pursuant to d,it is the debtor who must persuade the court,based on the equities of the case,that such rent should not be paid or should be reduced by some amount,and the bankruptcy court was not persuaded.the district court found no basis upon which to disagree with the bankruptcy court.
we review the bankruptcy court decision directly,according no deference to the district court.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and questions of law are reviewed de novo.in re air,cir citation omitted.this case presents a question of law or an application of the law to the given circumstances,and the bankruptcy court factual findings are immaterial to the disposition of this appeal.
giant eagle argues that it is entitled to damages resulting from rejection of the lease,and therefore,that it should be deemed a general unsecured creditor for purposes of pharmor bankruptcy distribution.see g.replies that when a lessor,confronted with a lessee breach of a lease,enters into a subsequent binding lease with a third party and the benefit of that lease would fully mitigate any damage from the prior breach,then the prior lessee is excused from liability as of the date of the new lease,as if the prior lease never existed,was assumed,or was extinguished by novation.the bankruptcy court agreed with,and the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court.we do not agree,and instead find for giant eagle.
subject to the court approval,a bankruptcy trustee may reject an unexpired lease,a,and proceed as if the debtor had breached the lease immediately before the petition date,g,thereby prompting the lessor to file a proof of claim to recover damages,d.such a claim is expressly allowable a claim arising from the rejection,under section of this title,of an unexpired lease shall be determined,and shall be allowed the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition,g.but,even though this provision allows the claim conceptually,the trustee may still object to the amount 
a claim or interest,proof of which is filed under section of this title,is deemed allowed,unless a party in interest,including a creditor of a general partner in a partnership that is a debtor in a case under chapter of this title,objects.
i f such objection to a claim is made,the court,after notice and a hearing,shall determine the amount of such claim in lawful currency of the united states as of the date of the filing of the petition,and shall allow such claim in such amount,except to the extent that such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor,under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.
a b paragraph break omitted.thus,the question remains as to how to properly quantify such a as of the date of the filing of the petition,benefit of the lease bargain,and then,except to the extent that such claim is unenforceable against the debtor,actual damages.for these calculations,we look to state law and the lease,to the extent that it does not conflict with the bankruptcy code.butner,at.
in this case,the leases contained two important features a liquidated damages provision that quantified the benefit of the bargain as the present value of all future monthly payments,based on a seven percent discount rate and an express provision,designating pennsylvania law as controlling.pennsylvania statute provides four possible alternatives for calculating damages d ispose of the goods and recover damages retain the goods and recover damages in a proper case recover rent or e xercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract,seek liquidated damages.a citation form altered.here,because of the inclusion of the liquidated damages has not been contested,see a we begin and end with the fourth alternative.see also b except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement a except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement a making this provision applicable only under particular circumstances that are not present here.
pennsylvania common law dictates that the lessor has a duty to mitigate the damages and can not claim damages that could have been avoided.see in re paskorz.before imposing this duty to mitigate,however,we must consider whether this pennsylvania law conflicts with the bankruptcy code.see butner,at.
in the bankruptcy case of in re steiner,a lessor sought damages in the form of future rents from a bankrupt debtor rejection of a farm equipment lease.the court framed the question as whether or not the language of b is intended to allow a lessor to claim the actual amount of rent which would have been paid under the contract,or whether the lessor is entitled to claim only the actual damages which result from the rejection.id.at.the court reasoned that i f a lessor were able to recover the actual amount of rent due under the lease as well as having the property available to it for,the lessor would receive twice the benefit it had originally contracted for over the same period of time,and concluded that the bankruptcy code did not intend such a result.id.at.consequently,the court held that the lessor was entitled to claim only actual damages,meaning that it was subject to ohio duty to mitigate.id.the same reasoning applies to the present case 
therefore,the proper approach to resolving this objection was to first calculate the benefit of the bargain as of the date of the filing of the petition,see b,and,from there,determine actual damages based on pennsylvania state law,by reducing the calculation by the amount actually or reasonably mitigated.as it turns out,the amount actually mitigated in this case is also the amount reasonably mitigated because,after snyder lease and ensuing insolvency and bankruptcy liquidati
