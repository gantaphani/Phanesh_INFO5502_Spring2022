the university system of maryland

procedural history 
on november,the stadium authority and the university filed a complaint in their own names against ellerbe becket in the circuit court for baltimore city alleging claims for negligence,breach of contract,and indemnification.the parties were represented,not by private counsel,but by the maryland attorney general office.ellerbe becket removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and it filed a counterclaim against the stadium authority for fees it alleged it was owed under the contract.no counterclaim was filed against the university.
on january,the stadium authority moved to dismiss the counterclaim under the eleventh amendment,and both the stadium authority and the university moved to remand the case to the state court.both alleged that they were alter egos or arms of the state of maryland and,accordingly,were not citizens for the purpose of.because diversity jurisdiction was lacking,both argued,the case should be remanded to state court.
the district court noted that the questions presented were close ones as to which there we re reasonable arguments on both sides,but it denied the motion to dismiss the counterclaim and the motion to remand,concluding that neither the university nor the stadium authority were arms or alter egos of maryland.at.to reach this conclusion,the district court determined that both the university and stadium authority possessed a great deal of fiscal and operational autonomy.the district court recognized that both entities were engaged in statewide,as opposed to local,activities,and that state law generally treated both as arms of the state.on balance,however,the district court concluded that the entities respective autonomy indicated that neither was properly characterized as an arm of the state.with respect to the university,the district court was particularly persuaded by the fact that many of the university employees received a salary in excess of other state officials,including the governor of maryland the stadium authority,under the collateral order doctrine,immediately appealed the ruling on the eleventh amendment.see aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d holding states and state entities that claim to be arms of the state may take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of eleventh amendment immunity.the district court then certified the remainder of its order for appeal,and we consolidated the two appeals for oral argument.we have jurisdiction under,b west.
on appeal,both the stadium authority and the university argue that they are not citizens of maryland under and,accordingly,no diversity jurisdiction exists in this case to support removal jurisdiction we review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,including those relating to the propriety of removal.mayes rapoport,cir.the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction resides with the party seeking removal.mulcahey columbia organic chems,cir.we are obliged to construe removal jurisdiction strictly because of the significant federalism concerns implicated.id.therefore,i f federal jurisdiction is doubtful,a remand to state court is necessary.id.
section of title provides that any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.a west.ellerbe becket premised its removal upon a,which provides for original district court jurisdiction of all cases between citizens of different states when the amount in controversy exceeds.states,however,are not citizens of a state for purposes of a.moor alameda county,d.in addition,public entities and political subdivisions,such as municipalities,are also not citizens of a state if they are an arm or alter ego of the state.id.at.for a suit to be between citizens of different states,a,each distinct interest should be represented by persons,all of whom are entitled to sue,or may be sued,in the federal courts.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.that is,each of the persons concerned must be competent to sue,or liable to be sued,in federal court.id.thus,if one party to an action is not a citizen,and therefore not able to sue or be sued in federal court under,the district court does not have jurisdiction of the action under,even if all other parties to that action are citizens of different states.accordingly,if either the university or the stadium authority is an alter ego of maryland,the requirements of are not met in this case and removal was improper.
in determining if a public entity is an alter ego of the state,and therefore not a citizen under,courts have generally looked to the standards announced in cases addressing whether governmental entities are entitled to eleventh amendment immunity as an arm of the state see,of am.tobacco,cir of chesterton,cir.in this case,neither the university nor ellerbe becket disputes application of eleventh amendment standards in determining whether the university is a citizen of maryland for purposes of.
typically,we apply a four factor test,first announced in ram ditta.capital park planning comm n,cir,to determine whether a governmental entity is an arm of the state under the eleventh amendment.accordingly,we will apply the same test in this case to determine if the university is an alter ego of the state and therefore not a citizen under.
under the framework provided by ram ditta,in determining an entity status as an arm of the state,the most important consideration is whether the state treasury will be responsible for paying any judgment that might be awarded.id.at see also cash granville county bd.of,cir the principal factor is whether a judgment against the governmental entity would have to be paid from the state treasury.after resolving this inquiry,we examine three other factors,includ ing,but not necessarily limited to,whether the entity exercises a significant degree of autonomy from the state,whether it is involved with local versus statewide concerns,and how it is treated as a matter of state law.ram ditta,at footnotes omitted see also gray laws,cir noting arm of the state status may be determined by resort to the other relevant considerations referenced by the court,chief among which are whether the suit will jeopardize the integrity retained by a state in our federal system,and whether the state possesses such control over the entity that it can legitimately be considered an arm of the state.internal citation omitted.
we analyze the second ram ditta factor,the operational autonomy of the entity,by considering whether the state retains a veto over the entity actions,the origins of the entity funding,and who appoints the entity directors.see ristow ports,cir as to the fourth factor,although a state court view of the status of a state political entity is,of course,an important factor,questions of eleventh amendment immunity are ultimately governed by federal law.ram ditta,at.these factors elucidate whether the relationship between the governmental entity and the state is sufficiently close to make the entity an arm of the state.cash,at 
one slight modification of ram ditta is necessary in the context of this case.the university is the plaintiff in this action and no claims are asserted against it.there is no possibility that,even if the university is an alter ego of the state,maryland will be responsible for paying a judgment in this case.thus,while the impact of the litigation on the state treasury remains the most salient factor in determining whether the university is an alter ego of the state for purposes of,the inquiry is reversed that is,while we usually look to whether the state will be liable for a judgment against the entity in question,in cases in which a state entity is plaintiff,we will look to whether any recovery by the entity will inure to the benefit of the state.the supreme court has explicitly endorsed this approach in a case involving diversity and removal jurisdiction 
applying the same principles of construction to the removal acts as to the eleventh amendment and to cases in which it is claimed that the state,though not the nominal,is in fact the real,party plaintiff,it may fairly be held that the state is such real party when the relief sought is that which inures to it alone,and in its favor the judgment or decree,if for the plaintiff,will effectively operate.
ry.hickman.with this framework in place,we turn to the question of whether the university is an alter ego of maryland.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the university is an alter ego of maryland.numerous courts have decided whether public state universities are arms of the state.almost universally,the answer has been in the affirmative.see,takle of.hosp.clinics,cir of,at buchwald of sch.of,cir laxey.bd.of,cir hutsell sayre,cir kashani purdue,cir hall med.coll.of ohio at toledo,cir.
in some circuits,the issue was not even disputed.for instance,in university of south alabama,the eleventh circuit succinctly noted,i n the context of eleventh amendment immunity,we have held that state universities are agencies or instrumentalities of the state,and thus are immune from suit in federal court.of,at.see also watson of utah med,cir our cases have consistently found state universities are arms of the state.in fact,research reveals only two circuit court opinions concluding that a particular state university was not an arm of the state.see chesterton,at,kovats rutgers,cir 
we,too,have previously treated several public universities as arms of the state.see litman george mason,cir huang bd.of governors of the of,cir richard anderson photography brown,cir.moreover,prior to this litigation,two district courts in maryland had found that the university system of maryland was an arm of the state of maryland.see palotai of,bickley of.despite this overwhelming precedent,each state univer
