the port of los angeles,a division of the city of los angeles,is run by a board of harbor commissioners pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff.the port leases marine terminal facilities to operators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships.federally licensed trucks,called drayage trucks,assist in those operations by moving cargo into and out of the port.in,in response to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port expansion on traffic,the environment,and safety,the board implemented a clean truck program.as part of that program,the board devised a concession agreement to govern the relationship between the port and drayage companies.the agreement requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting concerns,and to submit a plan listing parking locations for each truck.other requirements relate to a company financial capacity,its maintenance of trucks,and its employment of drivers.the concession agreement sets out penalties for violations,including possible suspension or revocation of the right to provide drayage services.the board also amended the port tariff to ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.the amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor,punishable by fine or imprisonment,for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregistered drayage truck.
petitioner american trucking associations,ata,whose members include many of the drayage companies at the port,sued the port and city,seeking an injunction against the concession agreement requirements.ata principally contended that the requirements are expressly preempted by the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa,see c.ata also argued that even if the requirements are valid,castle hayes freight lines,prevents the port from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting company right to operate at the port.the district court held that neither c nor castle prevented the port from proceeding with its program.the ninth circuit mainly affirmed,finding only the provision preempted and rejecting petitioner castle claim.
the faaaa expressly preempts the concession agreement placard and parking requirements.section c preempts a state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.because the parties agree that the port placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carrier price,route,or service with respect to transporting property,the only disputed question is whether those requirements hav e the force and effect of law.section c draws a line between a government exercise of regulatory authority and its own participation in a market.the statute force and effect of law language excludes from the clause scope contractual arrangements made by a state when it acts as a market participant,not as a regulator.see,american airlines,wolens.but here,the port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard and parking requirements.it forced terminal operators and through them,trucking companies to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment.that counts as action having the force and effect of law if anything does.
the port primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives rather than means.but the port proprietary intentions do not control.when the government employs a coercive mechanism,available to no private party,it acts with the force and effect of law,whether or not it does so to turn a profit.only if it forgoes the distinctively governmental exercise of legal authority may it escape c preemptive scope.that the criminal sanctions fall on terminal operators,not directly on the trucking companies,also makes no difference.see,rowe new hampshire motor transp.
this court declines to decide in the case present,posture whether castle limits the way the port can enforce the and requirements upheld by the ninth circuit.castle rebuffed a state attempt to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for past infringements of state safety regulations.but castle does not prevent a state from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such regulations.and at this juncture,there is no basis for finding that the port will actually use the concession agreement penalty provision as castle proscribes.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,we consider whether federal law preempts certain provisions of an agreement that trucking companies must sign before they can transport cargo at the port of los angeles.we hold that the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa expressly preempts two of the contract provisions,which require such a company to develop an parking plan and display designated placards on its vehicles.we decline to decide in the case present,posture whether,under castle hayes freight lines,federal law governing licenses for interstate motor carriers prevents the port from using the agreement penalty clause to punish violations of other,provisions.
the port of los angeles,a division of the city of los angeles,is the largest port in the country.the port owns marine terminal facilities,which it leases to terminal operators such as shipping lines and stevedoring companies that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships.trucks,called drayage trucks,move the cargo into and out of the port.the trucking companies providing those drayage services are all federally licensed motor carriers.before the events giving rise to this case,they contracted with terminal operators to transport cargo,but did not enter into agreements with the port itself.
the city board of harbor commissioners runs the port pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff,which sets out various regulations and charges.in the late,the board decided to enlarge the port facilities to accommodate more ships.neighborhood and environmental groups objected to the proposed expansion,arguing that it would increase congestion and air pollution and decrease safety in the surrounding area.a lawsuit they brought,and another they threatened,stymied the board development project for almost years.
to address the community concerns,the board implemented a clean truck program beginning in.among other actions,the board devised a concession agreement to govern the relationship between the port and any trucking company seeking to operate on the premises.under that contract,a company may transport cargo at the port in exchange for complying with various requirements.the two directly at issue here compel the company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting environmental or safety concerns you seen the type how am i driving and submit a plan listing parking locations for each truck when not in service.three other provisions in the agreement,formerly disputed in this litigation,relate to the company financial capacity,its maintenance of trucks,and its employment of drivers.
the board then amended the port tariff to ensure that every company providing drayage services at the facility would enter into the concession agreement.the mechanism the board employed is a criminal prohibition on terminal operators.the amended tariff provides that no terminal operator shall permit access into any terminal in the port of los angeles to any drayage truck unless such drayage truck is registered under a concession agreement.app.a violation of that provision which occurs each and every day a terminal operator provides access to an unregistered truck is a misdemeanor,at.it is punishable by a fine of up to or a prison sentence of up to six months,at.
the concession agreement itself spells out penalties for any signatory trucking company that violates its requirements.when a company commits a minor default,the port may issue a warning letter or order the company to undertake corrective action,complete a course of training,or pay the costs of the port investigation,at.when a company commits a major default,the port may also suspend or revoke the company right to provide drayage services at the port,at.the agreement,however,does not specify which breaches of the contract qualify as major,rather than minor.and the parties agree that the port has never suspended or revoked a trucking company license to operate at the port for a prior violation of one of the contract provisions involved in this case.see tr.of oral arg.
petitioner american trucking associations,ata,is a national trade association representing the trucking industry,including drayage companies that operate at the port.ata filed suit against the port and city,seeking an injunction against the five provisions of the concession agreement discussed above.the complaint principally contended that c of the faaaa expressly preempts those requirements.that statutory section states 
a state or local government may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c 
ata also offered a argument even if the requirements are valid,ata claimed,the port may not enforce them by withdrawing a defaulting company right to operate at the port.that argument rested on castle hayes freight lines,which held that illinois could not bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for prior violations of state safety regulations.we reasoned in castle that the state action conflicted with federal law providing for certification of motor carriers and ata argued here that a similar conflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to suspend or revoke a trucking company privileges.following a bench trial,the district court held that neither c nor castle prevents the port from proceeding with any part of its clean truck program.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit mainly affirmed.most important for our purposes,the court held that c does not preempt the agreement placard and parking requirements because they do not ha ve the force and effect of law.quoting c.the court reasoned that those requirements,rather than regulating the drayage market,advance the port own business interest in managing its facilities.at.both provisions were designed to address a specific proprietary problem the need to increase the community necessary to facilitate port expansion.at see,at.the ninth circuit also held the agreement and provisions not preempted,for reasons not relevant here section c,the court decided,preempts only the contract employment provision.finally,the ninth circuit rejected ata claim that castle bars the port from applying the agreement penalty clause to withdraw a trucking company right to operate at the facility.the court thought castle inapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in this case unlike a ban on using all of a state freeways,the court reasoned,a limitation on access to a single port does not prohibit motor carriers from generally participating in interstate commerce,at.
we granted certiorari to resolve two questions first,whether c of the faaaa preempts the concession agreement placard and parking provisions and second,whether castle precludes reliance on the agreement penalty clause to suspend or revoke a trucking company privileges.see.contrary to the ninth circuit,we hold that the placard and parking requirements are preempted as provision s having the force and effect of law.that determination does not obviate the enforcement issue arising from castle because the ninth circuit rulings upholding the agreement and provisions have now become final accordingly,the port could try to apply its penalty provision to trucking companies that have violated those surviving requirements.but we nonetheless decline to address the castle question because the case posture obscures the nature of the agreement remedial scheme,rendering any decision at this point a shot in the dark.
section c,once again,preempts a state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.all parties agree that the port placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carrier price,route,or service with respect to transporting property.the only disputed question is whether those requirements hav e the force and effect of law.the port claims that they do not,because the concession contract is just like a private agreement,made to advance the port commercial and proprietary interests.brief for respondent city of los angeles et brief for city of los angeles internal quotation marks omitted 
we can agree with the port on this premise section c draws a rough line between a government exercise of regulatory authority and its own participation in a market.we recognized that distinction in american airlines,wolens,when we construed another statute force and effect of law language.that phrase,we stated,connotes official,policies prescribing binding standards of conduct.at,internal quotation marks omitted.and we contrasted that quintessential regulatory action to contractual commitment s voluntarily undertaken.at internal quotation marks omitted.in wolens,we addressed a state enforcement of an agreement between two private parties.but the same reasoning holds if the government enters into a contract just as a private party would for example,if a state or city or port signs an agreement with a trucking company to transport goods at a specified price.see,building constr.trades council associated builders contractors of,when a state acts as a purchaser of services,it does not regulate the workings of the market it exemplifies them some internal quotation marks omitted.the force and effect of law language in c excludes such everyday contractual arrangements from the clause scope.that phrasing targets the state acting as a state,not as any market actor or otherwise said,the state acting in a regulatory rather than proprietary mode.
but that statutory reading gets the port nothing,because it exercised classic regulatory authority complete with the use of criminal penalties in imposing the placard and parking requirements at issue here.consider again how those requirements work.they are,to be sure,contained in contracts between the port and trucking companies.but those contracts do not stand alone,as the result merely of the parties voluntary commitments.the board of harbor commissioners aimed to require parties who access port land and terminals for purposes of providing drayage services to enter into concession agreements with the port.app.board findings and it accomplished that objective by amending the port tariff a form of municipal ordinance to provide that no terminal operator shall permit a drayage truck to gain access into any terminal in the port unless the truck is registered under such a concession agreement,at.a violation of that tariff provision is a violation of criminal law.and it is punishable by a fine or a prison sentence of up to six months,at.so the contract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental program wielding coercive power over private parties,backed by the threat of criminal punishment.
that counts as action having the force and effect of law if anything does.the port here has not acted as a private party,contracting in a way that the owner of an ordinary commercial enterprise could mimic.rather,it has forced terminal operators and through them,trucking companies to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishab
