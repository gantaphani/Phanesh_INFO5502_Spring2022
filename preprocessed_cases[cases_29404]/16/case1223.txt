jacqueline galloway appeals a district court order dismissing her action against santander consumer usa,seeking damages for breach of contract and alleging a violation of the maryland credit grantor closed end credit provisions the clec,see,comm.law,et.finding no error,we affirm.
the pertinent facts in this case are undisputed.galloway used a loan she obtained through a retail installment contract the risc to finance her purchase of a vehicle in march.the clec governs the risc terms.
the risc contained the transaction financing terms as well as information concerning repossession rights and procedures.it listed the total amount financed as and required galloway to make payments of on the day of every month.if a payment or part thereof was more than days late,the risc called for imposition of a late fee of five dollars or ten percent of the part of the payment that was late,whichever was greater.the risc also included a modification provision stating that a ny change to this contract must be in writing and we must sign it.
the risc was assigned to citifinancial auto,citifinancial,which took a security interest in the vehicle.sometime before october,galloway contacted citifinancial requesting a reduction in the amount of her monthly loan payment.the citifinancial representative with whom galloway spoke told her that citifinancial would send her paperwork to review and sign and that,once she returned the signed papers,the company would consider whether to approve her request.galloway stated that citifinancial told her they would notify her in writing concerning whether her request had been approved.
citifinancial then provided galloway with a cover page and a document.the cover page asked that she review the attached documents and provide the signature s required.it requested that after she signed the paperwork,she return it to citifinancial auto for further review,approval and consideration.it also requested that she retain a copy of this agreement for her records.
the two remaining pages constituted an amended agreement the amended agreement.under its terms,the amended agreement would take effect on october,galloway total amount due would be her monthly payment would be reduced from to her first payment would be due december,and her last and payment would be due on november.the amended agreement also included an arbitration agreement the arbitration agreement under which galloway,citifinancial,and citifinancial assignees,could elect to arbitrate any dispute,whether in contract,tort or otherwise,rather than proceed through a court action.the arbitration agreement also prohibited galloway from serving as a class representative or participating in a class action if arbitration was elected.finally,the amended agreement provided that all terms and provisions of the risc shall remain in full force and effect except as expressly modified herein.
galloway signed the amended agreement on november,and sent a copy of the signed agreement to citifinancial via fax.
the record does not reflect that citifinancial ever specifically sent galloway written approval of the amended agreement.nevertheless,galloway states in her declaration that sometime after november,citifinancial lowered her scheduled monthly payments to,an amount just cents more than the amount contemplated in the amended agreement.galloway immediately began making monthly payments of beginning december,and continued to make payments in that amount for several years.
in her declaration,galloway states that it was an agreement between her and citifinancial entered into sometime after november,that lowered her payment amount from to.however,the record contains no evidence of any specific discussions between galloway and citifinancial explaining or addressing the cent discrepancy.and galloway declaration asserts that the agreement that lowered her payments to each month was not evidenced by a writing.
in december,citifinancial assigned the security interest in galloway vehicle to santander consumer usa.after galloway fell behind on her payments,santander repossessed her car,sold it,and,after failing in its attempts to collect the outstanding deficiency,waived the deficiency.
galloway subsequently brought this action in state court,alleging that santander breached the risc and violated the clec by failing to provide sufficient notice before selling her vehicle.galloway purports to bring suit on behalf of herself and all persons similarly situated.
santander removed the case to federal district court.santander also filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay federal district court proceedings under the federal arbitration act faa,et,claiming galloway had previously agreed to arbitrate any disputes concerning her loan.galloway denied that the parties had an agreement to arbitrate and alternatively claimed that any arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the faa because it was not in writing.galloway also moved to amend her complaint,and santander opposed the motion on the basis that amendment would be futile.
applying a standard,the district court concluded as a matter of law that galloway had agreed to arbitration and that the agreement to arbitrate was enforceable under the faa.see galloway santander consumer usa,civ.no.ccb,wl.the district court analyzed several alternative legal theories offered by santander as support for its position that the parties agreed to arbitration.the court concluded that citifinancial sending the amended agreement to galloway was a mere invitation for galloway to make an offer because the company retained the right at that time to reject galloway refinancing application even if galloway signed the agreement.see id.at.however,the court concluded that galloway returning a copy of the executed agreement constituted an offer to enter into the agreement and that citifinancial accepted that offer by reducing her monthly payment to only cents more than the agreement had called for.see id.
alternatively,the court concluded that citifinancial proposal to reduce the payment to constituted a counteroffer to make a minor modification to the dollar amounts in the amended agreement,which galloway accepted by making the payments in the amount requested for several years without objection.see id.the district court rejected galloway argument that no new contract was formed because galloway returning a signed original of the amended agreement to citifinancial and citifinancial written assent were both conditions precedent to modifying the risc.see id.at.the district court concluded that the parties waived any right they may have had to such formalities by virtue of their performance under their new agreement.see id.the court added that,under the doctrine of equitable estoppel,galloway could not disclaim the amended agreement,having accepted the benefit of the agreement in the form of reduced monthly payments.see id.
having determined that the parties bound themselves to the terms of the amended agreement,or at least to the terms of the amended agreement with the slightly modified payment amount,the court concluded that the written arbitration agreement was enforceable under the faa see id.at.on that basis,the court initially granted santander motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case pursuant to.see,at.however,on reconsideration,the court,citing choice hotels int l,bsr tropicana resort,cir,entered a final judgment dismissing the case so as to allow galloway to pursue an immediate appeal.
we review de novo the district court judgment compelling arbitration,as well as any questions of state contract law concerning the validity of the arbitration agreement.santoro accenture fed,llc,cir.
sections and of the faa provide two parallel devices for enforcing an arbitration agreement a stay of litigation in any case raising a dispute referable to arbitration,and an affirmative order to engage in arbitration.chorley enters.dickey barbecue,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.before the faa was enacted,courts were hostile to the enforcement of arbitration provisions,following a common law rule which evolved from the judiciary jealous refusals to oust courts of jurisdiction in favor of other dispute resolution mechanisms.whiteside teltech,cir.the purpose for enacting the faa was to assure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate by placing them upon the same footing as other contracts.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this purpose is served by the cause of action the faa provides and its primary substantive provision,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,declaring,with exceptions not relevant here,that 
a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable.
we have stated that a pplication of the faa requires demonstration of four elements the existence of a dispute between the parties,a written agreement that includes an arbitration provision which purports to cover the dispute,the relationship of the transaction,which is evidenced by the agreement,to interstate or foreign commerce,and the failure,neglect or refusal of the defendant to arbitrate the dispute.rota mclarty santander consumer usa,cir quoting whiteside,at.
only the second element is at issue here.galloway does not dispute that the present action falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement,but she argues that the district court erred in concluding,without the benefit of a jury trial,that the provision was a term of any contract she and citifinancial entered into.she also alternatively maintains that if the arbitration agreement was a term of a contract the parties entered into,the district court erred in ruling that their acceptance of that provision satisfied the faa writing requirement.we address these issues seriatim.
we first address galloway contention that she is entitled to a jury trial regarding whether she and citifinancial entered into a binding contract that included the arbitration agreement.
under the faa,the party seeking a jury trial must make an unequivocal denial that an arbitration agreement exists and must also provide sufficient evidence in support of its claims such that a reasonable jury could return a favorable verdict under applicable law.chorley,at.thus,to obtain a jury trial,the parties must show genuine issues of material fact regarding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.id.we conclude that the district court properly ruled that no such factual issue existed here.
the parties agree that principles of maryland law control the question of whether they reached an agreement to arbitrate.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.see chorley,at.
under maryland law,a prerequisite to the formation of a contract is mutual assent between the parties.see cochran norkunas.manifestation of mutual assent includes two issues intent to be bound,and definiteness of terms.id.
a contract is formed when an unrevoked offer made by one person is accepted by another.county comm rs for carroll cnty.forty builders,internal quotation marks omitted.an offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain,so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.prince george cnty.silverman.importantly,an acceptance may be manifested by actions as well as by words.see porter general boiler casing,the purpose of a signature is to demonstrate mutuality or assent which could as well be shown by the conduct of the parties.
as it did below,santander offers several theories concerning how a meeting of the minds occurred here.santander first argues that citifinancial sending galloway the amended agreement for her signature amounted to an offer to enter the agreement and that galloway signing it and faxing a copy to citifinancial constituted her acceptance of the amended agreement.just as the district court did,we reject this argument because citifinancial made clear to galloway,both orally and in writing,that it retained the right to deny galloway request for lower monthly payments.since citifinancial had not agreed that galloway execution of the amended agreement would bind the parties,the sending of the agreement to galloway for her signature was a mere invitation to galloway to make an offer.see spaulding wells fargo bank,cir w hen some further act of the purported offeror is necessary,the purported offeree has no power to create contractual relations,and there is as yet no operative offer.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,galloway execution of the amended agreement and her sending of a copy of the signed document to citifinancial constituted not an acceptance of an offer made to her,but rather an offer to citifinancial to enter into the agreement.
santander alternatively contends that the district court correctly ruled that citifinancial accepted galloway offer by lowering the amount of galloway monthly payment to cents more than the amount the amended agreement specified,a difference described by the district court as de minimis.galloway,wl,at.galloway argues,however,that citifinancial actions did not constitute an acceptance of her offer because,under maryland law,any variation from the terms offered is considered to be a conditional acceptance or counteroffer,as opposed to an unconditional acceptance that would immediately create a binding agreement 
even assuming arguendo that galloway is correct that citifinancial actions did not bind the parties to an agreement,we agree with the district court alternative ruling that citifinancial actions proposing payments in an amount cents more than the amount specified in the amended agreement constituted a counteroffer to modify the terms of the amended agreement in this minor way and that galloway accepted the counteroffer by making the payments in this slightly increased amount.
although galloway contends that the question of whether a meeting of the minds occurred presented a genuine factual dispute,we conclude that the legal consequences of the parties undisputed actions are clear.when galloway first inquired about lowering the amount of her monthly payment,citifinancial drafted the amended agreement and instructed her that if she signed it and returned it,the company would review her request.galloway indicated her assent to the company proposed terms when she executed the amended agreement on november,leaving citifinancial to undertake its formal review process.within approximately one month,at some time early enough to allow galloway to make her december payment in the new amount,citifinancial informed galloway that it would lower galloway payment to,almost the exact amount that the amended agreement had contemplated.on these facts,citifinancial could not reasonably be understood to be offering galloway the option to her lower payment amount without accepting the other new terms specified in the amended agreement such as,for example,the increase in the number of payments that galloway would be required to make.rather,citifinancial could only be reasonably understood to be proposing a very minor tweak to the terms that it had originally suggested and that galloway had already indicated she would accept.see learning works,learning annex,cir maryland law requires unqualified acceptance of an offer before a contract can be formed.if a purported acceptance varies from the terms of the offer,then it does not operate as an acceptance,but rather as a rejection of the offer and a counteroffer.
there is no evidence that galloway ever explicitly agreed to accept this small modification to the amended agreement.nevertheless,her making payment in the revised amount citifinancial requested and then continuing to make those payments for several years without complaint can only be interpreted as an assent to the terms of the amended agreement as slightly modified by the company.see restatement second of contracts the conduct of a party is not effective as a manifestation of his assent unless he intends to engage in the condu
