bp products north america,bp appeals a district court order granting summary judgment in favor of charles stanley,and his business,telegraph petroleum properties,llc telegraph together,defendants in bp action seeking to enforce a restrictive covenant in a deed.bp also appeals the district court award of attorneys fees and costs.we reverse the grant of summary judgment,vacate the fee and cost award,and remand to the district court.
bp is a petroleum refiner and distributor of motor fuel under the bp,amoco,and arco brands.prior to december,bp sold fuel directly to its lessees and retailers,who then resold the fuel to the public.stanley was one of these lessees.for many years before december,stanley operated an gasoline station in alexandria,virginia,on property leased from bp the property.during that time,in addition to selling bp fuel,stanley operated an automobile repair shop on the property.
in,bp entered into an agreement to sell its virginia,maryland,and district of columbia station properties and dealer fuel supply rights to eastern petroleum,an independent wholesale supplier,or jobber.this agreement was subject to first providing individual retailers the chance to match eastern offer.the agreement was part of a transition by bp to a new distribution model,under which bp would no longer sell fuel directly to retailers such as stanley.rather,bp would sell to a large jobber,who would resell to dealers under supply agreements the jobber had with the retailers.with its acquisition of bp virginia retail assets,eastern entered into a year supply agreement with bp,under which eastern agreed to buy more than million gallons of fuel annually from bp.eastern also agreed to purchase each of the station properties subject to a restriction that they could not be used to sell fuel.
bp offered stanley and its other the opportunity to match eastern offer to purchase the property they were leasing.the purchases would have to be subject to the restriction against using the property to sell fuel,and the retailers would have to enter into year supply agreements with eastern.if the dealers decided not to purchase the properties,they could continue to operate their stations as they had been,with the only change being they would be leasing from eastern rather than bp and buying fuel from eastern rather than bp.the purpose of these dealings was to move bp to its new jobber distribution model,which required that demand for bp fuel at the station properties be maintained during the period under which eastern year supply agreement with bp was in force.
stanley,represented by legal counsel,agreed to purchase the property pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement psa with bp dated september.he also agreed to enter into a year agreement with eastern.attached to the psa was a special warranty deed that included restrictions on the property use.as is relevant here,one of these restrictions the pr states 
petroleum restriction no part of the property shall be used by grantee or any other grantee party,directly or indirectly,for an automobile service station,petroleum station,gasoline station,or for the purpose of conducting or carrying on the business of selling,offering for sale,storage,handling,distributing or dealing in petroleum,gasoline,motor vehicle fuel,diesel fuel,kerosene,benzol,naphtha,greases,lubricating oils,or any fuel used for internal combustion engines,or lubricants in any form,or other petroleum or products,except for the personal use or consumption of such products by grantee or its lessees of the property,unless any such use is in connection with the operation of the property as a grantor branded service station.for purposes hereof,grantor branded service station shall mean a service station under the brand bp,amoco,arco or any other brand of grantor or any of its affiliates or their respective successors and assigns.
the above covenants and use restrictions bind and restrict the property as covenants and restrictions running with the land and each portion thereof,and are deemed to benefit grantor as a user of,operator of,or supplier of grantor branded fuels to lands or retail operations in the county in which the property is located.these restrictive covenants will remain in full force and effect for a term of fifteen years from the date of this conveyance whereupon these restrictive covenants will automatically lapse and terminate and be of no further force or effect.
stanley expressly acknowledged that the purchase price reflects the fact that all of the use and operating restrictions shall be recorded against the property and shall be binding on grantee and the other grantee parties.
the deed took effect when the psa was signed on december,and telegraph signed a supply agreement with eastern seven days later.by early,however,stanley had become concerned that eastern was charging commercially unreasonable prices for its fuel.in response to a letter from stanley on this subject,eastern and stanley both agreed to lower their profit margins in an attempt to make the sale of bp fuel at the station property viable.when this effort failed,stanley requested that eastern sell telegraph a different,less expensive brand of fuel.defendants apparently continued to purchase fuel from eastern until approximately july.
starting about july,telegraph did not sell any gasoline from the property for one year but continued to provide and inspection services on the property.defendants never requested any relief from the restrictive covenant to provide these services.
on april,stanley sent bp a letter asserting that eastern had materially breached the supply agreement by failing to offer commercially reasonable fuel prices.the letter stated that the pr was rendered unenforceable by the breach and informed bp that stanley intended to remove his amoco brand imaging and obtain alternate gasoline supply.stanley also repeated this intent in a subsequent letter.receiving no response,defendants began selling amerigo fuel on july.when bp learned that defendants were selling amerigo fuel,it demanded that they stop doing so.
stanley refused,prompting bp to file suit against defendants.bp complaint alleges that defendants violated the psa and the special warranty deed by selling branded motor fuel during the year period in which the restrictive covenant was in force.the complaint requests monetary damages,injunctive relief,and an award of attorney fees and costs.defendants counterclaimed,seeking a declaration that the deed restriction is overbroad and invalid count i and that bp violated of virginia commercial code by charging commercially unreasonable fuel prices count ii.
the parties filed for summary judgment.in its motion,bp sought judgment on both its claims and defendants counterclaims.defendants moved for summary judgment on bp claims,but only on count i of their counterclaims.bp also moved to strike a declaration in which stanley proffered putative expert testimony on the commercial reasonableness of eastern fuel prices.the district court granted bp motion to strike.
the district court subsequently granted defendants summary judgment motion and denied bp,ruling that the pr was unenforceable as written and that it could not be modified by operation of the deed or by bp unilaterally.the court ruled that the pr was overbroad on the basis that it prohibited using the property as a vehicle repair business or using the property to sell kerosene,benzol,naphtha,greases,benzol,greases,or lubricating oils unless the station was.the court did not reach count ii of defendants counterclaim,concluding that count ii sought the same relief that the court granted pursuant to count i.the court also awarded in fees and costs to defendants 
bp argues that the district court erred in concluding that the pr was overbroad and,thus,unenforceable.we agree.
because we are sitting in diversity,our role is to apply the governing state law,or,if necessary,predict how the state highest court would rule on an unsettled issue.horace mann ins.general star ins,cir.
the parties agree that under virginia law,covenants restricting the free use of land are not favored and must be strictly construed.mid state equip.bell.they disagree,however,regarding the test by which such covenants should be judged.defendants argue that the restriction should be judged by the standard discussed in omniplex world services investigations services,which applies to covenants in employment contracts.bp contends that restrictive covenants in deeds are judged by a different standard,namely the one discussed in merriman cover,drayton leonard,and that the omniplex and merriman tests are distinct from one another.we agree with bp.
virginia courts have held that covenants restricting land use are valid where the restraint is limited and there is a valuable consideration to support it,so long as the restraint imposed is reasonable as between the parties and not injurious to the public by reason of its effect upon trade.merriman,at.a restraint is reasonable if it only afford s a fair protection to the interests of the party in favor of whom it is given,and is not so large as to interfere with the interests of the public.id.virginia courts apply a different test to covenants in employment contracts,under which a covenant is enforced if it is narrowly drawn to protect the employer legitimate business interest,is not unduly burdensome on the employee ability to earn a living,and is not against public policy.omniplex,at see also therapy servs,crystal city nursing,va applying merriman test when a lthough the provision in question involves an employee ability to secure future employment,it is neither a covenant not to compete nor a restrictive covenant between employer and employee.the presence of the words narrowly drawn in the omniplex test suggests that the omniplex test is stricter.see also ferdinand tinio,annotation,enforceability,insofar as restrictions would be reasonable,of contract containing unreasonable restrictions on competition,a generally,a stricter test of reasonableness is applied in employment covenant cases than in sale covenant cases.additionally,omniplex consideration of the employee ability to earn a living is not even a part of the merriman test.we therefore apply only the merriman test to the facts before us.
in so doing,we note that courts have consistently upheld covenants similar to the one before us today.see,savon gas stations no.six,shell oil,cir eastling bp prods,cir calumet council.standard oil of,cir staebler kempf oil mac auto mart.additionally,virginia courts often rely on restatements in resolving issues of contract and property law,see,edwards bradley,meissel finley,and the restatement third of property servitudes,addressing restrictions on the use of real property,strongly points to that result.comment b to of the restatement notes that t he common law of unreasonable restraints on competition looks to the purpose,the geographic extent,and the duration of the restraint to determine whether it is reasonable.the comment also provides that c ovenants against competition that are tied to ownership of a particular parcel of land are seldom unreasonable because the impact is limited to one piece of land.id.comment c to the same section further notes that companies often sell or lease land for service stations,taking covenants from the grantees that they would purchase all their petroleum products from the grantor and would sell only the grantor products in the station.comment c concludes that a lthough there was some early hesitance about the validity of these arrangements,they came to be widely accepted.
nevertheless,as we have explained,the district court found the pr to be overbroad and unenforceable for two reasons.bp challenges both reasons on appeal,and we will address them seriatim.
first,bp argues that the district court erred in ruling that the pr is unenforceable because it purports to prohibit using the property to operate a auto repair shop that does not sell gasoline.indeed,bp argues that the district court erred in interpreting the pr to even include such a prohibition.we agree.
under virginia law,terms in a contract will be interpreted in light of the context in which they appear.see westmoreland lg e partners virginia power.as do the courts of other states,virginia courts construe agreements according to the sense and meaning of the terms which the parties have used and,if they are clear and unambiguous,their terms are to be taken in their plain,ordinary and popular sense.bawden american cent.ins.additionally,when two constructions may be given a contract,one of which would render it valid and the other of which would destroy it,the former construction will be given it,if it is reasonable.merriman,at.any ambiguity in a real covenant must be resolved in favor of the unrestricted use of land.providence square,cir applying virginia law.
the pr provides,in relevant part,that n o part of the property shall be used for an automobile service station,petroleum station,gasoline station,or for other purposes not relevant to this issue unless any such use is in connection with the operation of the property as a bp branded service station.j.as bp expert stated in his report,
the terms automobile service station,petroleum station and gasoline station are common names referring to a retail facility that offers fuel and in some cases automotive repair services depending on the context,service station or automobile service station could mean a retail facility that provides gas only,gasoline and convenience merchandise,gasoline and a car wash,gasoline and automotive repair services,or a combination of gasoline with any number of these goods or services.
in the industry,however,service station or automobile service station would never mean a facility that provides automotive repair services only.
this understanding is in line with the common meaning of service station.see webster encyclopedic unabridged dictionary of the english language noting that service station is a synonym of gas station and is defined as a place equipped for servicing automobiles,as by selling gasoline and oil,making repairs.thus,while a service station might offer services,under the common meaning of the term,a service station would necessarily sell gasoline as well.furthermore,the notion that service station and gas station are synonymous is hardly unlikely in light of the fact that the third term included in the list,petroleum station,has the same meaning as well.see andrews american health life ins,applying the maxim noscitur a sociis,which instructs that the meaning of a word takes color and expression from the purport of the entire phrase of which it is a part,and it must be read in harmony with its context.
even if the meaning of service station were not plain outside the context of this agreement,it certainly is plain within the context of the agreement.the purpose of the pr from bp perspective was to secure stanley long term branded fuel sale commitment by making sure that any gasoline sold on the property would be.see the guaranteed length of the supply commitment is a critical element in determining the value of the location.bp had no interest in prohibiting stanley from operating an auto repair shop that did not sell fuel.
for all of these reasons,even assuming that the pr is ambiguous and we do not believe that it is the restriction must be interpreted narrowly to allow liberal use of the land,see providence square,at,and to favor the enforcement of the agreement,see merriman,at.see also bayside virginia super food fair stores,explaining that courts should give effect to the plain intention of the parties who agree to accept certain restrictions instead of seeking ingenious subtleties of interpretation by which to evade such restrictions internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we conclude that the pr does not prohibit stanley from operating a vehicle repair business on his property so long as the business does not also sell gasoline.
bp next challenges the district court conclusion that the pr is overbroad because it prohibits the business of selling,offering for sale,storage,handling,distributing or dealing in kerosene,benzol,naphtha,greases,lubricating oils or lubricants in any form,or other petroleum or petroleum related products unless any such use is in
