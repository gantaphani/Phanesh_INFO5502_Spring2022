between and,nicsand and were the only nationwide suppliers in the market for automotive sandpaper,and they competed for the business of six large retailers,which controlled of the market and which with one exception offered their shelf space on an exclusive basis for a year at a time.nicsand developed this niche market and eventually gained a share of it.between and,however,it lost most of the market when offered the large retailers greater discounts and longer exclusive agreements than nicsand had offered in the past or apparently was willing to offer in the future.
when nicsand filed an antitrust lawsuit to complain about conduct,the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of antitrust standing and,more particularly,for lack of a cognizable antitrust injury.because did not engage in,because five of the six large retailers demanded exclusivity as a precondition for doing business,because the allegations show no more than that competed with its rival on the same essential terms that nicsand and the large retailers had already established for this market and because the antitrust laws in the end protect competition,not competitors,we affirm.
this case comes to us as an appeal from a rule b dismissal.we thus look to nicsand allegations in the complaint in truth,the first amended complaint to determine the details of the the parties are,how the market for automotive sandpaper works and how the parties competed with each other.
the parties.nicsand is an ohio corporation based in berea,ohio,and has been in business since.it makes a variety of products for automotive body repair,including automotive sandpaper technically speaking,coated abrasives,which consumers use before,during or after painting a car or truck.sales of automotive sandpaper accounted for of nicsand revenue in.is a delaware corporation based in maplewood,minnesota.in addition to making a variety of other products,produces automotive sandpaper.
the market for automotive sandpaper.nicsand largely developed the market for automotive sandpaper,increasing the number of products offered in the market from in to in.am.compl.the development of the market,nicsand claims,was fueled primarily by its superior marketing,superior packaging,innovation,and superior value.id.
between and,just two companies supplied automotive sandpaper and related products in the national market nicsand and.as of,nicsand was the dominant player,holding a share of the market.
nicsand and did not sell their automotive sandpaper products directly to consumers they instead relied on retailers to distribute the products through a highly concentrated retail market.id.in,just six large auto parts,autozone,csk auto,kmart,pep boys,of the retail market,while smaller retailers divided up the remaining of the market.
perhaps due to the relatively small value of the market,five of the six large retailers sold just one brand of the product at a time,meaning they permitted nicsand or,but not both,to sell its products at the stores.id.in order to simplify planning and reduce costs,the large retailers also these agreements just once a year,giving the supplier a de facto exclusive agreement with each retailer.id.in order to replace an existing supplier of automotive sandpaper,a new supplier not only had to offer favorable prices but also had to produce a full line of automotive sandpaper,provide racks and other display equipment for the retailer,provide a discount on the retailer first order and purchase the retailer existing supply of the sandpaper.because the large retailers typically restocked the full line of sandpaper products five to seven times a year,buying out a retailer existing supply of the sandpaper could cost a supplier up to to of its annual revenues from that retailer.
nicsand complied with these requirements in seeking to obtain the large retailers business,and by every measure it succeeded.by,it was the exclusive supplier for four of the large retailers kmart,advance auto,csk auto and autozone.and along with it supplied pep boys,the one large retailer that did not insist on an exclusive agreement.
was the sole supplier of the sixth large.nicsand did could for this business,because sought a single supplier that could meet all of its sandpaper needs,which included providing two products that nicsand did not make sandpaper for power tool and paint departments.
nicsand made substantial profits on its agreements with four of the six large retailers.in,nicsand annual sales to kmart totaled with profit margins of.in,its sales to advance auto totaled with margins of,and its sales to csk auto totaled with margins of.in,its sales to autozone totaled with margins of.
competition between the two companies from through.according to nicsand,sought to monopolize the market for automotive sandpaper beginning in.to that end,offered kmart in as an incentive to switch suppliers and to enter into an explicit or sub rosa agreement for several years.id.kmart accepted offer and told nicsand that it would not review price quotes from nicsand for a few years.id.emphasis omitted.
one year later,did the same thing with advance auto and csk auto,offering the one and the other to switch suppliers and to enter into agreements.id.advance auto and csk auto accepted offers and refused to discuss switching suppliers with nicsand for at least a few years.id.
two years later,in,offered a similar deal to autozone,which long had been nicsand largest customer.offered autozone to switch suppliers and to enter a agreement.id.autozone accepted the offer.when contacted by nicsand,autozone refused to discuss switching back to nicsand as a supplier for at least a few years.id.
by,nicsand only remaining customers were pep boys which sold nicsand and products and several smaller retailers.with a significant drop in its sales volume,nicsand lost its economies of scale its raw material costs increased dramatically,id.and it could no longer fill existing orders at an appropriate cost,id.because nicsand could no longer compete,it left the market for automotive sandpaper in and sought to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code.id.since leaving the market,nicsand alleges that retailers though it makes no allegations about suppliers like have raised consumer prices for automotive sandpaper by as much as.
the complaint.on december,nicsand filed this lawsuit under of the clayton act,claiming that had monopolized,or attempted to monopolize,the market for automotive sandpaper in violation of of the sherman act.see.the complaint sought to recover nicsand lost profits or the value of nicsand business and to treble those damages as permitted under the antitrust laws.compl.at.the district court dismissed the complaint under rule b for lack of antitrust standing because nicsand failed to plead an injury to competition resulting from conduct.wl,at.
at first glance,one might fairly wonder whether a complaint like this one should be dismissed for lack of antitrust standing.standing,in a conventional article iii sense,requires just proof of actual injury,causation and redressability.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.and nicsand readily satisfies these requirements it was injured when it lost these accounts caused the injury when it offered better terms to the retailers than nicsand had offered in the past and nicsand request for damages will redress its injury by permitting it to recover the,three times the made before entered the picture.seemingly making matters easier for nicsand,we look at its complaint through the prism of rule b,requiring us to accept all of its allegations and all reasonable inferences from them as true.paytel joint venture city of detroit,cir.
yet antitrust standing and article iii standing are not one and the same,and we not only we claims under rule b when antitrust standing is missing.in the first place,an antitrust claimant must do more than make allegations of consequential harm resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws,and that is true even when the complaint is buttressed by an allegation of intent to harm the claimant.associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters,d.even when a complaint makes these allegations,it may not proceed when o ther relevant nature of the claimant injury,the tenuous and speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the claimant alleged injury,the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages,and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged heavily against judicial enforcement.id.most pertinently for our purposes,antitrust standing ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.atl.richfield usa petroleum,d.far from being a mere technicality,antitrust standing is the glue that cements each suit with the purposes of the antitrust laws,and prevents abuses of those laws by claimants seeking to halt the strategic behavior of rivals that increases,rather than reduces,competition.hypoint,cir.
in the second place,antitrust standing is a threshold,inquiry and when a complaint by its terms fails to establish this requirement we must dismiss it as a matter of the antitrust laws become a sword rather than the shield against conduct that congress meant them to be.it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery,but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.bell atl.twombly,d.given the limited success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse and the threat that discovery expense will push defendants to settle even anemic cases before reaching those proceedings,id.at,the federal courts have been reasonably aggressive in weeding out meritless antitrust claims at the pleading stage,valley prods.landmark,cir see bell.at s omething beyond the mere possibility of relief must be alleged,lest a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim be allowed to take up the time of a number of other people,with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement value.internal quotation marks omitted.
for these reasons,it should come as no surprise that,in the seminal antitrust standing case,the supreme court dismissed the claim under rule b.see associated contractors,at.and our court has dismissed numerous lawsuits for lack of antitrust standing under rule b.see indeck energy servs.consumers energy,cir valley,at hodges wsm,cir peck motors,cir apperson fleet carrier,cir tennessean truckstop,nts,cir axis,micafil,cir southaven land malone hyde,cir see also,wine liquor,cir,park radiology,methodist health,wl,at cir dry methodist med.ctr.of oak ridge,wl,at cir.
of the various requirements for establishing antitrust standing,the one that concerns us here is antitrust injury,which is a necessary,but not always sufficient,condition of antitrust standing.cargill,monfort of,d.an antitrust claimant must show more than merely an injury causally linked to a competitive practice it must prove antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d emphasis added.at a minimum,this requirement means that one competitor may not use the antitrust laws to sue a rival merely for vigorous or intensified competition.i t is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from continued competition,cargill,at.quoting brunswick,at.second alteration in original,because t he antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition not competitors,brunswick,at.quoting brown shoe united states,d see id.prohibiting competitor claim where the claimant sought in damages the profits they would have realized had competition been reduced.accordingly,even though a claimant alleges that an injury is causally related to an antitrust violation,it will not qualify as antitrust injury unless it is attributable to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny.atl.richfield,at.
moreover,a naked assertion of antitrust injury,the supreme court has made clear,is not enough an antitrust claimant must put forth factual allegations plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with antitrust injury.bell.at see id.at a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do a complaint must have enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an antitrust injury occurred.internal quotation marks omitted id.at t he threshold requirement of rule a is that the plain statement in the complaint possess enough heft to show that the pleader is entitled to relief.internal quotation marks omitted id.a naked assertion gets the complaint close to stating a claim,but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.
all of this is not to say that one competitor may never sue another under the antitrust laws.but courts typically have permitted such claims to proceed only when one of the rivals has engaged in some form of predatory pricing or illegal the rival has engaged in something more than vigorous price,product or service competition.see,eastman kodak image technical,d illegal tying utah pie cont l baking,d predatory pricing spirit airlines,nw.airlines,cir predatory pricing lepage,cir illegal tying bell cherokee aviation,cir illegal tying.
in attempting to satisfy this requirement,nicsand targets three of competitive tactics the payments that offered to the four retailers the terms of the agreements between and the retailers and the exclusive nature of these agreements.because the injury and damages suffered by nicsand from these competitive practices,however,do not match the rationale for finding an antitrust violation,hypoint,at indeed flow from the kind of competition that the antitrust laws were designed to has not established a cognizable antitrust injury.
the discounts.nicsand first complains about the cash payment s that offered four of the large retailers to obtain their business to kmart in,to advance auto in,to csk auto in and million to autozone in.br.at see am.compl.even after accounting for these payments,however,nicsand concedes that did not engage in any form of predatory concedes in other words that did not sell automotive sandpaper below cost with the goal of recouping its losses by charging monopolistic prices later.see nicsand mem.in opp.to mot.to dismiss,ja nicsand amended complaint is not premised on predatory pricing.reply br.at.
given this concession and given the realities of this market,payments do not show antitrust injury.if the payments,when combined with the price terms that offered each of these large retailers,are not predatory,any losses flowing from them can not be said to stem from an anticompetitive aspect of defendant conduct.it is in the interest of competition to permit firms to engage in vigorous competition,including price competition.atl.richfield,at internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.the market conditions at the time made these offers,according to nicsand own allegations,buttress the point.in,this market consisted primarily of six large retailers,and nicsand was the sole supplier of four of them.nicsand controlled of the market and earned profit margins on its sales to these four retailers.am.compl.nicsand gives no explanation why it has a right to preserve the antitrust laws no a product,sandpaper,that so far as the complaint is concerned does not take any ingenuity to make.
rather than upsetting the goals of the antitrust laws,the payments furthered them.the payments are nothing more than price reductions offered to the buyers for the exclusive right to supply a set of stores under contracts.augusta news hudson news,cir.c utting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition and mistaken inferences in cases such as this one are especially costly,because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.we must be concerned lest a rule or precedent that authorizes a search for a particular type of undesirable pricing behavior end up by discouraging legitimate price competition.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord verizon commc ns law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d.it would be ironic indeed if the standards for establishing antitrust injury were so low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool for keeping prices high.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.
one of the existing barriers to entry in this market,moreover,required suppliers to offer payments.before they would consider switching suppliers,the large retailers required new suppliers to offer to purchase the retailer existing supply of automotive sandpaper and provide a discount on the retailer first order.together these demands could cost a new supplier up to of its first year revenues.see am.compl.all of this goes to show that,by offering discounts to the retailers,was merely offering them something that,generically speaking,they already insisted on receiving.that offered greater discounts,though still discounts,to win the retailers business does not offend the antitrust laws,much less undermine the competitive environment those laws were designed to foster.
the terms.just as advances amounted to legitimate competition,so did its decision to enter into agreements.once again,did nothing more than compete on terms that the market already required.a supplier does not violate the antitrust laws by offering a agreement in a market in which the retailers already require de facto agreements.see id.if the buyers in a market demand one thing,the antitrust laws do not prohibit an entrant from offering that same thing on slightly different terms.verizon commc ns,at.antitrust analysis must always be attuned to the particular structure and circumstances of the industry at issue.eastman kodak,at.noting the importance of considering actual market realities when reviewing an antitrust claim.
from the perspective of a retailer,agreements permit the retailer to insist that the supplier charge lower prices.committing to a agreement,indeed,is no different from buying in bulk.from the perspective of a supplier,agreements ease an aspiring entrant ability to clear existing market barriers.here,the large retailers demanded that a new supplier buy out the former supplier products and offer a discount on the first sale,all at a cost of up to of the new supplier first year sales.it is far easier for a market entrant to clear these barriers when it is given several years,rather than just one,to recoup this investment.see areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application a temporary purchase commitment that overcomes an entry barrier increases rather than reduces competition.
had used illegal tying to obtain a agreement,that might be another matter.but nicsand makes no such allegation.reply br.at disclaiming any such contention.what nicsand complains about instead is a quid pro rather than a agreement for in return for a substantial price discount rather than a smaller discount for the retailers.having previously paid nicsand prices generating profit margins,the large retailers can not be blamed for accepting better prices with for several years,not just one.
contrary to nicsand suggestion,the nature of the agreements makes the accompanying advances less troublesome,not more so.it is true,as nicsand repeatedly asserts,that the advances made by to the retailers outpaced nicsand yearly profits from sales to each of those retailers.see reply br.at supp.br.at.but given a reasonable estimate of the length of these several year agreements,say three to five years,nicsand complaint itself demonstrates that it could have competed for the exact same agreements with its customers.am.compl.had nicsand approached its customers with similar deals,it could have expected profit margins of on its sales to kmart,advance auto,csk auto and autozone.id.while these margins would have been lower than the margins nicsand realized before entrance into the market,nicsand offers no explanation why this modest reduction in profit margins on a product of this sort is a concern of the antitrust laws.
the exclusivity of the agreements.unable to show that it suffered an antitrust injury from vigorous price competition and unable to show that it suffered an antitrust injury from offer to extend the agreements to cover at least a few years,id,nicsand argues that the exclusivity of the agreements establishes the requisite injury.while exclusive agreements in some instances may create impermissible barriers for new entrants to a market and may permit a supplier to charge monopoly prices,see tampa nashville coal,d,nicsand has not can not tenably it suffered these anticompetitive effects.
as with nicsand other complaints,so here we can not ignore the demands of the marketplace in which these agreements arose.antitrust analysis must always be attuned to the particular structure and circumstances of the industry at issue.verizon commc ns,at.see bell.at noting that industry history may provide a natural explanation for conduct.according to nicsand own complaint,all but one of the large retailers made exclusivity a condition for doing business with a new supplier.nicsand of course complied with this requirement and several others in obtaining the business it held in,and complied with this requirement and several others in winning some of that business away.if retailers have made supplier exclusivity a barrier to entry,one can not bring an antitrust claim against a supplier for acquiescing to that requirement.put another way,nicsand has not sued because it wants to share shelf space with its competitor it sued because it wants that shelf space all to as it had it in.this is just the kind of competitor claim that the antitrust laws do not protect.
nor can nicsand plausibly argue that the exclusivity requirement created entry barriers for it in this market.before,nicsand controlled of the market and used the existing barriers to product reviews and exclusive shelf preserve its lock on the market.from to,competed for and won the business of four retailers that nicsand formerly supplied.through it all,however,nicsand was not a potential market entrant it was the market leader.yet nicsand offers no explanation why it could not compete for these agreements nor why in view of its high margins it could not match discounts.as the market leader,nicsand was on the inside looking out,and for whatever reason the company chose not to compete.see areeda hovenkamp,supra,of course,a foreclosure alleged to be illegal because it deters entry does not injure a plaintiff already in the market.impeding the entry of others grants a benefit to those already in the market.footnote omitted.
to the extent exclusivity created a market barrier,it was that faced the problem,and it was that overcame it.in,according to the complaint,won the business of kmart with its several years offer as the incumbent,nicsand had every opportunity to compete and yet it failed to do so.in,overcame a similar hurdle in obtaining the business of advance auto and csk auto again,nicsand faced no such barrier and yet still failed to compete.in,when nicsand was the exclusive supplier of only one retailer,it still controlled a substantial portion of the market due to the volume of its business with autozone.compare am.compl.in sales to autozone,with id.in sales to kmart,id.in sales to advance auto,and id.in sales to csk auto.yet successfully competed for autozone business.though nicsand declared bankruptcy in,it says nothing in the complaint about efforts before then to recoup the business from kmart which entered the agreement in or from advance auto or csk auto which entered the agreements in.nor does size make a difference to the disposition of these allegations.see brunswick,at.yet respondents injury bears no relationship to the size of its competitor.respondents would have suffered the identical loss but no compensable injury had the acquired centers instead been purchased by shallow pocket parents thus,respondents injury was not of the type that the statute was intended to forestall.internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,nicsand simply has not alleged facts establishing that the agreements in and of themselves created barriers that caused it a cognizable antitrust injury.see bell.at holding that plaintiffs must allege enough facts to nudge their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.
nicsand injury also does not stem from alleged monopolization of the market.for most of the time nicsand was losing business,it retained control of a significant share of the market.while nicsand complains about the discounts offered,it does not allege that was selling below cost,and the numbers nicsand itself offers demonstrate that advances were comfortably within nicsand profit margins.while nicsand loss of business may have propelled into a dominant market position,its injury does not correspond to any allegedly anticompetitive effect on the market but rather a truly competitive one.
any doubt about the appropriate resolution of this case can be laid to rest by indeck energy services consumers energy,cir.there an energy supplier indeck alleged that a competitor consumers energy violated the antitrust laws by signing an exclusive supply contract with general motors for a period of five to ten years.id.at.the contract came on the heels of similar contracts with other large customers,through all of which consumers energy succeeded in excluding competition from over percent of the relevant at risk market.id.internal quotation marks omitted.central to the resolution of that case,as to this one,was that the only harm allegedly suffered by indeck was in the company capacity as a competitor in the marketplace,not as a defender of marketplace competition.id.at.
indeck was the harder case.consumers energy controlled of the market when its contracts preserved its hold on the market,while nicsand controlled of the market when it began losing its hold on the market.consumers energy entered into longer exclusive contracts years than did several years,few years or.and consumers energy did not unseat the dominant market leader as did but instead hindered a potential market entrant.indeck was hardly a dominant supplier of energy,as it provided cogeneration services recycling factory waste to create energy,which diminish a customer need for traditional energy rather than supply such energy.indeck,in short,was more akin far more akin to a market entrant than nicsand.
in its en banc papers,nicsand does not claim that indeck or for that matter any of our precedents should be overruled but insists that it can be on the ground that today case involves a series of contracts with several retailers as opposed to several contracts with one retailer.as a result,it submits,while indeck harm resulted only from competition,nicsand suffered not simply as a single competitor in the market,but as a proxy for all competitors and thus for all competition.but this seems to invert the relative vices and virtues of the two fact patterns.while nicsand originally held all of the contracts with the retailers in question and lost them to competition,indeck lost out on a single contract and alleged that it found itself in a market where a single dominant firm controlled of the market with exclusive contracts of years with all of the major industrial and commercial customers.if the harm to the market is the entry barriers established by exclusive contracts,it is indeck,not nicsand,that makes the better proxy for injury to competition in the market rather than harm to a competitor.nicsand had the opportunity to compete for each of the contracts,while indeck never had that opportunity because of the existing exclusive contracts.nonetheless,we concluded in indeck that there was no harm to competition because indeck failed to allege how the exclusive contracts have injured competition,especially in light of the discounted rates offered to the customers,in light of the fact that the exclusive contracts were of limited duration,and in light of the fact that the customers were free to seek other providers at the conclusion of the contracts.at.we rested our decision on these grounds,and these grounds control us nicsand,if anything,having the less compelling complaint.when one exclusive dealer is replaced by another exclusive dealer,the victim of the competition does not state an antitrust injury.see areeda hovenkamp,supra,clearly not a victim of antitrust injury is the exclusive dealing partner whose business relationship was terminated in favor of a different exclusive dealing partner.
nicsand next maintains that indeck can be distinguished on the ground that exclusive dealing arrangements have eliminated a superior product,noting that nicsand allegedly provides a better variety of products and better service than.indeck,it is true,noted that antitrust actions by marketplace competitors must at least allege that exclusion of the competitor from the marketplace results in the elimination of a superior product or a alternative because these developments might show that competition itself was harmed by an act of the defendant.at.but the court still rejected indeck claim even though the company had alleged that its competitor conduct caused the market to become less diversified because indeck provided alternative sources of electrical power,namely thermal power,while its competitor supplied only traditional electrical power.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as indeck suggests,then,such an allegation may be necessary to establish antitrust standing for a competitor,but it is not sufficient.under nicsand reading,every competitor could proceed to discovery and avoid showing a true antitrust injury by asserting an unelaborated claim that it provides better service than its competitors.indeck did not permit such a pleading and neither will we.
even aside from indeck,nicsand suggests in its en banc papers,and the dissent echos the point,that it is an efficient defender of the marketplace because the retailers face a collective action problem.dissent at.in its view,this collective action no retailer will accept the higher prices of one supplier in order to keep competition in the supply market when all the other retailers are accepting lower prices from a potentially emergent monopolist competitor standing in exclusive dealing cases.nicsand,however,did not raise this argument in the district court,and accordingly it is waived.
what we have said here does not mean that a potential competitor may never bring an antitrust claim for exclusive dealing.had the large retailers and conspired to eliminate nicsand from the market,that would be another matter.and should use these contracts and its current market dominance to establish unreasonable barriers to entry in the future,a potential competitor might have a legitimate antitrust claim.nor is this to say that the future competitiveness of the market lacks protection if chooses to impose monopolist prices down the road.aggrieved retailers would have standing to sue for treble damages if that occurred.see indeck,at a s the direct victim of the alleged antitrust violation in this regard,the customer could prosecute its own cause of action should it deem the actions of the supplier inappropriate.the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party such as the plaintiff to perform the office of a private attorney general.denying the plaintiff a remedy on the basis of its allegations in this case is not likely to leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.associated contractors,at.footnote omitted.
but to allow this litigation to continue on these allegations is to allow one monopolist to sue a competitor for seizing its market position by charging less for its goods.nicsand took advantage of the very same exclusivity it now attacks to charge prices that made it vulnerable to offers in the first place.if does the same by charging excessive prices itself,it will expose itself either to competition or to a legitimate antitrust complaint from retailers or excluded competitors.but until then,as the district court rightly concluded,nicsand has suffered no antitrust injury,and until then nicsand has no antitrust standing to bring this case.
the dissent worries that our decision will drive out all but the omniscient antitrust plaintiffs that happen to know every relevant factual detail before the inception of litigation.dissent at.that is not true,and there is no reason this decision should have any such effect.the key failing in nicsand complaint is not that it has too few details but that it has too many.while we must accept all of a claimant allegations as true at this stage of a case,that does not mean we must ignore those allegations when they defeat the claim and when they show the claimant is doing nothing more than invoking the antitrust laws to protect a competitor,not competition.see brunswick,at.in considerable detail,nicsand amended complaint explained the market for automotive sandpaper,see am.compl,explained that the relevant retailers demanded exclusivity by refusing to stock more than one brand of the sandpaper at a time,see id,explained that the relevant retailers had de facto exclusive agreements with their suppliers,see id,explained how all of the relevant retailers demanded payments before they would switch suppliers,see id,highlighted nicsand domination of that market under these precise conditions,see id,detailed the profit margins nicsand earned before entered the picture presumably to enhance nicsand request for treble damages,see id,and spelled out the amounts of the discounts that offered four of the retailers,see id.
confirming what the details in its amended complaint showed,nicsand disclaimed in its response to the rule b motion that had engaged in predatory pricing or illegal tying.when the complaint itself gives reasons to doubt plaintiff theory,bell.at,and when later pleadings confirm those doubts,it is not our task to resuscitate the claim but to put it to rest.nothing prevents a plaintiff from pleading itself out of court,which is all that happened here.
the dissent suggests that we can resuscitate this claim by returning to nicsand what it has given claim.when a party concedes that it is not bringing a claim,however,no purpose of rule b is served by overlooking the concession,and there is nothing misleading,dissent at,about reading and accepting the concession.plainly and simply,the company acknowledged that nicsand amended complaint is not premised on predatory pricing.ja reply br.at.the plaintiff remains the master of its complaint,and when it says that it is not bringing a claim,we should take it at its word.
nor,to be fair to nicsand counsel,was this an unusual concession to make.p redatory pricing schemes are rarely tried,and even more rarely successful.matsushita,at.success requires not just pricing but a product market that will allow the monopolist to raise prices later without the threat of new market entrants.id.at.nicsand,in short,had ample reasons for conceding that did not engage in a scheme,and we should accept the concession.
the claim also can not be revived based on the allegation that retail prices have risen a total of since nicsand left the market.dissent at.an allegation about retail prices in the context of a case against a supplier does not by itself show that the supplier engaged in anticompetitive conduct and does not show that nicsand injury flows from that which makes acts unlawful.brunswick,at.res ipsa loquitur is not a theory of antitrust injury,and it surely is not one after the supreme court decision in bell atlantic,which set out to eliminate this kind of loose antitrust pleading.just as in bell atlantic,where the court held that,w ithout more,parallel conduct does not suggest conspiracy.at,so here a price increase by retailers,without more,does not suggest anticompetitive behavior by suppliers.nicsand speculations show at most the possibility of an entitlement to relief,which is just what bell atlantic said would not suffice at the pleading stage,id.requiring allegations plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with an entitlement to relief.while it is assuredly true that bell atlantic in fact makes simpler the task before us in this case than it was before the supreme court decision,dissent at,it is hard to see how that decision makes it simpler to rule in the plaintiff favor,as the dissent contends,id.
the dissent adds that i t is not the appropriate response under the law to answer anticompetitive conduct with more anticompetitive conduct,suggesting that the only way nicsand could have responded to courtship of nicsand customers over a period would be to compete illegally.id.at.but why compete illegally if,as nicsand amended complaint says,it had margins before entered the competitive picture such profits surely left nicsand negotiating options over a period between competing illegally and invoking the antitrust laws to preserve these margins.
the dissent expresses skepticism about our decision in indeck,relying on a commentator who has questioned the decision.see id.at.but no party to this case,as we have noted,has asked us to reconsider indeck.and,what is more,the central criticism leveled by the commentator concerns the statement in indeck upon which the dissent principally relies,id.at requirement that the antitrust plaintiff must show the elimination of a superior product or a alternative,indeck,at see ronald davis,standing on shaky ground the strangely elusive doctrine of antitrust injury,antitrust.as we have explained,op.at,indeck language need not detain us here because it is at most a necessary,but not a sufficient,condition for proving antitrust standing.see indeck,at a competitor plaintiff must at least allege injury to the market.emphasis added.and nicsand can not meet another necessary it suffered an antitrust injury,as opposed to the ill effects of price competition,which understandably hurts,dissent at,but which does not by itself state a cognizable antitrust claim.see op.at.otherwise,every time an allegedly superior product or a alternative was eliminated from the market by competition,the producer of that product would have antitrust standing.that is not what indeck said or did.
for these reasons,we affirm.

as noted by the majority,our main concern in this case is whether nicsand has sufficiently alleged not only standing under article iii of the constitution,but also standing under the antitrust laws.to be sure,this is a more onerous task than that faced by most civil plaintiffs.yet this task,though challenging,should not be insurmountable.nicsand must allege more than mere economic injury,for the antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.brunswick pueblo,d quoting brown shoe united states,d.as the majority correctly notes,nicsand must show that the injury it suffered is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.id.at.that is,the injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.id.despite what the majority holds today,nicsand has alleged that type of injury in this case.
the supreme court has articulated certain factors to be analyzed in determining whether a plaintiff has established antitrust standing.indeck energy servs.consumers energy,cir citing associated contractors of,california state council of carpenters,d.those factors include 
the causal connection between the antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff and whether that harm was intended to be caused the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury including the status of the plaintiff as consumer or competitor in the relevant market the directness or indirectness of the injury,and the related inquiry of whether the damages are speculative the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violation.

this case comes before us on appeal from the district court grant of motion to dismiss.the supreme court recently clarified the standard an antitrust plaintiff must satisfy at this stage,holding that an antitrust plaintiff need only provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that he is entitled to relief,so that the defendant has fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.bell atl.twombly,d citations omitted although many commentators have intimated that bell atlantic represents a significant departure from prior law,the decision in fact makes simpler the task before us in this case.
in bell atlantic,the court explained that a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,the key distinction is between a complaint asserting only the elements of a claim and a complaint asserting not only legal elements,but also facts to support those elements.courts are to distinguish between the two.indeed,we do so all the time when reviewing questions of fact,mixed questions of law and fact,and questions of law.it is not a controversial assertion that,while a plaintiff need not assert detailed facts,a plaintiff must assert some facts.without some factual allegation in the complaint,it is hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the requirement of providing not only fair notice of the nature of the claim,but also grounds on which the claim rests.id.at citing wright miller,at,rule a contemplates the statement of circumstances,occurrences,and events in support of the claim presented and does not authorize a pleader bare averment that he wants relief and is entitled to it.thus,at the b stage,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.id.at citations omitted.
nicsand complaint establishes a right to relief above the speculative level.notably,nicsand has provided detailed factual allegations regarding the payments made by to retailers,the years in which exclusive contracts were entered,and the approximate duration of the contracts.in particular,with regard to the duration of the exclusive contracts,nicsand has alleged a reasonable basis for inferring that they will last a few wit,that the retailers told nicsand that they could not even discuss the possibility of doing business with nicsand for at least a few years.these factual allegations must be taken as true.potentially relevant information may be missing from the complaint,but it is exactly this additional information that,with the benefit of discovery,may entitle nicsand to relief.yet following today decision,it is difficult to see how any antitrust of those few omniscient plaintiffs that happen to know every relevant factual detail before the inception of litigation and without the benefit of be able to overcome a motion to dismiss.see freightliner of knoxville,daimlerchrysler vans,llc,cir plaintiff claims under the act may well be highly speculative,and discovery may well reveal that they are futile,but we can the district such a determination based on the pleadings alone.
for a number of years,nicsand had a significant share of the market for retail automotive coated abrasives.nicsand sold its products through a handful of retailers and was its only competitor agreements between suppliers and retailers for these products lasted one year in the de facto sense because retailers did not want to change their inventories.according to nicsand complaint,pushed retailers into a series of exclusive dealing arrangements,excluding nicsand from the market.the terms of these exclusive agreements,and their harm to consumers by the creation of a monopoly,form the crux of this case.
the new agreements drastically changed the market and were more than simply a regurgitation of the old agreements with slightly different terms.op.at.for one thing,offered unprecedented substantial,cash payments to retailers.for another,contractually guaranteed exclusivity with retailers,cutting nicsand out of the market for an extended period of time.pushed retailers,including nicsand clients,into the exclusive agreements.
first,let us focus on cash payments.using figures provided in the complaint,we are presented with the following picture for each of the four relevant big retailers 
kmart in,nicsand sales to kmart were per year and its profits were per year.in,executed a contract with kmart which provided for a payment in excess of.this payment is equal to approximately of nicsand sales to kmart and of nicsand annual profits on sales to kmart from the prior year 
advance auto in,nicsand sales to advance auto were and its profits were.in,executed a contract with advance auto which provided for a payment of over.this payment is equal to approximately of nicsand sales to advance auto and of nicsand annual profits on sales to advance auto from the prior year.
csk in,nicsand sales to csk were and its profits were.in,executed a contract with csk which provided for a payment of over.this payment is equal to approximately of nicsand sales to kmart and of nicsand annual profits on sales to csk from the prior year.
autozone in,nicsand sales to autozone were and its profits were.in and,executed a contract with autozone which provided for a payments totaling over.the annual value of these payments is equal to approximately of nicsand sales to autozone and of nicsand annual profits on sales to autozone from the prior year.
as these numbers demonstrate,cash payments exceeded nicsand profits from the prior year for three of the retailers.in other words,from through,signed agreements with three retailers,the terms of which nicsand could not possibly match on an individual basis without selling below action that may have given a cause of action under the sherman act.see weyerhaeuser hardwood lumber,d.
if sales coupled with substantial cash payments to those retailers would have resulted in a loss for nicsand,then it is a reasonable inference that they may have been below cost for as well.however,it is obvious that without discovery nicsand would have had no way of knowing with certainty production or other overhead costs.it is telling that,in its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss,noted that nicsand had made no allegation regarding how nicsand purports to measure costs.ja.this is the very purpose of discovery in a civil case.it simply can not be that a business must know everything about its competitors before bringing suit in an antitrust case.after all,a business that knows everything about its competitors is likely to dominate them,rather than fall prey to them,as nicsand did here.
the majority is quick to point out that nicsand concedes that did not engage in any form of predatory pricing.op.at citing ja and reply br.this assertion is misleading.in saying that its complaint is not based on predatory pricing,nicsand is simply stating that conduct is not premised on the type of conduct typically referred to as predatory pricing,that is,the pricing of an individual item below the cost of its production.black law dictionary ed defining predatory pricing as u nlawful pricing intended to eliminate specific competitors and reduce overall competition.in other words,nicsand allegations do not pertain to the price terms offered by but rather to the unprecedented and unusually large cash payments used by to secure agreements.ja.while nicsand did not use the magic words predatory pricing in its complaint,the allegations that charged competitive prices and offered substantial,payments,negating any possible profits,amounts to the same thing.thus,the conduct alleged by nicsand,a form of predatory pricing,is still predatory conduct that hurts,and in this case eliminated,competition.see id.at.as nicsand aptly notes in its response to motion to dismiss,t he point is not that supracompetitive payments crossed the predatory pricing line,but that they were part and parcel of a different,but equally insidious,form of predatory,anticompetitive,conduct.id.
in fact,the majority,when defending the terms of agreements,seems to acknowledge that effectively sold below cost.the majority explains that it would be easier for a supplier such as to gain a foothold in the market when it is given several years,rather than just one,to recoup this investment.op.at.the investment that would recoup is the loss it took by offering substantial,payments.those payments,upon further discovery,might be revealed to have effectively amounted to pricing.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d the success of any predatory scheme depends on maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator losses and to harvest some additional gain.
perhaps recognizing that nicsand would have lost money had it offered matching payments to three out of the four retailers,asks this court to compare nicsand aggregate profits from four individual retailers in four individual years kmart in,advance auto in,csk in,and autozone in to the aggregate of payments over a later period.by aggregating in this manner,attempts to gloss over the fact that nicsand would have had to have sold below cost to three out of the four retailers.this approach asks us to read nicsand complaint in the light most favorable to.nevertheless,even under that improper approach,there is a small margin for error.according to,the aggregate data for nicsand would yield a profit margin of merely five meager profit indeed 
the poor quality of the data at issue makes this potential five percent profit margin hinge on several levels of assumptions,which could could not through discovery.to be sure,on this record,we have little choice but to compare profit data for nicsand last year with a particular retailer to the amount of payment to that retailer in the subsequent year.that is the best we can do because nicsand was eliminated from the market,and therefore was not around long enough to develop its own profit data in the later years.but when we aggregate this data,we are forced to use assumptions about how well nicsand might have performed in the market with respect to individual retailers in years after secured contracts with them,and to compare those assumptions with the actual payments made by.moreover,the data fails to account either for inflation or for any line of credit nicsand may have had,such that the estimated profit margin may contain significant inaccuracy.and,the data also fails to account for the fact that these agreements were made in secret,thereby depriving nicsand of an opportunity to compete by offering comparable deals.in order to avoid elimination from the market,nicsand not only would have had to match payments,but also presumably would have had to pay the cost of inducing a retailer to breach its exclusive contract with.in contrast,did not have to bear that cost because the exclusivity of the prior agreements was merely de could switch at any time without penalty.
given the multiple levels of uncertainty incorporated into analysis,it is impossible to tell how accurate or solid that predicted profit margin is,or whether,indeed,nicsand would have lost money in the aggregate.that realization is more troubling in light of the obviously sequential conduct that took place in this case.acquired three retailers over a series of years,each time employing allegedly anticompetitive agreements.only in the final year,when nicsand was already on its last legs,was able to recoup its losses on its deals with the other three retailers by securing a more favorable agreement with autozone.given our duty to read the facts in the light most favorable to nicsand in this case,it is simply impossible to conclude that these agreements were not anticompetitive 
in addition to downplaying the importance of substantial payments,the majority is also untroubled by the exclusivity of the agreements or the agreements terms.the majority claims that the type of exclusivity demanded by is the same type of exclusivity that retailers demanded prior to market dominance.but according to nicsand complaint,under the retailers rules,exclusivity lasted no longer than the completion of one purchase order.retailers were free to switch suppliers from one purchase order to the next.see complaint r etailers would typically not change suppliers other than at the time of their annual line review.emphasis added.a retailer carrying products was free to suddenly solicit nicsand line of products.or alternatively,a retailer was free to do what pep boys both suppliers lines simultaneously.although it appears that in reality,retailers opted to stick with one supplier for a full year,these agreements were,at most,de facto exclusive in the sense that once a retailer decided to receive its inventory from one supplier,it was unlikely to switch suppliers for one year.thus,while an individual retailer perhaps wisely chose to keep one supplier product on its shelves for a period of one year,that retailer was simply not contractually bound to do so.there were no actual exclusive dealing agreements prior to.rather,there were four retailers choosing an economically reasonable course of business,and two suppliers competing fairly for that business and even so,agreements with suppliers were reconsidered every year during annual line reviews under this system,although nicsand may have been the more successful competitor in the market for a time,it alleges its success was owed to its superior marketing,superior packing,innovation,and superior value,id,not to anticompetitive practices.
contrary to the majority averments,nicsand should not have sought arrangements with retailers like did.it is not the appropriate response under the law to answer anticompetitive conduct with more anticompetitive conduct.moreover,in a battle for a monopoly between nicsand and,it is hard to imagine how nicsand could have prevailed.given the choice between a certain amount of money in one payment or in installments over several years,any reasonable retailer would have chosen the former.that is simply economics.is a manufacturing powerhouse that obviously had the ability to subsidize its operations in the market with revenues from other sectors nicsand,in contrast,may not have had the capital to match substantial payments and may not have been able to do so without selling below cost.the majority opinion lacks a certain understanding of the relative positions of the two companies at issue in this case.
in sum,under a plausible reading of nicsand complaint,did the following.first,it offered retailers unprecedented and substantial that may have,in effect,been a form of pricing.executed contracts with retailers that gave exclusivity for several years in order to guarantee time to recoup any losses.this exclusivity,when paired with its agreements with other retailers,also gave a large enough share of the market such that its sole competitor,nicsand,would no longer be able to stay afloat.these agreements guaranteed a monopoly in the market.nicsand allegations of anticompetitive conduct are further bolstered by the fact that nicsand was forced into bankruptcy,id,now controls almost of the market share,id,and prices for these products have risen by since nicsand left the market,id.as discussed below,with this monopoly now established,no longer has to worry about keeping a superior and diverse product line or keeping its prices low.
in indeck,we explained that in a case where a competitor sues another competitor for an alleged antitrust violation,the plaintiff must at least allege that its exclusion from the marketplace results in the elimination of a superior product or a alternative.at since this case comes before us at the b stage,we must focus on nicsand particular allegations of harm to the market.to do so,we need look only to nicsand complaint,which alleges,in pertinent part 
the growth in nicsand market share between and in diy retail automotive coated abrasives was fueled primarily by nicsand superior marketing,superior packaging,innovation,and superior value.nicsand acquired and retained its share of that market by offering better value than its competitors,providing delivery,instituting innovative programs designed to assist diy retailers in increasing their volume and profitability in the diy retail automotive coated abrasives market,offering more products in less space,offering flexible payment terms,packaging each of its products in a manner consistent with that product market orientation,and,creating new specialty products at the request of customers.
as a result of attempted monopolization monopolization of the market for diy retail automotive coated abrasives,consumer prices for diy retail automotive coated abrasives have risen significantly,in some cases,as much as.

consumers have suffered as a result of unlawful monopolization of the diy retail automotive coated abrasives market,as prices have increased and selection has decreased substantially since established its monopoly.
under a fair reading of the quoted paragraphs,nicsand has met indeck requirements.first,it has alleged that its products were superior to products.given that superior is a comparative term and that was nicsand only competitor during the relevant period,see complaint nicsand only competitor in the diy retail automotive coated abrasives market during the period to was,nicsand complaint could only have been alleging that its products were superior to.nicsand claimed superiority in several senses superior marketing,superior packing,innovation,and superior value.id.see also id.did not offer a superior product,superior pricing,or superior service.
the majority complains,however,that what nicsand offers us is simply an unelaborated claim that it provides better service than its competitors.op.at.neither b nor indeck requires much,if any,further elaboration.nevertheless,nicsand does in fact explain what it means,noting that it provided better value,delivery,and innovative programs designed to assist diy retailers in increasing their volume and profitability in the diy retail automotive coated abrasives market,offering more products in less space.complaint.nicsand also touts its flexible payment terms,packaging,and perhaps most importantly,its creat ion of new specialty products at the request of customers.id.in addition to the allegation of superior products and service,nicsand also alleges that since established its monopoly,the selection of products has decreased substantially.id.thus,nicsand has alleged a decrease not only in product quality,but also in market diversity.while nicsand certainly could have alleged that its sandpaper had a better coefficient of friction than,or something else to similar effect,nicsand does not need to supply such detailed factual information at the pleading stage,without the benefit of discovery.
nicsand has also alleged that since its departure from the market,consumer prices for diy retail automotive coated abrasives have risen significantly,in some cases,as much as.id.see also id.p rices have increased since established its monopoly.nicsand has sufficiently alleged that its exclusion has result ed in the elimination of a alternative,which in turn indicat es that competition itself was harmed by conduct.indeck,at emphasis in original.in other words,as a result of eliminating its only competitor through a series of exclusive dealing contracts,competition was lessened,and prices increased as a result.and indeed,price increases of this magnitude certainly injure consumers.this type of problem goes to the heart of what the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.reiter sonotone,d the essence of the antitrust laws is to ensure fair price competition in an open market.
although the majority dispenses with these factual allegations by concluding that nicsand has not alleged that raised its prices,op.at,it is a reasonable inference that at least some portion of the price increase could be due to monopoly.the idea that the retailers might be passing on some additional cost from should not be controversial.northwest airlines county of kent,d thomas,dissenting any cost an airline bears is in some sense an indirect charge on persons traveling in air commerce,because the airline ultimately will pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher ticket prices.acadia motors ford motor,cir i t is quite commonplace for manufacturers and other regulated entities to pass on to retailers and consumers their costs of complying with regulatory statutes.yet the majority believes this is not good enough,taking aim at nicsand for not specifying that the apparent increase in prices was due to actions by and not by retailers.to dismiss this case on the pleadings on that basis defeats the whole point of notice pleading.when retailers raise prices,they do not include on their price tags a footnote outlining their reasons.at this point,before discovery,all nicsand can go by is what it sees in stores,and its allegations based on those observations raise a reasonable inference that has used its monopoly power to increase prices.nothing more should be required.
the majority apparently believes that nicsand has merely alleged that conduct caused the market to become less diversified,and argues that indeck stands for the proposition that less diversity in the marketplace,standing alone,is insufficient to establish antitrust standing.op.at.as discussed above,that is not all nicsand alleged in its complaint.however,assuming arguendo that all nicsand has alleged is that the market has become less diverse,i would part ways with the majority on its result because this less diverse market is now clearly a monopoly and the facts,as alleged by nicsand,show that the special dangers inherent in monopoly power may exist in this case.von grocery,at.
antitrust cases focus on exclusion from the relevant market,and the relevant market usually has characteristics that pertain to the case at hand.diversity is valuable in any marketplace,but more so in some than in others.in indeck,the relevant market was one for the commodity of electric power.the relevant question about the diversity of the market was whether the exclusion of thermal power from the market,in and of itself,was enough to establish antitrust standing.the indeck court apparently believed that it was not.however,the electric power market is entirely different from the market at issue in this case.in most markets for electric power,it is not the substantial,maintenance,and regulatory costs of operating a power there to exist exclusive agreements with one producer.tampa electric nashville coal,d upholding a requirements contract between a public utility and a coal mining company,and noting that at least in the case of public utilities the assurance of a steady and ample supply of fuel is necessary in the public interest.but,exclusive contracts are obviously less essential in a market that supplies a product to consumers that is hardly a necessary commodity,the production of which does not require as substantial an investment of capital as does a power plant,and that,as the majority quips,does not take any ingenuity to make.op.at.and,since prices of electricity are usually regulated in some fashion by a governmenta
