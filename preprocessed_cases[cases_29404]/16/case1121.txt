this appeal requires us to consider the application of a evidentiary rule known as the fiduciary exception to the privilege.under this exception to the privilege,certain fiduciaries who obtain legal advice in the execution of their fiduciary obligations are precluded from asserting the privilege against their beneficiaries.although the fiduciary exception has been adopted by a number of other federal courts of appeals,we have not yet had the opportunity to decide whether the rule should apply within our circuit.we decline to make that decision today because we hold that,even if we were to adopt the fiduciary exception,the exception would not apply to the defendants in this case.for this reason,we will vacate the order of the district court requiring the production of otherwise privileged communications.
factual and procedural background 
health net of new jersey,sells and maintains health insurance policies for employee benefit plans.the company offers a variety of policies,covering services by health maintenance organizations,preferred provider organizations,and policies.is a subsidiary of health net of the northeast.health net,hni is the corporate parent not only of and but also of other subsidiary insurance companies that provide medical benefits to participants in benefit plans established under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.although certain policy formulation and administrative services are shared among the health net companies,a subsidiary is responsible for deciding claims in accordance with these policies and for paying claims to participants from the subsidiary assets.hni and its subsidiaries do not hold or manage the assets of their customer benefit plans.rather,the health net subsidiaries sell insurance policies to the plans.when a plan beneficiary submits a claim,the subsidiary will process the claim and,if appropriate,pay the beneficiary from the subsidiary own funds.similarly,when hni or any of the subsidiaries obtains legal advice,counsel is paid from hni or the subsidiary funds.neither hni nor any of the subsidiaries is a plan administrator or trustee for any of the benefit plans.
the plaintiffs are beneficiaries of two different employee benefit plans that purchased policies from.under the plaintiffs policies,health care providers are classified as or.when beneficiaries obtain care from providers,they must pay a higher share of the cost than they would had they obtained care from providers.in determining what percentage of an charge will pay,will look to the usual,customary,and reasonable ucr charge for the service provided.in defining ucr charges,health net companies rely on data contained in certain national databases.the plaintiffs allege that relied on antiquated data and improper methods to define ucr charges,thereby violating both new jersey law and the health net companies duties as statutory fiduciaries under erisa.the plaintiffs filed suit under of erisa to recover benefits and to redress the alleged violations of fiduciary duties and failure to supply information to beneficiaries.
on august,the district court for the district of new jersey consolidated the plaintiffs cases and granted class certification to a national class of beneficiaries.hni,and collectively,health net appealed the certification.on september,we issued a stay order,requiring that the district court refrain from holding any trial,or entering any judgment that would have the effect of resolving any claims or issues affecting the disputed class until this court has issued its ruling deciding the pending appeal under rule f on june,we vacated the class certification order and remanded for further certification proceedings.
during the pendency of the rule f appeal,the district court moved forward on issues of discovery.on june,the district court assigned a special master to examine documents listed on defendants privilege logs to determine whether the documents were discoverable.the special master reviewed over documents in health net first eleven privilege logs.after determining which documents were protected as or privileged as communications,the special master considered whether any of those documents were nonetheless discoverable pursuant to the fiduciary exception to the privilege.he recognized that the exception has not been considered within our circuit,but he concluded that,given the opportunity,we would adopt the fiduciary exception and apply it to health net.having found that certain communications related to fiduciary acts by health net and were not prepared in connection with adversarial proceedings against the beneficiaries,the special master ordered health net to produce those communications.
health net appealed this ruling to the district court.in addition,hni moved for summary judgment,arguing that it was not an erisa fiduciary and therefore owed no fiduciary obligations to the plaintiffs.the district court,in an order entered may,denied hni motion for summary judgment,finding that hni exerted sufficient control over operations at for the court to hold hni liable as a fiduciary.in the same order,the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the special master and ordered the production of all documents on privilege logs which the special master had determined should be produced.because of the district court finding regarding hni status as a fiduciary,this production order applied to communications with hni in addition to communications with the other health net defendants.health net appeals the may order on the basis that the district court wrongly applied the fiduciary exception and wrongly determined hni status as a fiduciary.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under because the plaintiffs claims arise under of erisa.we have appellate jurisdiction under to review the district court order of may,ordering the production of certain documents.though not a final resolution of the case,an order for the production of documents over which a privilege is asserted is appealable as finally resolving a collateral discovery issue.cohen beneficial indus.loan.in re ford motor,cir.thus,insofar as health net contends that the district court improperly ordered the discovery of privileged documents,its appeal is properly before us.
hni has also appealed the district court summary judgment determination regarding hni status as an erisa fiduciary.ordinarily,an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not an appealable final order to the contrary,it is an order permitting litigation to continue.robinson hartzell propeller,cir.nonetheless,hni urges us to consider the issue and vacate the order denying summary judgment.
hni argues that we have jurisdiction to vacate the order because the district court,in denying hni motion for summary judgment,violated our stay order of september.this argument lacks merit.our stay order prevented the district court from entering judgments affecting the disputed class during the pendency of health net rule f appeal.the question whether hni was a fiduciary is wholly independent of the question whether the class was properly certified 
hni also contends that we must review hni fiduciary status as part of our resolution of the discovery question properly before us.however,because we hold that the disputed documents are privileged no matter how heavily involved hni may have been in the daily operations of its subsidiaries,we do not need to consider hni fiduciary status.we conclude,therefore,that we do not have jurisdiction at this time to hear the appeal of the denial of summary judgment.
we exercise de novo review over issues of law underlying the application of the privilege.doe,cir.we review the application of that law for abuse of discretion.id.
iii.discussion 
we confront an issue of first impression.although the fiduciary exception has been recognized in many of our sister circuits,see becher long island lighting lilco,cir wildbur arco chemical,cir fausek white,cir bland fiatallis north am,cir united states mett,cir cox adm r steel carnegie,cir in re lindsey,cert.denied,d,and even by district courts within our own circuit,see,arcuri trump taj mahal associates,dome petroleum employers mut.liab.ins,in re sunrise securities litigation,valente pepsico,we have not yet decided whether or to what extent the exception applies in the third circuit.see depenbrock cigna,cir.
we recognize that in a number of circuits it is that the fiduciary exception can apply to erisa fiduciaries.see,lilco,at wildbur,at bland,at mett,at.moreover,concedes that it is a fiduciary under erisa because it has authority to process individual beneficiaries insurance claims.under erisa,an entity is considered a fiduciary to the extent that,inter alia,it holds any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of an employee benefit plan.a iii interpreting this provision,the supreme court has held that an insurance company with discretionary responsibility over the award of benefits under an employee benefit plan acts as a fiduciary under erisa.see aetna health davila,d t he ultimate decisionmaker in a plan regarding an award of benefits must be a fiduciary and must be acting as a fiduciary when determining a participant or beneficiary claim.accordingly,at least to the extent that has discretion to determine claims covered by its policies,it is an erisa fiduciary.health net characterizes a subsidiary as a claims fiduciary under if the subsidiary exercises discretion in making claims decisions under insured plans.health net maintains,however,that no health net entity is a fiduciary for any other purpose.we need not examine the particulars of the fiduciary obligations of the health net companies,except to note that is not a plan administrator or trustee and that its fiduciary status arises out of its discretionary authority over the payment of benefits owed to plan beneficiaries.
health net contends that the fiduciary exception recognized at common law does not apply to every entity which is designated a fiduciary under erisa.instead,it argues that a fiduciary such as insurance company which contracts with multiple employee benefit plans to provide health insurance to,processes and pays claims using its own assets,obtains legal advice using its own funds,and operates with an eye toward outside the scope of the fiduciary exception.to our knowledge,no court has considered whether the fiduciary exception to the federal attorney client privilege applies with equal force to all fiduciaries under erisa.it is that question which we now confront.
history and development of the fiduciary exception 
we will begin our consideration with an historical review of the privilege and the development of the fiduciary exception.in england,the right to testimonial compulsion was still in its infancy.along with the emergence of this right to compel testimony there also arose an privilege.wigmore,evidence mcnaughton.jurists originally justified the privilege as necessary to protect an attorney point of honor to refrain from divulging the secrets of his clients.however,by the late,a new policy underlying the privilege took hold.jurists reasoned that to promote the freedom of consultation of legal advisers by clients,the apprehension of compelled disclosure by the legal advisors must be removed id.at.this policy has survived as the modern justification for the privilege.id.at.
as we cross centuries to reach the federal rules of evidence,we find that the common law development of the privilege continues in the federal courts of the united states.under federal rule of evidence,evidentiary privileges shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.rule requires the federal courts,in determining the nature and scope of an evidentiary privilege,to engage in the sort of analysis that is central to adjudication.see upjohn united states.consistent with this analytical dictate,federal courts have long recognized the applicability of the privilege,the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law,id.at,and it is well established that c onfidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance are privileged.fisher united states,d.the policy behind the privilege is equally well established full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients must be encouraged because the administration of justice in a complex society depends upon the availability of sound legal advice,and in turn,the soundness of legal advice depends upon clients willingness to present full disclosures to their attorneys.see upjohn,at.
for centuries,the common law has also recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public has a right to every man evidence and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional,being so many derogations from a positive general rule.wigmore at.because the privilege has this effect of withholding relevant information from,federal courts must apply it only where necessary to achieve its purpose.fisher,at.as a result,the limitations which have been developed under the common law all are consistent with the purpose of encouraging clients to speak fully with their lawyers without concern that what they say to the lawyer will be disclosed.see swidler berlin united states,d.where this purpose ends,so too does the protection of the privilege.
for example,because the purpose of the privilege is to promote the dissemination of sound legal advice,the privilege will extend only to advice which is legal in nature.where a lawyer provides business advice,the communication is not privileged.wigmore at in re lindsey,at.similarly,the protections of the privilege are restricted to those communications which are made in confidence,since a client who speaks openly or in the presence of a third party needs no promise of confidentiality to induce disclosure.wigmore at westinghouse republic of philippines,cir.as for two clients having a common legal interest who are represented by the same attorney,the confidentiality requirement means that,although communications between a client and the attorney may be privileged as to outsiders,they are not privileged inter sese.wigmore at matter of grand jury subpoena duces tecum dated november.on the other hand,the administration of justice is not improved by protecting communications designed to further a crime or a fraud such communications consequently fall outside the scope of the privilege.united states zolin,d.to these exceptions,many courts have added fiduciary exception.the fiduciary exception first emerged in england as a principle of trust law.under english common law,when a trustee obtained legal advice relating to his administration of the trust,and not in anticipation of adversarial legal proceedings against him,the beneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of that advice.see talbot marshfield,drew sm,eng.ch.see also wynne humbertson,beav,eng.the theory of the rule was that the trustee obtained the advice using both the authority and the funds of the trust,and that the benefit of advice regarding the administration of the trust ran to the beneficiaries.talbot,drew sm.at,eng.at.the rule recognized in talbot and wynne quickly became at english common law.see,in re mason,ch.
it was not,however,until the that the fiduciary exception found its way into american case law.american courts adopted the exception in two separate and shareholder suits.the application to trusts was the more of the two,as it involved a direct application of the principles enunciated in talbot and wynne.in riggs bank of,zimmer,the delaware court of chancery held that the beneficiaries of a trust were entitled to discover a legal memorandum which had been prepared for their trustees in connection with matters of trust administration,and for which the trustees had paid using trust assets.noting that american case law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee in this context,the court looked back to talbot,wynne,and mason and found a clear and applicable rule of trusts.id.at.in applying this rule,the court found the memorandum to be discoverable for two reasons.first,the court placed a great deal of weight on the duty of a trustee to furnish information to the trust beneficiaries.id.at.second,the court found the memorandum discoverable for the equally compelling reason that it determined that counsel real whom,under longstanding principle,the privilege the beneficiaries,not the trustees whom the court described as mere representatives.id.at.identification of the real client was informed by several factors the content of the advice was for the benefit of the trust,not the trustees the advice was paid for with assets of the trust,not the trustees and no adversarial proceeding against the trustees was pending,meaning that the trustees had no need to seek personal legal advice.id.at.indeed,the court noted that a trustee who properly executes his duties acts only on behalf of the beneficiaries.id.in this sense,the fiduciary exception is something of a misnomer because it is the beneficiary,rather than the trustee,who is the client component of the privilege.
although the discussion in riggs is focused on principles of trust law,american application of the fiduciary exception has not been limited to the trust context.even before riggs was decided,the fifth circuit held in garner wolfinbarger,cir,that in a shareholder action,legal advice given to corporate managers by corporate counsel for the benefit of the corporation was not privileged.the court recognized that corporate managers,and even sometimes the corporate entity,may have interests adverse to some or all of the shareholders,particularly because shareholders varying ownership interests mean that shareholders interests often are not uniform.id.at.the court concluded that when all is said and done the management is not managing for itself.id.central to this conclusion was the fundamental fact that corporate managers in the ordinary course can have no legitimate personal interests for which the advice of corporate counsel paid for from corporate funds is needed.when a legitimate personal interest does as when a corporate manager is sued by manager then becomes entitled to legal advice which is not discoverable by the shareholders.thus,of central importance in both garner and riggs was the fiduciary lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained.at.
scope of the fiduciary exception under erisa 
in the early,federal courts began extending the principles of garner and riggs to apply against erisa fiduciaries.first,in,the fiduciary exception was used to render discoverable communications by pension fund officials regarding the administration of the fund.donovan fitzsimmons.the court relied on both garner and riggs to hold that,where beneficiaries sue their fiduciaries alleging breaches of fiduciary duty,the privilege does not attach to legal advice rendered to the fiduciaries for assistance in the performance of fiduciary duties.id.at.most notably,the court recognized that the garner rule might not apply in every fiduciary situation but found it applicable to the erisa fiduciaries before it because of the strong parallels to the trustee situation in riggs.id.at.
it is not surprising that the court found the analogy between trust law and erisa to be apt the supreme court has recognized that fiduciary duties under erisa draw much of their content from the common law of trusts,the law that governed most benefit plans before erisa enactment.varity howe,d.
the following year,another federal district court applied the fiduciary exception in an erisa action.see newspaper guild,local v.the washington star.for our purposes,the case is most significant for the broad,sweeping language with which the court asserted that w hen an attorney advises a fiduciary about a matter dealing with the administration of an employees benefit plan,the attorney client is not the fiduciary personally but,rather,the trust beneficiaries.id.at.on its face,this language suggests that the court holding applies to any erisa fiduciary acting in its fiduciary capacity,regardless of whether the fiduciary is a plan administrator,trustee,or a statutory fiduciary.such a reading would be unjustified.the court analysis focused on the responsibilities of trustees the defendants in that case were the trustees and the sponsor of an plan.the court simply did not consider whether the fiduciary exception applied with equal force to all erisa fiduciaries,its broad language notwithstanding.
since donovan and washington star were decided,many other courts have applied the fiduciary exception to erisa fiduciaries.just as the riggs court recognized that the exception was premised on both the beneficiaries right to inspection and their identity as the real clients,courts applying the fiduciary exception to erisa fiduciaries have cited these same rationales.see mett,at.these courts also have recognized two types of situations in which the fiduciary exception does not apply.first,under the liability exception,a fiduciary,seeking the advice of counsel for its own personal defense in contemplation of adversarial proceedings against its beneficiaries,retains the privilege.mett,at riggs,at.second,under the settlor exception,courts distinguish between fiduciary acts and settlor acts,the former being discretionary acts of plan administration and the latter involving the adoption,modification,or termination of an employee benefit plan.see a iii aetna,at.lockheed spink,d.the fiduciary exception does not apply to settlor acts because such acts are more akin to those of a trust settlor than they are to those of a trustee.see lockheed,at.bland,at.
these two exceptions to the fiduciary exceptions share a common allow the privilege to remain intact for an erisa fiduciary when its interests diverge sufficiently from those of the beneficiaries that the justifications for the fiduciary exception no longer outweigh the policy underlying the privilege.the beneficiaries are no longer the real clients,and disclosure of communications is no longer an obligation.
erisa fiduciaries,however,come in many shapes and sizes,and we do not believe that the logic underlying the fiduciary exception applies equally to all.we conclude that the fiduciary exception does not apply to an insurer like and its corporate parents because the are not the real clients obtaining legal representation.
in some respects,an insurer providing benefits to the beneficiaries of an plan is no differently situated than a plan administrator or an erisa trustee.all are considered to be fiduciaries under erisa,and all owe duties of loyalty and care to their beneficiaries.because they are fiduciaries,they must act in furtherance of their beneficiaries interests.nonetheless,significant differences exist between insurance company fiduciaries such as and other erisa fiduciaries to whom the fiduciary exception has been applied.
identity of the client 
the first significant difference is the identity of the entity for whom the legal advice is given.when a contractual service provider such as obtains legal advice regarding the execution of its fiduciary obligations,the beneficiaries of the customer benefit plans are not the real clients.we look to four factors in reaching this conclusion.the first is the ownership of the assets.in situations in which the fiduciary exception traditionally has been applied,the fiduciary is managing assets over which it lacks ownership rights.for instance,a trustee,by definition,manages a trust res it does not own because the trust separates ownership from management,the trustee can have no legitimate personal interest in the trust funds or its management.see riggs,at.similarly,a corporate manager manages assets owned by the shareholders of the corporation in contrast,although erisa typically requires that plan assets be held in trust,a,this requirement is excepted for insurance companies providing insurance contracts.b.although disposition of its assets may be limited by its contractual and statutory obligations,legal title to the assets nonetheless remains with.this convergence of management and ownership places an insurer like in a different position than other erisa fiduciaries to whom the fiduciary exception has been applied,and dem
