this appeal arises out of disputes between puerto rico telephone company,prtc and sprintcom,sprint concerning the intercarrier compensation due under an interconnection agreement the agreement,which they entered into in june.prtc and sprint both appeal from the district court decision in,telecommns.regulatory,d,where the court upheld an order of the telecommunications regulatory board of puerto rico the board adjudicating the disputes at issue.on appeal,prtc argues that the board order violated federal law and misinterpreted the agreement insofar as it mandated that pursuant to the terms of the agreement provision prtc and sprint were to reciprocally compensate each other for traffic in accordance with the interim compensation regime set forth by the federal communications commission fcc in the isp remand order sprint,on the other hand,from the district court decision upholding the board dismissal of sprint claims on a separate albeit related dispute in which sprint alleged that prtc had overcharged it for the termination of transit traffic.for the reasons stated below,we reverse in part and affirm in part the district court decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
regulatory background 
we provide some background of the regulatory framework under the telecommunications act of the act to set up the issues on appeal.some of our prior cases provide further background as to the general operation of this statute.see,centennial license telecomms.regulatory,cir global naps,verizon new eng.gnaps vi,cir,cert.denied sub nom gangi verizon new,d global naps,verizon new,gnaps v,cir global naps,verizon new,gnaps iv,cir global naps,inc verizon new,gnaps iii,cir global naps.dep t of telecomm.energy,gnaps ii,cir global naps,verizon new,gnaps i,cir.
prior to the enactment of the act,telephone services were provided mainly by incumbent local exchange carriers lecs who operated as monopolies.see centennial license,at.in order to end the local telephone monopolies and promote competition,the act,inter alia,removed all state barriers to entry,see,mandated that all telecommunications carriers interconnect with one another,see id.a,and imposed special obligations on incumbent lecs to mitigate their dominant market position,including the duty to share their telecommunications facilities and services with their rivals,competing lecs,id.c.see centennial license,at.
allows customers of one lec to call the customers of another,with the calling party lec the originating carrier transporting the call to the connection point,where the called party lec the terminating carrier takes over and transports the call to its end point.verizon,peevey,cir.to ensure that each lec is fairly compensated for these calls,the act requires all lecs both incumbent and competing to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b see also.under a reciprocal compensation arrangement,each of the two carriers receives compensation from the other carrier for the transport and termination on each carrier network facilities of telecommunications traffic that originates on the network facilities of the other carrier.e.
an assumption behind this reciprocal compensation system was that traffic back and forth on these interconnected networks would be relatively balanced such that no carrier would disproportionately benefit from the reciprocal payments.see gnaps v,at isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.the rise of internet access,however,disturbed this balance and created an opportunity for classic regulatory arbitrage see gnaps v,at isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.specifically,because internet service providers isps receive a high volume of calls and typically originate very few calls,some lecs began to heavily solicit isps as customers,by providing free services or even paying their isp customers so that such lecs would collect,instead of pay,reciprocal compensation.see gnaps v,at.this created a number of market distortions that hurt competition.isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.
the first addressed the issue of reciprocal compensation over calls in february,when it promulgated a ruling later vacated by the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that classified calls as calls that did not qualify for reciprocal compensation under b.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommun.act of,fcc rcd.hereinafter,isp order,vacated,bell atl.fcc.the fcc said,however,that because the fcc had no rule governing compensation for traffic,parties could voluntarily include this traffic within the scope of their interconnection agreements under sections and of the act,even if these statutory provisions did not apply as a matter of law.isp order,fcc rcd.at.the fcc added that pending adoption of an fcc rule establishing an appropriate interstate compensation mechanism,it had no reason to interfere with state commission findings as to whether reciprocal compensation provisions of interconnection agreements apply to traffic.id.at.the circuit,however,vacated isp order and remanded to the fcc,holding that the fcc had not satisfactorily explained its analysis for classifying calls.see bell atl.fcc,at.
on remand,the fcc issued in april the isp remand order in which the fcc reexamined the grounds for its previous conclusion that b did not mandate reciprocal compensation for traffic.see isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.this time using a different reason the fcc again conclude d that traffic was not subject to the reciprocal compensation provisions of section b.id.at.in addition,the fcc found that it had the authority under to establish rules governing intercarrier compensation for traffic.id.at.pursuant to this authority,the fcc stated that it would examine the desirability of adopting a uniform intercarrier compensation mechanism applicable to all traffic exchanged among telecommunications carriers,and,in that context,would examine the merits of a bill and keep compensation regime for all traffic,including traffic.id.at.the fcc,however,concluded that in order to address the then existing market distortions and avoid a flash cut to a new compensation regime an interim solution was necessary.id.at.thus,under the isp remand order,the fcc imposed an interim intercarrier compensation regime for traffic the isp remand order compensation regime comprising a hybrid mechanism that included,inter alia,the following.
rate caps.the fcc imposed declining caps on intercarrier compensation rates for traffic,starting at per mou on the effective date of the isp remand order and stabilizing,months thereafter,at per mou,id.at.
mirroring rule.because the fcc believed i t would be unwise as a policy matter,and patently unfair to have allowed incumbent lecs to benefit from lower rates for intercarrier compensation of traffic for which incumbent lecs were usually,while they benefitted from higher rates for traffic subject to reciprocal compensation under b for which incumbent lecs were generally net payees,the fcc imposed a special mirroring rule.id.at.this rule established that t he rate caps for traffic adopt ed by the fcc under the isp remand order apply only if an incumbent lec offers to exchange all traffic subject to section b at the same rate.id.however,those incumbent lecs that choose not to offer to exchange section b traffic subject to the same rate caps adopted by the fcc for traffic,are ordered to exchange traffic at the or reciprocal compensation rates reflected in their contracts.id.at.the isp remand order allowed incumbent lecs to make this election on a basis.id.at.in sum,the mirroring rule ensures that incumbent lecs will pay the same rates for traffic that they receive for section b traffic.id.at.the fcc asserted that this was the correct policy result,since it saw no reason why there should be different rates for and voice traffic.id.at.
this isp remand order compensation regime became effective starting june.gnaps ii,at.by its own terms,however,this regime does not apply in all situations.rather,to avoid upsetting contractual expectations,the isp remand order establishes that the isp remand order compensation regime applies as carriers expired or expiring interconnection agreements and does not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.
similar to isp order,the isp remand order was challenged before the circuit,which again found the fcc alleged basis to be lacking and rejected the fcc reliance on g.worldcom,at.this time,however,the circuit decided not to vacate the fcc order and instead remanded the case in for the fcc to provide an alternative legal justification for the compensation rules adopted under the isp remand order.id.thus,the isp remand order remained in force.
the fcc,however,delayed in responding to the circuit remand in worldcom,causing the circuit to grant a writ of mandamus ordering that the fcc respond to the remand in the form of a final,appealable order that explains the legal authority for the commission interim intercarrier compensation rules that exclude traffic from the reciprocal compensation requirement of b.in re core commc ns.the fcc complied in november by promulgating a new order addressing its authority to regulate isp traffic.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime,intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic hereinafter,second isp remand order,fcc rcd.in the second isp remand order,the fcc provided yet another basis for its authority to regulate traffic,namely,that although traffic falls within the scope of section b,this interstate,interexchange traffic is to be afforded different treatment from other section b traffic pursuant to the fcc authority under section and i of the act.second isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.on review,the circuit accepted the fcc new legal justification for the isp remand order interim compensation regime and affirmed.see core commc ns,fcc.
ii.facts and procedural history 
the material facts for the resolution of this case are not in dispute.because this appeal involves two distinct albeit related disputes,we divide our discussion of the facts into two sections accordingly and generally discuss the facts relevant to each dispute separately.
dispute over whether the isp remand order altered the agreement 
prtc,a puerto rico corporation,is a telecommunications carrier and incumbent lec under the jurisdiction of the board and the fcc that provides local exchange,exchange access and long distance services in puerto rico.sprint,a kansas corporation authorized to do business in puerto rico,is a communications common carrier and telecommunications carrier providing commercial mobile services,commercial mobile radio services,personal communications services,and personal wireless services.
on june,prtc and sprint voluntarily negotiated and entered into the agreement to establish the terms and conditions for interconnection of their networks.the board approved this agreement in accordance with e.the agreement had a initial term,ending june.the parties,however,agreed on multiple occasions to extend its terms beyond this date.specifically,in june,the parties extended the agreement for another year.subsequently,in june,the parties extended it for a term,to september.then,in september,prtc and sprint extended it indefinitely with automatic renewal every thirty days until written notice of termination by either party.the agreement finally terminated on august.prtc does not dispute that,during each of these extensions,it never offered sprint the rate caps established under the isp remand order.it is also undisputed that sprint never specifically asked that prtc make such an offer.rather,the agreement was extended each time under the same terms and conditions.nevertheless,sprint has never argued that the agreement was ever an expired or expiring agreement,within the meaning of the isp remand order,during or prior to such agreement extensions.
effective july,prtc entered into an interconnection agreement with a competitor known as centennial in puerto rico,which contained rates for reciprocal compensation based on the rate caps established by the fcc under the isp remand order.prtc never notified other competitors of this.nevertheless,on december,during negotiations between prtc and at t wireless another competitor,the latter became aware that prtc had offered the isp remand order rate caps to centennial and requested that it also receive the same treatment.as a result of the negotiations,prtc amended its interconnection agreement with at t wireless in,effective june,to include rates for reciprocal compensation based on the isp remand order rate caps.
in august,sprint became aware that prtc had offered the isp remand order rate caps to competitors.sprint,however,concedes that prior to august it neither asked prtc nor reviewed prtc publicly filed interconnection agreements to ascertain this information.
shortly thereafter in august,sprint informed prtc of its belief that the isp remand order triggered the provision in the agreement.in addition,sprint requested that prtc amend the then existing agreement and that such amendment be effective as of the date prtc first implemented the isp remand order rate caps with another carrier,july.prtc,however,rejected both sprint construction of the agreement and its request for implementation of the isp remand order rate caps as of july.prtc thus continued to invoice sprint based on the reciprocal compensation rates set forth in the agreement price schedule,which resulted in a composite reciprocal compensation rate of approximately mou,which is much higher than the isp remand order rate caps.
after various discussions,matters escalated on march,when sprint began to unilaterally adjust prtc charges for reciprocal compensation,transit traffic and reverse toll billing by applying the isp remand order capped rate of.prtc responded on may,warning that it would terminate services to sprint unless sprint paid the amounts withheld.
thereafter,on may,sprint filed a complaint with the board that sought to enjoin prtc from terminating and for a ruling that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision as of the date prtc began exchanging traffic with another competitor in puerto rico pursuant to the isp remand order rate caps,july,thus entitling sprint to the application of the isp remand order rate caps as of such date.prtc responded with a counterclaim seeking payment for reciprocal compensation at the rates set forth in the agreement price schedule.
the following timeline illustrates the relevant dates concerning prtc and sprint dispute over the applicable intercarrier compensation rates for traffic.
june.prtc and sprint enter into the agreement,which has a one year initial term.
april.fcc issues the isp remand order.
june.the isp remand order compensation regime set forth in the isp remand order becomes effective.
june.prtc and sprint extend the agreement for one year.
june.prtc and sprint extend the agreement for three months up to september.
july.prtc offers the isp remand order rate caps to centennial,a competitor of sprint.
september.prtc and sprint extend the agreement indefinitely with automatic renewal every thirty days until written notice of termination by either party.
august sprint requests that prtc amend the existing agreement to incorporate the isp remand order rate caps and that such amendment be effective retroactively as of the date prtc first implemented such rate caps with centennial,as of july.
dispute over alleged excess billing for transit traffic 
sprint alleges that,during the discovery period in the aforementioned administrative proceeding,it became aware that prtc reciprocal compensation invoices for the period from december through july charged sprint for transit services at rates that were in excess of the amounts established in the agreement.
thus,on january,while discovery was ongoing,sprint filed a motion with the board for leave to amend its complaint to add a count seeking recoupment of amounts allegedly paid in excess to prtc for transit traffic between december and july.the board granted the motion.
the parties dispute whether the information provided in prtc invoices was reasonably sufficient for sprint to have identified the alleged over billing of transit traffic.nevertheless,it is uncontested that sprint did not object in writing or otherwise to the invoices in question within thirty days after prtc mailed them and that sprint paid the billed amounts to prtc.in fact,the first time sprint objected to the transit traffic charges in these invoices was in december.
decisions of the board and the district court 
the board issued a resolution and order on february,after the parties had filed for summary judgment.
having found that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision,the board ruled in favor of sprint on the isp remand order issue and granted sprint claim for the application of the isp remand order rate caps as of july.the board,however,closed the case without determining the amounts that sprint allegedly overpaid to prtc for reciprocal compensation and without ordering prtc to credit sprint for said amounts.
on the other hand,with respect to the transit traffic over billing dispute,the board found,inter alia,that based on its reading of section.of the agreement the board was convinced of the parties intention to specifically limit objections to the invoices for thirty days after a bill is mailed,a common practice in this type of agreement.the board thus dismissed sprint claims against prtc for alleged excess billing of transit traffic services.
prtc challenged the board order on the isp remand order issue by filing a complaint in the district court.sprint responded by filing a against the board and a against prtc challenging the board dismissal of sprint claims against prtc for the alleged over billing of transit traffic.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court issued an opinion and order on march.
in its order,the district court held in favor of the board and sprint on the isp remand order dispute,ruling that sprint was entitled to the isp remand order rate caps beginning on july,the date prtc offered centennial the isp remand order rates.in addition,the district court granted sprint request that the case be remanded to the board for a determination of the amounts due by prtc to sprint as a result of its decision.also,with respect to sprint claims against prtc on account of the latter alleged over billing of transit traffic,the district court again agreed with the board and dismissed sprint claims this appeal ensued.
iii.appellate jurisdiction 
because federal courts must always be vigilant of their jurisdiction,we begin by analyzing whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying disputes.
a district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.verizon,pub.serv.comm of verizon.i,d quoting steel citizens for better env t,d.
there are two types of actions that fall under the rubric of federal question jurisdiction for purposes of.the first and most familiar category involves direct federal questions that is,suits in which the plaintiff pleads a cause of action that has its roots in federal law say,a claim premised on the united states constitution or on a federal statute.fishermen alliance,dep t of envtl,cir citing am.well works layne bowler.holmes.the second and far more rare category involves embedded federal questions that is,suits in which the plaintiff pleads a cause of action,but that cause of action necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.id.alteration in original quoting grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.
prtc complaint filed in the district court asserted two counts.the first count count alleged that the board order violated the isp remand order,a federal ruling promulgated under the act,because it applied the isp remand order compensation regime to a situation where the fcc did not intend for it to apply.the second count count,however,asserted a contract enforcement action alleging that the board misinterpreted the agreement insofar as it found that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision,and consequently wrongfully applied the isp remand order provisions to the parties dispute.
the parties including the board unanimously aver that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over count under because this count asserts a violation of federal law,and had supplemental jurisdiction under over the remaining claims,namely,count of prtc complaint and sprint claims for recoupment of amounts allegedly billed in excess by prtc concerning transit traffic as explained below,we agree.thus,we express no opinion as to whether federal question jurisdiction under is proper over count,which arguably may be construed as a state law contract enforcement with embedded questions of federal law concerning the application of the isp remand order similarly,we issue no opinion as to whether e granted authority to the district court for reviewing the board interpretation and enforcement of the agreement.verizon.i,at expressly declining to decide whether e can be so construed.
our decision that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over count is compelled by verizon.i,where the supreme court held that federal courts have jurisdiction under over a claim alleging that a state commission order,which mandated reciprocal compensation between two carriers in accordance with the terms of their interconnection agreement,violated the act and a federal ruling.verizon.i,u.at.
similar to verizon.i,count avers a direct violation of federal law by alleging that the board order violated an fcc ruling,in this case the isp remand order.as explained below,although it is unclear whether this claim ultimately has merit,we find that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over it.
the isp remand order expressly states that its interim compensation scheme applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring agreements and does not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.isp remand order,fcc rcd.at.based on these provisions,it is clear that a failure to apply the isp remand order compensation regime in situations where such regime applies by its own terms would violate federal law.it is not so clear,however,whether applying the isp remand order compensation regime in other situations,applying it to an existing interconnection agreement where the applicable contractual provision is not triggered by the isp remand order would constitute a violation of the isp remand order,as prtc alleges,or only a breach of the existing interconnection agreement.nevertheless,for jurisdictional purposes,the question is not whether prtc claim under count would ultimately succeed on the merits,but rather whether the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or whether such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.verizon.i,at internal quotations omitted.because we find that prtc claim under count that the board order violates federal law was not immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or wholly insubstantial and frivolous,we find that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over it.id.
having found that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over prtc claim in count,we conclude that the district court had at least supplemental jurisdiction under over the remaining claims,count of prtc complaint and sprint transit traffic over billing claim.see gnaps vi,at finding that a defendant counterclaim was more than sufficiently related to the plaintiff complaint for purposes of supplemental jurisdiction where b oth parties claims ultimately arose from a dispute over the same agreement and involve d the same basic factual question what fees the carriers owe d each other.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under.
furthermore,although we find that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over prtc claim in count,it is unnecessary for us to resolve on appeal the merits of this claim because,as explained below,we conclude that prtc prevails on its claim under count and thus the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sprint and the board must be reversed insofar as it found that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision.accordingly,with respect to the dispute over the compensation rates for traffic,our analysis will focus on count,which alleged that the board misinterpreted the terms of the agreement provision,and consequently wrongfully applied the isp remand order compensation regime to the agreement.
iv.standard of review 
where as here judicial review is based on the agency record,we apply to the agency ordinary review standards,accepting the district court decision merely as it may be persuasive.centennial license,at.
accordingly,we review de novo the board interpretations of federal and state law.id.in addition,although it is customary where any doubt exists to give some deference to the agency charged with administering a statute,we give no deference to the board interpretation of the act because it is the fcc and not the individual state commissions that has the authority to administer the act through the formulation of policy,rulemaking,and regulation.gnaps iii,at n quoting gnaps i,at.on the other hand,the board interpretation of an interconnection agreement that has been approved by it under the scheme adopted by the act,see e,is generally entitled to some deference.see gnaps v,at citing boston ferc,cir.moreover,although we have not perfectly calibrated the weight to be accorded to such interpretation,we note that if such interpretation is reasonable then at the very least close calls tend to go its way.boston edison,at citing sierra club larson,cir.
on the other hand,where no error of law exists,we review the state agency other determinations under the arbitrary and capricious standard.centennial license,at quoting gnaps i,at.
discussion 
we turn now to the merits of this appeal,which involves two distinct disputes concerning intercarrier compensation under the agreement,namely,the dispute over whether the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision,and the dispute over whether sprint may recoup amounts allegedly over billed by prtc between december and july involving transit traffic.we address these disputes in order.
dispute over whether the isp remand order altered the agreement 
the board concluded in its order that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision and that,in accordance with the isp remand order,the agreement was altered at the moment prtc offered the isp remand order rate caps to centennial.for the reasons stated below,the board order misinterprets the agreement and illustrates a misunderstanding as to the operation of the isp remand order compensation regime particularly,its mirroring rule.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue and remand for further proceedings.
as previously mentioned,the isp remand order establishes that the isp remand order compensation regime applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements and does not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.isp remand order,fcc rcd.at emphasis added.thus,to avoid upsetting contractual expectations,the fcc expressly stated that the isp remand order compensation regime did not apply to or alter interconnection agreements that existed as of the date such regime became effective,june.rather,in the context of then existing agreements,the isp remand order compensation regime only applied if the respective parties had voluntarily agreed that their contract would incorporate such a change of law of voluntary application.
in the present case,sprint has never alleged that the agreement was an expired or expiring agreement at some point prior to august and consequently that the isp remand order compensation regime applied to the parties prior to august as a matter of law.neither did the board address such a possibility in its order.rather,the issue properly before us in this appeal is whether the isp remand order compensation regime triggered the agreement provision.the resolution of this question requires that we interpret the applicable terms of the agreement.
all parties assert that section of the agreement sets forth the agreement provision.this section establishes as follows 
the parties agree that if a regulatory agency or court having jurisdiction finds that the terms of this agreement are inconsistent in one or more material respects with applicable federal or state law or any of its respective decisions,rules or regulations,or a regulatory agency or court having jurisdiction alters or preempts the effect of this agreement,then in the event of the occurrence of or,which occurrence is final and no longer subject to administrative or judicial review,the parties shall immediately commence good faith negotiations to conform this agreement with any such decision,rule,regulation or preemption.the revised agreement shall have an effective date that coincides with the effective date of the original federal or state action giving rise to such negotiations.the parties agree that except as provided herein the rates,terms and conditions of any new agreement shall not be applied retroactively to any period prior to such effective date.
emphasis added.sprint alleged,and the board found,that the isp remand order triggered alternative in the provision cited above.no party has argued that the isp remand order triggered alternative.thus,we also focus our analysis on alternative.
section xxi of the agreement establishes that the agreement construction,interpretation and performance shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth of puerto rico.accordingly,we are guided by the following principles for purposes of construing the agreement terms.
articles through of the puerto rico civil code the civil code govern contract interpretation under puerto rico law.see laws ann.tit.as a basic rule of interpretation,article establishes that i f the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties,the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.laws ann.tit,see also unisys puerto rico,ramallo.printing,wl,when the terms of a contract,its conditions and exclusions,are clear and specific,and leave no room for ambiguity or for diverse interpretations,they should be thus applied citations omitted.however,article also establishes that if the contract language should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties,the intention shall prevail.laws ann.tit,see also marcial tome,noting that although the puerto rico supreme court ordinarily presupposes that the statements expressly set forth in the text of the contract constitute the will of the contracting parties the court will not hesitate to thoroughly examine the true intent of the parties whenever the court has doubts as to such intent.thus,determining the real and common intent of the contracting parties is the fundamental criteria for contract interpretation under puerto rico law.see marcial,at although the starting point of contract interpretation must be the expressions contained in the words,the trier can not stop at the literal sense,but must fundamentally investigate the intent of the parties and the spirit and purpose of the transaction,as they are inferred from the overall conduct of the interested parties and from the concurring circumstances that may contribute to an adequate investigation of the will of the executing parties.in determining the intention of the contracting parties,attention must principally be paid to their acts,contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract.laws ann.tit,see also marcial,at.in addition,i n determining the intent of the contracting parties it is important to take into consideration who the contracting parties are,as well as their experience and expertise with the subject matter of the contract.unisys puerto rico,ramallo.printing,wl,see also laws ann.tit.
our review of the board determination that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision and that the application of such fcc ruling caused the agreement reciprocal compensation rates to be altered as of the date prtc first offered said order rate caps to a competitor requires the following analytical framework.first,it is necessary to determine whether the isp remand order in fact triggered the agreement provision.if we find that it did not,then that ends our inquiry and the board order can not stand.on the other hand,if we were to find that the isp remand order indeed triggered the agreement provision,then we would turn to the second question,which would require that we determine the effect of applying the isp remand order compensation regime to the agreement,examining whether the board correctly found that the effect of applying the isp remand order compensation regime to the agreement was to alter the agreement reciprocal compensation rates as of the date prtc offered the isp remand order rate caps to centennial.as further explained below,our analysis of the first question indicates that the board erred in finding that the isp remand order triggered the agreement provision.we therefore need not address the second question.
the agreement provision established a general rule that all revisions made to the agreement would be effective as of the date in which the agreement was revised by the parties.see section of agreement the parties agree that except as provided herein the rates,terms and conditions of any new agreement shall not be applied retroactively to any period prior to the effective date of the revised agreement.however,said provision established two specific exceptions to this general rule.if a change of law falls within one of these two exceptions,then the effective date of an agreement revision that incorporates such a change of law shall coincide with the effective date of the federal or state action that caused the agreement to be revised.
the exception at issue in this case is the second exception two,which is triggered if a regulatory agency alters or preempts the effect of th e agreement.emphasis added.a natural reading of this language indicates that it is only triggered where a regulatory agency itself as a matter of law alters or preempts the effect of the agreement.contrary to sprint arguments,it is unreasonable to construe this language as referring to a situation where prtc and sprint decide to alter the agreement in light of a change of law by a regulatory agency whose application is voluntary.in such case,the regulatory agency would have changed the law,but it would not have alter ed or preempt ed the effect of th e agreement,as exception two expressly requires.rather,assuming that prtc and sprint decide to voluntarily adopt such a change of law of voluntary application,it would be prtc and sprint who would alter or preempt the effect of th e agreement and not the regulatory agency,as expressly required by exception two.
furthermore,sprint unreasonably broad interpretation of exception two threatens to turn the exception into the general rule by causing practically all revisions made by the parties to the agreement incorporating a change of law to have an effective date that coincides with the effective date of the federal action giving rise to the change of law.if sprint intended this result,as it now avers,then the agreement provision should have simply stated that exception two was triggered if a regulatory agency changes the law,regardless of whether it alters or preempts the effect of the agreement.the clear language of the agreement that was actually entered into by sprint and prtc,however,does not support such interpretation.
thus,the terms of the agreement provision are clear and leave no doubt as to the parties intentions that only those changes of law which by their own force alter or preempt the effect of the agreement will trigger exception two.we therefore disagree with the district court finding to the contrary.
the isp remand order compensation regime,however,was not the type of change of law that altered or preempted by its own force prtc and sprint agreement.to the contrary,the fcc made expressly clear that this interim compensation regime does not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.isp remand order,fcc rcd.at emphasis added.thus,the isp remand order compensation regime only altered interconnection agreements which existed at the time such regime became effective if the contracting parties had voluntarily agreed that their agreements would be thus altered.
as previously mentioned,however,the agreement provision clearly expressed the parties common intention that exception two would not be triggered by a change of law that did not by its own force alter or preempt the agreement and whose application to the agreement was subject to the parties common intent.it is therefore necessary to conclude that the isp remand order compensation regime did not trigger exception two of the agreement provision.as a result,the isp remand order compensation regime applied to prtc and sprint as they intercarrier compensation for a revised agreement and not prior to such time.
the board found,however,that the language of the agreement section.section,which governed the intercarrier compensation for traffic under the agreement,provided further support for its conclusion that the isp remand order triggered alternative of the agreement provision.this section states as follows 
until the fcc establishes a means of determining the amount of intercarrier compensation for traffic,compensation for such traffic shall be based upon a division of revenues as follows compensation for traffic delivered to an isp shall be paid by the carrier whose customer originates the call in the amount of of the amount billed by the originating carrier.any amount billed by the terminating carrier to the isp for delivery of such traffic shall be credited against such payments by the originating carrier and the net amount remaining shall be paid by the originating carrier.
in construing the import of this language,the board opined as follows said language leads us to conclude the parties were aware and in anticipation of a forthcoming fcc action that could alter the rates adopted in the agreement.we more or less agree with this general proposition,given that,as the aforementioned regulatory background illustrates,the agreement was signed on a date,june,when the fcc was reconsidering on remand its ruling in the isp order.thus,it is expected for prtc and sprint to have anticipated a forthcoming fcc action that could change the law in this area.we,however,do not agree with the analytical leap made by the board.that is,we do not agree with the board apparent proposition that the parties anticipation of an fcc action in this area necessarily entails that prtc and sprint agreed for any fcc action to have altered their agreement effective as of the date of the fcc action,and not as of the date in which such a change of law was incorporated by the parties into a revised agreement.
significantly,section.is silent with respect to whether an fcc action in this area would necessarily alter the agreement and,more importantly,the effective date for such purported alteration.nowhere does section.say that an fcc action such as the isp remand order which did not by its own force alter or preempt the then existing agreement would necessarily alter the agreement as of the date of the fcc action.rather,section.merely appears to open up the possibility for negotiation on the issue of compensation for traffic by establishing a conditional intercarrier compensation scheme that would apply until the fcc established a means of determining intercarrier compensation for traffic.these matters,however,are expressly covered by the agreement provision,which established that except for changes of law that by their own force alter or preempt the agreement no changes of law would be applied by prtc and sprint effective as of a date prior to the date in which they consented to a revised agreement implementing such changes of law.thus,section.does not support the board determination that the isp remand order compensation regime triggered exception two of the agreement provision 
notably,the board lead argument in this appeal was not based on the grounds upon which its order rested,that the isp remand order compensation regime triggered the agreement provision rather,on appeal the board argues for the first time that prtc should have offered the isp remand order compensation regime rate caps in when prtc and sprint agreed to multiple extensions of the agreement,all of which were approved by the board pursuant to e.the board thus apparently suggests that the agreement was an expired or expiring agreement within the meaning of the isp remand order at the time that prtc and sprint negotiated the extensions of the agreement in,and consequently that the isp remand order compensation regime applied to such negotiations as a matter of law.see isp remand order,fcc rcd.at establishing that the isp remand order compensation regime applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements.we note that sprint has never made this argument,the board order did not rest on this ground or even address it,and the record is not developed on this issue.thus,we decline to consider this new argument for purposes of this appeal.moreover,the board can not now defend its order based on this new argument,which leads to a different result in terms of the date as of which the isp remand order compensation regime may have applied to prtc and sprint.thus,the board order on this dispute can not stand and we remand this case.we clarify,however,that we express no opinion as to the merits of this new argument now brought by the board.similarly,we issue no opinion as to whether sprint is precluded through estoppel or otherwise from claiming on remand that the isp remand order compensation regime applied as a matter of law at the various times in which the agreement was extended by prtc and sprint after june,the isp remand order compensation regime effective date because the agreement was considered at such times an expired or expiring agreement within the meaning of the isp remand order.
in sum,we conclude that the board erred in finding that the isp remand order triggered the agreement change of law provision from the time prtc opted to terminate that traffic with another carrier at the rates adopted in the order.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue and remand the case to the district court with instructions that the court grant injunctive relief precluding the enforcement of the board order on this issue and that the case then be remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
dispute over alleged excess billing for transit traffic 
this appeal also presents a dispute between prtc and sprint as to whether prtc reciprocal compensation invoices for the period from december through july billed sprint for transit traffic services at rates that were in excess of the amounts established in the agreement,and whether sprint may recover such amounts.the board found and the district court agreed that,even if prtc over billed sprint for transit traffic,sprint waived its right to challenge prtc invoices,pursuant to section.of the agreement the waiver provision.sprint challenges this determination on appeal through various arguments.for the reasons stated below,we agree with the board determination and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing sprint claims for the recoupment of amounts allegedly over billed by prtc concerning transit traffic.
section.of the agreement establishes that the parties must reciprocally compensate each other for transit traffic services in accordance with section,which in turn makes reference to a price schedule attached to the agreement.on the other hand,section.of the agreement,which governs the payment of charges billed under the agreement,requires that any objection to reciprocal compensation charges must be made in writing and received by the billing party within thirty days from the date the billing party mailed the corresponding invoice.specifically,the waiver provision establishes as follows 
each party is responsible for payment of all charges for completed calls,services and equipment chargeable to that party under the terms hereof.if objection in writing is not received by the billing party within days after a bill is mailed,the account shall be deemed correct and binding upon the billed entity.
thus,under the waiver provision,a billed party failure to object to the billing party invoice within thirty days will cause the invoice to be deemed correct and be binding upon the billed party.although the agreement does not define the words deem and binding,these words are of common legal usage and are defined in legal dictionaries.for example,black law dictionary defines the word deem as follows to treat something as if it were really something else,or it has qualities that it does not have.black law dictionary ed noting that the word deem has been traditionally considered to be a useful word when it is necessary to establish a legal fiction either positively by deeming something to be what it is not or negatively by deeming something not to be what it is quoting thornton,legislative drafting ed.moreover,the word binding has been defined as having legal force.black law dictionary ed.thus,the text of the waiver provision clearly manifests prtc and sprint common intentions that a billed party failure to object in writing to an invoice during the specified time shall cause the invoice to be treated by the parties as if it were correct,even if it was not,and to have legal force between the parties.accordingly,under the terms of the waiver provision,a billed party failure to object to an invoice in accordance with the procedures set forth in such provision constitutes a waiver of that party right to challenge the invoice.
sprint,however,alleges that the waiver provision is ambiguous because it conflicts with other provisions of the agreement,namely,the first sentence of section.and section xvii.as explained below,these arguments are unavailing.
the first sentence of section.states that e ach party is responsible for payment of all charges for completed calls,services and equipment chargeable to that party under the terms hereof.emphasis added.sprint contends that the waiver provision only applies insofar as the charges on an invoice are chargeable under the terms of the agreement,and because prtc invoices for transit traffic were not,sprint maintains that it has not waived its right to challenge them.in other words,sprint argues that the waiver provision only applies insofar as the invoice is correct.this argument is without merit and renders the waiver provision a nullity.as previously mentioned,the waiver provision use of the term deem clearly suggests that the provision is specifically intended to apply in cases where the billed amounts were not properly chargeable under the terms of the agreement.furthermore,interpreting the waiver provision as only restricting the right of a billed party to challenge a correct and properly chargeable invoice,as sprint suggests,would render such provision practically meaningless.we thus decline to adopt such interpretation.see laws ann.tit,if any stipulation of a contract should admit of different meanings,it should be understood in the sense most suitable to give it effect.
in addition,sprint argues that the waiver provision is trumped or at least made ambiguous by the agreement section xvii the general anti waiver provision,which is titled no waiver and establishes that a failure or delay of either party to
