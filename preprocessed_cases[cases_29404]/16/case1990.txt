nestle waters north america,nestle appeals from the district court dismissal of its claims against donald and nancy bollman the bollmans.nestle had sought declaratory and injunctive relief regarding its rights to certain subsurface waters that the bollmans had deeded to it.notably,the deed in question was silent regarding arbitration.in response,the bollmans contended that the dispute fell within the scope of an arbitration clause that the parties had included in the initial contract that established their business relationship.although questions regarding the scope of arbitration clauses are familiar,the question of whether and when an arbitration clause in one contract encompasses a dispute arising out of a related agreement is less common in our case law.in the present case,we conclude that the parties intended that the arbitration clause in the contract establishing and defining their relationship should govern the present dispute therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the bollmans own approximately acres of real property in mecosta county,michigan,which contains several fresh water springs and an aquifer.on december,nestle and the bollmans signed a purchase and sale agreement psa,in which nestle agreed to purchase certain property rights from the bollmans.the psa divided the acres into two parts the sanctuary and the property.in exchange for consideration of million,the bollmans would deed certain subsurface intervals beneath the property and all of the water rights related to the property to nestle as specified in a subsurface and water rights deed the deed and lease the property to nestle under specified terms the lease,grant nestle easements of ingress to and egress from the property across the sanctuary and rights of way necessary for nestle to use the property the easement,and enter into land use restriction agreements setting forth restrictions on land use with respect to both the property and the sanctuary.the form of each of these documents was attached to the psa as an exhibit and made a part of the psa.following the execution of the psa,the parties executed the deed,lease,easement,and land use restriction agreements as required,and nestle began drilling and pumping water.
later,the bollmans and nestle began to disagree regarding the permissibility of nestle pumping.the bollmans presented nestle with a copy of a petition for arbitration that the bollmans intended to file with the american arbitration association.in their draft petition,the bollmans characterized their dispute as arising out of the psa.the bollmans asserted that the deed conveyed to nestle rights to water from any and all water sources on the property and that nestle had determined that the original well locations were inadequate to produce the gallons per minute it desired.nestle then drilled an additional well,which resulted in the groundwater zone of contribution and surface area contributing to the zone of contribution both extending off the property to the east.in other words,the additional well drew from not only sources on the property,but also from water sources on the sanctuary to the east which,but for the pumping,would never flow beneath the property or vent from springs on the property.asserting that nestle ability to pump out subsurface water under the sanctuary amounted to acquisition of property rights for which nestle did not bargain or pay,the bollmans draft petition sought a declaration that nestle was limited to water sources that would naturally vent from springs on the property.there is no indication that the bollmans actually filed the petition for arbitration.
as the bollmans indicated in their draft petition for arbitration,the psa contains an arbitration clause.the clause states that any controversy or claim dispute arising out of this agreement between pbe and gswa disputing parties,which can not otherwise be resolved by the disputing parties themselves,shall be settled by arbitration by a neutral arbitrator mutually acceptable to pbe and gswa the arbitration clause further specifies both the procedure for selecting the arbitrator and the substantive qualifications that the arbitrator should possess,including at least fifteen years experience practicing law,with expertise in water utility operations,water rights,and the process of deciding disputes and interpreting real estate contracts.
by contrast,the other documents vary significantly regarding arbitration.the deed does not include an arbitration clause.the lease includes the same detailed arbitration clause as the psa.the easement does not include an arbitration clause.the land use restriction agreements for the sanctuary and property contain identical arbitration clauses,stating that a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement,or the breach of this agreement,shall be settled by arbitration in grand rapids,michigan,in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the american arbitration association unlike the psa arbitration clause,the land use restriction agreements arbitration clauses do not specify the qualifications of the arbitrator or provide the same level of detail as the psa arbitration clause.
on august,nestle filed its declaratory judgment action after receiving the bollmans draft petition for arbitration.in its complaint,nestle argued that the bollmans allegations contradicted the plain language of the broad grant of rights contained in the deed,which nestle attached to its complaint accordingly,nestle sought a declaration that the bollmans claims lacked merit and an injunction preventing the bollmans from interfering with nestle rights to continue withdrawing water.nestle complaint did not refer to the psa or any of the other agreements.
the bollmans moved to dismiss nestle complaint or,in the alternative,to stay the action and compel arbitration.after briefing,but without a hearing,the district court found that the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration clause in the psa and granted the motion to dismiss.nestle filed a timely notice of appeal.
a district court decision whether to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa,et,is reviewed de novo.javitch first union,cir.similarly,the district court decisions regarding the arbitrability of a particular dispute are reviewed de novo.mcmullen meijer,cir.
before compelling arbitration,a court must determine whether a dispute is arbitrable,meaning that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of the agreement.javitch,at see howsam dean witter reynolds,d at t techs.commc ns workers,d united steelworkers saint gobain ceramics plastics,wl,at cir,en banc.in this case,neither the validity of the arbitration clause in the psa nor the application of the faa is disputed.rather,the sole issue is whether nestle action for declaratory judgment is within the scope of the psa arbitration clause.although it is a close question because both parties arguments rely on controlling principles of contract and arbitration law,we conclude that the action is within the scope of the arbitration clause.
this appeal presents two issues.the first issue is whether nestle claim arises primarily out of the deed or the psa.if nestle claim arises primarily out of the psa,then the arbitration clause in the psa obviously applies.if it arises primarily out of the deed,as the district court found,then the second issue is whether the arbitration clause nevertheless encompasses the dispute.
a.the basis of the dispute 
although the bollmans arguments in their draft petition for arbitration and,to a lesser extent,the arguments in nestle district court complaint,range beyond the deed,the only dispute before the district court was the claim presented in nestle complaint.the district court correctly found that although the complaint seeks a declaration that is broader than the claim based on the deed,the allegations in the complaint are limited to the deed.although there is no case law squarely on point,the district court finding comports with the traditional notion that a plaintiff is master of his claim.
in their draft petition,the bollmans asserted that the deed limits nestle to extraction and consumption of water from any and all water sources on the property.although water sources is nowhere defined in any of the documents,the bollmans looked to the use of the term in the psa,lease,and land use restriction agreements as evidence of the allegedly restrictive meaning of the term.based on those documents,the bollmans draft requested an arbitrator ruling that nestle was limited to those waters which would naturally vent from springs on the property.
the bollmans intent to seek arbitration prompted nestle to seek relief in district court.in its complaint,nestle requested a declaration that the bollmans claims referred to in this complaint are without merit,and that nestle is entitled to continue withdrawing water from the wells without regard to the underground path traveled by the water molecules or the place where the water molecules would have emerged to the surface in the absence of the wells.nestle admits that its action was filed in response to the bollmans petition for arbitration.appellant br.however,nestle asserts that its complaint rests on the plain language of the deed as the basis for its request for declaratory relief.
in their briefs to this court,the parties have continued their arguments regarding the basis of the dispute.nestle reiterates that it sought a declaration and injunctive relief based solely on its rights under the deed.appellant br.the bollmans assert that all of the various documents form but one contract,and that the dispute turns on the meaning of water sources as used throughout the contract.appellee br.according to the bollmans,resolution of the parties respective claims will require interpretation of the term water sources throughout the entire contract,not just the deed.appellee br.
the traditional rule that a plaintiff is master of his claim suggests that nestle is entitled to seek relief solely on the basis of language in the deed.just as artful pleading of defenses can not be sufficient to raise a federal question for purposes of removal,see,fair kohler die specialty.the party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon louisville nashville mottley.stating the complaint rule,the bollmans artful characterization of the claim in this case should not be sufficient to turn an otherwise claim into an arbitrable one.if nestle wishes to base its claim solely on the deed,then the dispute before the court may be said to arise primarily from the deed.in this case,the district court applied these principles correctly and found that the dispute arose primarily from the deed.of course,nestle pleadings are not dispositive regarding arbitrability.the remaining issue is whether the arbitration clause in the psa nevertheless encompasses the dispute.
b.the scope of the arbitration clause 
because the dispute arose primarily from the deed,which is silent regarding arbitration,the dispute is arbitrable only upon a finding that the arbitration clause in the psa encompasses the deed.more generally,this case requires us to determine the scope of an arbitration clause where parties have entered into multiple contracts as part of one overall transaction or ongoing relationship.ultimately,we conclude that the psa arbitration clause is sufficiently broad to encompass this dispute.
we examine arbitration language in a contract in light of the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,resolving any doubts as to the parties intentions in favor of arbitration.see albert higley,cir great earth simons,cir.this court has previously noted the large number of cases from the supreme court encouraging arbitration in a wide variety of contexts and emphasizing the federal policy in favor of arbitration.see wilson contractors,minnotte contracting,cir.the supreme court has interpreted the federal arbitration act as establishing that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.ibid.quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.moreover,i n the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail.at t,at.quoting united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d.this court has stated even more forcefully that any doubts are to be resolved in favor of arbitration unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.masco zurich am.ins,cir quoting highlands wellmont health network,john deere health plan,cir.
however,countervailing principles also apply.as this court has frequently noted,the federal policy in favor of arbitration is not an absolute one.arbitration under the federal arbitration act is a matter of consent,not coercion.higley,at quoting volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.the supreme court has stated while ambiguities in the language of the agreement should be resolved in favor of arbitration,we do not override the clear intent of the parties,or reach a result inconsistent with the plain text of the contract,simply because the policy favoring arbitration is implicated.eeoc waffle house,d internal citation omitted.in sum,no matter how strong sic the federal policy favors arbitration,arbitration is a matter of contract between the parties,and one can not be required to submit to arbitration a dispute which it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.simon pfizer,cir citations omitted.
keeping these countervailing principles in mind,this court has held that in deciding whether an issue is within the scope of an arbitration agreement courts should ask if an action could be maintained without reference to the contract or relationship at issue.if it could,it is likely outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.fazio lehman,cir.this court has applied this method to determine whether particular torts or challenges to the validity of the contract itself are within an arbitration clause.see,fazio,at holding that alleged theft of funds is within arbitration clause highlands wellmont,at holding that alleged fraudulent inducement claim is within arbitration clause.
in the context of multiple contracts,this court has adopted a more narrow test of arbitrability,examining which agreement determines the scope of the contested obligations.we have rejected the view that a dispute is arbitrable merely because it touch es matters covered by the arbitration clause.alticor,union fire ins,cir.in alticor,we held that an arbitration clause in a later agreement could not apply to a dispute over substantive rights and obligations stemming from an earlier agreement.at.similarly,we have held that an arbitration clause in a later agreement should not be read backward into an earlier agreement merely because the later agreement had a boilerplate merger clause.see sec.watch,sentinel,cir.none of our precedents,however,has addressed the application of an arbitration clause in an earlier contract to a dispute arising out of a later agreement,whose execution was required by the first contract.
in the instant case,the district court began its analysis with fazio,but then ultimately relied on a seventh circuit standard.in the seventh circuit,arising out of clauses reach all disputes having their origin or genesis in the contract,whether or not they implicate interpretation,or performance of the contract per se.sweet dreams unlimited,int l,cir.applying this broad standard,the district court concluded that the deed had its genesis in the psa therefore,the arbitration clause in the psa encompassed the deed.the district court found that this court,in highlands wellmont,had cited sweet dreams with approval.however,the highlands wellmont panel did not come close to adopting the sweet dreams standard.rather that panel ruled more narrowly and without endorsing any standard beyond that set in fazio.see highlands wellmont,at.
we do not think it necessary to resort to the sweet dreams test to decide this case.rather,the standard we announced in if an action can be
