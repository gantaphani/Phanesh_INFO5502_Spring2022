in this bankruptcy appeal,we are asked to review the bankruptcy court calculation of the appropriate interest rate to be applied in a cram down provision in the debtors chapter plan.the decision requires interpretation of language in the controlling case of memphis bank trust whitman,cir.there we adopted what has since become known as the coerced loan formulation in the application of a b,which is the chapter provision that has been held to permit confirmation of a plan proposed by the debtor over the objection of the holder of a secured claim.here,the sales contract for the debtors pickup truck imposed an interest rate of,allegedly due to the purchasers poor credit rating.the chapter plan proposed a rate of,and the trustee suggested a rate of.the bankruptcy court determined that the rate should be,an amount that the district court affirmed as reasonable under the circumstances.the creditor now appeals,insisting that in this case only the contract rate will satisfy the valuation criteria of a b.we reject this contention as a legal proposition and,giving the bankruptcy court decision what we believe to be the substantial degree of deference required in this context,we find no error and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant facts germane to this dispute are not contested by the actual parties to the appeal,household automotive finance and the chapter trustee.indeed,much of the background evidence adduced at the hearings in this matter was introduced by way of joint stipulation.as noted by the bankruptcy court,the parties agreed upon the following facts 
debtors entered into a retail installment contract and security agreement dated may,the contract under the terms of which debtors purchased a chevrolet pickup truck the vehicle from myers,the dealer for an agreed price of.
the contract was assigned by the dealer to household automotive finance corporation household,which accepted the assignment.
household has a first and prior lien on the vehicle by virtue of the title lien statement filed in the perry county clerk office on may.
pursuant to the contract,the balance of the purchase price in the principal amount of,plus interest at the rate of,was to be paid by debtors in monthly installments of.
debtors made two payments under the contract before filing their chapter petition the petition on august.
debtors filed their plan along with the petition under which debtors proposed to pay interest on the allowed secured claim of household under the contract.
household filed its proof of claim on september,setting forth a secured claim amount of.
the value of the vehicle for purposes of confirmation of the plan is.
the parties agreement that the vehicle had a present value of only thus resulted in household having a secured claim against the kidds in that amount and an unsecured claim in the amount of,which represents the difference between the total amount financed and the value of the collateral.despite the consensus on the value of the collateral,household vigorously contested the proposed interest rate to be applied to the payment to the finance company as a secured creditor,arguing that it was entitled to the full interest rate rather than the rate proposed by the kidds.given that disagreement,the bankruptcy judge conducted an evidentiary hearing at which three witnesses offered opinions as to the appropriate market rate of interest that should be added to the installment payments for the debtors truck.
david clayton cruise,iii,the regional sales manager for household,explained that household was considered a subprime lender because it offered loans to individuals whose past credit problems or lack of positive credit history made them unattractive customers for banks,credit unions,and other prime lenders.due to the higher risk of from those borrowers,cruise testified,lenders generally charged higher rates of interest on their loans,ranging from to for automobile loans.cruise did admit,however,that household website advertised loans at rates as low as.he nevertheless insisted that the kidds,as a result of their low scores on charts predicting creditworthiness,would not be offered an interest rate by household less than the contract rate of.
the second witness to testify at the evidentiary hearing,richard newsome,served as senior and division manager for consumer lending at community trust bank in the pikeville,kentucky,area.he explained that the bank rate of interest for a borrower purchasing a pickup truck would be and the average rate for all used truck loans would be.pursuant to questioning by the chapter trustee,however,newsome indicated that a weigh t ed average rate for all car loans,for both new and used vehicles,and for all tiers of borrowers,would be because of those people in the entire universe of borrowers pay.
finally,michael litzinger,an attorney in the office of the chapter trustee,testified that hearings to determine the proper interest rate to be applied in situations similar to the one before the court were seldom required because all parties usually agreed on the application of rates between and.in fact,litzinger claimed,household itself had recently agreed to eight different chapter plans with automobile interest rates of and two plans calling for rates of.the witness concluded that interest rates approved in plans in that area of kentucky generally ranged from.specifically,he explained 
seven percent has almost always drawn objection.eight percent will on occasion draw an objection and has done so lately because the interest rate in the market is going up in the last year or so.ten and ten and a half do draw that many objections.eleven rarely does and twelve almost never.some debtors accounts have for the sole purpose to make sure that they do get an objection and it accepted and i think that why they do that.
faced with the divergent testimony of the witnesses at the hearing,the bankruptcy judge found the testimony of richard newsome,the bank,believable and determined that the testimony that the rate of interest for car loans that are made by his bank in the region is,is credible evidence of the market rate of interest.the judge specifically found that cruise testimony that the market rate of interest is is not entirely accurate,especially in light of the fact that household advertises rates on the internet as low as and has agreed in other chapter cases to interest rates of and.
consequently,the bankruptcy judge found that the current market rate for similar loans in the region is,but that,because interest rates had experienced a recent rise,the rate to be applied to the kidds loan should be.both household and the kidds appealed that decision to the district court,household arguing that its contract rate of should have been used to arrive at the present value of the collateral,and the kidds contending that no interest whatsoever should be added to the resale value of the pickup truck.the district judge,however,affirmed the ruling of the bankruptcy court,concluding that the finding of a market rate was not clearly erroneous.additionally,the district court declined to analyze the propriety of the bankruptcy court consideration of other chapter plans involving claims by household,stating that any error in that regard would be harmless because t here is sufficient evidence in the record which supports his conclusion regardless of these agreed orders.household now appeals from that ruling,availing itself of another opportunity to challenge the conclusion reached by the bankruptcy court.
discussion 
standard of review 
as noted in borock mathis in re clipper international,cir 
in reviewing district court decisions on bankruptcy matters,this court accords discretion only to the original bankruptcy court findings,not those included in the decision rendered by the district court,since t his court is in as good a position to review the bankruptcy court decision as is the district court.in re omegas group,cir citations omitted.the court reviews bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.id.
in the present case,not only do the trustee and household disagree on the interest rate that may appropriately be charged to the debtors for retention of the collateral at issue,they even disagree on the appropriate standard of review to be utilized by this court in evaluating the bankruptcy judge determination.the trustee argues that the court ruling involves only a factual determination as to which of several competing rates most closely approximates market value.as a result,she contends that the ruling of the bankruptcy court should be reviewed only under the clear error standard normally reserved for such factual determinations.see,roach united states,cir citing anderson city of bessemer,d.household submits,however,that the issue before the court actually requires selection of the appropriate methodology to be used in making a market rate calculation,and thus entails legal conclusions that are to be reviewed by this court de novo.see id.
although,at its basic level,the bankruptcy court decision in this case turns upon a finding that one of a variety of potential interest rates should be considered to reflect true market value,household is correct that the court is first called upon to establish for the circuit the methodology under which that rate is to be calculated.consequently,the selection of the appropriate interest rate does indeed involve a legal determination that must be reviewed de novo without a presumption of correctness.see motors acceptance jones,cir.
ii.cram down under chapter 
although the bankruptcy code nowhere uses the words cram down,the term has come to denote the confirmation of a plan over the objection of a secured creditor.pursuant to the provisions of a b,a bankruptcy court may approve a plan proposed by a chapter debtor without the consent of the affected creditor if 
i the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien securing such claim and 
ii the value,as of the effective date of the plan,of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim.
in memphis bank trust,at,we recognized that the law,in effect,requires the creditor to make a new loan in the amount of the value of the collateral rather than repossess it,and the creditor is entitled to interest on his loan.footnote omitted.such interest payments are mandated simply i n order for the secured creditor to get payments over time under the plan having a present value equal to the allowed amount,as the above quoted statutory language directs.motors acceptance,at.
in reference to determination of the appropriate rate of interest to be added to chapter payments,we declined to t ie the interest rate to an arbitrary rate,and instead held that 
i n the absence of special circumstances bankruptcy courts should use the current market rate of interest used for similar loans in the region.bankruptcy courts are generally familiar with the current conventional rates on various types of consumer loans.and where parties dispute the question,proof can easily be adduced.
memphis bank trust,at.even after such a seemingly clear explanation by this court of the proper method for calculating interest in cram down situations,household now cites additional sixth circuit decisions in an attempt to justify its effort to maximize debtor payments to itself to the detriment of other creditors.
for example,the finance company discusses in its brief on appeal the holding in cardinal federal savings loan ass colegrove in re colegrove,cir.in colegrove,a case arising in the context of home mortgage arrearages,keith lundin,chapter bankruptcy,at ed,the court concluded 
t he most equitable rate to establish in this type of situation is the prevailing market rate of interest on similar types of secured loans at the time of allowance of the creditors claim and the confirmation of the plan in bankruptcy with a maximum limitation on such rate to be the underlying contract rate of interest.
colegrove,at emphasis in original.household focuses upon that language to support its position that the appropriate interest rates for the automobile transaction in this case should also be determined by reference to the underlying contract rate of interest.we have,however,limited colegrove to its particular home mortgage arrearage situation in which the creditor was completely secured and was not required to accept unsecured status as to any portion of its debt.united states arnold,cir.because the factual situation in this appeal in no way resembles the facts of colegrove,we conclude that the decision in that case is inapplicable here.
household also cites the arnold decision in support of its argument that memphis bank trust s references to the current market rate of interest used for similar loans in the region and the current conventional rates on various types of consumer loans actually relate only to a lender own interest rate and not an actual market or conventional rate.in arnold,we resolved a dispute involving a chapter,rather than a chapter,bankruptcy,but we noted that chapter cram down provision is identical to that found in chapter.arnold,at.then,in determining which of competing interest rates to apply,we held that where a cram down occurs and a creditor is forced to a portion of its note,a creditor is entitled to receive its current market rate on the new loan.id.at footnote omitted emphasis added.household contends that this court use of the word its in describing the relevant market rate indicates that a more general rate need not be considered and that the interest rate at which the particular creditor would loan money to the particular debtor may be used for cram down purposes.
there is,however,absolutely no indication in arnold or in other sixth circuit decisions that use of the phrase its market rate mandates assessment in this case of interest at the rate at which a loan would be made by household to borrowers identical to the kidds in all relevant respects.in fact,adoption of such a rate is tantamount to endorsement of the automatic application of a contract rate of interest,a principle clearly at odds with the clear language of memphis bank trust.rather,it is more likely that use by the panel in arnold of the modifier its to describe the appropriate market rate was intended solely to limit consideration to rates relevant to the particular types of loans at issue.for instance,the setting of the market rate for automobile loans should be limited to consideration of only the automobile loan universe and not rates that would apply to an average borrower seeking,for instance,financing for a new home.
furthermore,as noted by the bankruptcy court in in re richards,the purpose of chapter cram down provisions is to ensure that a secured creditor receive s payment equal to the value of the collateral as of the effective date of the plan.to the extent that the debtor payments are spread out over time,the creditor will actually receive less than what he is entitled to due to the simple fact that a sum of money received over time does not have the same value as a sum of money received today.id.hence,in memphis bank trust,we concluded that current market rates of interest would best approximate the present value of a secured claim.id.thus,payment of that amount and that amount alone satisfies the purposes of the cram down provisions.in fact,t o permit a secured creditor to receive interest on his claim in an amount greater than the conventional market rates would allow the creditor to actually receive more than the allowed amount of his secured claim.id.
finally,an analysis of the language used in memphis bank trust clearly negates application of an interest rate that can be determined only on a basis through analysis of information provided and controlled by the creditor.clearly,the opinion does not anticipate imposition of a rate of interest that would apply in the market that encompasses the factors prevalent in the bankruptcy setting.rather,by stating that b ankruptcy courts are generally familiar with the current conventional rates on various types of consumer loans,memphis bank trust,at emphasis added,we directed the use of more generally applicable rates.moreover,had rates been contemplated i
