plaintiff sleepy,llc appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,in favor of defendant select rendered upon a bench trial.this action arises out of a contractual agreement between sleepy and select comfort pursuant to which sleepy sold beds manufactured by select comfort.after the parties ended their business relationship,sleepy brought suit,asserting numerous claims,including claims for breach of contract,breach of the contract implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unfair competition,and slander per se.
the case proceeded to a bench trial in the spring of.in june,toward the end of sleepy presentation of its case,select comfort moved for judgment on partial findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c the district court granted judgment for select comfort on all claims.the court dismissal of many of sleepy claims depended on its determination that the contract had expired on september,and,by its terms,could not be extended past that date except by written waiver.the court dismissed the claims of defamation primarily on the ground that sleepy had consented to the allegedly slanderous statements.on appeal,sleepy contends these rulings were based on errors of law.sleepy also challenges several of the district court evidentiary rulings.
we affirm the judgment dismissing one of the contract claims.as for the other claims,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
plaintiff sleepy,llc is a new retailer of mattresses and bedding products.defendant select comfort,based in minnesota,manufactures and sells a line of bedding called the sleep number,which is known as alternative bedding because,unlike traditional springfilled mattresses,select comfort sleep number beds are filled with inflatable air chambers that can be adjusted to vary the firmness of the mattress.select comfort sells its sleep number beds through its own retail stores.
in october,select comfort launched a retail partner program to sell sleep number beds in the stores of other retailers.sleepy began negotiations with select comfort in early to join the retail partner program.in june,sleepy and select comfort executed a written dealer agreement the dealer agreement making sleepy an authorized retailer of sleep number beds.
under the terms of the dealer agreement,the only select comfort merchandise to be sold by sleepy was the personal preference line.in contrast,select comfort sold its core line in its retail stores.the personal preference and core lines differed from one another in several respects,including differences of foundation and of controls to adjust firmness.the foundation of the personal preference beds sold by sleepy was wooden the core beds had a plastic polymer foundation.the controls of the personal preference line were wired,while the core line came with wireless remote controls.
the dealer agreement between sleepy and select comfort in section a required select comfort to provide sleepy with first quality merchandise meeting all mutually agreed upon specifications.joint app x ja at.in section c,each side agreed not to adversely affect the character,reputation and good will collectively the brand image of the other party.id.section provided,subject to earlier termination in accordance with any provision of this agreement,the term of this agreement will expire september.ja.
sleepy began selling sleep number beds in august.sales were disappointing.in response to reports it received that select comfort salespeople were disparaging sleepy and its personal preference line,in late sleepy began conducting secret shops,sending hired personnel into select comfort stores posing as customers to assess whether this was true.sleepy contends its undercover shopping revealed a regular pattern of disparagement.in particular,sleepy presented evidence that select comfort salespeople told sleepy secret shoppers that the wooden foundation sold at sleepy was inferior to the plastic polymer foundation of the core line sold at select comfort stores that beds sold at sleepy were stored in warehouses where they attracted allergens and dust mites,while beds sold through select comfort stores were made to order and that sleepy offered inferior sales terms and deceitfully refused to honor its warranties.
at a meeting on january,sleepy presented select comfort with results of some of its secret shops.sleepy continued to conduct additional secret shops thereafter.on january,select comfort sent sleepy a letter stating that it saw no reason to extend the term of the parties agreement and wanted to the dealer relationship.ja.the letter proposed that sleepy continue to sell its remaining inventory of select comfort product through the end of february,following which select comfort would arrange for the timely retrieval of its merchandising materials and fixtures.id.on april,the parties entered into a wind up agreement the wind up agreement,which provided that between april and may select comfort would retrieve all select comfort materials from sleepy stores and warehouses.under the wind up agreement,select comfort agreed to fill all sleepy orders until two weeks before the final date of product removal,subject to certain limitations,and sleepy agreed to operate according to the terms and conditions of the parties previous agreement during this period ja.
on august,sleepy began this suit in new york state court.select comfort removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.sleepy complaint alleged that select comfort breached the dealer agreement by failing to provide it with first quality merchandise,as required by the agreement,and by violating the dealer agreement clause.sleepy also asserted claims of fraudulent inducement,slander per se,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unfair competition,and violation of the lanham act.after several months of trial,toward the end of sleepy presentation of its case,select comfort made its motion for judgment on partial findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.on september,the district court,acting as,found in select comfort favor on all claims.this appeal followed 
discussion 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.macdraw,cit grp.equip,cir.
breach of contract claims 
sleepy alleged that select comfort breached a of the dealer agreement by failure to deliver first quality merchandise and c by disparaging sleepy merchandise and business practices.we agree with the district court that sleepy failed to prove a breach of a,and we therefore affirm the dismissal of the claim based on that provision.as for the claim under c,however,the district court erred in construing the dealer agreement as barring extension of the contract term past the stated expiration date except by written waiver,and dismissing the claim on that basis.
a section a first quality merchandise 
sleepy contends its evidence showed that select comfort breached the requirement of a of the dealer agreement that select comfort provide sleepy with first quality merchandise.the parties dispute the meaning of first quality.relying on evidence from the contract negotiation,sleepy maintains that this term required select comfort to provide it with beds that were in no way inferior to the beds sold at select comfort stores.select comfort contends the generally accepted meaning of the term in product manufacturing is new,unflawed products which are distinguished from defective or damaged goods.sleepy llc select comfort wholesale,cv,slip op.at.the district court found the term ambiguous and,acting as,adopted select comfort construction.the court further found that select comfort did not breach its obligation to provide sleepy with new,unflawed products.
we need not decide whether the district court properly interpreted the term first quality.even if sleepy is correct that this clause required select comfort to deliver to sleepy merchandise that was in no way inferior to what select comfort sold in its own stores,sleepy failed to establish a breach.the district court found that sleepy failed to show that the personal preference beds it received were of inferior quality to select comfort core line.we find no flaw in that ruling.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of judgment for select comfort on this claim.
b section c clause 
in its second breach of contract claim,sleepy alleges that select comfort breached the clause of c of the dealer agreement.section c provides,in relevant part 
each party represents that it shall not impair,infringe upon or adversely affect the character,reputation and good will collectively,the brand image of the other party.
ja.the district court ruled that sleepy failed to prove a breach of c because it presented no competent evidence of disparagement by select comfort that took place while the agreement was in effect.
the district court ruling was predicated on its interpretation of two subsections of the dealer agreement.section a states that the term of this agreement will expire september.ja.section e provides that,after termination of the agreement,the terms of the agreement can not be extended or continued except by an express written waiver of termination signed by the terminating party.id.taken together,the district court understood these provisions to mean that the agreement would come to an end on september,and could not be extended beyond that date except by written waiver,which the court concluded was not shown.the court accordingly concluded that the dealer agreement was no longer in force after september,and that disparagements by select comfort subsequent to that date could not be breaches of the contract.
the court thus treated expiration and termination as interchangeable terms referring to the end of the contract term,regardless of how it occurred.sleepy argues that the court failed to recognize the contract carefully drawn distinction between expiration,which refers to the arrival of the date contractually specified as the end of the contract term,and termination,meaning the act of a party,relying on a contractual justification,to bring the contract term to a premature end.
we agree with sleepy that the court construction of the contract was erroneous.the dealer agreement does indeed use those terms to refer to different ways of ending the contract term.expiration is used to refer to the end of a initial term on a contractually agreed date.this was provided in section a,which states,subject to earlier termination,the term of this agreement shall commence as of the effective date and will expire september,the initial term.ja emphases added 
in contrast,termination is used to describe an affirmative act by a party,relying on a contractually agreed justification,to end the agreement prior to its expiration.section c permits a party to terminate the agreement for cause upon a material breach by the other party by serving a written notice of termination.id.section d allows a party to terminate the agreement by giving a written notice of termination if,inter alia,the other party becomes bankrupt,insolvent,or under control of a receiver.id.and a,as quoted above,provides that the contract expiration on september,is s ubject to earlier termination.
section e which is quoted in full in footnote,in which the district court found a prohibition of extension of the contract term absent an express written waiver,applies only after termination of this agreement,which had not occurred when the agreement came to its expiration date.in addition,the type of written waiver specified in e is a written waiver of termination.furthermore,e requires that the express written waiver of termination be signed by the terminating party,a provision that makes no sense if applied to extension of the contract term after expiration,because expiration happens automatically on the arrival of the expiration date,and not at the instigation of any terminating party.
in sum,e did not prevent the dealer agreement from being extended by the parties conduct after the agreement initial term expired on september.the district court conclusion that sleepy could not prevail on its claim of breach of contract by disparagement because sleepy failed to show disparagement prior to the dealer agreement expiration date was based on an invalid interpretation of the agreement.the court did not confront sleepy contention that the dealer agreement was in fact extended by conduct of the parties and that select comfort disparaged sleepy in breach of c while the agreement was still in force we therefore vacate the judgment dismissing sleepy claims of disparagement in breach of contract.the court will need to rule on those issues on remand.
ii.unfair competition and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
sleepy also challenges the district court grant of judgment for select comfort on sleepy claims for unfair competition and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing both claims are based,broadly speaking,on sleepy allegations that regardless of whether select comfort disparagements violated c,this and other hostile conduct violated select comfort implied obligations to refrain from unfair competition and of good faith and fair dealing during the contract term.as with sleepy claim for breach of c of the agreement,the district court granted judgment for select comfort on these claims on the grounds that sleepy had presented no evidence of hostile conduct that took place prior to the expiration date of september.
as discussed above,the district court erred in ruling that the agreement could not be extended except by written waiver and therefore necessarily ended on september.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of judgment for select comfort on sleepy claims for unfair competition and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and remand for further consideration 
iii.slander per se 
sleepy asserted claims of slander per se,alleging that select comfort salespersons had a practice of defaming sleepy merchandise and business practices.sleepy undertook to prove defamation through testimony of its secret shoppers relating twelve instances of what was said to them by salespersons in select comfort stores.the district court dismissed the slander claims,ruling that none of the twelve statements was actionable.as to eleven instances,this was because sleepy undercover shopper had been the first to mention the fact that sleepy stores also sold select comfort merchandise or had asked questions about sleepy to find out what select comfort would say in response.on that basis,the district court ruled that sleepy solicited the allegedly defamatory statements and was therefore deemed in law to have consented to them,which precluded suit.as to a final instance the zaffron claim,the court concluded that they were not defamatory because a reasonable listener would not have believed that they asserted facts,as opposed to mere hyperbolic,sales talk.we believe that these rulings were based on an incorrect understanding of the new york law of defamation 
a consent to defamation 
decisions of new york intermediate appellate courts have established that the consent of the person defamed to the making of a defamatory statement bars that person from suing for the defamation,and that,in some circumstances,a person intentional eliciting of a statement she expects will be defamatory can constitute her consent to the making of the statement.see dickson slezak,dep t lebreton weiss,dep t handlin burkhart,dep t park lewis,dep t.what is less clear is what circumstances will justify the imputation of consent from the eliciting of the defamatory statement and thus render the statement not actionable.the unclarity of new york law results from the fact that the precedents are few,the formulations of the new york courts to have ruled are not entirely consistent,and new york highest court has never ruled on this precise question.
the contours and purposes of the rule are somewhat illuminated by the restatement second of torts,which in defamation cases has been cited with approval by the highest court of new york.see,liberman gelstein,park knoll assocs.schmidt.section of the restatement provides,except as stated in,the consent of another to the publication of defamatory matter concerning him is a complete defense to his action for defamation.comment d to this section says,it is not necessary that the other know that the matter to the publication of which he consents is defamatory in character.it is enough that he has reason to know that it may be defamatory.as an illustration,the restatement notes that a summarily discharged school teacher who demands that the reason for his dismissal be made public has consented to the publication of the reason though it turns out to be defamatory.restatement second of torts cmt.d.
section,which furnishes an exception to the rule of section,provides,an honest inquiry or investigation by the person defamed to ascertain the existence,source,content or meaning of a defamatory publication is not a defense to an action for its republication by the defamer.comment d to this section explains that this exception to the rule of section has no application when the inquiry is not an honest inquiry or investigation to ascertain the facts,and the republication is invited only for the purpose of decoying the defendant into a lawsuit.id.cmt.d.the first department of new york appellate division has cited approvingly both section and comment d to section.see lebreton,at.
whether a republication of an earlier defamation is itself actionable when elicited by the defamed party appears to turn in part on a combination of the defamed party motivation for eliciting the republication and the degree of certainty of the defamed party expectation that the statement elicited will be defamatory.three precedents of three of new york four appellate divisions have found consent and hence preclusion of suit based on the statement in circumstances where the defamed party elicited republication of the statement with a high degree of certainty,based on information derived from prior experience,that the statement would be defamatory.thus the third department in dickson slezak found consent and consequent preclusion where the plaintiff hired undercover investigators to garner what he had every reason to anticipate would be defamatory comments from defendants.at emphasis added.the second department in handlin burkhart found consent and preclusion where i n view of the previous meeting at which the defendant met with the plaintiff and two representatives from his union and detailed the reasons for the plaintiff requested resignation,the plaintiff had every reason to anticipate that the report delivered to the union explaining the reasons for his discharge would be defamatory in nature.at emphasis added.the fourth department in park lewis likewise found consent where the plaintiff essentially knew the statement elicited would be defamatory.the defendant had made defamatory statements about the plaintiff during an earlier conversation with the plaintiff agents,and the plaintiff instructed his agents to return to defendant office to record additional statements concerning plaintiff.park,at.
on the other hand,the choice of words by which the second and fourth departments but not the third have described the standard for determining whether there was consent to the republication has suggested a less burdensome standard for the defendant to demonstrate the plaintiff consent.the fourth department stated in park that consent is found if the plaintiff has reason to anticipate that the defendant responses to the inquiries might be defamatory.id.emphasis added.and the second department in handlin quoted the same standard,citing an earlier fourth department case.the third department in dickson,however,as stated above,appeared to base its ruling in favor of the defendant on the fact that the plaintiff elicited the remarks having every reason to anticipate they would be defamatory.dickson,at emphasis added.
the provisions of the restatement cited above place emphasis on the plaintiff motive in eliciting the statements from the defendant.there is,of course,a close relationship between the degree of assurance the plaintiff possesses that the statements elicited from the defendant will be defamatory and the plaintiff likely motive in eliciting them.the higher the degree of the plaintiff certainty that the defendant statements will be defamatory,the less likely it is that the plaintiff is eliciting them in an honest inquiry or investigation to ascertain the facts,as expressly condoned by section,and the more likely it is that the republication is invited only for the purpose of decoying the defendant into a lawsuit,which precludes suit on the elicited republication.considering the scant and new york case authority entirely from lower courts,and the elucidation to be found in the restatement,it appears to us that new york standard would be along the following lines when a plaintiff sues for defamation based on a statement of the defendant elicited by the plaintiff with some reason to expect that the defendant statement might be defamatory,the more the evidence supports the proposition that the plaintiff elicited the statement with a high degree of certainty that it would be defamatory,for the purpose of enabling a lawsuit,the stronger the defendant case for deeming the statement consented to,thus barring the claim.otherwise put,the more the evidence supports the proposition that the plaintiff elicited the statement,notwithstanding awareness but lacking certainty that it might be defamatory,doing so as a good faith investigation to determine whether in fact the defendant has been defaming the plaintiff as the plaintiff has reason to suspect,the weaker the defendant case for deeming the defamation consented to.
the district court based its decision on the question whether the alleged defamations of select comfort salespersons elicited by sleepy secret shoppers were consented to,and thus not actionable,primarily on whether it was sleepy agent or select comfort salesperson who first mentioned the fact that sleepy stores also sold select comfort merchandise.the district court also gave weight in favor of select comfort to evidence that sleepy instructed its secret shoppers to ask about differences between sleepy and select comfort products and to find out whether or not select comfort would denigrate sleepy.sleepy llc,cv,slip op.at.we do not believe this was the proper analysis under new york law.accordingly,we remand for reconsideration of whether these claims were barred by sleepy consent.to justify a ruling either way on whether the specific statements of the select comfort salespersons were consented to and thus not actionable,the court will need to make findings on the issues outlined above as to whether sleepy inquiries were motivated by a good faith attempt to learn whether the select comfort sales force was carrying on a consistent pattern of slander,or were merely a ruse to decoy select comfort into a lawsuit,along with the closely related question what was the degree of sleepy confidence or certainty at the time of each inquiry that such a pattern of slander existed 
we note further,however,that the inquiry into whether sleepy should be deemed to have consented to the instances of alleged slander elicited by its secret shoppers may be of limited importance.according to sleepy argument,the elicited statements had two purposes.one was as actionable slanders.their second,and perhaps more important,purpose was as evidence demonstrating that select comfort sales force had adopted a pattern and practice of telling customers who inquired about the relative merits of purchasing select comfort merchandise from sleepy that the wooden foundations of the beds sold by sleepy were defective and that sleepy did not honor its warranties.evidence of an organization routine practice may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice.if sleepy succeeded through this evidence of elicited statements in showing a pattern and practice in the select comfort sales force of slandering sleepy,it might make little difference whether the elicited statements could also serve individually as actionable slanders,because sleepy would have shown that select comfort had committed numerous additional similar slanders that were not solicited by sleepy.on remand,the district court should consider a whether sleepy evidence of statements elicited from select comfort showed a pattern and practice on the part of select comfort to make such defamatory statements to its customers,and,if so,b whether new york law would sustain liability for the incidents of unsolicited slanders so demonstrated,see fashion boutique of short hills,fendi usa,cir.if so,this might effectively moot the inquiry whether under new york law the elicited statements should be deemed consented to.
the judgment dismissing the slander claims is vacated and the matter remanded for reconsideration whether sleepy should be deemed to have consented to the elicited statements so as to bar claims of slander based on those statements,and for further consideration whether sleepy,through those elicited statements,showed a pattern and practice in select comfort of slandering sleepy.
b the zaffron claim 
we conclude in addition that the court dismissal of the zaffron claim was also based on an incorrect understanding of new york law.this slander allegation was based on statements made by select comfort during a secret shop conducted by deborah zaffron on november.although the court found it could not rule as a matter of law that sleepy consented to these statements because the select comfort salesperson was the first to mention sleepy,the court granted judgment for select comfort on the grounds that the statements by the select comfort salesperson were not actionable because they were loose and hyperbolic sales talk that a reasonable listener would not believe to be conveying facts about sleepy.sleepy llc,cv,slip op.at internal quotation marks omitted.this ruling was error.
under new york law,with some exceptions statements that do not purport to convey facts about the plaintiff,but rather express certain kinds of opinions of the speaker,do not constitute defamation.in determining whether a statement is actionable,t he dispositive inquiry is whether a reasonable listener could have concluded that the statements were conveying facts about the plaintiff.gross new york times,internal quotation marks omitted.the statements are not actionable if a reasonable listener would not understand them as assertions of fact.id.at.whether a statement can be reasonably construed to assert a fact and thus be actionable is a question of law.id.the court of appeals has instructed that the inquiry calls for examination of whether the specific language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily understood whether the statements are capable of being proven true or false and whether either the full context of the communication in which the statement appears or the broader social context and surrounding circumstances are such as to signal listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to be opinion,not fact.id.internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.courts should begin the analysis by looking to the content of the whole communication,its tone and apparent purpose,immuno ag.moor jankowski,instead of engaging in hypertechnical parsing of written and spoken words for the purpose of identifying possible facts that might form the basis of a sustainable defamation action,gross,at internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.
the allegedly slanderous statements made during zaffron secret shop occurred during a lengthy conversation between zaffron and the salesman about select comfort beds,pricing,and terms of service,as well as the differences between sleepy and select comfort models and pricing policies.zaffron had told the salesman that she bought a bed at sleepy but wanted to replace it because it had become lumpy.the salesman,who had said he used to work at sleepy and had left because he was not wild about the way they did business,ja,at,continued the conversation as follows 
salesman call sleepy up and you find out that sleepy will not honor the warranty.
zaffron no 
salesman absolutely not.
zaffron how can they not honor it 
salesman because they send somebody out to your house,they inspect the bed,they say there nothing wrong with it.happens daily.
this statement,viewed in the context of the conversation,conveyed defamatory facts about sleepy business practices,and not merely vague claims of superiority by a competitor.the statement had a precise meaning,capable of being proven true or false that sleepy regularly,as a business practice,refuses to honor its warranty on defective merchandise,justifying the refusal by the false assertion of an inspector that there nothing wrong with the defective merchandise.especially coming from one who had worked at sleepy but left because he did not like the way sleepy did business,the statement in context would be understood as communicating a fact known by the speaker to be true.the statement plainly attributed to sleepy a regular business practice of intentionally rejecting warranty claims it knew to be justified based on dishonest inspection reports.we accordingly vacate the judgment on this claim and remand for reconsideration 
iv.evidentiary rulings 
sleepy challenges the district court exclusion of two kinds of evidence offered by sleepy at trial.trial courts are allowed a measure of discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence.united states white,cir.
a evidence of customer state of mind 
through the testimony of four sleepy employees to whom the statements were made,sleepy offered statements of four unidentified customers who sought to cancel the purchase of select comfort beds.the customers said they wanted to cancel their purchases because of negative things they had been told by select comfort employees about sleepy.the district court excluded these statements as hearsay.sleepy contends this was error.although acknowledging that the statements would be hearsay if offered to prove what select comfort employees said to sleepy customers,sleepy argues that the statements were nonetheless admissible as evidence of the customers states of mind.because slightly different factors bear on each of these offers of evidence,we discuss each separately.
scott cheshul 
sleepy offered the testimony of scott cheshul,a sleepy employee,about an incident in which a customer said he wanted to cancel a purchase because he was told by select comfort that sleepy product was inferior.the district court ruled that this was inadmissible hearsay.sleepy contends the customer statement was admissible to show the customer state of mind evidencing the customer belief that the select comfort merchandise the customer had purchased from sleepy was inferior.
we agree with sleepy argument.although the statement was indeed inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove what select comfort personnel had said to the customer,it was admissible evidence for the limited purpose of the customer belief that the select comfort merchandise sold by sleepy was inferior.see herman schwabe,united shoe mach,cir friendly.thus,while sleepy could not use this evidence to show that select comfort was responsible for the customer beliefs,the evidence was nonetheless competent to show that sleepy was harmed by select comfort conduct if it had other evidence to demonstrate that the customer belief was attributable to select comfort 
tyler paiva 
sleepy offered the testimony of its employee,tyler paiva,regarding incidents in which two customers said they wanted to cancel their purchases from sleepy of select comfort beds because they were told by select comfort that sleepy carried an inferior bed foundation and that the warranty given by sleepy was not effective.the district court excluded paiva testimony as hearsay because paiva did not identify the customers.
while there might well have been justifications for excluding this evidence,including perhaps the absence of competent evidence linking these customers beliefs to conduct of select comfort,sleepy inability to identify the customers whose states of mind were at issue did not render the evidence hearsay on that point.see callahan,cir.
