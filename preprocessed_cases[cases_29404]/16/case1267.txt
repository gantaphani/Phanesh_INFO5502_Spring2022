faced with financial hardship and a monthly mortgage payment they could not afford,appellants josephine spaulding and dale haylett applied for a mortgage modification under the home affordable modification program hamp.their mortgage servicer,appellee wells fargo bank,denied their application.feeling aggrieved by wells fargo actions,spaulding and haylett filed suit,alleging five state law claims.the district court concluded that appellants had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and therefore granted wells fargo motion to dismiss.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
hamp was part of congress response to the financial and housing crisis that struck the country in the fall of.it provided an incentive for lenders to modify mortgages so that struggling homeowners could stay in their homes.see emergency economic stabilization act of,pub,stat,codified at et 
the seventh circuit recently explained the emergency economic stabilization act and hamp role in it 
the centerpiece of the act was the troubled asset relief program tarp,which required the secretary of the treasury,among many other duties and powers,to implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages to take advantage of available programs to minimize foreclosures.a.congress also granted the secretary the authority to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures.id.
pursuant to this authority,in february the secretary set aside up to billion of tarp funds to induce lenders to refinance mortgages with more favorable interest rates and thereby allow homeowners to avoid foreclosure.the secretary negotiated servicer participation agreements spas with dozens of home loan servicers,including wells fargo.under the terms of the spas,servicers agreed to identify homeowners who were in default or would likely soon be in default on their mortgage payments,and to modify the loans of those eligible under the program.in exchange,servicers would receive a payment for each permanent modification,along with other incentives.the spas stated that servicers shall perform the loan modification described in the program guidelines and procedures issued by the treasury and any supplemental documentation,instructions,bulletins,letters,directives,or other communications issued by the treasury.in such supplemental guidelines,treasury directed servicers to determine each borrower eligibility for a modification 
t he borrower had to meet certain threshold requirements,including that the loan originated on or before january,it was secured by the borrower primary residence the mortgage payments were more than percent of the borrower monthly income and,for a home,the current unpaid principal balance was no greater than 
where a borrower qualified for a hamp loan modification,the modification process itself consisted of two stages.after determining a borrower was eligible,the servicer implemented a trial period plan tpp under the new loan repayment terms it formulated using the waterfall method.the trial period under the tpp lasted three or more months,during which time the lender must service the mortgage loan in the same manner as it would service a loan in forbearance.supplemental directive.after the trial period,if the borrower complied with all terms of the tpp agreement including making all required payments and providing all required documentation and if the borrower representations remained true and correct,the servicer had to offer a permanent modification.see supplemental directive if the borrower complies with the terms and conditions of the trial period plan,the loan modification will become effective on the first day of the month following the trial period.
wigod wells fargo bank,cir footnote omitted.as generally described in wigod,wells fargo entered into a servicer participation agreement spa with the secretary of the treasury the secretary.the spa expressly incorporated the hamp guidelines,procedures,and supplemental directives issued by the secretary.
the law gave the secretary authority to issue directives and other guidelines for each mortgage servicer participating in hamp.see.the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac is the sole compliance agent responsible for enforcing hamp.see john chiles matthew mitchell,hamp an overview of the program and recent litigation trends,consumer fin.freddie mac conducts reviews of participating servicers operations and performs analyses of the documents the servicers provide on a regular basis.id.
perhaps not surprisingly,given the large stakes for financially stressed homeowners,and in light of widespread media reports of bureaucratic bungling and worse on the part of lenders,mortgage servicers,and their myriad agents,hamp has given rise to a large number of civil claims by mortgagors against financial industry firms.the claims here arise with that general background.
spaulding and haylett purchased their home in glenelg,maryland,in march.in january,they refinanced their mortgage with fremont investment loan of fullerton,california,which later assigned servicing rights to wells fargo.at that time,appellants owed a principal balance of,and they refinanced to take out a new mortgage of.the new mortgage was an adjustable rate year mortgage with an initial rate of.at that rate,appellants initial monthly payment was.the interest rate remained at for two years,when it was then eligible to change every six months,keyed to the london interbank offered rate libor.the mortgage rate,however,would never exceed or fall below.
in early,appellants suffered financial hardship and became unable to make their full monthly mortgage payments.on february,they wrote a hardship letter to wells fargo,explaining the reasons for their difficulties in making their payments.the letter stated that spaulding suffered from collagenous colitis,which caused her stomach pains and diarrhea and,combined with other physical ailments,prevented her from working.the letter also stated that haylett had lost work hours because of the recession and the bad maryland weather,an apparent reference to the major snowstorms that struck the state in february.haylett occupation is not stated,but his pay stubs are from integrated electrical services of houston,texas.the appellants included two of haylett weekly pay stubs with their mortgage modification application one,dated february,showing gross pay of,and one dated february,showing gross pay of.they also reported earning a month in rental income and a monthly disability payment for spaulding of.
wells fargo responded a week later,in a letter dated march,stating that it had received appellants inquiry regarding your mortgage loan and that in order to process the request for a loan modification the bank needed additional proof of income.specifically,the bank asked for two additional weekly pay stubs for haylett reflecting either after february,before february,or one of each.the letter further stated that if the information or a request for an extension was not received within ten days,the modification request would be considered cancelled.the appellants submitted the additional proof of income by fax on march,eleven days past the deadline set in the march letter.
it appears that nowhere in the record have appellants offered any explanation or otherwise attempted to account for their delay in responding to wells fargo march letter containing the deadline.to the contrary,as we discuss infra,appellants have insisted,alternatively,that wells fargo did not need to see additional pay stubs that its receipt of the additional pay stubs after the deadline was sufficient to qualify them for hamp relief 
in any event,wells fargo sent a delinquency notice on april,asserting the appellants owed.wells fargo sent a second hamp introduction letter and application packet on july.additional delinquency notices were sent on july and july.a notice of intent to foreclose was sent on july.on august,wells fargo sent appellants a denial of their hamp application,citing their failure to provide the requested documents within the specific time period.appellants continued to apply for a hamp modification after that,but were denied each time.
another foreclosure notice was sent on september.by that point,appellants had not made a mortgage payment since june 
on july,spaulding and haylett filed suit against wells fargo in the circuit court for howard county,maryland,alleging five counts breach of contract count i,negligence count ii,violations of the maryland consumer protection act mcpa count iii,negligent misrepresentation count iv,and common law fraud count v.wells fargo removed the action to the united states district court for the district of maryland on the basis of diversity.
the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.spaulding wells fargo bank,civ.no.glr,wl,at.july.the court found that absent a trial period plan tpp agreement,which creates privity of contract,a suit that seeks the general enforcement of the hamp guidelines must fail.id.the court noted that congress created no private right of action for the denial of a hamp application,citing several cases to that effect.see id.citing ramos bank of america,no.dkc,wl,at.june,allen citimortgage,no.ccb,wl,at.here,the district court noted,the plaintiffs did not allege that a tpp agreement was in place or even that it was offered.id.therefore,because the entire complaint arises out of an alleged failure to follow the hamp guidelines,it must fail.id.
the court found that count i,breach of contract,failed because no contract,either express or implied,existed between the plaintiffs and wells fargo.spaulding,wl,at.the appellants had applied for a tpp agreement,but wells fargo rejected their application.id.thus,there was never any contract to be breached.
the court found that count ii negligence and count iv negligent misrepresentation failed because wells fargo did not owe plaintiffs a tort duty.spaulding,wl,at.the court noted that in maryland,causes of action based on negligence or negligent misrepresentation require the plaintiff to prove a duty owed to them.id.citing jacques first bank of.because in maryland the relationship between a bank and borrower is contractual,not fiduciary,in nature,then,absent special circumstances,courts are reluctant to impose extra,fiduciary duties upon a bank not found in the contract or loan agreement a bank has with its customer.id.at.the court thus found that because the appellants and wells fargo had not entered into an implied or express contract,no tort duty could arise as a matter of law.id.at.
finally,the court considered count iii violations of the mcpa and count v common law fraud of the complaint.the court noted that the mcpa prohibits the making of a false or misleading oral or written statement that has the capacity,tendency,or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers.spaulding,wl,at citing,com.law.to bring a common law fraud claim,a party must show that the defendant made a false representation.id.quoting parker columbia bank.here,the court observed,wells fargo acknowledged receipt of the appellants loan modification application and replied by asking for additional information within a specified period,a deadline appellants failed to meet.the court found that the clarity of wells fargo letter does not support plaintiffs allegations of the misrepresentations needed to support claims of mcpa violations and common law fraud.id.further,the appellants had not met the heightened pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b.accordingly,the court granted wells fargo motion to dismiss.id.at.
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,focusing only on the legal sufficiency of the complaint.giarratano johnson,cir.we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,but we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts.shore,assocs,cir.a complaint must be dismissed if it does not allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.
appellants alleged five state law counts breach of contract negligence violations of the maryland consumer protection act negligent misrepresentation and common law fraud.we hold for the reasons set forth within that the district court correctly granted wells fargo motion to dismiss all five counts 
under maryland law,t he formation of a contract requires mutual assent offer and acceptance,an agreement definite in its terms,and sufficient consideration,selective ins.of,cir citing peer first fed.sav.and loan ass of cumberland.an agreement implied in fact is founded upon a meeting of minds,which,although not embodied in an express contract,is inferred,as a fact,from conduct of the parties showing,in the light of the surrounding circumstances,their tacit understanding.hercules,united states,d quoting baltimore ohio united states.
appellants argue that the parties clearly shared a tacit understanding rising to the level of an contract that the application was to be processed and approved under hamp.appellants br.at.according to appellants,there was sufficient consideration on their side of this alleged contract 
the consideration was the appellants promise to comply with the hamp requirements,and their act of taking time to complete and submit the application.
appellants br.at insertions added.moreover,according to appellants,wells fargo bound itself to comply with the applicable standard of care,see supra,by virtue of its following conduct entering into an agreement with the treasury to participate in hamp consenting to the treasury publicly listing wells fargo as a hamp participant stating,in its foreclosure notice to appellants,that i f you are eligible for hamp,we will look at your monthly income and housing costs,including any past due payments,and then determine an affordable mortgage payment and regularly sending hamp starter kits to distressed homeowners stating,to start,we must receive specific documentation from you.then we determine if you qualify for the first step of the process,which is the trial period plan.id.at.
as a matter of law,however,none of this conduct is sufficient to constitute a meeting of the minds evidencing a contract,or otherwise.wells fargo agreement with the treasury was an agreement between the bank and the treasury,an agreement to which appellants were not a party and which they have no authority to enforce.nothing about that agreement could be considered to extend legal rights to appellants.
moreover,both the foreclosure notice and hamp starter kit contain clear qualifying language that falls short of the definiteness required to make a contract.under contract law,when some further act of the purported offeror is necessary,the purported offeree has no power to create contractual relations,and there is as yet no operative offer.joseph perillo,corbin on contracts,at ed.see also richard lord,williston on contracts ed.a condition of subsequent approval by the promisor in the promisor sole discretion gives rise to no obligation.the language in the foreclosure notice and starter kit,we determine if you qualify makes clear that further action was required on the part of wells fargo before an offer would be extended.when there is no offer,there can be no contract.
appellants fall back on the argument that wells fargo offered to process an application under hamp.appellants br.at.assuming arguendo this was an offer amenable to a binding acceptance by appellants though,as explained,the qualifying language extinguishes such a theory and that appellants accepted the offer by submitting an application on february,wells fargo did in fact process the application,as shown by its march,letter to appellants noting receipt of the application and asking for additional income information.appellants repeated invocation,see supra,of their counterfactual legal conclusions the application contained all of the documentation required under the hamp guidelines the application showed that the homeowners were eligible under hamp under the hamp guidelines,which wells fargo knowingly adopted,wells fargo was required to issue a hamp modification to the h
