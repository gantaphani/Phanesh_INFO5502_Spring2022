the primary issue in this appeal is whether a contractual indemnity provision meets the requirements of the texas express negligence rule,entitling the indemnitee to relief from a judgment based on its own negligence.by,the indemnitee challenges its insurer compliance with the duty to defend.the insurer,in turn,challenges the insured compliance with the cooperation clause in the insurance policy.
this court concludes that,as a matter of law,the contract does not meet the texas express negligence rule requirements for indemnification of losses arising from the indemnitee own negligence.as to the insurance issues,the record discloses genuine issues of fact material to determining whether the insurer breached its duty to defend.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment,rendering as to the indemnification issue and remanding as to the duty to defend issues.the reasons are explained below.
background 
in,quorum health resources,quorum,a hospital management company,entered into a management agreement with the maverick county hospital district fort duncan medical center the hospital the hospital was insured by the texas hospital insurance exchange and texas hospital insurance network,collectively,thie.quorum was an additional named insured on the hospital policy 
in june,david and veronica rodriguez filed suit in state court in maverick county,texas,on behalf of themselves and their minor daughter,cristina.the rodriguez family sued the hospital and the obstetrician,three registered nurses,and the nurse practitioner present at cristina birth.the rodriguez plaintiffs alleged medical malpractice during the delivery that left cristina with severe mental and physical disabilities the hospital timely notified thie of the lawsuit.thie assigned a law firm to represent all the defendants.
in march,the rodriguez plaintiffs joined the hospital management company,quorum,as an additional defendant.thie assigned the same lawyer to represent quorum,along with the previously named defendants.the joint representation proceeded until april,when quorum asserted a conflict of interest and requested separate counsel.the parties dispute what happened next.thie asserts that it offered quorum separate counsel from its list of approved attorneys,but quorum rejected the lawyer offered and insisted on an attorney who was not on thie list.quorum agrees that thie offered a lawyer,but asserts that this lawyer declined the representation and that thie failed to offer a replacement.
the rodriguez suit proceeded to trial in eagle pass,texas,in november.quorum was represented by counsel it had selected without thie participation or involvement.quorum excess insurer,american continental insurance,paid the costs of quorum defense.before trial began,the rodriguez plaintiffs nonsuited all the defendants except quorum.the parents,david and veronica rodriguez,nonsuited their individual claims against quorum.the trial proceeded with quorum as the only defendant,on claims for actual and exemplary damages for simple and gross negligence,on behalf of the minor child.
plaintiffs tried the case on the basis of the ninth amended petition,which alleged that quorum committed separate acts of negligence.the allegations included negligent hiring of untrained nursing personnel,failing properly to train nursing personnel,failing to enforce the hospital personnel policies,and negligently hiring and training the quorum employees who managed the hospital.the petition did not allege that quorum was vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of the hospital medical staff or the obstetrician who attended the delivery,but who was not a hospital employee.the petition did allege that quorum was vicariously liable for the negligence of two of quorum own employees working at the hospital under the management agreement the hospital administrator and the controller 
the jury found that quorum negligently performed services to the hospital that increased the risk of injury or harm to a patient of the hospital and proximately caused injury or harm to a patient by reliance of the hospital upon quorum undertaking to perform such services.the jury found quorum percent responsible for cristina rodriguez injuries.the jury also found the attending obstetrician negligent and assessed comparative causation at percent.the jury awarded million in actual damages and,finding malice on the part of quorum,awarded an additional million in exemplary damages.
plaintiffs settled with the obstetrician before the verdict.in an amended final judgment,the trial court deducted the amount of the settlement and added prejudgment interest,awarding actual damages of approximately million before postjudgment interest.the trial court disregarded the jury finding of malice and ordered that plaintiffs not recover exemplary damages against quorum.
quorum filed a declaratory judgment suit in federal district court,alleging that the indemnity provision in its management agreement required the hospital to indemnify quorum for the rodriguez judgment and required the hospital to defend quorum in the rodriguez suit.quorum also sought a declaratory judgment that thie had breached its duty to defend quorum under the insurance policy and owed quorum a duty to indemnify for the resulting judgment,up to the policy limits.
both the and management agreements between the hospital and quorum contained the following indemnity provision 
hospital agrees to indemnify and hold harmless quorum,its affiliates,and each of their shareholders,directors,officers,employees,and agents quorum indemnified party from and against any and all losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses related to the defense of any claims,joint or several,which may be asserted against any of the quorum indemnified parties or for which they may now or hereafter become subject arising in connection with the activity of the hospital quorum claim,including but not limited to i alleged or actual failure by the board to perform any of its duties hereunder,ii any pending or threatened medical malpractice or other tort claims asserted against quorum iii any action against quorum brought by any of the hospital current or former employees or medical staff members iv any act or omission by any hospital employee,medical staff member,or other personnel and v any violation of any requirement applicable to the hospital under any federal,state or local environmental,hazardous waste or similar law or regulation provided that such claims have not been caused by the gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of the quorum indemnified party seeking indemnification pursuant to this agreement.
the management agreement contained the following provision setting out quorum reciprocal indemnity obligation to the hospital 
quorum agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the hospital and its shareholders,directors,officers or trustees hospital indemnified party from and against all losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs and expenses including reasonable attorney fees and expenses related to the defense of any claims,joint or several,which may be asserted against any hospital indemnified party hospital claim,as a result of any personnel or other action brought against the hospital indemnified party by any key person the administrator and controller relating to any acts performed by such key person within the scope of his or her employment by quorum provided that such hospital claims have not been caused by the gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of the hospital indemnified party seeking indemnification pursuant to this agreement.
the management agreement contained this same provision,with one change.the agreement contained the provision stating that quorum would indemnify the hospital for losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs and expenses as a result of actions brought by a key person.however,the agreement added that quorum would indemnify the hospital for losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs and expenses from claims asserted against the hospital as a result of the sole negligence of quorum outside the scope of its employment provided that such hospital claims have not been caused by the gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of the hospital indemnified party seeking indemnification pursuant to this agreement.
the insurance policy thie issued to the hospital provided,in relevant part,as follows 
thie shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages because of such injury even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false,or fraudulent.the company may make such investigation and,with the written consent of the insured,such settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.the company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of the company liability has been exhausted by payment of the judgment or settlements.
the policy further provided that 
the insured and each of its employees shall cooperate with the company and,upon the company request,assist in the conduct of suits no action shall lie against the company unless,as a condition precedent thereto,there shall have been full compliance with all the terms of this policy 
quorum and the hospital filed for summary judgment as to the enforceability of the hospital obligation to indemnify quorum for the million judgment.quorum and thie filed for summary judgment as to whether thie had breached its duty to defend and whether quorum had breached its duty of cooperation.the district court held that the indemnity provision in the management agreement between the hospital and quorum met the texas express negligence rule and required the hospital to indemnify quorum for the damages resulting from quorum own negligence,making the hospital liable for the amount quorum paid to settle the rodriguez judgment,approximately million the hospital did not owe quorum common law indemnification under texas law the statutory damage cap applicable to the hospital as a governmental unit of the state of texas under the texas tort claims did not limit the hospital obligation to indemnify quorum the hospital did not owe quorum a duty to defend because the management agreement permitted,but did not require,the hospital to participate in the defense of any action against quorum thie did not breach its duty to defend quorum under the insurance policy and thie was not obligated to indemnify quorum for the rodriguez judgment because quorum breached its duty to cooperate with the insurer under the policy by rejecting the defense counsel thie offered.all parties appealed.
the hospital appeals on two grounds the indemnity provision in the management agreement fails the express negligence test under texas law and is unenforceable as to losses resulting from quorum own negligence and the hospital indemnity obligations to quorum,if any,are limited by the statutory cap limiting tort damages against a state hospital district.quorum asserts it is entitled to contractual indemnity from the hospital for the million that quorum paid to settle with the rodriguez family.quorum and the hospital agree that the indemnification issues between them are properly decided as a matter of law.
quorum from the district court grant of summary judgment,holding that thie did not breach its duty to defend quorum and that quorum did breach its duty to cooperate with thie.quorum argues that there are genuine issues of fact material to determining whether thie satisfied its obligation to provide counsel to quorum or whether quorum rejected the lawyer thie provided.quorum argues that the evidence in the record either negated thie claim that quorum breached the cooperation clause or,at least,raised genuine factual disputes that precluded summary judgment.quorum also asserts that the record contains no evidence that thie suffered prejudice as a result of quorum actions or,at least,raised genuine factual disputes as to whether thie lost any right under its policy,precluding summary judgment.quorum argues that the district court ruling on these issues should be reversed and remanded for trial.
because of our resolution of the hospital first ground for appeal,we do not decide whether the hospital indemnity obligations to quorum are limited by the texas statutory cap on tort damages against a state hospital district.the other bases for appeal and are examined below.

iii.analysis 
a.the texas express negligence rule 
the express negligence rule is a rule of contract interpretation that applies specifically to agreements to indemnify another party for the consequences of that party own negligence.under the express negligence rule,contracting parties seeking to indemnify one party from the consequences of its own negligence must express that intent in specific terms,within the four corners of the document.ethyl daniel const.the texas supreme court adopted this rule in the ethyl case,rejecting the less stringent clear and unequivocal test,in recognition of the fact that indemnification of a party for its own negligence is an extraordinary shifting of risk.dresser industries,page petroleum.the express negligence rule is based on a requirement of fair notice.dresser,at.
in ethyl,a third party successfully sued ethyl,the premises owner,for injuries occurring during the performance of ethyl contract with daniel,the contractor.at.ethyl then sued daniel,seeking contractual indemnity.the jury found both ethyl and daniel negligent,apportioning liability for the third party injuries ninety percent to ethyl and ten percent to daniel.the contractual indemnity provision stated as follows 
daniel shall indemnify and hold ethyl harmless against any loss or damage to persons or property as a result of operations growing out of the performance of this contract and caused by the negligence or carelessness of daniel,daniel employees,subcontractors,and agents and licensees.
id.at.the texas supreme court held that this contractual language did not meet the express negligence test.ethyl argued that it was entitled to indemnification from daniel.the court held that the language providing indemnification for any loss as a result of operations did not expressly state that the indemnity obligation included losses resulting from ethyl own negligence.the texas supreme court held that under the express negligence rule,i ndemnitees seeking indemnity for the consequences of their own negligence which proximately causes injury jointly or concurrently with the indemnitor negligence must also meet the express negligence test.id.at.the contract contained no provision for contractual comparative indemnity,and the texas supreme court refused to imply such an obligation from the contract language.
the texas supreme court explained the need for the strict requirements of the express negligence doctrine 
as we have moved closer to the express negligence doctrine,the scriveners of indemnity agreements have devised novel ways of writing provisions which fail to expressly state the true intent of those provisions.the intent of the scriveners is to indemnify the indemnitee for its negligence,yet be just ambiguous enough to conceal that intent from the indemnitor.the result has been a plethora of law suits to construe those ambiguous contracts.we hold the better policy is to cut through the ambiguity of those provisions and adopt the express negligence doctrine.
id.at.whether a contractual indemnity provision complies with the express negligence doctrine is a question of law for the court.see dresser,at fisk constructors.
does the express negligence rule apply 
the express negligence rule applies if quorum seeks indemnification for its own acts of negligence or for the joint or concurrent negligence of quorum and the hospital.indemnitees seeking indemnity for the consequences of their own negligence which proximately causes injury jointly or concurrently with the indemnitor negligence must also meet the express negligence test.ethyl,at.if quorum is seeking indemnification for the consequences of the hospital negligence,the express negligence doctrine does not apply.see gulf ins.burns motors,boston old colony ins.tiner assocs,cir.
quorum argues that the judgment in the rodriguez suit is not based on quorum own negligence,but rather solely on the negligence of the hospital board and the hospital personnel who attended cristina rodriguez delivery.the rodriguez plaintiffs nonsuited the hospital and its employees before trial.the rodriguez jury answered questions only as to the negligence of quorum and the obstetrician,who was not a hospital employee.the jury found that quorum negligently fulfilled duties it owed to the patients of the hospital.the jury answered the comparative causation issue by finding quorum percent at fault and the obstetrician percent at fault.the jury answered questions finding that quorum was liable for the negligence of the quorum administrator and controller,quorum employees provided to the hospital under the management agreement.
the record does not support quorum argument that the damages awarded resulted from the sole negligence of the hospital and its employees and staff members,not quorum employees.the express negligence rule applies.
does the contract language satisfy the express negligence rule 
quorum argues that the language of the indemnity provision satisfies the texas express negligence rule,so as to require the hospital to indemnify quorum from the consequences of quorum own negligence.quorum relies on one general provision and two more specific provisions of the management agreement paragraph entitled indemnification by hospital.
the first provision quorum invokes is the statement that the hospital will indemnify quorum from losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs,and expenses arising in connection with the activity of the hospital quorum claim.the second provision is the definition of quorum claim as including but not limited to any pending or threatened medical malpractice or other tort claims asserted against quorum.the third provision is the statement that the hospital will not indemnify quorum for claims caused by quorum gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.as to the second and third provisions,quorum argues that because a medical malpractice claim is a negligence claim,and because the express exclusion for gross negligence is tantamount to the express inclusion of ordinary negligence,the contract,construed as a whole,sufficiently expressed the parties intent to require the hospital to indemnify quorum for its own ordinary negligence the hospital argues that the contract language fails to meet the stringent requirements of the texas express negligence rule.
this court compares the language of the management agreement indemnity provision to similar provisions that courts have examined under the texas express negligence standard.the comparison reveals that the management agreement provision does not meet the texas express negligence rule and can not be the basis for requiring the hospital to indemnify quorum for the judgment resulting from its own negligence or the concurrent negligence of the indemnitor and indemnitee.
the texas supreme court has consistently refused to enforce indemnity agreements that do not expressly and specifically provide for indemnification for the indemnitee own negligence.general,broad statements of indemnity are not effective to shift the consequences of the indemnitee own negligence to the indemnitor.the indemnity provision that the court found ineffective in ethyl,the case in which texas adopted the express negligence rule,provided that the contractor would indemnify the owner against any loss incurred as a result of operations growing out of the performance of this contract and caused by the negligence or carelessness of contractor indemnitor at.the texas supreme court rejected the argument that this broad language sufficiently expressed the intent that the would absorb the consequences of the negligence,including joint negligence.id.
the texas courts have rigorously applied the express negligence rule since ethyl was decided.in gulf coast masonry,a contractor agreed to indemnify the plant owner for losses arising out of or in any way connected with or attributable to the performance or of work hereunder by contractor id.at.the texas supreme court held that the clause failed the express negligence test because the language did not specifically and expressly state that the losses included those resulting from the owner own negligence.id.in fisk constructors,the indemnity clause provided that t o the fullest extent permitted by law,fisk shall indemnify,hold harmless,and defend constructors from and against all claims,damages,losses,and expenses,including but not limited to attorney fees arising out of or resulting from the performance of fisk work.at.the texas supreme court held that language insufficiently specific to provide fair notice that fisk was obligated to indemnify constructors for its own negligence.id.at see also ddd energy,veritas dgc land,dist,holding that the following clause did not expressly state that veritas would indemnify ddd for ddd own negligence veritas shall indemnify,defend,ddd for all claims,damages,causes of actions,and liabilities resulting from veritas failure to conduct seismic operations in an orderly and workmanlike manner.
the texas supreme court has applied the express negligence rule so strictly that contracts defining what is included in an indemnity obligation by stating what is excluded fail the rule requirements.in singleton crown cent.petroleum,the plaintiff sued the premises owner and the contractor,for injuries caused by the contractor employee.the jury found that the owner and contractor were concurrently negligent.the trial court required the contractor to indemnify the owner based on an indemnity agreement that provided as follows 
contractor agrees to indemnify owner from and against any and all claims of every kind and character whatsoever,for or in connection with loss of life or personal injury directly or indirectly arising out of the activities of contractor excepting only claims arising out of accidents resulting from the sole negligence of owner.
dist.emphasis added.the texas supreme court held that the indemnity agreement did not satisfy the express negligence rule.singleton,at.the court explained this result more fully in a later opinion 
the indemnity contract in singleton did not specifically state that contractor was obligated to indemnify owner for owner own negligence.rather,it specifically stated what was not to be indemnified,claims resulting from the sole negligence of the owner.the agreement was an implicit indemnity agreement requiring owner to deduce his full obligation from the sole negligence exception.
atlantic richfield petroleum personnel.
under these texas supreme court cases,a contract subject to the express negligence rule can not define what is included in an indemnity provision by stating what obligations are outside that indemnity agreement.such implicit agreements to require an indemnitor to indemnify against the indemnitee own negligence are not express and,therefore,not enforceable.id.
by contrast,texas courts have enforced indemnity agreements that state,in clear,express,and specific terms,the extent of the obligation to indemnify.in atlantic richfield,the court considered an indemnity clause providing that the indemnitor would indemnify the indemnitee for any negligent act or omission of the indemnitee,its officers,agents or employees at.the texas supreme court held that this language met the requirements of the express negligence rule.id.in enserch parker,the court considered a clause providing that the indemnitor would indemnify for any claims regardless of whether such claims are founded in whole or in part upon alleged negligence of the indemnitee and that the indemnitor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnitee in respect to such matters.the court held that the contract defined the parties intent to indemnify for the consequences of the indemnitee own negligence.id.at.in maxus exploration,moran brothers,the court found that the following provision met the express negligence test diamond shamrock agree s to indemnify moran against all bodily injury,death and property claims by its employees or the employees of its contractors without limit and without regard to the cause or causes thereof or the negligence of any party or parties,see also permian union texas petroleum,paso,no writ clause providing contractor hereby indemnifies and agrees to protect,hold and save union texas harmless from and against all claims,including but not limited to injuries to employees of contractor,on account of,arising from or resulting,directly or indirectly,from the work services performed by contractor and whether the same is caused or contributed to by the negligence of union texas,its agent or employees,met the express negligence test.
at one end of the spectrum,general statements providing for indemnification for a type of activity from which losses or claims arise do not satisfy the express negligence doctrine.see,fisk,at gulf coast masonry,at ethyl,at.statements that require inference or extension to impose an indemnification obligation for the indemnitee own negligence do not satisfy the express negligence doctrine.see,singleton,at houston lighting power atchison,topeka,santa fe rwy,provision expressly providing indemnification for indemnitee own negligence could not be inferentially extended to include indemnification for strict liability claims against indemnitee see also glendale constr,accurate air,dist,writ denied indemnification clause applying to loss regardless of whether it was caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder does not expressly include loss from negligence lee lewis,harrison,aff on other grounds,same.at the other end of the spectrum,indemnity provisions explicitly and affirmatively stating that the parties intend to provide indemnification for the indemnitee own negligence provide fair notice under the express negligence doctrine.see,maxus exploration,at atlantic richfield,at enserch,at.
quorum essentially argues that the indemnity provisions in the management agreement place it at the enforceable end of the spectrum,allowing the district court to use general contract construction principles to view the contract as a whole and conclude that the indemnity clauses were sufficiently specific to give the hospital fair notice of its obligation to indemnify quorum for losses resulting from quorum own negligence.quorum argument fails under the texas cases on which it relies.
quorum first relies on the general statement in the indemnification by hospital provision,stating that the hospital agrees to indemnify and hold harmless quorum for any and all losses,claims,damages,liabilities,costs,and expenses joint or several arising in connection with the activity of the hospital under clear texas supreme court precedent,this language is insufficient to establish,in the required express terms,that the parties intended that the hospital would indemnify quorum for its own negligence.see,ethyl,at any loss arising as a result of operations does not convey intent to cover the indemnitee own negligence.
quorum argues that indemnity provision definition of the losses,claims,and damages for which the hospital must indemnify quorum provides the necessary specificity.the management agreement defines the losses,claims,and damages covered by the hospital indemnification obligation as including,but not limited to medical malpractice and other tort claims asserted against quorum.quorum argues that medical malpractice or other tort claims asserted against quorum includes claims based on quorum own negligence.however,not all losses,claims,damages,or liabilities arising in connection with a medical malpractice or other tort claim asserted against quorum are necessarily based on quorum own negligence.a statement that indemnification applies to certain types of claims does not extend the obligation to the indemnitee own negligence,even if the types of claims specified could include claims based on the indemnitee negligence.in ethyl,for example,the contract provided indemnity for losses as a result of the operations growing out of the performance of this contract.at.ethyl,the indemnitee,argued that this language was so broad that it covered all losses resulting from contract performance,including losses caused by ethyl own negligence.the texas supreme court held that such a broad statement of indemnity did not meet the express negligence test.accord gulf coast masonry,at claims arising out of or in any way connected with or attributable to a list of specified items did not state with sufficient specificity the parties intent to indemnify for the party own negligent performance of the described items ddd energy,at all claims asserted on account of damage to property insufficient to establish intent to indemnify for the indemnitee own negligence that caused damage to property.
the language in the management agreement provision setting out the hospital obligation to indemnify quorum does not expressly and specifically state that the hospital must indemnify quorum for losses,damages,liabilities,and costs of defense,arising in connection with medical malpractice or other tort claims asserted against quorum and resulting from quorum negligence.the language in the provision does not satisfy the requirements of the express negligence rule.
quorum also argues,and the district court concluded,that the language excluding losses or claims caused by quorum gross negligence from the hospital obligation to indemnify quorum meant that the parties intended to include losses,damages,and claims caused by quorum simple negligence within the hospital indemnity obligation.quorum cites established principles of contract construction and interpretation to support this result.however,the express negligence doctrine is a rule of contract construction that imposes requirements beyond the established principles of construction on which quorum relies.see dresser,at.the express negligence rule requires an explicit statement of the parties intention to require the hospital to indemnify quorum for the consequences of its own simple negligence.ethyl,at.
the texas supreme court has held that an indemnity agreement that implies an obligation to indemnify for the indemnitee own negligence as to one category or type of liability by excluding it for a different category or type of liability is not enforceable under the express negligence doctrine.the texas supreme court held in singleton,at,and atlantic richfield,at,that an agreement that implies an obligation to indemnify for the indemnitee own negligence as to one degree or type of excluding it for a different degree or type of not enforceable under the express negligence doctrine.under that holding,the language in the management agreement requiring deduction to determine what is included in the indemnity for quorum simple the description of what is for quorum gross not meet the explicit requirement of the texas express negligence rule.
texas cases decided since singleton and atlantic richfield have reached similar results.in texas utils.babcock wilcox,no writ,texas utilities sought indemnification from babcock wilcox for a claim that texas utilities had settled with a third party arising from the use of equipment sold by babcock wilcox to texas utilities.texas utilities,the purchaser,asserted that it and babcock wilcox,the seller,were concurrently negligent in causing the injury that formed the basis of the claim.id.the indemnity provision in the contract between the parties provided that 
seller shall indemnify purchaser from and against any and all claims of every kind and character whatsoever arising in favor of any person or entity with the only exception being that purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification for claims,demands,expenses,judgments,and causes of action resulting from purchaser sole negligence.
id.at.the court held that,as in singleton,the contract exclusion of the sole negligence from the indemnity obligation failed the express negligence test because it did not affirmatively state that the parties intended to include indemnity for concurrent negligence.id.similarly,in houston lighting power,at,the texas supreme court held that a contract provision expressly providing indemnification for the indemnitee own negligence could not be extended by inference to require indemnification for the indemnitee losses resulting from strict liability.
these results are consistent with ethyl itself,the opinion in which the texas supreme court adopted the express negligence test as the texas rule.in ethyl,the court first considered whether the contractor was required to indemnify the owner for the damages based on a broad provision providing indemnity for losses as a result of the operations growing out of the performance of this contract.at.the court held that the indemnity obligation did not extend to the owner own negligence.the indemnity provision also explicitly stated that the contractor would indemnify the owner for damages caused by the negligence or carelessness of contractor.ethyl argued it was entitled to indemnification because the jury found the damages were proximately caused by both the owner and contractor.at.the court held,however,that this provision,requiring indemnification for losses caused by the indemnitor negligence,did not include indemnification for the concurrent negligence of both the indemnitee and indemnitor.the contract did not explicitly include concurrent negligence within the indemnity obligation and the court declined to find it by deduction or inference.id.
these texas cases make it clear that an indemnity provision excluding one degree or type of liability does not permit a texas court to find that the parties implicitly intended to include indemnification for a different degree or type of liability.this result applies even if excluding the specified type or degree of liability appears,by deduction,to leave only the type or degree of liability for which indemnity is sought.excluding sole negligence from an indemnity obligation would appear to leave concurrent negligence within the indemnity obligation,but the texas supreme court in singleton and atlantic richfield held that a contract can not implicitly include an obligation to indemnify for the indemnitee concurrent negligence by explicitly excluding the obligation to indemnify for the indemnitee sole negligence.singleton,at atlantic richfield,at.
a provision excluding the indemnitee gross negligence from the losses,damages,or claims covered by the indemnity obligation appears,by deduction,to leave the indemnitee simple negligence within the indemnity obligation.however,just as a provision explicitly excluding indemnification for the indemnitee sole negligence is insufficient to establish inclusion of indemnification for the indemnitee concurrent negligence,so the provision in the management agreement explicitly excluding quorum gross negligence from the hospital indemnification obligation is insufficient to require the hospital to indemnify quorum for quorum simple negligence.the indemnity provision exclusion of losses,damages,and claims caused by quorum gross negligence from the hospital indemnity obligation does not explicitly state that the hospital is obligated to indemnify quorum for losses,damages,or claims caused by quorum simple negligence.rather,the exclusion of gross negligence creates an implicit agreement to indemnify for simple negligence,requiring the hospital to deduce its full obligation from the gross negligence exception.an implicit indemnity agreement does not pass the texas express negligence test.singleton,at atlantic richfield,at houston lighting power,at.
quorum cites fina,arco,cir,to support its argument that the indemnity provision is sufficient to meet the express negligence test.in fina,the court held that an indemnity provision excluding claims caused by the indemnitee gross negligence did not expressly state the parties intent to indemnify against strict liability claims.in reaching this conclusion,the court in fina stated even if the exclusion of gross negligence from the indemnity coverage is interpreted as indicating that the indemnitor intended to indemnify the indemnitee for ordinary negligence,claims based on strict liability are of quite a different nature.at citing rizzo john healy and sons,wl,at,laws ayre leasing,wl,at.july.quorum argues that this sentence permits a court to find that a contract excluding gross negligence from indemnification shows the parties intent to include simple negligence.
fina involved contracts governed by both texas and delaware law.although the court made the statement quorum cites in analyzing whether the indemnity provision was enforceable under texas law,the only authorities the court cited in support are unpublished delaware cases.delaware follows the more permissive clear and unequivocal test.as the court in fina noted,when the texas supreme court adopted the express negligence standard,it rejected the clear and unequivocal test.in fina,the court concluded that under texas law,an indemnity provision expressly excluding gross negligence claims could not be enforced as applied to a strict liability claim.the dicta in fina does not make the indemnification provision at issue here enforceable.
quorum also relies on banzhaf adt sec.southwest,pet.denied,involving an indemnity provision in a security alarm installation contract.the contract provided that the store would indemnify the alarm company,adt,for claims against adt for failure of its equipment or service in any respect.id.the court stated that the provision met the express negligence rule and required indemnification of adt for claims based on failure of adt equipment or service in any respect.id.banzhaf does not lead to the conclusion that the hospital must indemnify quorum for its sole negligence under the management agreement.in banzhaf,another section of the indemnity provision made it clear that the parties intended to indemnify adt if loss,damage or injury resulted from performance or nonperformance of obligations imposed by this contract or from negligence,active or otherwise,of adt,its agents or employees,a statement which clearly did satisfy the express negligence rule.id.at.
the banzhaf court cited arthur garage,sec,no pet,in support of its statement that a contract does not have to include the word negligence to satisfy the express negligence doctrine.arthur garage does not support this statement because the indemnity clause in that case did include the word negligence.in arthur garage,the indemnity clause in the alarm installation contract provided that the purchaser would indemnify the seller for claims brought by third parties 
regardless of cause,including seller performance or failure to perform,and including defects in products,design,installation,maintenance,operation or of the system,whether based upon negligence,active or passive,warranty,or strict product liability on the part of seller,its employees or agents 
id.at.the court concluded that because this provision clearly and specifically provides that it covers any negligence on the part of the security alarm seller and installer,it met the express negligence test.id 
in contrast to banzhaf,other texas courts of appeals have held that an indemnity provision must specifically refer to the indemnitee own negligence to meet the express negligence test.in monsanto fiberglas,dist,no writ,the houston court of appeals held that the contract did not meet the express negligence test,in part because the agreement did not use the word negligence.in lee lewis,at,the court interpreted ethyl and its progeny as explicitly requiring the parties to use the word negligence in stating the indemnitor obligation to indemnify the indemnitee for the indemnitee own negligence.
in the cases in which the texas supreme court has allowed indemnification of a party for its own negligence,the contracts contained language that expressly referred to the type of the indemnified party negligence covered by the indemnity obligation.atlantic richfield,enserch,maxus exploration,at payne keller,indemnitor owed indemnification for indemnitee concurrent negligence where indemnity provision covered claims arising out of the acts or omissions of indemnitor in the performance of the work irrespective of whether indemnitee was concurrently negligent but excepting claims caused by the sole negligence of indemnitee.in contrast,texas courts do not allow indemnification of a party for its own negligence when the contract did not expressly identify the precise category of liability for which indemnification was sought.ethyl,at no indemnification for concurrent negligence when sole negligence of indemnitor included singleton,at no indemnification for concurrent negligence when sole negligence of indemnitee excluded texas,at same see also houston lighting power,at no indemnification for strict liability when negligence of indemnitee included fina,at no indemnification for strict liability when gross negligence of indemnitee excluded.the exclusion of coverage for quorum gross negligence falls into the second category because it fails expressly to state the parties intent to require the hospital to indemnify quorum for losses,claims or damages resulting from quorum simple negligence.
the management agreement provision requiring the hospital to indemnify quorum fails to satisfy the fair notice requirements of the express negligence rule.as a matter of law,the provision is not enforceable against the hospital for claims based on quorum own negligence.quorum is not entitled to indemnification from the hospital for the rodriguez judgment.
