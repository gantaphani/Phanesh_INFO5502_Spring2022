in this putative class action,prospective luxury home buyers allege that a real estate development company unlawfully refused to return deposits when the prospective buyers could not obtain mortgage financing.the named plaintiffs appellees are mehdi noohi and soheyla bolouri plaintiffs,a husband and wife defendants appellants are toll,a real estate development company,and several of its subsidiaries collectively,toll brothers.plaintiffs contracted with a subsidiary of toll,for the construction of a luxury home in maryland.the agreement of sale the agreement required that plaintiffs seek approval of a mortgage,and included an arbitration provision.though plaintiffs received a mortgage loan commitment letter from at least one lender that was later rescinded,and though several other of their mortgage applications were all denied,toll brothers sought to keep in plaintiffs deposits.
plaintiffs sued toll brothers individually and on behalf of a class of other prospective buyers who allegedly lost deposits to toll brothers in a similar manner.the district court denied toll brothers motion to dismiss or stay the suit pending arbitration,finding that the agreement arbitration provision lacked mutuality of consideration under maryland law because it required only the buyer but not the seller to submit disputes to arbitration.toll brothers appealed.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that this appeal is properly before us under a,and that the agreement arbitration provision is unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration under maryland law.
we begin by setting out the facts plaintiffs have alleged,which we take as true for purposes of this appeal,see hill peoplesoft usa,cir,although the decision to deny a motion for stay and to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo,patten grading paving,skanska usa,cir citing microstrategy,lauricia,cir.see also johnson circuit city stores,cir.
toll brothers,a publicly traded real estate development company,sells luxury residences in a number of states,including maryland.one of toll brothers subsidiaries,tbi mortgage company tbi mortgage,provides mortgage banking primarily to buyers of toll brothers homes.other subsidiaries contract with individual home buyers for the purchase of newly constructed or planned homes.one such subsidiary,toll land,is the general partner in toll md v limited partnership,with whom plaintiffs contracted to purchase a home.
on february,plaintiffs made an initial reservation deposit of.on february,they entered into the agreement with toll md v to purchase a preconstruction home in glenelg,maryland,for.plaintiffs made an additional deposit of and later deposited another.by february,the deposit total had reached.
the agreement contained a number of relevant provisions.section of the agreement provided that toll brothers would hold the deposit until it was either refunded or forfeited by plaintiffs.section dealt with mortgage application obligations,and directed plaintiffs to complete the mortgage approval process within days.in order to do so,plaintiffs agreed to make a,truthful and complete application to tbi mortgage and any other lender of their choosing,accept a loan commitment,and comply with all terms imposed by the lender.compl.plaintiffs agreed to be responsible for and bear the risk of meeting all terms and conditions of the loan commitment,and the agreement further provided that the termination or expiration of the mortgage commitment after it is received,for any reason,shall not release them of their obligations under the agreement.if plaintiffs were not approved for a mortgage after days,toll brothers could either extend the mortgage application period in order to submit a mortgage request on behalf of plaintiffs,or declare the agreement null and void and refund plaintiffs their deposit.compl.section of the agreement comprised an arbitration provision,and plaintiffs initialed under each of its paragraphs.
plaintiffs applied to tbi mortgage on february,but their application was rejected.on toll brothers recommendation,plaintiffs then applied for a mortgage with first preferred financial,which provided them with a mortgage loan commitment letter for on april.though plaintiffs accepted the letter,first preferred financial informed plaintiffs on june,that it could no longer provide them with financing in light of a recent maryland law prohibiting stated income loans.plaintiffs also sought to secure a mortgage from gmac,but were unsuccessful.
on july,plaintiffs sent a letter to toll brothers,informing them that they were unable to secure a mortgage,and demanding a refund of their deposit pursuant to the agreement of sale.on august,toll brothers responded to plaintiffs by asserting that the first preferred financial commitment letter,although now terminated,had satisfied the mortgage contingency and plaintiffs were still obligated to perform under the agreement.the response further stated that toll brothers would retain plaintiffs deposit if they did not submit additional mortgage applications and proceed to closing.specifically,the letter suggested that plaintiffs contact apex funding group.
on august,plaintiffs wrote to toll brothers,stating that they would continue to work to receive a mortgage.on september,apex funding group gave plaintiffs a loan commitment letter but then declined to approve them for a mortgage.plaintiffs also sought mortgage approvals from other lenders,but were unable to secure financing.
plaintiffs further allege that toll brothers has neither begun construction on the lot in question,nor incurred expenses toward the construction of the home.plaintiffs claim that because toll brothers refused to refund their deposits after the failure of their repeated attempts to secure a mortgage,toll brothers breached the agreement.
plaintiffs sued,filing a class action complaint against toll brothers on march,on behalf of themselves and home buyers around the country who they alleged lost their deposits in a similar manner.federal jurisdiction was founded on the class action fairness act the complaint asserted an amount in controversy of over million,and at least one member of the putative class is a citizen of a different state from one of the defendants.see d.the complaint contained four causes of action breach of contract breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment and unfair and deceptive trade practices,in violation of,commercial law et.
toll brothers filed a motion to dismiss or stay plaintiffs complaint pending arbitration based on the agreement arbitration provision,section.after a hearing,the district court issued an order and memorandum opinion denying the motion.see noohi toll,wl.the court noted that state contract formation law determines the validity of arbitration agreements,and that under maryland law as articulated in cheek united healthcare of mid atlantic,an arbitration provision is treated as a severable contract that must be supported by adequate consideration.after determining that the arbitration provision required only plaintiffs but not toll brothers to submit disputes to arbitration,the court relied on cheek to hold that section of the agreement was unenforceable for lack of consideration.the court did not,however,address the possibility that the rule set forth in cheek was preempted under at t mobility llc concepcion,d,which held that the federal arbitration act faa preempted california judicial rule regarding the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers in consumer contracts.toll brothers appealed.
plaintiffs first argue that we lack jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of toll brothers motion to dismiss or stay pending arbitration.
as we recently reiterated,c ourts of appeal ordinarily may review only final decisions of district courts.rota mclarty santander consumer usa,cir.see also.although a district court order denying a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is not a final decision,we may nevertheless exercise appellate jurisdiction if the order falls within an exception to the final judgment rule established by the faa.rota mclarty,at.
under the faa,courts must stay any suit referable to arbitration under an arbitration agreement,where the court has determined that the agreement so provides,and one of the parties has sought to stay the action.under a a,an appeal may be taken from an order refusing a stay of any action under.in short,a party may appeal the denial of a motion to stay an action concerning a matter that a written agreement has committed to arbitration.see green tree fin.randolph,d holding that a preserves immediate appeal of any final decision with respect to an arbitration,regardless of whether the decision is favorable or hostile to arbitration.see also am.cas.of reading,l j,cir abrogated on other grounds by green tree,at.
plaintiffs acknowledge the above principles but argue that because toll brothers motion was primarily a motion to dismiss,and a motion to dismiss is not an appealable final decision,a a is inapplicable.in other words,according to plaintiffs,for toll brothers motion to be immediately appealable,the motion must seek only a stay.
this overly formal argument fails for at least two reasons.first,toll brothers moved to dismiss or stay,not simply to dismiss.see defs.mem.in supp.of mot.to dismiss or stay pls.compl.pending arbitration at hereinafter,defs.mot.to dismiss or stay emphasis added.the motion conclusion specifically requested that the court dismiss,or in the alternative stay,plaintiffs complaint pending arbitration between plaintiffs and defendants.defs.mot.to dismiss or stay at.as noted above,under a a,a party may appeal the denial of a motion to stay federal proceedings pending arbitration at least to the extent that an appeal concerns the denial of a motion to stay,the fact that the motion also seeks dismissal does not affect its appealability.
second,in assessing whether a motion adequately invoked the faa,the proper inquiry focuses on substance rather than nomenclature.rota mclarty,at.thus,we look to whether a motion evidences a clear intention to seek enforcement of an arbitration clause rather than on whether it adhered to a specific form or explicitly referenced or.id.though toll brothers never sought to have the district court compel arbitration,its entire brief focused on the enforceability of the arbitration provision.toll brothers thus indicated a clear intention to seek enforcement of that provision 
this court therefore has jurisdiction over the instant appeal.
we next examine whether the district court correctly held that the arbitration provision in section of the agreement was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration under cheek.
toll brothers makes the following arguments in support of its view that the court erred in so holding the arbitration provision was supported by the consideration underlying the agreement as a whole the arbitration provision binds both parties to arbitration,and the district court failed to resolve ambiguities in favor of arbitration when it held otherwise cheek is distinguishable on its facts and cheek is inconsistent with the supreme court holding in concepcion because it singles out arbitration provisions by imposing on them a requirement inapplicable to other contract provisions.
plaintiffs make the following arguments in support of the district court holding under maryland law,mutual consideration must exist in the arbitration provision itself the arbitration provision here unambiguously binds only plaintiffs,leaving no ambiguities to interpret in favor of arbitration cheek facts do not render it distinguishable and neither concepcion nor other recent supreme court cases abrogate cheek requirement that an arbitration provision contain mutual consideration.we think plaintiffs have the more persuasive arguments.
we review de novo a district court determination on arbitrability of a civil action.aggarao mol ship mgmt,cir.at the same time,we give due regard to the federal policy favoring arbitration and resolve any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration.hill peoplesoft usa,cir quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
section of the faa,its primary substantive provision,moses cone mem l,at,makes agreements to arbitrate valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
section is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.
moses cone mem l,at.under this federal substantive law,courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,and enforce them according to their terms.concepcion.at internal citations omitted.
however,also permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion.at citation omitted.
applying the above framework,the supreme court has 
held that parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration,mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d,to arbitrate according to specific rules,volt info.sciences,bd.of trustees of leland stanford junior,d,and to limit with whom a party will arbitrate its disputes,stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,d.
concepcion.at emphasis in original.in concepcion,the supreme court further prohibited courts from altering otherwise valid arbitration agreements by applying the doctrine of unconscionability to eliminate a term barring classwide procedures.id.at.
the maryland case at the center of this appeal is cheek united healthcare of mid atlantic.in cheek,the plaintiff was presented with an offer of employment conditioned on acceptance of the employer arbitration policy.id.at.that policy left to the employer the unilateral right to alter,amend,modify,or revoke the p olicy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice.id.at.the plaintiff accepted the offer of employment on the employer terms,but was terminated about seven months later.id.he then filed suit in maryland state court,alleging a number of violations.id.at.the employer filed a motion to dismiss compel arbitration and stay the suit,which the trial court granted.id.the court of appeals of maryland which granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court agreed with the plaintiff argument that the employer unfettered discretion to change the arbitration agreement rendered its promise to arbitrate illusory,and that the agreement was therefore unenforceable for lack of consideration.id.in reaching that conclusion,the court viewed the arbitration agreement as severable from the underlying employment relationship,and limited its assessment of consideration to the four corners of the agreement itself.id.at.
toll brothers first argument is that the arbitration provision in the agreement is enforceable because it was supported by the consideration underlying the agreement as a whole.to assess that argument,we must first determine what law applies.the supreme court has directed that we apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts when assessing whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a matter.hill,at quoting first options of chicago,kaplan,d.see also rota mclarty,at the question of whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists is a matter of contract interpretation governed by state law,which we review de novo.maryland generally follows the lex loci contractus principle,under which the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made controls its validity and construction.kramer bally park place.the agreement was executed in maryland between toll brothers maryland subsidiary toll md v limited partnership and plaintiffs,who resided in maryland at the time it was executed.the agreement also references numerous provisions of maryland law.for example,section references the maryland homeowners association act,section references section of the real property article of the annotated code of maryland,and section references of the business occupations and professions article of the annotated code of maryland.we therefore look to maryland law.
as already discussed,that law was set forth in cheek.there,after a thorough analysis discussing cases that reached conflicting conclusions,maryland highest court specifically rejected the notion that consideration for an underlying contract can serve as consideration for an arbitration provision within that contract.see cheek,at we disagree with cases from other jurisdictions that determine that consideration for an underlying contract also can serve as consideration for an arbitration agreement within the contract,even when the arbitration agreement is drafted so that one party is absolutely bound to arbitrate all disputes,but the other party has the sole discretion to amend,modify,or completely revok e the arbitration agreement at any time and for any reason.the court reasoned that to do otherwise would require straying into the prohibited morass of the merits of the claims by looking to the parties obligations and their potential breach underlying the lawsuit itself.id.at.that merits inquiry could eclipse the role of the arbitrator,should a valid agreement exist,and therefore run afoul of strong federal and maryland policies favoring arbitration as a viable method of dispute resolution.id.at.in other words,where it is asserted that a dispute is bound to arbitration,the role of courts is limited to determining the enforceability of an arbitration provision straying into areas outside that provision is an impermissible encroachment on the arbitrator authority.prima paint flood conklin,d holding that courts may adjudicate claims of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself an issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitrate but may not consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.
there are two published fourth circuit cases that cite cheek.the first is hill peoplesoft usa,cir in hill,this court examined the enforceability of an arbitration agreement under maryland law.there,an employee suing her employer had previously signed a separate arbitration agreement consisting of a document detailing both parties arbitration obligations.id.at.we noted that under maryland law,a court examining whether an arbitration agreement is a valid contract is limited to the language of the arbitration agreement itself.id.at.because the arbitration agreement was a separate contract,however,we did not confront the specific issue of what to do when an arbitration agreement is contained within a larger contract.rather,we held that the district court erred in looking outside the arbitration agreement to an internal dispute solution program that the employer reserved the right to change without notice because the arbitration agreement itself clearly bound both parties to arbitration,it was supported by adequate consideration.id.at.
the second fourth circuit case that cites cheek is dan ryan builders,nelson,cir,a case involving facts strikingly similar to those plaintiffs have alleged here.in dan ryan builders,the defendant builder constructed a new home in west virginia for the plaintiff buyer.the contract contained an arbitration provision purportedly binding both parties,but giving the builder the right to seek arbitration or to file an action for damages if the buyer fail ed to settle on the property within the time required under the agreement.id.at emphasis in original,first alteration added.the buyer sued,arguing that the arbitration provision was unenforceable as a matter of law because it was not supported by mutual consideration,notwithstanding the fact that the contract as a whole was supported by adequate consideration.id.at.the district court agreed and dismissed the builder motion to compel arbitration.id.because the parties contract was governed by west virginia law,and there was no west virginia law directly controlling,this court certified the following question to the west virginia supreme court of appeals does west virginia law require that an arbitration provision,which appears as a single clause in a contract,itself be supported by mutual consideration when the contract as a whole is supported by adequate consideration id.at relevant here,however,is this court assumption that state law was controlling on the issue of whether the consideration underlying the contract could support an arbitration provision see also infra.
in the face of clear maryland law that consideration for an arbitration provision must be in the provision itself,toll brothers argues that we may look outside that provision.its arguments are not persuasive.first,toll brothers cites a string of cases that it claims have rejected challenges to arbitration clauses on mutuality grounds where the underlying contract is supported by adequate consideration.but,as plaintiffs point out,all of those cases are based on the law of states other than maryland.because the relevant inquiry depends on maryland law,cases based on the law of other states are inapposite.
second,toll brothers cites an unpublished district court opinion from new jersey,arakelian country club estates limited partnership,wl,that enforced an arbitration provision contained in an agreement with toll brothers similar to the provision at issue here.not only does arakelian apply north carolina law,however,but it does not even examine the issue of consideration,instead focusing its analysis on the plaintiffs unconscionability argument and which toll brothers subsidiaries were bound by the arbitration provision.wl,at.the reasoning in that case is similarly inapposite.
in short,we apply maryland law to determine the validity of the arbitration provision in the agreement.under maryland law as articulated in cheek,an arbitration provision must be supported by consideration independent of the contract underlying it,namely,mutual obligation.under maryland law,therefore,the validity of the arbitration provision in the agreement drafted and employed by toll brothers must satisfy that requirement,an issue to which we now turn.
toll brothers first fallback argument is that the arbitration provision is supported by consideration within the provision itself because it binds both parties to arbitration.plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that the clause binds only plaintiffs.the arbitration provision reads as follows 
arbitration buyer,on behalf of buyer,and all permanent residents on the premises,including minor children,hereby agree that any and all disputes with seller,seller parent company or their subsidiaries or affiliates arising out of the premises,this agreement,the home warranty,any other agreements,communications or dealings involving buyer,or the construction or condition of the premises including,but not limited to,disputes concerning breach of contract,express and implied warranties,personal injuries illness,mold related claims,representations omissions by seller,and conditions and all other torts and statutory causes of action claims shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of construction arbitration services,cas or its successor or an equivalent organization mutually agreed upon by the parties.if cas is unable to arbitrate a particular claim,then that claim shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the construction rules of arbitration of the american arbitration association or its successor or an equivalent organization mutually agreed upon by the parties.in addition,buyer agrees that buyer may not initiate any arbitration proceeding for any claim s unless and until buyer has first given seller specific written notice of each claim at gibraltar road,horsham,pa,attn warranty dispute resolution and given seller a reasonable opportunity after such notice to cure any default,including the repair of the premises i
