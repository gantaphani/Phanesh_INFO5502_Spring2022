opinion of the court 
kehm oil and golden oil collectively,kehm,owned by george kehm,were dealers of gasoline in western pennsylvania for years,owning texaco gas stations by the end of the relationship.over that period of time,kehm entered into franchise agreements with various distinct entities,including motiva enterprises,llc motiva.motiva,which was at that time by texaco,informed kehm in that as of june,it could no longer license the texaco brand to kehm and would terminate kehm franchise.when motiva terminated kehm franchise in,kehm filed this action under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,claiming that it had an unbroken franchise relationship with texaco that was not properly cancelled under the pmpa.
in this opinion,we address whether kehm was in a franchise relationship with texaco,texaco at the time of termination,requiring texaco to fulfill the requirements of the pmpa before terminating its relationship with kehm.we conclude that motiva,not texaco,had a franchise relationship with kehm at the time of termination and therefore texaco did not,and could not,violate the pmpa.
following a number of franchise agreements that kehm signed with various entities over time,in,kehm entered into a agreement with star enterprises star the final contract.less than a year after the contract was signed,star sent kehm a letter indicating that the contract would be assigned to motiva,a joint venture between texaco,shell oil company shell,and sri.in october,texaco and chevron corporation chevron merged as a condition of approval for the merger,the federal trade commission ftc required texaco to divest its interest in motiva and,if certain conditions were met,to offer to extend motiva ability to license oil until june.chevron and texaco,docket no.accordingly,texaco transferred its interest in motiva to shell and sri and agreed to license its brand to motiva through june.
in light of the impending loss of its ability to license texaco products,motiva sent a letter to kehm in february,stating that as of june,it would no longer have a license in the texaco brand.motiva also indicated that,in its new role as a shell affiliate,it would consider whether to offer kehm a franchise when the texaco licensing agreement expired.in that letter,motiva stated that a s motiva is losing its right to grant you the right to use the texaco trademark,motiva must formally end our texaco brand franchise in accordance with the petroleum marketing practices act effective june.
kehm claims that it did not consider motiva notice to terminate the franchise as an official termination from texaco because a texaco representative had stated that the relationship would continue beyond june.specifically,an employee of chevron products company,james barnes,performed a site visit in march or april of allegedly to negotiate an agreement to continue the franchise relationship between texaco and kehm.kehm also claims that in order to continue the relationship with texaco it agreed to debrand six stations,invest in improving the remaining stations,and offer two of the stations for sale to fund the improvements.kehm contends that it only learned that texaco would not continue the franchise after june,at some point between april and june of that year.kehm and motiva continued to act under the terms of the final contract until the termination of the franchise on june.
kehm brought suit against texaco,texaco refining and marketing east,trmi,motiva,sfm energy llc,chevron,chevron usa,chevron products company,and star in federal district court under the pmpa,seeking a tro,a preliminary injunction,and damages under the pmpa and state law on june,the district court denied the emergency relief,holding that kehm only had a franchise relationship with motiva and that motiva had the right to terminate the relationship under the pmpa because motiva lost the right to use the texaco trademark.
subsequently,texaco,chevron,trmi,and star filed motions for summary judgment,and chevron also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court granted chevron motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and granted the other defendants summary judgment motions,finding that kehm failed to sue within the pmpa one year statute of limitations period.kehm oil texaco,wl,at.in the alternative,the district court found that when its franchise was terminated,kehm did not have a franchise relationship with texaco,and motiva,who kehm did have a franchise relationship with,properly terminated the franchise under the pmpa.id.at.kehm appeals.

the aim of the pmpa is to protect motor fuel station franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or of their franchises,at,as reprinted in,hereinafter senate report.according to the legislative history of the pmpa,congress found that franchisors have more bargaining power than franchisees because franchisees depend on franchisors to supply their main product,motor fuel,and franchisors often control the premises upon which the franchisees operate.amoco oil,cir.because of the imbalance in bargaining power,franchisors,prior to the enactment of the pmpa,were able to enter into contracts granting them great flexibility in their ability to terminate.senate report at,at.therefore,it was determined that there was a need to protect motor fuel franchisees because terminations and,or threats of termination or,were being used by franchisors to compel franchisees to comply with marketing policies of the franchisor.id.at,at.
congress purpose in enacting the pmpa was to protect a franchisee reasonable expectation of continuing the franchise relationship while at the same time insuring that distributors have adequate flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and consumer preferences.slatky amoco oil,cir quoting senate report at,at.in order to achieve these goals,the pmpa restricts the grounds on which a franchisor can terminate or fail to renew a franchise.the pmpa also imposes notice requirements on franchisors looking to terminate or nonrenew the franchise relationship.congress also included a statute of limitations for pmpa actions.the pmpa provides that no action may be maintained under the pmpa unless commenced within year of the date of termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship.a.
a review of the agreements kehm signed with the defendants makes clear that kehm claims are.the most recent agreement between kehm and texaco expired,by its terms,on december.the agreement with trmi expired,by its terms,on june.the final contract with star was set to expire on june,but was assigned to motiva in.in the assignment letter,star indicated to kehm that motiva shall be substituted for star with respect to the rights and obligations of star under these agreements.finally,kehm never had a contractual relationship with chevron,chevrontexaco corporation,chevron products company,or chevron,
accordingly,kehm claims against the defendants are untimely because they were not commenced within year of the date of termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship.a.kehm did not file its lawsuit until june.the defendant with the most recent contract with kehm,star,properly assigned the final contract to motiva in may,over seven years before kehm filed its lawsuit.
kehm argues that its franchise relationship with texaco did not end until june,so that its claim is timely filed kehm contends that,regardless of the specific entity that it contracted with,its franchise relationship with texaco endured throughout the time kehm sold oil at its stations.kehm asserts that texaco violated the pmpa when it did not offer to renew kehm franchise after motiva was no longer able to provide it with oil.
in order to have a timely claim against texaco,we would need to find that texaco and kehm remained in a franchise relationship at least through june,one year prior to the date that kehm filed its lawsuit.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that kehm franchise relationship with texaco ended in.
the term franchise relationship is defined under the pmpa as the respective obligations and responsibilities of a franchisor and a franchisee which result from the marketing of motor fuel under a franchise.the pmpa defines a franchise,in relevant part,as any contract between a distributor and a retailer.a iv.kehm is indisputably not in a franchise with any of the defendants but argues that franchise relationship,as used in the pmpa,is broad enough to encompass its current relationship with texaco.
the legislative history of the pmpa explains why,given that a franchise gives rise to a franchise relationship,the term franchise relationship,rather than simply franchise is used in connection in the nonrenewal provisions of the pmpa.according to the senate report,a franchise relationship covers 
the broad relationship which exists between a franchisor and a franchisee by reason of the franchise agreement.the term is utilized for two reasons.first,in the renewal context,the contract which constitutes the franchise may no longer exist and the term franchise relationship is utilized to avoid any contention that because the franchise does not exist there is nothing to renew.the renewal provisions of the title address the renewal of the relationship between the parties rather than the specific rights or obligations of the parties under the franchise agreement.second,because the title contemplates changes in the specific provisions of the franchise agreement at the time of renewal,the title requires renewal of the relationship between the parties as distinguished from a continuation or extension of the specific provisions of the franchise agreement.use of the narrower term franchise in this context could raise unintended questions regarding the ability of the franchisor to comply with the renewal obligations of the title by offering a n agreement which differs in any particular from the expiring franchise.
senate report at,at see also,at.thus,the senate contemplated two very specific scenarios,neither implicated here,when it decided to use the language franchise relationship rather than simply the word franchise with respect to prohibitions on nonrenewal.franchise relationship was used to require a franchisor to renew with the franchisee,except if certain conditions were satisfied,even if the contract that the parties were operating under had expired.the use of the phrase franchise relationship also allows the franchisor to alter the terms of the franchise agreement between franchise contracts.in this case,the contract between kehm and texaco has not simply expired.the last contract with texaco ended eighteen and a half years and two contracts ago.the senate report does not support kehm view that it was in a franchise relationship with texaco through june.
our view that kehm was not in a franchise relationship with texaco in is further supported by the relevant case law.see hutchens eli roberts oil,cir consumers petroleum texaco,cir.in hutchens,american petrofina marketing fina owned the service station operated by the plaintiff,hutchens.at.fina leased the property to roberts oil,which in turn subleased the property to hutchens.id.hutchens brought a lawsuit under the pmpa when fina terminated the underlying lease between fina and roberts oil.id.the eleventh circuit found that hutchens did not have a claim against fina because under the pmpa,a franchise requires a direct contractual relationship.id.at.
in consumers,consumers petroleum company consumers filed a lawsuit against texaco alleging that it violated the pmpa by misleading consumers into believing that it was planning to remain in michigan,the geographic market in which consumers operated.at.consumers had entered into a number of franchise contracts with texaco and in entered into one such contract for a term.id.at.in,a rumor circulated that texaco planned to withdraw from michigan.id.subsequently,consumers was approached by a competitor of texaco,with an offer to become a franchisee.id.texaco told consumers that it would not withdraw from the market and consumers declined the offer from the competitor.id.two years later,texaco announced its decision to withdraw from michigan.id.texaco provided notice that it would not renew the contract after it expired and the parties entered into a interim agreement,which was designed to ease the transition prior to texaco withdrawal from the market.id.at.
after the interim agreement expired,consumers sued,alleging that texaco misled it into believing that texaco was not planning to withdraw from michigan during the pendency of the five year contract.id.at.texaco moved for summary judgment,claiming that the lawsuit was untimely under the pmpa statute of limitations,as it was filed more than a year after the nonrenewal of the agreement,even though it was filed within a year of the termination of the interim agreement.id.
in order to resolve whether the case was,the sixth circuit considered the meaning of franchise relationship in the context of the pmpa.id.at.the court found that a franchise relationship is nothing more than the distribution obligations and responsibilities resulting from a particular franchise and the franchise and interim franchise form ed separate franchise relationship s.id.at.accordingly,the sixth circuit found that consumers was obliged to sue within one year of the termination of the agreement,because consumers alleged a violation of that agreement.id.at.
in this case,kehm has not had a direct contractual relationship with texaco for almost two decades.kehm is a sophisticated business entity that presumably understood that it was dealing with distinct corporate entities.under hutchens,kehm can not assert the existence of a franchise relationship without the existence of a direct contractual relationship.furthermore,under consumers,an entity needs to sue within a year of the termination that it claims violated the pmpa.in,kehm had a single franchise relationship with motiva and kehm has abandoned any argument that motiva violated the pmpa.we hold that kehm can not reach back to a contract which expired in to claim a current franchise relationship with texaco.
kehm relies on two cases to support its view that it was in a franchise relationship with texaco in.see barnes gulf oil,cir wisser texaco.in barnes,the plaintiff entered into a series of franchise agreements with gulf oil corporation gulf between and.at.barnes asserted that gulf terminated the franchise relationship in violation of the pmpa by assigning its interest in the franchise to an unrelated entity,anderson oil.id.at.barnes alleged that by assigning the contract,the cost of gasoline went up over a month,because anderson marked up gulf oil.id.at.the fourth circuit found that even if an assignment is legal under state law,it is not permissible under the pmpa if the franchisee can no longer obtain gasoline at the stipulated franchise price.id.at.
the court held that a franchisor can not circumvent the protections of the pmpa by the simple expedient of assigning the frachisor obligation to an assignee who increases the frachisee burden.id.
barnes can be distinguished from the instant case.kehm was not negatively affected when star assigned the final contract to motiva in it was not until,when motiva wrote a letter to kehm indicating that in it would no longer have the right to license texaco oil,that it became clear that the assignment would have any affect on kehm.thus,there is n
