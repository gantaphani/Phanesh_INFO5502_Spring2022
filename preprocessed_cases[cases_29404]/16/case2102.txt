plaintiff lauren pavlovich invested a small fortune in rx remedy,rx remedy,a health care company,with a dubious financial record.a and a dollars in losses later,pavlovich now is trying to blame defendant national city bank the bank for following her investment instructions and those of her unscrupulous investment advisor,cashel management company cashel.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the bank as to all claims and denied pavlovich motion for partial summary judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
in,the mooney family sold its business,mooney chemical.plaintiff lauren mooney pavlovich received approximately million after taxes from selling her share.her brother,bob mooney,advised pavlovich,as well as other family members,to invest the proceeds under the direction of cashel,an investment company led by bob mooney childhood friend tom durkin.that same year,pavlovich and cashel executed an investment management contract cashel contract giving cashel complete discretion with respect to the investments of your funds and the execution of purchase sale orders through one or more registered representatives as cashel deems appropriate.
since the cashel contract precluded cashel from having custody of her funds,pavlovich simultaneously signed a custody agreement with the bank that generally required the bank to follow her written instructions regarding investment of the funds entrusted to the bank.also in,a trading letter apparently executed by her granted cashel sole trading authority over her fixed income account and directed the bank to accept all trades from cashel unless notified to the contrary 
pursuant to these three documents,in,cashel began directing the bank to disburse some of her funds in rx remedy.this company sold health care information from its large database,published a magazine,and,starting in,provided personalized consumer health news on the internet.pavlovich initial disbursement purchased stock in rx remedy.as the millennium approached,rx remedy became increasingly starved for cash.the company net losses compounded each year,and its owners equity decreased over in five years to a whopping million by the spring of.cashel heeded rx remedy calls for cash by,between until well into,investing the money of pavlovich and other clients each month in rx remedy promissory notes bearing interest with warrants to buy rx remedy stock as she later testified,pavlovich understood that this was a risky strategy but it was one with the potential for a big payoff by the summer of,the company management propagated the prospect of an initial public offering ipo to capitalize on the booming demand for internet ipos.that same summer pavlovich and her husband agreed with tom durkin to increase her investments in rx remedy to generate more income.
to prop up rx remedy and conceal the true state of pavlovich investment funds,cashel devised a scheme of rollover transactions that eventually depleted her account 
typically,at the beginning of each month,cashel requested money to be wired from the account to rx remedy account then on the last day of the month,a cashel representative would hand deliver to ncb a check in the amount of the earlier wire transfer plus interest for deposit into the account.this pattern of transactions would begin again on the first day of the next month.the net effect of these repeated transactions was that even before the funds represented by the checks had been deposited into the account,those same funds had already been wired back to rx remedy.
pavlovich city bank,d.the bank provided pavlovich with monthly statements depicting these transactions.in january of,the bank instituted a five day rule prohibiting the bank from approving any wire transfers from cashel which were dependent on funds that had been deposited by check less than five days earlier.id.at.that same month,pavlovich husband called the bank to complain about these transactions,but no written correspondence terminated cashel management authority until late.by then,pavlovich had lost roughly a dollars once rx remedy filed for bankruptcy.
on april,pavlovich sued the bank in state court in ohio,alleging various claims under state and federal law.the bank timely removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.she subsequently amended her complaint to assert diversity jurisdiction.approximately a year after that amendment,she again amended her complaint to withdraw those counts presenting federal questions.pavlovich now appeals the district court grant of the bank motion for summary judgment on all claims,and denial of pavlovich motion for partial summary judgment on counts i and iii.
jurisdiction 
the district court had diversity jurisdiction over this case pursuant to a because,when the suit was initiated,pavlovich was domiciled in florida and the bank was a citizen of ohio see grupo dataflux atlas global group,d to our knowledge,the court has never approved a deviation from the rule articulated by chief justice marshall in that w here there is no change of party,a jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition,as it was at the commencement of the suit.quoting conolly taylor,pet.emphasis in original.this court has jurisdiction under since the district court order at issue here was a final decision.

breach of contract count i 
pavlovich argues that the bank breached the custody agreement by following cashel purportedly unauthorized instructions to direct money to rx remedy.this claim is without merit because the bank disbursements pursuant to cashel written directives were authorized by relevant agreements and,in any event,pavlovich ratified the bank activities.
under ohio law,contract interpretation is a matter of law when a contract terms are clear and unambiguous.see long beach ass n,jones,ohio.to establish a breach of contract,a plaintiff must show that a contract existed,the plaintiff performed,the defendant breached,and the plaintiff suffered damages.wauseon plaza.wauseon hardware,ohio app d,ohio app.dist.since the other elements are undisputed,the only issue here is whether the bank breached the custody agreement.
the custody agreement required the bank to be responsible for the safekeeping of pavlovich investment assets entrusted to the bank.paragraph nine of the custody agreement further provided 
the custodian may safely rely and act upon any written direction delivered to it as provided herein,if purported to have been signed by me or by any one or more persons specifically authorized in writing by me and reasonably believed by the custodian to be genuine.the custodian may rely upon the continuance of any such authorization until notified in writing to the contrary 
in paragraph five,the custody agreement also limited the bank obligations with respect to investment recommendations 
the custodian shall have no duty to and shall not review or make investment recommendations with respect to any property held hereunder.the custodian shall sell,exchange,invest,and otherwise deal with the property only as i may direct in writing.
as noted above,the concurrently executed trading letter gave cashel sole trading authority over her fixed income account and required the bank to accept all trades from cashel unless notified to the contrary 
the now disputed transactions involving rx remedy fell wholly within the framework of the custody agreement and the trading letter and persisted for several years without written objection.the trading letter provided written authorization,as required by the custody agreement,for cashel to direct the investment of pavlovich funds.cashel exercised that authority by directing investments in rx remedy.the bank had no reason to doubt the genuineness of cashel authorization after all,she had granted cashel in the cashel contract complete discretion to invest her money.see yochim first of am,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,holding that,even where the plaintiffs alleged obvious,the custodian bank was authorized to act on instructions of a third party it believed were genuinely made on behalf of clients.the bank did not violate the custody agreement by weighing in on her risky investment strategies,but,instead and unfortunately for her,followed cashel written directions to a tee.see abbott chem.trust,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,upholding a custodian agreement which required the bank to determine whether a particular investment was administratively feasible,but not whether it was fraudulent.moreover,the bank delay in instituting the five day rule was not a breach of the contract because the rule was not contractually required.she received monthly statements depicting these transactions but did not terminate cashel authority until late.when she did so,the bank honored that written direction.
pavlovich primary argument to the contrary is that the trading letter limited cashel authority to executing trades as opposed to simply transferring money without a stated purpose.this argument borders on the frivolous because,at least until the commencement of litigation,it was undisputed that the challenged disbursements purchased promissory notes with interest and warrants to buy rx remedy stock.pavlovich and her husband agreed with this characterization in their deposition testimonies.in a letter to pavlovich husband and other investors,bob mooney,the apparent brains behind the family investments in rx remedy,described the investments as loans paying interest and about warrants per per year.moreover,pavlovich reported over in interest income from rx remedy on her tax returns.thus,since her money was exchanged for notes and investments of dubious value trades occurred.
even if the transactions were somehow outside the scope of the custody agreement and trading letter,pavlovich ratified the bank disbursements pursuant to cashel directives,in the words of the district court,by accepting its actions and their consequences over the course of several years.pavlovich city bank,d.ratification may be implied when there is actual knowledge of an agreement,acceptance of its benefits and a failure to repudiate within a reasonable time.young int l of locomotive eng rs,ohio app d,ohio app.dist see also campbell hospitality motor inns,ohio,per curiam.pavlovich had actual knowledge of the bank disbursements pursuant to cashel investment decisions over her funds,as manifested by her deposition testimony and receipt of monthly statements for multiple years depicting the challenged transactions.she accepted the benefits of this investment activity by accepting the interest the notes paid and reporting the interest as income on tax returns.she further failed to repudiate cashel authority until roughly eight years after that authority was granted.this case resembles others holding that a failure timely to object to transactions depicted in bank statements generally amounts to ratification.see white castle huntington bank,columbus,ohio first bank of philadelphia farrell,cir juerling sons,first bank of richmond,indiana.dist.pavlovich argues to the contrary based on cashel fraud in concealing the true nature of the transactions and on ohio law ban on ratifying illegal conduct.these arguments focus on cashel actions,not those of the bank,and are unavailing because nothing the bank did was fraudulent or otherwise unlawful.
pavlovich further argues that she did not ratify transactions occurring after a phone call from her husband to the bank in january of.in that conversation,pavlovich recalled telling a bank representative that these transfers are not supposed to happen.even assuming that this instruction contained sufficient content to defeat ratification,the custody agreement prevented the bank from heeding this direction because pavlovich was not a party to the custody agreement and because the communication was not in writing as required by the custody agreement.
breach of fiduciary duties count ii 
pavlovich claims that the bank breached a variety of fiduciary duties including the duty of good faith and the duty to disclose material facts.this claim also fails because the bank upheld its narrow and primary fiduciary duty not to make unauthorized distributions and because no applicable fiduciary duty imposed any obligation separate from,and in addition to,that imposed on the bank by the relevant agreements.
an agency relationship between the bank and pavlovich was created through execution of the custody agreement.under ohio law,there are four elements of an agency relationship agency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control,and consent by the other so to act.berge columbus cmty.cable access,ohio app d,ohio app.dist quoting restatement second of agency.by executing the custody agreement and trading letter,pavlovich manifested consent to the bank custody of her funds and its compliance with cashel investment directives.the bank acted on her behalf,and consented to do so,in making distributions according to the custody agreement and trading letter.the bank was subject to her control because she had the sole power to authorize transactions or to delegate that power and could have terminated the relationship at any time.
an agency relationship gives rise to those fiduciary duties within the scope of the agency.see miles perpetual savs.loan,ohio,per curiam.the key issue here,therefore,is determining the scope of the agency and whether the accompanying fiduciary duties differ from the bank contractual obligations.pavlovich account was administrative and nondiscretionary in that the bank would not distribute funds absent written direction from her or an authorized third party.see merrill lynch pierce fenner smith,cheng,with respect to a account,the customer must give prior approval for all transactions.in such nondiscretionary situations,a bank owes primarily the very narrow fiduciary duty not to make unauthorized distributions.see abbott chem.trust,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,t o the extent the bank owed a fiduciary duty to plaintiffs,that duty was limited to executing the transactions requested by plaintiffs.tapia chase manhattan bank,cir w here the investor controls a nondiscretionary account and retains the ability to make investment decisions,the scope of any duties owed by the broker will generally be confined to executing the investor order.hill bache halsey stuart shields,cir the fiduciary duty owed by a broker operating a nondiscretionary trading account is very not to make unauthorized trades.in the instant case,the bank did not violate its primary fiduciary duty not to make unauthorized distributions because all of its disbursements were directed by cashel pursuant to pavlovich written authorization.
in addition,having concluded that no breach of contract occurred,we can not now find a breach of a fiduciary duty where pavlovich has identified no applicable fiduciary duty separate from,and in addition to,that imposed on the bank by the custody agreement and trading letter.it is well established in ohio that t he duties of an agent to his principal are dependent upon the agreement between them.orvets city bank,northeast,ohio app d,ohio app.dist see also gem sav.ass sterling gold,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio,t he fact that this contract created an agency relationship between the parties did not,without more,impose a fiduciary duty upon the agent which was separate from,and in addition to,that imposed on it by the contract.restatement second of agency the existence and extent of the duties of the agent to the principal are determined by the terms of the agreement between the parties.the bank honored its contractual obligations and was bound to no fiduciary duty outside the terms of the relevant agreements.
