this appeal involves a labor dispute between major league baseball and its umpires,the majority of whom resigned in protest over what they viewed as objectionable policies which the commissioner of baseball sought to implement during the season.although all of the resigning umpires eventually attempted to rescind their letters of resignation,the events that followed left a substantial number of them unemployed.the unemployed umpires subsequently filed grievances that were submitted to an arbitrator.
the district court confirmed the arbitrator determination that the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement cba,and further confirmed the arbitrator disposition of the grievances of nineteen of the umpires.in their appeals,both sides challenge the confirmation of the portions of the award unfavorable to them.in addition,the leagues contend that the dispute was not arbitrable in the first instance.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
the major league umpires association mlua or association represents umpires employed by both the american league of professional baseball clubs and the national league of professional baseball clubs.the american and national leagues together comprise what is commonly referred to as major league baseball mlb.each league has its own president,operates as a separate entity,and employs its own umpires.generally speaking,the commissioner of baseball broadly oversees the operation of the leagues and participates in decisions affecting the game as a whole.however,control over the employment and discipline of umpires has historically rested with the respective league presidents.
the dispute at issue arose during the baseball season over what the mlua perceived as an attempt by the commissioner of baseball,allan bud selig,to strip the league presidents of supervisory power over umpires and to centralize that power in the commissioner office.specifically,the mlua believed that commissioner selig was attempting to implement various new policies that violated the cba between the mlua and the leagues 
to resolve its disputes with the leagues,the mlua attempted to force the leagues to negotiate with it over the proposed new policies by organizing a mass resignation of its members.the mlua apparently believed that,by electing to pursue a mass resignation strategy as opposed to a strike or other form of work stoppage,it could avoid violating the clause contained in the cba and force the leagues to bargain because the voluntary resignation of its members would trigger the leagues obligation to pay the resigning umpires approximately million in severance compensation.of the mlua members agreed to participate in the mass resignation from the american league and from the national league.on july,each of the resigning umpires sent a letter to his respective league president stating that he resigned his position effective september.umpires with more than ten years on the job also demanded severance pay due under the cba as a result of voluntary termination in addition,each of the resigning umpires executed a personal services agreement with the newly created professional umpire services.these agreements stated,in relevant part,that the umpire would render services exclusively for the corporation for the person with whom the corporation agrees to provide umpire services.
articles of incorporation were filed for professional umpire services on july,but the company never countersigned the personal services agreements or conducted any business.it appears the mlua planned to use the company as a means of providing the leagues with umpiring services in the event that the labor dispute was not resolved by the time the resignations took effect on september.
on july,commissioner selig met with american league president gene budig and national league president leonard coleman in milwaukee,wisconsin,in an effort to determine how best to respond to the resignations.after some discussion,the leagues decided not to negotiate with the mlua.
there are conflicting versions of what transpired at this meeting.the mlua contends that there was no immediate threat to the continuing operation of mlb,as the resignations did not become effective until several weeks after the meeting.it further argues that commissioner selig essentially forced the league presidents to begin hiring replacement umpires in an effort to manufacture a claim of detrimental reliance and to break the union.the leagues counter that they viewed the mass resignation strategy as a violation of the cba clause,and therefore began hiring replacement umpires to ensure the continued operation of mlb during the upcoming league playoffs and world series.
by the end of the day on july,the leagues had hired a total of twenty replacement umpires eight in the national league and twelve in the american league as a result,it soon became clear to mlua members that the mass resignation strategy was a failure.many began to rescind their letters of resignation.despite the capitulation of some of its members,however,the mlua continued to exert pressure on the leagues.on july,it filed a declaratory judgment action in the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking to establish the resigning umpires rights to termination pay and benefits.
through a combination of new hires and resignation rescissions,the american league returned to full staff by july.in contrast,relatively few national league umpires had rescinded their resignations as of that date,and national league president coleman hired five more replacement umpires.on july,the remaining national league and six american league umpires attempted to rescind their resignations en masse.however,because of the new hires and previous resignation rescissions,only nineteen national league positions remained open.as stated above,all of the american league positions had been filled by that date 
because he had no positions left to fill,american league president budig simply refused to allow any of the final six american league umpires to rescind their resignations national league president coleman faced a more difficult situation,as he was forced to determine which of the remaining national league umpires would be permitted to rescind their resignations.in order to make this determination,he invoked article viii a of the cba,which provides in its second paragraph that a ll umpires shall be selected or retained in the discretion of the league presidents on the basis of merit and the skill of the umpire to perform to major league standards.applying this provision at least in part,coleman selected nineteen umpires from the and permitted those nineteen to rescind their letters of resignation.coleman then accepted the resignations of the remaining thirteen national league umpires.
by the end of this imbroglio,of the mlua members who participated in the mass resignation scheme,nearly of the association total membership,were unemployed nine from the american league and thirteen from the national league.all of these umpires filed grievances under the cba.
ii.procedural history 
the mlua filed its demand for arbitration of the grievances on august.on august,the mlua sought an injunction from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to prevent the leagues from dismissing the umpires whose resignations had been accepted and were due to take effect on september.the district court held a hearing on september.following this hearing,the parties executed a memorandum of understanding stating that the mlua would withdraw its complaint and that the parties would submit the matter to an arbitrator.the memorandum of understanding also permitted either side to raise in such arbitration whatever procedural and substantive arbitrability arguments the parties may have.
in november,the leagues,contending that the dispute at issue did not fall within the scope of the cba arbitration provision,moved to dismiss the grievances.the arbitrator denied this motion on november.both sides were represented by counsel during the arbitration proceedings,which included seventeen days of testimony over the course of approximately one year.
following completion of the proceedings,the arbitrator issued his opinion and award on may.the arbitrator sustained the grievances and ordered the reinstatement of two american league umpires coble and kosc,and seven national league umpires darling,hohn,tata,pulli,poncino,west,and vanover with full back pay and benefits.it denied the grievances of all of the remaining american and national league umpires.both sides subsequently filed actions in the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking to vacate the portions of the award unfavorable to them.in addition,the leagues challenged the arbitrator denial of their motion to dismiss the dispute as.
the district court held that the leagues had properly preserved their objection to arbitrability.it nevertheless confirmed the arbitrator conclusion that the dispute was arbitrable.as for the merits of the parties arguments,the district court confirmed the arbitrator conclusion that the leagues were entitled to hire replacement umpires in reliance on the letters of resignation submitted by the grievants,as well as confirming his determination that american league president budig was not required to accept the six resignation rescissions submitted on july in view of the fact that the american league was fully staffed by that date.
the district court further confirmed the arbitrator application of the article viii merit and skill criteria to the determinations made with respect to all but three of the national league umpires,and his decision,following this application,to require the national league to reinstate seven umpires darling,hohn,tata,pulli,poncino,west,and vanover who satisfied this criteria despite the fact that all national league positions had been filled.finally,the district court confirmed the arbitrator conclusion that three additional national league umpires davidson,gregg,and hallion need not be reinstated because they failed to satisfy the article viii merit and skill criteria on appeal,both sides contend that the district court erred in confirming the portions of the award unfavorable to them.additionally,the leagues assert that the dispute at issue does not fall within the scope of the cba arbitration provision so that it was not arbitrable in the first instance.

iv.discussion 
scope of judicial review of arbitration awards 
we begin our analysis by examining the general legal principles governing federal courts review of arbitration awards.the first step in any such review involves an examination of the sources of the arbitrator authority.see matteson ryder system,cir under the federal arbitration act,a district court may vacate an arbitration award if,inter alia,the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.quoting a.simply stated,an arbitrator may not venture beyond the bounds of his or her authority,which is defined not only by the terms of the cba,but also by the scope of the issues submitted by the parties.id.thus,i t is the responsibility of the arbitrator in the first instance to interpret the scope of the parties submission,but it is within the courts province to review an arbitrator interpretation.id.at.
in conducting this review,the deference that is accorded to an arbitrator interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement should also be accorded to an arbitrator interpretation of the issue submitted.id.quoting mobil oil independent oil workers union,cir.this is so because a more searching judicial review of submissions would undermine the congressional policy of promoting speedy,efficient,and inexpensive resolution of labor grievances interpretation of a submission must often occur in the context of the collective bargaining agreement itself,thereby resulting in an inconsistency if the arbitrator interpretation of the cba receives deference but his or her determination of the scope of the submission does not and requiring courts to engage in a close examination of the submissions to arbitrators would put a considerable strain on judicial resources.id.citing mobil oil,at.
our role in reviewing the outcome of the arbitration proceedings is not to correct factual or legal errors made by an arbitrator.
courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties agreement when an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract,and no dishonesty is alleged,the arbitrator improvident,even silly,factfinding does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award.

with this standard in mind,we turn now to the specific claims at issue here.
arbitrability 
in addressing the threshold question of arbitrability,we first must determine whether the cba empowers the arbitrator to settle questions of substantive arbitrability,whether a particular dispute is subject to the parties contractual arbitration provision s.bell,communications workers of,cir.as we have previously held,a bsent a clear expression to the contrary in the parties contract,substantive arbitrability determinations are to be made by a court and not an arbitrator.id.at.therefore,contract language submitting the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator must be clear and unmistakable.painewebber hofmann,cir.
here,however,the leagues conceded before the district court that the issue of arbitrability was properly submitted to the arbitrator we do not therefore have to decide whether it was proper for the arbitrator to determine arbitrability,merely whether he ignored the plain language of the cba in his determination of arbitrability.see national ass of letter carriers,at.in doing so,we are obliged to give that decision the same deference due an arbitrator decision on the merits.united indus.workers,at.thus,the arbitrator determination of arbitrability must be affirmed as long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.pennsylvania power local union of the int l of workers,cir.as noted above,this requires only that the arbitrator interpretation of the cba be rationally derived from the agreement,viewed in light of its language,its context,and any other indicia of the parties intention.united transportation union local,at citations and internal quotations omitted.
in presenting the issue to the arbitrator in their motion to dismiss,the leagues contended that the dispute was not arbitrable because article viii of the cba gives the league presidents the authority,following a hearing,to issue a final and binding decision regarding the termination of an umpire the mlua on the other hand maintained that the dispute fell within the broad scope of the general arbitration provision contained in article xv of the cba 
following his review of the text of articles viii and xv,the arbitrator denied the leagues motion to dismiss,ruling instead that,although the first paragraph of article viii a vested substantial authority in the league presidents regarding the termination of umpires,the second paragraph placed two specific limitations on that authority.first,this substantial authority was limited to issues concerning the merit and skill of the umpire to perform to major league standards,and,second,it had to be exercised without discrimination or recrimination.in view of this determination,the arbitrator concluded that,to the extent that the presidents terminated or accepted the resignations of the umpire grievants,as the case may be,the issue of whether this decision was an abuse of discretion or was performed in a discriminatory or recriminatory manner,is subject to arbitration.rulings concerning employer motion to dismiss et.rulings at.in confirming the arbitrator decision,the district court held that,because the parties contracted to arbitrate disputes concerning any claimed violation of the agreement,and because the current dispute concerning the selection or retention of umpires is such a claimed violation,the arbitrator properly exercised jurisdiction.major league umpires ass american league of professional baseball clubs,slip op.at.
on appeal,the leagues contend that the issue sought to be arbitrated by the mlua was whether the leagues violated the cba by terminating the umpires in question.they further assert that the cba does not provide for arbitration of this issue,and that it therefore is not arbitrable.instead,they argue that,in order to be arbitrable,a dispute must concern a claimed violation of the provisions of th e cba.quoting article xv of the cba.the leagues urged that articles viii and xv contain two mutually exclusive dispute resolution mechanisms because the mlua relied primarily upon article viii and the dispute resolution provision of article viii makes no mention of arbitration or of article xv,the arbitrator should have concluded that there was no agreement to arbitrate the dispute at issue here.
we have reviewed the applicable provisions of the cba in light of the arguments of the parties and see no basis for vacating the arbitrator finding of arbitrability.although we may question the clarity of the arbitrator ruling with respect to this issue,we do not conclude from the record before us that the arbitrator considered the issue before him to be a simple article viii termination of the umpires.rather,in rejecting the leagues motion to dismiss,the arbitrator found the arbitrable issue to be one involving a determination of relative merit and skill as well as the possible abuse of discretion or exercise of discriminatory or recriminatory animus in the respective league presidents decisions regarding the terminat ion or accept ance of the resignations of the umpire grievants.rulings at.the reference by the arbitrator to merit and skill and to discriminatory or recriminatory animus brings us down to the second paragraph of section a of article viii.it is,however,the first paragraph of the section a that speaks of final and binding review by the league president of umpire discharges.
from the foregoing,we conclude that the arbitrator initial finding of arbitrability was premised on alleged violations of the cba,involving selection of umpire candidates which selection did not involve merit and skill,and further premised on the arbitrator determination that he must consider whether there had been discriminatory or recriminatory animus.he determined that such types of violations did not fall under the limited review provision of the first paragraph of article viii by default,then they would fall within the broad scope of the general dispute resolution mechanism contained in article xv.thus,the arbitrator finding of arbitrability was not conditioned upon a finding that the reasons for the terminations required explanation prior to the exercise of the final and binding review of the league presidents,as provided for in the first paragraph of article viii a.the review required from the nature of the alleged violations would encompass more than the explanation of the reasons for discharge set out there and would therefore expand beyond the bounds of the final and binding authority of the league presidents provided for in that first paragraph.in sum,we conclude that the arbitrator did not ignore the plain language of the cba,see national ass of letter carriers,at,or demonstrate manifest disregard for the cba,see newark morning ledger,at,when he determined that violations of the provisions of the second paragraph of article viii a were covered by the arbitrability provisions of article xv rather than by the specific review of discharges provided for in the preceding first paragraph of article viii 
this conclusion is reinforced by the consideration of the arbitrability issue in the arbitrator award.the arbitrator quoted article xv,the cba general dispute resolution provision,for the proposition that t he dispute resolution language of the agreement gives me the jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning claimed violations of the provisions of this agreement,and then noted that,w hile there may be conflicting views concerning the propriety of the actions taken by both sides in this case,the sole question in this case concerns whether the actions taken were appropriate under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.opinion and award at.in this reference to the terms of the cba,the conclusion is evident that the arbitrator is considering not just the league presidents discharge review authority of the first paragraph of article viii a but also the no discrimination or recrimination language of the second paragraph.from this it follows that the arbitrator rationally determined that his consideration of whether there had been a violation of the cba extended beyond a review of the reasons for discharge of an umpire by the league president as set out in the first paragraph of article viii 
we find further reinforcement of this conclusion in the fact that the arbitrator,in his award,determined that the grievant umpires had resigned their positions,rather than having been terminated.for this reason,the arbitrator concluded that the limitations for terminated umpires found in article viii a did not apply.we presume that in referring to the limitations for terminated umpires of article viii a and their inapplicability to the case before him,the arbitrator had in mind article viii a final and binding review of umpire discharges by league presidents,found in the first paragraph.
as noted above,an arbitrator finding of arbitrability draws its essence from the cba if it can be rationally derived from the agreement,viewed in light of its language,its context,and any other indicia of the parties intention.united transportation union local,at internal quotations omitted.here,the arbitrator denial of the leagues motion to dismiss was based on a determination that the question whether there had been an abuse of discretion and discrimination and retaliation was not constrained by the limitations of the first paragraph of article viii a.we conclude that such a determination can rationally be derived from the cba.
whether,if faced with the initial determination,we would have come to the same decision is immaterial.there is no basis from which to conclude that the arbitrator finding of arbitrability fails to draw its essence from the cba,as it may logically be derived from the text of that agreement.see matteson,at.thus,we will affirm the district court confirmation of the award with respect to arbitrability.
detrimental reliance 
turning then to the merits of the underlying dispute,we begin with the arbitrator conclusion that the actions of the umpires amounted to actual resignations,as opposed to a mere threat or notification of future resignations,so that the leagues acted properly in hiring replacements.the mlua challenges this determination,contending that this ruling amounted to manifest disregard of the law,was not supported by the record,and failed to draw its essence from the cba.the mlua urges that,because no umpire actually relinquished his position prior to september,no umpire can be said to have resigned.thus,because the umpires did not resign,the leagues refusal to accept the umpires rescissions of their resignations amounted to a discharge in violation of the cba.the mlua further claims that there is no evidence in the record to support the leagues claims of detrimental reliance.
in response,the leagues justify their decision to begin hiring replacement umpires for the following reasons the inclusion of the phrase i hereby resign my employment in each of the resignation letters at issue the demand for voluntary termination pay by each umpire with more than ten years service mlua general counsel richard phillips statements to the media,which unequivocally indicated that the mlua members had resigned and would not rescind their resignations the execution by each resigning umpire of an employment contract with professional umpire services,and the filing by the mlua of an action in the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking to establish the leagues obligation to make the severance payments required by the cba in the event of voluntary termination.the leagues assert that on this record the arbitrator properly determined that the leagues were justified in hiring replacement umpires.
we have reviewed the record below and find no basis for disturbing the award with respect to this issue.under the standards of review of arbitration decisions set out above in part iv a,the arbitrator conclusion that the umpires resigned and that the leagues were justified in hiring replacement umpires is well supported by the facts of record and for that reason there is no basis for reversing it.see tanoma mining,at.simply put,the arbitrator considered the mlua arguments and,based on the facts and his interpretation of the cba and applicable law,found that the letters constituted resignations rather than notices of intent to resign.he therefore concluded that the leagues acted appropriately by hiring replacements in reliance upon these representations.
the district court found that this conclusion was not a manifest error of law.slip op.at.we agree.as noted above,because the parties have bargained for the arbitrator decision,it is the arbitrator view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept.tanoma mining,at internal quotation omitted.thus,we will affirm the district court confirmation of the award with respect to this issue.
d.the arbitrator application of article viii merit and skill criteria 
the mlua next challenges the arbitrator determination concerning the standards that national league president coleman was required to apply in making his staffing decisions following the rescission of the remaining resignations on july.specifically,in accordance with the mlua position that the letters constituted notices of intent to resign rather than actual resignations,the mlua contends that the combination of new hires and resignation rescissions resulted in a situation in which the national league was overstaffed and national league president coleman,in determining whom to retain,should have compared the merit and skill of the rescinding umpires not only as between those umpires but also as to the merit and skill of the new hires and that of those umpires who had never resigned.the mlua urges that the arbitrator countenance of coleman failure to do so results in a decision which fails to draw its essence from the cba.
in support of this argument,the mlua analogizes the present situation to the one that existed in when its members refused to execute their individual employment contracts at the beginning of the baseball season despite the existence of a clause.there,the striking umpires were permitted to return to work once the situation was resolved.this resulted in overstaffing,as replacement umpires had been hired in the meantime.the mlua claims that the current merit and skill language was inserted into the cba as a result of the incident for the express purpose of preventing the leagues from trimming the umpire ranks by taking action against those who participate in work stoppages.
in light of the history of the merit and skill provision,and because national league president coleman admitted during his testimony before the arbitrator that he never applied the merit and skill criteria to either those umpires who never resigned or those newly hired,the mlua argues that his actions violated the plain language of the cba.further,because american league president budig never applied the merit and skill criteria in the first instance,the association asserts that he too violated the cba and that the award,which the mlua contends effectively allows each league to employ a different process,fails to draw its essence from the cba.
we again reject the mlua arguments.as a preliminary matter,in view of the unequivocal clause contained in the cba,we find troubling the assertion that the merit and skill criteria was inserted in order to protect striking umpires.indeed,if we were to read article xix of the cba as prohibiting strikes while article viii nevertheless protects striking umpires,we would have a very tortured interpretation of the contract.
moreover,even if there were some arguable merit to the mlua attempt to analogize this situation to the job action taken by its members in,the arbitrator rejected its argument with respect to this issue.see opinion and award at.instead,he found that,unlike the situation that existed in,the work stoppage at issue here involved the actual severing of the employment relationship through resignation the hiring of permanent replacements and no decision by the league presidents to increase the size of their respective umpire staffs.id.this conclusion does not constitute a manifest disregard for either the cba or the applicable law.see newark morning ledger,at.thus,we see no basis for disturbing the district court confirmation of this aspect of the award.
e.the arbitrator resolution of the claims of individual umpires 
as discussed above,by the time the remaining national league umpires attempted to rescind their resignations on july,national league president coleman,through new hires and prior resignation rescissions,had already filled nineteen of the vacant positions.because of the limited vacancies,he had to accept the resignations of thirteen of the national league umpires.he chose to accept the resignations of the following umpires darling,hohn,poncino,pulli,west,tata,vanover,davidson,gregg,hallion,nauert,dreckman,and holbrook,all of whom filed grievances.in his award,the arbitrator sustained some of the grievances and denied others.he ordered the reinstatement of national league umpires darling,hohn,poncino,pulli,tata,west,and vanover the darling group,but denied the grievances and upheld coleman acceptance of the resignations of umpires davidson,gregg,and hallion,the davidson group,as well as umpires nauert,dreckman,and holbrook the nauert group.the leagues now contend that the district court erred in confirming the arbitrator construction and application of article viii in making these determinations.
because coleman elected not to exercise his discretion to increase the size of the national league staff,he was forced to find a method to determine which nineteen umpires would be permitted to rescind their resignations and which thirteen would have their resignations accepted.in so doing,he sought input from the mlua counsel,who simply insisted that all decisions be made on the basis of seniority,which would have guaranteed that all resigning mlua members would be rehired and the new replacement umpires released.coleman rejected this suggestion.
without any other guidance for making such determinations,coleman decided to use the merit and skill criteria from article viii a of the cba to select which resignation rescissions to accept 
as stated above,in applying this merit and skill provision to the national league umpires who attempted to rescind their resignations on july,coleman accepted only nineteen rescissions.the thirteen national league umpires not permitted to rescind fell into either the darling,davidson,or nauert groups.
with respect to the darling and nauert groups,coleman refused to allow them to rescind their resignations because of the limited number of unfilled positions.however,in refusing to allow the davidson group to rescind their resignations,coleman articulated various reasons why he believed each member of the group lacked the merit and skill necessary to perform to major league standards.
after reviewing coleman decisions to refuse reinstatement,the arbitrator upheld him on the davidson and nauert groups but reversed coleman refusal to rescind the darling group resignations.the primary basis for the ruling on the darling group was the arbitrator belief that coleman decision to reject their rescissions was based solely on the number of available positions,not on merit or skill,and that this ran afoul of the terms of article viii.although the arbitrator concluded that the league president had substantial discretion in employment decisions regarding the tenure of umpires,he found that article viii limited this discretion by requiring the league president decision to be based on the merit and skill to perform to major league standards.the arbitrator therefore concluded that the discretion exercised by the league presidents is not limitless,and that such decisions must be one s that can be reasonably articulated and related to issues of merit and skill and not arbitrary or capricious.opinion and award at.the arbitrator therefore concluded 
in reviewing these explanations in light of the broad discretion given to league presidents,it is this arbitrator view that coleman must articulate an explanation that has some relationship to the merit and skill of that umpire as well as the other factors that he considered.if coleman was unable to articulate a basis,then i must conclude that he abused his discretion.the mere statement that he had to find the numbers required to fill the positions is an arbitrary consideration and must be overruled.
id.footnote omitted.
however,the arbitrator upheld coleman decision to refuse to allow the davidson group to rescind because coleman articulated a merit or basis for the refusal.finally,the arbitrator concluded that the members of the nauert group did not have more than five years experience and thus were not entitled to the limited protections offered by article viii.opinion and award at.
the leagues challenge the arbitrator interpretation and application of article viii.specifically,the leagues contend that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and that the award failed to draw its essence from the cba in two respects.first,they read the award as concluding that article viii is applicable only in situations involving the selection or retention of umpires.they also read the award as holding that the umpires at issue in this case voluntarily resigned and were not entitled to the protections afforded by article viii.the leagues therefore contend that the arbitrator application of the article viii merit and skill criteria results in a logical inconsistency.
second,the leagues assert that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applied by the arbitrator to coleman merit and skill determinations exceeded his authority and failed to draw its essence from the cba.simply stated,they allege the arbitrator impermissibly created his own standard of review for merit and skill determinations out of whole cloth.in response,the mlua contends that a reviewing court should look only to the arbitrator award,and not his reasoning,in determining whether it draws its essence from the cba.
in reviewing this portion of the award,the district court noted its concern over the arbitrator determination with respect to this issue.the court nevertheless,citing steelworkers enterprise wheel car,d,and,local,cir,confirmed this portion of the award because the court believed binding precedent prevented it from vacating an award simply because of the existence of ambiguity in the arbitrator reasoning.although the court noted the confusing nature of the award,it ultimately concluded that the arbitrator did interpret the agreement and did manifest fidelity to his proper role as to the national league umpires to whom he applied the merit and skill standard of article viii slip op.at.the district court further noted that,because it believed the arbitrator had reached the proper conclusion,the reasoning which provided the basis for its conclusion was irrelevant.
we are in accord with the district court conclusion that it may not vacate an award based solely on an ambiguity in an arbitrator opinion.see roadway package system,kayser,cir.however,we agree with the leagues assertion that the district court erred in stating that the reasoning of the arbitrator is entirely irrelevant.see id.holding that a court may conclude that an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority when it is obvious from the written opinion newark morning ledger,at holding that a court is not required to disregard what an arbitrator says in order to justify what the arbitrator does.nevertheless,we do not find this error to be essential to the court resolution of this matter.we therefore reject the leagues invitation to use it as a basis for disturbing the district court confirmation of this portion of the award.at bottom,the leagues primary contention is that the award is inconsistent.more specifically,they contend the arbitrator employed varying and questionable logic in first determining that article viii did not govern the dispute because the umpires had resigned as opposed to being terminated,but then nevertheless requiring national league president coleman to employ the article viii skill and merit criteria appropriately and consistently once he chose to invoke it.
the leagues argument is unpersuasive.regardless of whether another interpretation of the cba would make more sense,or whether we or the district court would reach a different result if reviewing this case de novo,the arbitrator reading is logical and clearly draws its essence from the cba.
simply stated,the arbitrator interpretation of the cba was as follows article viii creates minimal protections from termination for umpires with more than five years of service because the umpires at issue in this case resigned,none were entitled to the protections of article viii in the first instance regardless of the number of years of service even though article viii was not directly applicable in this case,national league president coleman invoked it in determining which nineteen of the final resignation rescissions to accept a decision that essentially involved the selection of individuals from among the pool of resigned umpires,thereby arguably making the application of article viii appropriate once article viii was inv
