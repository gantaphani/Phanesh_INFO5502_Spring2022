plaintiff alexander stratienko,who created a catheter device and shared his design for that device with defendant cordis corporation,brought this federal diversity suit against cordis for misappropriation of a trade secret,wrongful benefit,and breach of contract.the district court granted summary judgment to cordis,and stratienko appeals.he challenges the district court reliance on declarations of cordis employees,the district court determination that circumstantial evidence can never create a genuine issue of material fact in cases,and the district court determination that the tennessee tort of conversion does not extend to conversion of trade secrets.
the district court properly relied on declarations of cordis employees notwithstanding the employees.also,although tennessee law likely provides that stratienko was entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate that cordis used his catheter design by relying on circumstantial evidence,stratienko failed to proffer sufficient evidence of similarity between his trade secret and cordis catheter to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning use by cordis of stratienko secret.summary judgment was,therefore,appropriate on his claims for misappropriation,wrongful benefit,and breach of contract.stratienko other contentions on appeal are without merit,and we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
stratienko device is a modified catheter used for gaining medical access to blood vessels.cordis explained the conventional medical practice associated with catheters in the following manner,which is consistent with the description of conventional practice in stratienko patent 
an interventional cardiology procedure generally begins by inserting a hollow needle into the femoral artery,which is located close to the surface of the skin in the groin area.a wire called a guidewire is then inserted through the needle into the artery,and the needle is withdrawn.another device called a sheath is then inserted over the guidewire into the artery.a sheath is a inch hollow tube with a valve at the end which remains outside the body proximal end.the valve prevents excess blood loss.the sheath remains in place throughout the procedure.
next,a inch hollow tube called a guiding catheter is inserted through the sheath and into the artery.the guiding catheter has a soft,flexible tip at the end that is inserted into the patient distal end.the distal end positions the catheter into a specific blood vessel within the heart coronary artery.the guiding catheter also remains in place throughout the procedure.other medical devices such as angioplasty balloons and stents can be inserted through the guiding catheter and into the patient coronary artery to treat the blockage.
appellee br.at.
stratienko submitted a patent application for a sheath catheter.his design combines a sheath and a catheter with a preformed distal end.while the record is surprisingly unclear as to the benefits of the unified,it appears that it allows a smaller puncture hole while providing necessary support during the invasive procedure.the preformed distal end is soft and flexible,which allows more precise engagement of targeted segments.his design also has holes at the end of the catheter,allowing direct delivery of contrast fluid to a segment of the targeted vessel traditional delivery of contrast fluid must first displace blood to reach the intended segment.
on may,stratienko,a tennessee resident,sent a letter and nondisclosure agreement to cordis corporation.cordis is a florida corporation with its principal place of business in new jersey,and is a subsidiary of johnson johnson.in august,cordis associate manager of business development william scheessele proposed changes to the agreement and faxed them to stratienko.over a period of months,the parties negotiated the terms of the agreement.cordis deleted portions regarding remedies for breach and regarding return of the materials.the agreement specifically provided that stratienko information was a trade secret.the parties executed the agreement in november.on december,stratienko submitted his patent application and a description of his sheath catheter to scheessele.
cordis internal written policy states that reviews of submitted proposals will be conducted by members of new business development,new product strategy,legal,and to a lesser degree,senior members of r d.it is our goal to minimize exposing our innovative engineering talent pool to external ideas,to safeguard our interests to our own internal inventions.scheessele provided stratienko submitted material to cordis counsel paul coletti in.both scheessele and coletti declare that they discussed stratienko proposal,but they deny discussing the proposal with anyone else at cordis or johnson johnson.scheessele declares that he kept the proposal in his locked file cabinet at all times,but coletti can not remember whether he placed the documents in a locked cabinet or safe.on january,cordis advised stratienko that cordis was not interested in his proposal.coletti returned the related documents,at the latest,by and kept no copies.
on april,cordis submitted a combined sheath and guiding catheter,which it called the vista brite tip introducer guiding catheter,for fda approval.the fda approved it on april.cordis sales documents establish that cordis manufactured and shipped vista brite tip ig catheters as of may.
stratienko alleges that cordis has given varying reasons for its rejection of his proposal.according to stratienko,scheessele originally told him that cordis was not interested because stratienko proposal was not within cordis budget,and scheessele later told him that the company had no interest in his invention.scheessele stated at his deposition that the proposal did not meet cordis needs.stratienko further alleges that coletti told stratienko patent attorney that a patent,the hillstead patent disclosed a combination method similar to cordis vista brite tip ig catheter.stratienko also stated in his affidavit that,for the first time in august,cordis informed him that another patent,the fernandez patent disclosed the combination.cordis does not challenge that it gave stratienko several reasons for its disinterest.
stratienko filed suit in hamilton county circuit court on november,and cordis removed the case to the federal district court for the eastern district of tennessee in january.stratienko alleged that cordis had misappropriated,converted,and wrongfully benefitted from his ideas breached the nondisclosure agreement and committed theft of a trade secret under tennessee uniform trade secret act,ann.through west.
in march,cordis moved for summary judgment on all of stratienko claims.the primary pieces of evidence submitted were deposition testimony and declarations of both scheessele and coletti and micheline johnson and david hill expert reports submitted by stratienko.david hill was stratienko patent attorney.both experts stated that neither the hillstead nor the fernandez patents teach the design,and both determined that stratienko proposal shared all the salient features of the vista brite tip ig,except for the holes at the distal end.
in october,the district court granted cordis motion for summary judgment in full.the district court reasoned that,because this circuit requires direct evidence of use in cases and because stratienko offered only circumstantial evidence of use,stratienko was unable to demonstrate that cordis used his idea.without evidence that cordis used his secret,stratienko was unable to rebut the evidence of cordis employees,who denied discussing his ideas with anyone else.stratienko claims for misappropriation,breach of contract,and wrongful benefit all failed,therefore,as a matter of law.the court also determined that there was no violation of the uniform trade secret act because cordis alleged theft in april and may occurred before the july effective date of the tennessee statute.finally,the district court held that tennessee does not recognize a cause of action for conversion of trade secrets.
earlier,during march,stratienko had moved for leave to amend his complaint so that he could add a claim involving a patent that is irrelevant to his claims,and the district court had granted the motion in april.in february,stratienko moved for voluntary dismissal of this claim,but the court denied his request.in march,cordis moved for summary judgment,arguing that stratienko patent was not new because cordis had patented a combined in,over a year before stratienko filed his first patent application.this was the first time that cordis had produced any evidence of its patented webster guiding sheath.on the eve of the summary judgment hearing,stratienko moved for voluntary dismissal with prejudice of his claim.the district court granted the motion in october.
stratienko appeals the district court october grant of summary judgment in favor of cordis.he challenges the rejection of each of his original claims,except for the claim under tennessee uniform trade secrets act.we affirm because the district court properly considered the declarations of cordis employees in determining that cordis,as the moving party,satisfied its burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact existed stratienko did not respond with sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether cordis used his catheter design and tennessee cause of action for conversion does not extend to conversion of trade secrets.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see united states miami,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.this court must view the facts contained in the record and draw all inferences from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.this court can not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of any matter in dispute,anderson liberty lobby,d,because this court determines only whether the case contains sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the nonmoving party,id.at.if the moving party fulfills its burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists,the nonmoving party,to receive a trial,must present some significant probative evidence creating a factual issue.celotex catrett,d.because cordis met its burden and stratienko failed to meet his,summary judgment was proper.
cordis submitted declarations by coletti and scheessele,in which they deny sharing stratienko information with anyone else at cordis.although these declarations came from employees,cordis can rely on those denials to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists because stratienko has not impeached the declarants credibility.stratienko argues that the following language in reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure at ed,precludes the district court from considering scheessele and coletti declarations in deciding a motion for summary judgment and thus leaves cordis with no evidence denying use t he court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.stratienko misinterprets the import of this language to mean that courts may never consider affidavits of interested persons when the affidavits are submitted by a moving party.
this court has already considered this issue in almond abb indus,wl cir,per curiam,and held that courts can consider the testimony of a moving party interested witnesses.the court held that the interpretation of reeves advocated by stratienko leads to absurd consequences because defendants will often be able to respond only through the testimony of their employees.almond,wl,at.to support its conclusion,the almond court cited additional language from federal practice and procedure the testimony of an employee of the movant must be taken as true when it disclosed no lack of candor,the witness was not impeached,his credibility was not questioned,and the accuracy of his testimony was not controverted by evidence wright miller at.almond holding is consistent with chesapeake ohio ry.martin,in which the supreme court stated that courts need not deny the conclusiveness of testimony of the moving party that is not contradicted by direct evidence,nor by any legitimate inferences from the evidence,because the rule requiring that testimony be considered by the jury is not an absolute and inflexible one.almond and chesapeake establish that the issue,therefore,is not whether the district court could consider the affidavits of cordis but instead whether the affidavits were uncontradicted.
stratienko unsuccessfully contends that the following pieces of evidence so impeach or controvert the testimony of scheessele and coletti that their testimony is not sufficient for summary judgment cordis did not follow its internal policy,coletti left his office unlocked,coletti retained stratienko information for weeks after he declined the proposal,cordis recommended changes to the nondisclosure agreement,and cordis provided several reasons for declining the proposal.because none of these facts,however,impeach scheessele and coletti testimony,the district court correctly relied upon cordis declarations.
cordis followed its internal policy,and thus the internal policy has no bearing on the declarants credibility.stratienko argues that cordis policy,stating that reviews will be conducted by members of new business development,new product strategy,legal,and to a lesser degree,senior members of r d,impeaches the declarants testimony that they were the only individuals to see his proposal.there is no inconsistency here.cordis established the policy to minimize exposing our innovative engineering talent pool to external ideas,to safeguard our interests to our own internal inventions.the policy does not mandate that other individuals read the proposal.its purpose,as evidenced by to a lesser degree,is to limit the individuals who have access to secrets.in this case,consistent with the policy,scheessele,a member of new business development,and coletti,a member of the legal department,examined the proposal.the fact that the policy may have permitted others to view the proposal does not create any evidence that they,in fact,viewed it.
coletti uncertainty as to whether he kept stratienko documents in a locked or unlocked office fails to impeach his testimony that he did not share stratienko information with others at cordis.stratienko contends that coletti said that the documents were left in an unlocked office.but coletti,instead,said that he was unsure whether the documents were locked away.the small possibility that the documents were stolen or viewed sub rosa by being in a potentially unlocked office does not impeach coletti testimony that he did not share stratienko information with anyone at cordis.
likewise,coletti retention of stratienko information for weeks after he declined the proposal does not contradict the declarations.although stratienko argues that coletti retention of the documents creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether cordis used the documents,the retention does not demonstrate in any way that cordis used the information or that coletti shared the information with anyone else.any allowable inference that the retention of documents for a few weeks increases the probability that cordis shared them with research and development is too tenuous to create a genuine issue of material fact as to use.
that cordis had recommended changes to the nondisclosure agreement in no way impeaches the testimony of scheessele and coletti.stratienko argues that,because cordis suggested changes affected the remedies and the return of documents,the declarants credibility is impeached.both cordis and stratienko negotiated the details of the agreement,and the agreement contains several provisions that protect stratienko.stratienko never explains how the revised terms,reached at arm length,affect credibility or make it any more likely that cordis used the proposal.
