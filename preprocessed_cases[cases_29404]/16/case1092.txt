opinion of the court 
introduction 
plaintiff general refractories company grc appeals from the district court dismissal of its declaratory judgment and breach of contract action against defendant insurance companies for failure to join parties as defendants pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in particular,it asks us to consider whether the district court erred in determining that various insurers grc did not name in its complaint as defendants,the absent insurers,were both necessary and indispensable to this action as federal rule of civil procedure defines those terms.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that they were neither,and,accordingly,we will reverse.
ii.facts and procedural history 
grc is a manufacturer,distributor,and seller of products that plaintiffs have named as a defendant in thousands of lawsuits filed throughout the united states in both state and federal courts.grc maintains that from to,it purchased excess and umbrella liability insurance policies from either defendants or their notwithstanding its acquisition of these policies,grc attempts to obtain coverage from defendants for asbestos claims filed against it have met with little success thus far see refractories first state ins.grc,plaintiff submitted these claims to its comprehensive general liability insurers,which tendered defenses and indemnification until their policy limits were exhausted.on one basis or another,all of defendants policies purport to exclude personal injury claims and defendants denied coverage.internal citations omitted.
on july,grc filed a complaint in the district court against defendants.first,grc sought a declaratory judgment that any exclusions in defendants policies we re invalid and unenforceable and that defendants were required to pay for grc defense of the underlying actions,and to reimburse grc for,or pay on behalf of grc,any and all judgments or settlements reached in the underlying actions,until such time as the total aggregate limits of each of the foregoing insurance policies have been exhausted.at.second,grc stated a breach of contract claim,alleging that defendants had refused to honor their obligations to provide grc with a defense or indemnification in and for the underlying actions and seeking,among other things,t he entry of an award requiring the defendants to pay grc all monetary damages suffered by grc caused by their breaches,including,without limitation,compensatory damages,consequential damages,prejudgment interest,interest,and attorneys fees and costs.id.at.it is undisputed that grc expressly chose not to name all of the insurers that provided it with coverage because it believed that some of the policies were subject to releases,their limits had been exhausted,or the insurers who had issued the policies were insolvent or from grc 
after grc filed its complaint,five of the excess and umbrella insurance companies named as defendants moved to dismiss the same pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to join indispensable parties under federal rule of civil procedure.defendants predicated their motions on the theory that grc had failed to name all of the excess and umbrella insurers that had provided it with coverage from to,and that these absent insurers were indispensable to the action significantly,if grc had joined the absent insurers in the action,the district court would not have had subject matter jurisdiction as some of these insurers were.
the district court agreed with defendants in an order issued september.in the order the court reached two particularly significant conclusions for present purposes first,insofar as grc acknowledged that at least one of the policies in dispute follows form to a policy issued by an absent insurer,century indemnity,the court concluded that the absent insurer was a necessary party under rule a grc,at.the court went on to observe that 
without the absent insurers,it is highly unlikely that a judgment could be fashioned that would not be either unduly favorable or prejudicial to some of the other parties.it is also unlikely that a plaintiff award would be adequate if rendered against fewer than all potentially responsible insurers.no shaping of the judgment could avoid these coverage issue possibilities.
id.at.accordingly,the court found that all the absent insurers,rather than just century indemnity,were indispensable parties under rule b.id.the court thus dismissed grc complaint as joining the absent insurers would destroy diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.it indicated,however,that grc could refile the action in state court where all defendants may be joined in one action and complete relief afforded.id.grc moved for reconsideration of that order,but the court denied that motion on october.grc has appealed from these two orders.
iii.jurisdiction 
the district court had diversity of citizenship jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment and breach of contract action pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the final order of the district court dismissing grc complaint and the order denying reconsideration of that order pursuant to.
to the extent that the district court premised its rule a determination that the absent insurers joinder was necessary on a conclusion of law,our review is plenary.janney montgomery scott,shepard niles,cir.by contrast,we would review any subsidiary findings of fact for clear error only.id our review of the district court rule b determination that the absent insurers were indispensable,and dismissal is required because their joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction in diversity,is for abuse of discretion.id.at see also koppers aetna cas.sur,cir.
iv.discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure specifies the circumstances in which the joinder of a particular party is compulsory.in reviewing the district court conclusion in this regard,we first must determine whether the absent insurers should be joined as necessary parties under rule a.if they should be joined,but their joinder is not feasible inasmuch as it would defeat diversity of citizenship as would be the case here,we next must determine whether the absent parties are indispensable under rule b should we answer this question in the affirmative,the action can not go forward.janney montgomery scott,at citing bank of am.trust sav.ass hotel rittenhouse,cir.relatedly,should we decide that the district court erred in its conclusion that the absent insurers were necessary parties under rule a,we need not reach or decide the question of whether it abused its discretion by holding the absent insurers were indispensable under rule b,though we are not precluded from doing so to reach an alternative basis for our result.id.
under rule a,the joinder of parties is compulsory or necessary if their joinder is feasible.specifically,the rule states in material part 
a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
courts treat clauses and in the disjunctive just as the rule phrases them.see koppers,at as rule a is stated in the disjunctive,if either subsection is satisfied,the absent party is a necessary party that should be joined if possible.additionally,and as we discussed above,a holding that joinder is compulsory under rule a is a necessary predicate to a district court discretionary determination under rule b that it must dismiss a case because joinder is not feasible,will defeat diversity and the party is indispensable to the just resolution of the controversy.see janney montgomery scott,at.
under rule a we ask whether complete relief may be accorded to those persons named as parties to the action in the absence of any unjoined parties.as should be apparent,we necessarily limit our rule a inquiry to whether the district court can grant complete relief to persons already named as parties to the action what effect a decision may have on absent parties is immaterial.angst royal maccabees life ins,cir completeness is determined on the basis of those persons who are already parties,and not as between a party and the absent person whose joinder is sought.janney montgomery scott,at same.
the district court,relying on gould,arkwright mutual insurance,wl,found that because at least one of the policies in dispute follows form to a policy issued by an absent insurer,century indemnity,it was necessary to determine whether that absent insurer or any other absent insurer was indispensable under rule b.grc,at.we hold that the court erred in its conclusion 
pennsylvania law,which the parties agree governs the substantive aspects of this action to the extent of establishing the scope of defendants liability,plainly holds that once multiple policies have been triggered for an indivisible loss as is the case here,the insured is free to select the policy or policies under which it is to be indemnified.france refractories allstate ins,determining whether various insurance companies were liable for the defense and indemnification of an insured for claims and,if so,how that liability should be apportioned.further,w hen the policy limits of a given insurer are exhausted,the insured is entitled to seek indemnification from any of the remaining insurers which was on the risk.id.cognizant of insurers fear that a single company might be stuck with full liability for an injury,the pennsylvania supreme court added that its opinion does not alter the rules of contribution or the provisions of other insurance clauses in the applicable policies.there is no bar against an insurer obtaining a share of indemnification or defense costs from other insurers under other insurance clauses or under the equitable doctrine of contribution.id.given these legal precepts,there can be no doubt that,as in france,liability for coverage in the instant matter is similarly joint and several.see also koppers aetna cas.sur,cir noting that in france the pennsylvania supreme court held that the insurers whose coverage had been triggered were jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the claim up to policy limits,and the insured was entitled to select the policy or policies under which it would be indemnified.
we have recognized that where liability is joint and several among multiple parties,a court may grant complete relief with respect to any one of them subject,of course,to policy limits.janney montgomery scott,at citing cases for proposition that where liability is joint and several,a plaintiff may sue them separately in federal court.accordingly,it follows that the absent insurers generally,and century indemnity in particular,are not necessary parties under subsection a of rule as the court can grant complete relief to grc from any insurer it named as a party to this action see see also uti fireman fund ins,noting where liability is several,complete relief may be granted in a suit against any one of the severally liable parties.
defendants rely on a district court decision in city of littleton commercial union assurance,to support their argument,but that case is not inconsistent with our conclusion that grc may obtain complete relief in this case without the joinder of the absent insurers in city of littleton the plaintiffs sued one of their primary insurance carriers as well as two excess insurance carriers,seeking coverage for potential hazardous waste cleanup liability.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,alleging that two of the plaintiffs primary insurance carriers not named to the suit were indispensable parties under rule.in conducting its rule a analysis,the district court agreed that,at least with respect to the excess insurers,the absent primary insurers were necessary parties to the suit as otherwise it could not accord complete relief to the plaintiffs.id.at.
in particular,the city of littleton court deemed significant the circumstances that the liability of at least one excess insurer was dependent upon a determination of whether the absent primary insurers policies provided coverage one of the excess insurer policy provisions could not be triggered until the obligations of all the primary insurers had been determined and one of the plaintiffs purportedly was breaching a contract provision by failing to proceed against all primary carriers id.accordingly,the court concluded that issuance of a declaratory judgment would fail to dispose of the controversy and would not serve a useful purpose.id.on this point,it explained that 
although i could construe the absent insurers policies,any declaration on their liability would not bind them,the plaintiffs or the named defendants.thus,the finality of any judgment as to the excess insurers liability would be entirely contingent on judgment in a necessary,parallel state court suit between the plaintiffs and the absent insurers.the present defendants likely would be joined in that suit in which issues identical to those presented here would be considered.in a rule a inquiry,i must consider the public interest in avoiding repeated lawsuits on the same subject matter no useful purpose would be served by a partial judgment when there is a substantial risk of duplicative litigation.
id.citations omitted.
to be sure,in making its analysis under rule a,a court should consider the interests of the public in avoiding repeated lawsuits on the same essential subject matter.advisory committee notes.rule a,however,similarly stresses the desirability of joining those persons in whose absence the court would be obliged to grant partial or hollow rather than complete relief to the parties before the court.id.in this case,considering pennsylvania joint and several liability rules which supply the governing substantive law,grc failure to name the absent insurers to its suit plainly will not result in it obtaining partial or hollow relief if it is successful in its suit.see janney montgomery scott,at recognizing that where liability is joint and several among multiple parties,complete relief may be granted with respect to any one of them.to this end,the advisory committee notes to rule note particularly that the description of persons to be joined under subdivision a is not at variance with the settled authorities holding that a tortfeasor with the usual liability is merely a permissive party to an action against another with like liability.advisory committee notes internal citation omitted.the fact that the public might be subject to repeated suits on the same subject matter thus poses no bar to our conclusion that the absent insurers are not necessary parties to this case under rule a 
finally,defendants express some concern that because grc has failed to produce proof that it has exhausted the absent underlying insurance policies,they would be prejudiced if the action were to proceed.see gould,wl,at,finding plaintiff could proceed against its excess insurance carriers only if the policy limits of its absent underlying insurance carrier had been exhausted and,thus,that the absent underlying insurance carrier was a necessary party under rule a.our holding in koppers,which is binding precedent,and which we decided after gould,which is not binding precedent,makes clear that defendants concerns are largely unfounded.
in koppers,we considered whether ina,a excess insurer,was a necessary and indispensable party to an action brought by the appellant,koppers,against the appellees,certain underwriters from lloyd of london and certain london market insurance companies the london insurers,under rule.the london insurers urged that we answer this question in the affirmative,arguing they could not be held liable to pay on their excess policies unless and until the underlying paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their underlying policies.id.at.to this end,the london insurers submitted that their policies we re directly excess to the ina policies and contingent upon their liability under them and that payment or liability under the underlying policies is a condition precedent to any obligations that the london insurers might incur.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.upon reviewing the relevant policies,we found that satisfaction of a deductible to be paid by koppers or ina,among others,was required before the london insurers excess policy was triggered.id.at.based on this understanding,that any liability on the london insurers part was independent of ina,we held that insofar as liability under the london policies is concerned,complete relief can be accorded to the parties present to this litigation without the joinder of ina.accordingly ina is not a necessary party under rule a.id.
defendants in this action have provided no we can perceive of we should not reach the same result here as we did in koppers.at most,the question of whether the underlying policies have been exhausted to the extent that their exhaustion is a condition prerequisite to defendants monetary liability to make payments on their policies will be an issue at trial.in this regard,we point out that we are not holding who is or is not ultimately liable in this case.rather,we are determining the question of who are necessary and indispensable parties.
notwithstanding a determination that complete relief may be accorded to those persons already named as parties to an action,a court still may deem a party necessary under subsection a of rule.unlike subsection a,subsection a requires the court to take into consideration the effect that resolution of the dispute among those parties before it may have on any absent parties.see.a.
under rule a i,the court must decide whether determination of the rights of those persons named as parties to the action would impair or impede an absent party ability to protect its interest in the subject matter of the litigation.a i see also janney montgomery scott,at i t must be shown that some outcome of the federal case that is reasonably likely can preclude the absent party with respect to an issue material to the absent party rights or duties under standard principles governing the effect of prior judgments.defendants argue that the absent insurers whose policies must be interpreted in this declaratory judgment action have an interest relating to the subject of the interpretation of their the disposition of the action in their absence might,as a practical matter,impair their ability to protect the interpretation of their policies.appellees br.at.as our holding in janney montgomery scott makes clear,defendants position is without support.
in janney montgomery scott,the defendant and its parent corporation were on a contract with the plaintiff.claiming that the contract had been breached,the plaintiff filed a suit in the district court against the defendant and in state court against the defendant and its parent corporation.in a situation similar to that facing grc here with respect to parties,the defendant parent corporation was a citizen of pennsylvania.consequently,its joinder to the district court case would have resulted in the case dismissal inasmuch as the district court jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship and the plaintiff was a pennsylvania citizen.janney montgomery scott,at.the defendant subsequently filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings predicated on the plaintiff failure to join the defendant parent corporation in the action as a defendant under rule.the district court granted the motion,in part based on its holding that the defendant parent corporation was a necessary party to the suit under rule a i because it was likely that any decision reached in the federal action would affect the pending state court action as persuasive precedent against the absent parent corporation.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.
the plaintiff appealed and we disagreed with the district court conclusion,explaining 
we are not sure what the district court means by the phrase persuasive precedent.to the extent it involves the doctrine of stare decisis,we are not inclined to hold that any potential effect the doctrine may have on an absent party rights makes the absent party joinder compulsory under rule a whenever feasible.such a holding would greatly expand the class of necessary or compulsory parties rule a creates.moreover,to whatever extent the rule phrase as a practical manner impair or impede has broader meaning than that given by principles of issue preclusion,we think the effect of the federal decision must be more direct and immediate that the effect a judgment in defendant favor would have on its absent parent corporation here in any event,we do not believe any possibility of a persuasive precedent requires joinder under subsection a i.
id.at see also uti.at in janney,the third circuit expressly rejected the proposition that where a piece of litigation may result in a persuasive precedent against an absent party,the disposition of the action in that party absence would impair or impede that party ability to protect its interest within the meaning of rule a i.inasmuch as defendants proffer nothing more than a reincarnation of the persuasive precedent argument we have rejected,we similarly do not deem the absent insurers in this case to be necessary parties to grc suit under rule a i.
finally,under rule a ii,a court must decide whether continuation of the action would expose named parties to the substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.according to defendants,the very real possibility of prejudice arises from the likelihood that subsequent litigation will produce inconsistent obligations with those a court may determine they have here.for example,defendants contend that the district court in this case could determine that the exclusions contained in the policies are unenforceable,requiring them to indemnify grc for its losses in the underlying actions,while a second court in a later action against the absent insurers for contribution indemnification could reach a contrary conclusion,thus foreclosing recovery by defendants for their losses in whole or in part.similarly,defendants hypothesize 
the same problem would exist if,following a trial in federal court and a victory for grc,grc were to select one of the policies issued by a defendant in this matter covering year a for coverage and the chosen insurer then sued absent insurer covering year b for contribution in state court.in the state court action,the exclusion might well be honored,thereby defeating the contribution claim,which could not happen if all insurers rights were determined in the same action.
appellees br.at.again,we reject defendants position given our holding in janney montgomery scott.
in addition to its finding that the defendant parent corporation was a necessary party to the suit under rule a i,the district court in janney montgomery scott made the same determination under rule a ii.specifically,the district court reasoned that continuation of this action in the parent corporation absence may expose the defendant to a substantial risk of incurring double or inconsistent obligations because the defendant may be found liable under the agreement in the federal action while the parent corporation may be found not liable in the state court action.janney montgomery scott,at internal quotations and citation omitted.
even though we acknowledged that i t is,of course,possible that if the defendant is held liable in the federal action,it may ultimately be responsible for the entire claim if its parent corporation is found not liable in the state court action,we nonetheless concluded that t his is not the double liability that rule a ii refers to.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.on this point,we explained first that the district court conclusion necessarily was grounded on the unstated premise that if the defendant was found liable on the agreement,its parent corporation must be as well.we rejected this premise inasmuch as it was contradicted by the law refusal to consider the real possibility that one court could find the defendant liable while another was finding the absent parent corporation not liable in separate proceedings to which the rules of claim or issue preclusion do not apply.see also field volkswagenwerk ag,cir t he possibility of a subsequent adjudication that may result in a judgment that is inconsistent as a matter of logic,does not trigger the application of rule,disagreed with on other grounds by,d.we added that 
the possibility that the defendant may bear the whole loss if it is found liable is not the equivalent of double liability.it is instead a common result of joint and several liability and should not be equated with prejudice.inherent in the concept of joint and several liability is the right of a plaintiff to satisfy its whole judgment by execution against any one of the multiple defendants who are liable to him,thereby forcing the debtor who has paid the whole debt to protect itself by an action for contribution against the other joint obligors.
janney montgomery scott,at.to this end,we explicitly noted that a n outcome adverse to the defendant in the plaintiff present action against it does not have any legal effect on whatever right of contribution or indemnification the defendant may have against its parent corporation.id.
our holding in janney montgomery scott squarely addresses,and defeats,those arguments defendants make with respect to why the absent insurers should be deemed necessary parties to grc suit under rule a ii.as we outlined above,defendants primary concern is that inconsistent judgments from the state and federal courts effectively could foreclose their indemnification contribution claims against the absent insurers.however,janney montgomery scott makes clear that the possibility defendants may have to shoulder the entire loss if found liable is a necessary consequence of joint and several liability.further,it bears noting that the imposition of joint and several liability is intended to ensure that grc,and not defendants,be afforded the coverage for which it contracted.see france refractories,at in order to accord the insured the coverage promised by the insurance policies,the insured should be free to select the policy or policies under which it is to be indemnified.accordingly,defendants similarly can not be deemed necessary parties under rule a ii.see also uti.at.
even if we assumed that the district court correctly concluded that the absent insurers were necessary parties under rule,we nonetheless would find that they were not indispensable under that rule.as we noted above,when a party is deemed necessary under rule a,joinder must occur if feasible.if joinder of a necessary party would divest the district court of subject matter jurisdiction,destroy diversity,a court must determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed without that party,or whether the court should dismiss it,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.b.put another way,a finding of indispensability under rule b necessitates dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
under rule b,the four factors listed,though not exhaustive,are the most important considerations in determining whether a party is indispensable.gardiner water power,cir.these factors are 
first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
though it did not consider the four factors explicitly the district court found with respect to rule b 
without the absent insurers,it is highly unlikely that a judgment could be fashioned that would not be either unduly favorable or prejudicial to some of the other parties.it is also unlikely that a plaintiff award would be adequate if rendered against fewer than all potentially responsible insurers.no shaping of the judgment could avoid these coverage issue possibilities.
grc,at.the district court added that grc could refile its action in a state court where all defendants may be joined in one action and complete relief afforded.id.we conclude again that the district court was mistaken.
the first and second factors under rule b are to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties,and to what extent such prejudice can be lessened or avoided.notably,the first factor under rule b overlaps considerably with the rule a analysis.gardiner,at citing wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure at.as we discussed above,given the rules of joint and several liability,it is possible that grc can recover fully from those insurers it already has named as defendants in the present action.id.at finding no prejudice to either plaintiff or absent party where plaintiff could recover fully from defendant,the party with whom plaintiff claimed it had a contract,and defendant failed to present specific evidence of prejudice see also uti.at noting defendant insurance company potential liability for the entire loss results from the plaintiff absolute right under the pennsylvania supreme court decision in france to select the policy or policies under which it is to be indemnified and thus does not constitute prejudice within the meaning of rule b internal quotations and citation omitted.
we also take note of our particularly relevant precedent for present purposes that,a defendant right to contribution or indemnity from an absent party does not render that absentee indispensable pursuant to rule.janney montgomery scott,at quoting bank of am.trust sav.ass n,at.indeed,defendants are free to pursue any claim for contribution or indemnification they might have against the absent insurers in a separate action while w e recognize that this is a less convenient remedy for defendant,it is nonetheless a means of resolving defendant claim of the risk of inconsistent obligations.gardiner,at.
the third factor under rule b is whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate.specifically,this element allows the court to consider whether the relief it grants will prove an adequate remedy for the plaintiff.provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d.certainly with respect to defendants,the court can resolve grc claim in the present action and this factor weighs in grc favor.see gardiner,at.additionally,and also as we noted above,the possibility that the defendant s may have a claim for contribution or indemnity does not render an absentee indispensable.the right to contribution and indemnity should not,therefore,be considered to cause inadequacy of the resulting judgment.id.moreover,as the court indicated in provident,the adequacy criterion refer s to the public stake in setting disputes by wholes,at.at,and we surely will not hold that this stake is so great that it trumps the rules not otherwise requiring a plaintiff to join all potentially liable parties in joint and several liability situations.
finally,the fourth rule b the plaintiff has a remedy if the action is counsels strongly against dismissal in this case.gardiner,at.in vale chemical hartford accident indemnity,the pennsylvania supreme court reiterated its precedent that where claims are asserted against an insured,the persons asserting the claims are indispensable parties in a declaratory judgment action on the issue of coverage between the insured and the insurance carrier.the failure to join a claimant whose interests would be affected has been held to be fatal error.relying on this pronouncement from the pennsylvania supreme court in vale,grc argues that if forced to refile its action in a pennsylvania state court,the state in which defendants themselves believe that grc should have brought this action and now can proceed,grc necessarily would be required to add the tens of thousands of pl
