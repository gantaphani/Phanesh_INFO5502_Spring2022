this is the second time these parties have been before us on this case.see keenan donaldson,lufkin jenrette,cir reversing district court grant of summary judgment under the louisiana credit agreement statute hereinafter keenan i.following keenan i remand,the defendants again moved for summary judgment,this time asserting that this case was filed after the expiration of the applicable louisiana prescriptive period,among other grounds.the district court granted summary judgment on the entire case,and keenan again appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,and reverse and remand in part.
factual background 
keenan i describes the basic facts of this case,and we will not belabor them here.suffice it to say that keenan was a founder of independent energy holdings plc ie.the defendant parties collectively dlj parties acted in various financing and advisory capacities to ie.after experiencing cash flow problems,ie turned to a banking syndicate of which one of the dlj parties was a member to extend additional capital and forgive certain technical defaults of an existing credit facility.keenan contends,and the dlj parties dispute,that the dlj parties promised that if he personally loaned million to ie and raised million of mezzanine financing they would waive the technical default of the existing credit facility and extend the credit facility from to million.on june,keenan,not represented by counsel,loaned ie the money pursuant to a written agreement between ie and keenan.the loan matured on october.
the syndicate waived the technical defaults but did not extend additional credit to ie.on august,keenan presented million in mezzanine finance commitments to dlj.the syndicate then informed keenan that they were no longer interested in the mezzanine finance plan and wanted,instead,to pursue a short sale of the company.the short sale to aes corporation proceeded,but on september,the syndicate refused to lend ie any more money.ie then entered receivership in the united kingdom,where ie conducted business.although the credit facility was paid in full,keenan recovered only of his loan to ie through the receivership process.keenan contends that he did not know until that he would not be repaid in full through the receivership process.
on october,keenan filed suit against the dlj parties in the eastern district of louisiana.keenan original complaint contained two reliance and promissory estoppel under louisiana law at the instigation of the district court,keenan then conducted discovery to learn if he had a fraud claim as well.he contends that he eventually discovered that,when the promise described above was made,the dlj parties had no intention of honoring it.he then amended his complaint to add various fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims.as we discussed above,the district court then granted summary judgment under the louisiana credit agreement statute lcas,which we reversed in keenan i.the appeal in keenan i addressed the lcas.the dlj parties in that appeal also argued that the fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims were barred by louisiana prescription period,see,but conceded that the detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel claims were governed by the prescriptive period for an action in contract.see.we noted the district court did not address the limitations period issue.because keenan two claims detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel are not barred,remand is necessary regardless of our determination on this issue.at.
despite initially conceding that the detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel claims were governed by the contractual prescription period and therefore timely,on remand the dlj parties moved for summary judgment on prescription on these claims as well as the other claims that were based on fraud,negligence,and breach of fiduciary duty.keenan argued that the detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel claims,as well as the breach of fiduciary duty claim,were contractual in nature,and,thus,the period did not apply.he conceded that fraud and negligent misrepresentation fell under the period,but he argued that the period did not begin to run until he discovered facts showing that he had been defrauded.the district court ultimately decided that all claims were delictual in nature and thus governed by the statute it further found that keenan had sufficient knowledge of facts to trigger the start of the prescription period when his loan was not paid in.thus,the district court concluded that all claims were barred by the prescription period.summary judgment was granted,and keenan appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review grants of summary judgments de novo.minter great am.ins.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,after making all inferences in favor of the,the record contains no genuine issue of material fact,and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.b minter,at.we note that when a plaintiff should know of his cause of action is usually a question of fact.picard vermilion parish sch,so d,a determination of whether or not the plaintiffs were indeed prevented from filing their claim by reason of lack of knowledge is an issue of fact.see also ducre mine safety appliances,cir reversing summary judgment because a fact question remained as to whether the plaintiff was reasonably ignorant of the facts upon which his claims were based.
iii.discussion 
prescription period for detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel 
the first contention keenan makes is that the dlj parties current arguments about the detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel prescription period are foreclosed by keenan i.while we do not countenance the dlj parties change of position necessitating another appeal and further work by the district court and this court,we can not find that keenan i forecloses this argument.because prescription expressly was not reached by our court in the first appeal and thus was not decided on its merits,the references to prescription are not law of the case in this appeal.see united states hatter,d the law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits.
turning to the merits of this issue,the answer to this question turns on whether these two claims are viewed as contractual in thus governed by the delictual in thus governed by the period the question seems simple,but the answer is more complex.we have applied both statutes to claims denominated as detrimental reliance because the nature of the action,rather than its label,governs which statute applies.compare copeland wasserstein,perella,cir applying statute,with stokes,cir applying statute.in other words,w hen evaluating which prescriptive period is applicable to a cause of action,courts first look to the character of the action disclosed in the pleadings.ss state,so d.
we conclude that keenan detrimental reliance and promissory estoppel claims derive from a breach of promise,like stokes,rather than a breach of duty,like copeland accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the dlj parties on the defense of prescription to the promissory estoppel and detrimental reliance claims 
breach of fiduciary duty 
we need not reach the question of which statute governs keenan breach of fiduciary duty claim because we agree with the dlj parties that no fiduciary duty was owed by them to keenan.as the dlj parties argue,there is simply no evidence of a fiduciary relationship,nor could there be as the claim is pled there is no evidence any dlj entity was to act for keenan benefit regarding the loan,see scheffler adams reese,llp,so d,and close personal relationships do not create such a duty,see kaplan fine,so d.thus,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim count five on the alternate ground that no fiduciary duty was owed by the dlj parties to keenan 
fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
keenan admits that his remaining four claims sound in tort and are subject to the prescription period however,he contends that the period began to run when he discovered evidence of fraud in discovery rather than when he first learned dlj breached the al
