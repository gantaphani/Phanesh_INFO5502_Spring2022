gary fieger fieger or plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sidney stein,judge,dismissing his contract and quantum meruit claims as barred by connecticut real estate broker licensing statute,connecticut general statute a.fieger contends that the district court erred in applying connecticut law because under the applicable new york principles,the court should have applied new york law,under which his claims are not barred.he also argues that even if connecticut law applies,because he acted as a financial advisor rather than a real estate broker,section a does not bar his claims.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court to the extent that it dismissed fieger contract claim against prefco xxii,but we vacate as to the contract claim against pitney bowes and prefco,and the quantum meruit claim,both of which should have been assessed under new york law.we remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
fieger operates a financial advising business from his home office on the upper east side of manhattan.pitney bowes credit corporation pitney bowes,and its directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries,pitney bowes real estate financing corporation prefco and prefco xxii limited partnership prefco xxii together,defendants,are real estate financing businesses with their principal places of business in connecticut.pitney bowes has financed real estate development projects nationwide,including projects in california,pennsylvania,indiana,georgia,texas and virginia.
in,the swiss bank corporation sbc began to search for potential investors for its new american headquarters in stamford,connecticut,which was scheduled to be built by late.in,sbc sent a request for proposals rfp to a few real estate investors to solicit their interest in financing the sbc headquarters.in the rfp,sbc stated that it wished to finance its headquarters through a arrangement,and was seeking an investor to purchase the partially completed office building and trading pavilion,and to lease the facility back to sbc.pitney bowes responded to the rfp,but sbc did not act on that response.
fieger claims that in,sbc officials and fieger swiss business associate,karl steiner holding corporation steiner,informed him about the stamford project.in late,sbc officials in new york advised fieger that sbc had decided to structure the deal as a sale and leaseback.in september,fieger received a copy of sbc rfp.in late,he met with representatives of union bank of switzerland ubs in new york to discuss potential joint real estate financing opportunities,including the proposal for the sbc headquarters.in pursuing this possibility,fieger communicated with ubs at its new york offices and with sbc officials in switzerland and new york.
soon thereafter,ubs in new york proposed to pitney bowes in connecticut that pitney bowes become involved with a large financing project,but did not reveal to pitney bowes the location of the property as stamford or the identity of its owner as sbc.in a letter dated april,ubs informed pitney bowes that the property was located in stamford and owned by sbc.ubs told pitney bowes that it was working with had an inside connection at sbc and who might be able to help pitney bowes negotiate the transaction without competition.pitney bowes was attracted to the possibility of a preemptive deal.ubs requested that pitney bowes prepare a term sheet for financing a private transaction between pitney bowes and sbc.on april,fieger faxed the swiss bank rfp to ubs.on april,pitney bowes sent ubs the financing proposal for the stamford project.the next day,ubs sent fieger a letter in which it stated 
nevertheless,we also understand that in the event a financing is consummated involving,among others,pitney and swiss bank or their respective affiliates,ubs will be paid on the closing date an fee of of prefco cost out of the financing.for your information,this fee has already been included among the items intended to be paid out of the transaction fee assumed by pitney in the attached financing proposal.
on april,ubs sent fieger a similar letter,along with the pitney bowes financial proposal which fieger was to submit to the appropriate persons at sbc.the letter included slightly different terms with regard to the advising fee 
nevertheless,we also understand that in the event a financing is consummated involving,among others,pitney and swiss bank or their respective affiliates,ubs will be paid on the closing date an sic fee of of the prefco cost out of the financing.for your information,this fee as well as the fieger associates advisory fee not to exceed have already been included among the items intended to be paid out of the transaction fee assumed by pitney in the attached financing proposal.
pitney bowes claims that it never discussed the payment of fees with fieger,nor did it see the april ubs letter until after the present lawsuit had been commenced.
on april,prefco mailed to fieger new york office a copy of the pitney bowes term sheet for the proposed transaction.this letter stated that i ncluded in our pricing is fees and expenses of.the term sheet was set to expire by its terms on may,and stated that it was not a commitment by prefco to enter into this transaction,nor should it be construed as an offer to perform any undertaking.the next day,fieger forwarded the pitney bowes proposal to sbc at its new york office.on may,pitney bowes sent a letter to sbc stating this letter will confirm that prefco and its advisors are aware of the april submission and that gary fieger of gary fieger associates,in his capacity as a real estate consultant on this project,was authorized by prefco and its advisors to submit that proposal to you.sbc did not act on the prefco proposal,which expired by its terms.in early june,fieger wrote to pitney bowes in connecticut to update pitney bowes on his contacts with sbc.
rather than pursuing a private transaction,sbc hired merrill lynch to act as its financial advisor for the headquarters project.merrill lynch sent out an rfp to numerous potential investors,including pitney bowes,in order to solicit interest in the project.in june,merrill lynch sent confidentiality agreements and equity offering memoranda to prospective investors,including pitney bowes.fieger received a copy of this mailing because merrill lynch believed he was acting as pitney bowes advisor.in june,fieger received a letter from sbc which stated that sbc would send fieger the rfp consistent with all our recent conversations.at the end of the month,fieger forwarded the merrill lynch documents to pitney bowes in connecticut and noted in his cover letter that,although s ome of the criteria have changed as an outgrowth of on the part of sbc,the essence of the deal is substantially the same.he continued 
it is my opinion,having been involved,for more than a year,in discussions with sbc relative to the financing of this deal,that your offer of april,which gary fieger associates transmitted,on your behalf,was a very competitive and aggressive bid and should prevail at the end of the day.
in,pitney bowes responded to the rfp by submitting to merrill lynch a financing proposal that had been prepared without fieger involvement.this proposal was considerably more detailed that the april pitney bowes submission which fieger had made to sbc.
on july,pitney bowes sent a letter to fieger describing its involvement with the sbc stamford project and stating 
the purpose of this letter is to make it clear to you that prefco has not engaged you or your company to represent it in connection with this proposed transaction.our only interest in dealing with you in april was in connection with a privately negotiated transaction,based on our understanding that you had special business connections with sbc and the project.prefco has very broad experience is sic bidding on and negotiating transactions and has no need for a broker or financial advisor in that regard.
therefore,we request that you desist from any further communications with any person involved in this transaction,including without limitation sbc or merrill lynch,to the effect that you in any way represent prefco or are acting as an advisor to prefco.
in september,fieger sent a letter to pitney bowes at its connecticut offices in which he stated that pitney bowes letter appeared to be an attempt to deprive gary fieger associates,inc of compensation in this matter although he had provided pitney bowes with substantial assistance.
on august,merrill lynch advised pitney bowes that sbc had decided to conduct further negotiations with pitney bowes.on september,sbc and pitney bowes executed a letter of intent,and the sale and leaseback transaction closed in december.according to pitney bowes,fieger was not involved in the negotiations conducted with merrill lynch.the final sale and leaseback agreement between pitney bowes and sbc included the following provision 
section.governing law.this lease shall in all respects be governed by,and construed in accordance with,the laws of the state of connecticut applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within the such state,including all matters of construction,validity and performance.
the land lease agreement included the following statement this agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of connecticut.
in january,fieger commenced this action in new york state supreme court,and,in february,defendants removed it to the southern district of new york based on diversity.fieger alleged a claim for,plus interest,which represents of the million pitney bowes paid to acquire the sbc stamford property.specifically,he alleged that 
the defendants have failed to pay said agreed commission to the plaintiff or to make available said commission from the funds paid for the acquisition of said realty interests and 
u pon information and belief,the defendant prefco xxii limited partnership,assumed the obligations of pbcc and prefco to pay the swiss bank corporation the agreed price for the acquisition of its said stamford realty interests,which included all transactional charges up to of the acquisition price,which included the of one percent which pbcc and prefco had agreed to pay or make available for payment to plaintiff.
fieger also alleged a quantum meruit claim on the ground that he had rendered services to defendants with the expectation of compensation,the reasonable value of which was million,or of the purchase price for the sbc property,plus interest.in their answer,defendants raised several defenses,including that fieger claims are barred because he was not a licensed connecticut real estate broker and that he was not a procuring cause of the transaction.
defendants moved for summary judgment,which was granted.in its thoughtful opinion,the district court determined that connecticut law should be applied and dismissed fieger claims,reasoning that under connecticut law,he was barred from recovering any fee arising out of the sale of real estate in connecticut because he was not licensed in connecticut as a real estate broker.
on appeal,fieger pursues both his contract and his quantum meruit claims.the theory behind fieger contract claim against pitney bowes and prefco seems to be that with the initial proposal submitted to sbc in april,pitney bowes and prefco committed themselves to pay fieger a fee if they completed the deal with sbc.fieger claims that this arrangement was memorialized in ubs april,letter to him.according to fieger,his fee was contingent on the completion of the stamford project financing.fieger claims that his fees became due in december,when the agreement was finalized.with regard to his contract claim against prefco xxii,fieger alleges that in the december agreement between prefco xxii and sbc,prefco xxii agreed to assume the transactional charges that pitney bowes and prefco had agreed to pay him.thus,although fieger complaint states that he alleges one contract cause of action,he in fact alleges two such claims a claim against pitney bowes and prefco based on the april letter,and a beneficiary claim against prefco xxii based on the december assumption.his quantum meruit claim is based on the theory that if there was no valid contact between himself and defendants,then defendants are equitably obliged to pay him for the services he rendered in facilitating the negotiations between defendants and sbc.defendants deny that they are bound by any agreement between ubs and fieger,such as the april letter,and further deny that fieger is an intended beneficiary of the december contract.they also deny that fieger work on their behalf led to the consummation of the xxii agreement.
discussion 
choice of law 
the court of appeals reviews the district court determination and its grant of summary judgment de novo.see caruolo john crane,cir citations omitted curley amr,cir we review a grant of summary judgment de novo to ascertain whether the substantive law was properly applied and,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,to determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact necessitating a trial.
a federal trial court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the law of the forum state to determine the.see klaxon stentor electric.cited in hartford fire ins.orient overseas containers lines uk,cir.in new york,the forum state in this case,the first question to resolve in determining whether to undertake a choice of law analysis is whether there is an actual conflict of laws.curley,at citing matter of allstate ins.stolarz.it is only when it can be said that there is no actual conflict that new york will dispense with a choice of law analysis.id.we will consider this question with regard to each of fieger claims.
the december financing contract upon which fieger relies for his claim against prefco xxii includes a connecticut provision,while the april letter includes no such reference to state law.new york law is clear in cases involving a contract with an express provision absent fraud or a violation of public policy,a court is to apply the law selected in the contract as long as the state selected has sufficient contacts with the transaction.hartford fire,at.connecticut law give s effect to an express choice of law by the parties to a contract provided that it was made in good faith.elgar elgar,see reichhold chemicals,hartford accident indem,connecticut court would apply most significant relationship test in evaluating a question w here there is no choice of law provision in the contract.with respect to enforcing a provision in a contract,new york and connecticut law do not conflict.as there are no allegations of fraud,bad faith or unfavorable public policy aspects to the provision,the court will enforce it.accordingly,with regard to the contract claim against prefco xxii,connecticut law governs.
contacts analysis 
with respect to the contract claim against pitney bowes and prefco,and the quantum meruit claim against all defendants,the court must first compare the laws of new york and connecticut to determine if they conflict.see curley,at.each state requires that real estate brokers working in the respective state be licensed in order to bring actions for commissions,see.real prop.however,fieger was licensed in new york only.consequently,although the new york and connecticut real estate licensing statutes do not directly conflict,the application of each statute will lead to a different result under new york law,his claims are not barred,while under connecticut law,they are.because there is a conflict,we must resolve the issue,using new york principles.
new york employs two different analyses,one for contract claims,another for tort claims.see lazard freres protective life ins,cir.with regard to the pitney bowes and prefco contract claim,it is clear that the contract law analysis would apply.with respect to a quantum meruit claim,we are not aware of any published new york decision that has stated the appropriate test to apply to such a claim.under new york law,a quantum meruit claim is a claim in.see revson cinque cinque,cir futterman,bridgemarket assocs,app.div.dep t quantum meruit claims rest on implied contract landcom,galen lyons joint landfill comm n,app.div.dep t quantum meruit is a claim.fieger claimed entitlement to a commission payment sounds more in contract than in tort,arising as it does from the benefit allegedly conferred upon defendants by plaintiff business advice.accordingly,the court will apply new york analysis for contract claims to fieger quantum meruit claim.
under the contracts analysis,the court evaluates the center of gravity or grouping of contacts,with the purpose of establishing which state has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.zurich ins.shearson lehman hutton,quoting restatement second of conflict of laws.in developing this test,the new york court of appeals relied on the second restatement of conflict of laws,which in addition to the traditionally determinative choice of law factor of the place of contracting,offers four other factors to be considered in establishing this most significant relationship the places of negotiation and performance the location of the subject matter and the domicile or place of business of the contracting parties.id.citing restatement second of conflict of laws.additionally,with regard to the law governing financial transactions arranged in new york,new york has emphasized the state role as an international financial center,see intercontinental planning,daystrom,and considered the state need to ensure that its licensed professionals are paid for services provided within the state,see rosenberg rosenberg,hoffman,app.div.dep t discussing need for state licensed brokers to be compensated see also istim,chemical bank,noting,in the context of a suit over an attorney lien,that new york undisputed interest in protecting its attorneys ability to be paid for legal services rendered is paramount.
the district court,relying on madison realty,neiss,dep t internal citation and quotation marks omitted,based its analysis primarily on the principle that c ontracts referring to the transfer of title to land are governed by the law of the place where the land is situated.id.this statement is true when the validity of a conveyance itself is in question.see james powell,choice of law as to legal consequences of conveyance should be determined by jurisdiction empowered to deal with the r es.notwithstanding,new york courts have recognized the governmental interest underlying state licensing statutes,to wit,that a state may have a strong interest in regulating the activities of real estate brokers who perform services in connection with the sale of property located within that state.madison realty,at florida real estate licensing statute see marina mgmt.brewer,cir the connecticut license requirements furnish supervision and regulation of the real estate business and make possible the elimination of the incompetent and unscrupulous agent.konikoff prudential ins.of,cir applying new york law in a suit alleging defamation arising from a report indicating improper appraiser bias by plaintiff where,inter alia,the appraisal of which is at the heart of this located in new york.
in contrast,when an action involves real estate but does not challenge the title to,or succession or conveyance of,property,the situs of the property is viewed as one in the spectrum of significant contacts considered in connection with the analysis.madison realty,at quoting stolarz,at.stated another way,in these cases the situs of the property is not dispositive of our analysis.
although the district court placed heavy reliance on the situs rule,it evaluated three cases in which the situs of the property was just one of several factors in a analysis.in madison realty neiss,dep t,the state court applied the center of gravity or grouping of contacts theory to determine that florida law applied to a claim by a new york broker for commission on sale of florida property.the madison realty court noted that the brokerage fee was earned in connection with the transfer of property,the purchaser was registered with the seller agent in florida as a potential purchaser,and eventually an offer for the property was made in florida to the seller agent in florida.on these facts,florida contacts were greater than new york.in rosenberg rosenberg,hoffman,dep t,which the district court rejected,the state court applied an interests analysis to a new york real estate broker claim for a commission for securing financing from a new york bank for the purchase of a new jersey condominium,and found that new york had the primary interest in the deal because the work to secure the financing had been performed in new york.the court stated 
t he interest of new york in seeing that its licensed brokers are compensated on contracts arising from initial contacts in new york and made in new york for obtaining financing from whatever source and the fact that a new york source was found and the loan commitment issued and the loan agreement closed in new york would indicate the propriety of the application of new york law.
id.at.the district court also rejected reliance on advance realty associates,first bank national association,civ.swk,wl,at.in conducting an interests analysis,the advance realty court found that new york had the primary interest in a claim by a new york broker for commission on the sale of georgia property because the broker principal place of business was new york while the purchaser was minnesota the relationship was initiated through a series of conversations in new york,nebraska,and minnesota the broker procured a buyer in new york and discussions regarding the commission and negotiations regarding the property sale occurred in new york.id.
cases from other jurisdictions support the approach of considering the situs of the real estate that is the subject of a transaction as just one of several contacts assessed in an interests analysis.in an almost case concerning the application of the situs rule,selover,bates walsh,the plaintiff claimed that the law of colorado must apply to the interpretation of a contract drafted in minnesota because the contract covenanted certain rights to property in colorado.the supreme court stated the contention is that the minnesota statute,as applied,affected the transfer of land situated in another state,and outside of,therefore,the jurisdiction of the state of minnesota.in other words,it is contended that the law of colorado,the situs of the property,is the law of the contract.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that the contract was strictly personal,and i t in no way affects the land or seeks any remedy against it.id.it relied on polson stewart,in which the court had explained 
it is true that the laws of other states can not render valid conveyances of property within our borders which our laws say are void,for the plain reason that we have exclusive power over the res.but the same reason inverted establishes that the lex rei sitae can not control personal covenants,not purporting to be conveyances between persons outside the jurisdiction,although concerning a thing within it.
id.at internal citation omitted see coldwell banker karlock,cir finding that a real estate brokerage contract is generally characterized as a contract for personal services rather than a contract conveying an interest in land,and performing a analysis by assessing contacts with brokerage arrangements,including,inter alia,the situs of the property dorothy winston town heights,concluding that situs rule did not control contacts analysis and florida broker law did not bar commission for a district of columbia broker who procured a purchaser for property in florida see also sika chem,holding that the situs of an acquired missouri corporation was not determinative of question as to finder fee contract between a finder and a purchaser,both corporations ames ideal cement,misc d.new york county holding,in the analogous context of in relation to the sale of personal property,that compensation for arranging the sale is assessed apart from underlying sale.
applying new york contract test,the district court determined that connecticut had the primary contacts with the controversy because the situs of the property was in connecticut,the defendants are connecticut corporations,the defendants interest was solicited in connecticut and the final agreement between defendants and sbc was consummated in connecticut.in this case,we believe that the district court analysis was too focused on the final transaction between sbc and prefco xxii,rather than on fieger services which form the basis of his contract claim against pitney bowes and prefco,and his quantum meruit claim.the present case more closely resembles the rosenberg case,which the district court rejected,than madison realty upon which it relied,because fieger claims do not address the validity of the conveyance or negotiation in connecticut,but rather his involvement with the negotiations and the structuring of the financing in new york.but see agency rent a car grand,cir in evaluating contacts of in the context of personal jurisdiction analysis under new york statute,noting that i ndeed,we question whether,in an age of and teleconferencing,the absence of actual personal visits to the forum is any longer of critical consequence.
fieger negotiated with ubs,sbc,merrill lynch and pitney bowes from his office in new york.he met and communicated with representatives of the four companies in new york and switzerland these communications are the heart of fieger efforts on behalf of defendants to secure the sbc deal.ubs letter to fieger setting forth the terms of the financing was sent from its new york offices to fieger new york office.pitney bowes provided the term sheet to fieger in new york and authorized his contact with sbc in new york on pitney bowes behalf by a letter sent to new york.pitney bowes confirmed fieger role as its representative by letter to sbc in new york in may.in the summer of,sbc hired merrill lynch in new york,and pitney bowes responded positively to the new york solicitation for interest.to the extent that fieger reached into connecticut,the earliest communication from plaintiff to pitney bowes in connecticut occurred in june.notably,it was ubs,not fieger,that solicited pitney bowes interest in the project in connecticut.finally,while defendants are located in connecticut,because defendants operate a national business,it should come as little surprise to them that their activities might be assessed under the laws of a state other than connecticut.
we conclude that the majority of the relevant contacts are with new york.when coupled with new york policy interests in recognizing the importance of the state professional brokers in arranging complex international financing transactions,new york has the more significant interest in the relationship between fieger and defendants.accordingly,new york law applies to the contract claim against pitney bowes and prefco,as well as to the quantum meruit claim 
ii.broker licensing statutes 
connecticut 
connecticut law regarding real estate licenses provides in part 
no person who is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter,and who was not so licensed at the time the person performed the acts or rendered the services for which recovery is sought,shall commence or bring any action in any court of this state,after october,to recover any commission,compensation or other payment with respect to any act done or service rendered by the person,the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter except by persons duly licensed under this chapter.
a section b of,which requires that valid real estate listings include several specific items,states 
no person,licensed under the provisions of this chapter,shall commence or bring any action with respect to any acts done or services rendered after october,as set forth in subsection a,unless the acts or services were rendered pursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom the acts were done or services rendered.to satisfy the requirements of this subsection any contract or authorization shall be in writing,contain the names and addresses of the real estate broker performing the services and the name of the person or persons for whom the acts were done or services rendered,show the date on which such contract was entered into or such authorization given,contain the conditions of such contract or authorization,be signed by the real estate broker or the real estate broker authorized agent,if such contract or authorization pertains to any real property,include the following statement the real estate broker may be entitled to certain lien rights pursuant to section of the connecticut general statutes,and be signed by the person or persons for whom the acts were done or services rendered or by an agent authorized to act on behalf of such person or persons,pursuant to a written document executed in the manner provided for conveyances in section,except,if the acts to be done or services rendered involve a listing contract for the sale of land containing any building or structure occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families,be signed by the owner of the real estate or by an agent authorized to act on behalf of such owner pursuant to a written document executed in the manner provided for conveyances in section.
the chapter defines a real estate broker or brokers as 
any person,partnership,association,limited liability company or corporation which acts for another person or entity and for a fee,commission or other valuable consideration,lists for sale,sells,exchanges,buys or rents,or offers or attempts to negotiate a sale,exchange,purchase or rental of,an estate or interest in real estate,or collects or offers or attempts to collect rent for the use of real estate.
the parties dispute the proper scope of section a,a question which is the source of some controversy in connecticut courts.fieger claims that he did not act as a real estate broker as that term is defined in connecticut law,but instead served as a financial advisor to pitney bowes.defendants argue that fieger services come within the connecticut real estate licensing statute,and thus fieger can not bring a claim for a commission based on those services because he was not licensed as a real estate broker in connecticut when he provided them.it is undisputed that fieger did not possess a valid connecticut real estate license at all times relevant to the instant action.very few connecticut courts have addressed the application of section a to the claim of a buyer broker or financial advisor,and the connecticut supreme court has not spoken on the issue.
absent law from a state highest court,a federal court sitting in diversity has to predict how the state court would resolve an ambiguity in state law.michalski home depot,cir.in predicting how a state highest court would rule on an issue,it is helpful to consider the decisions of the state trial and appellate courts.id.the holding of an intermediate appellate state court is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.west v.at t.cited in michalski,at.other data include relevant case law from other jurisdictions on the same or analogous issues,scholarly writings in the field,and any other resources available to the state highest court.michalski,at citing leon bakery,grinnell,cir.
two connecticut cases,both of which applied section a to bar an unlicensed broker action for commission,present facts similar to those of the case before us.in wilder group,byers,no.civ,wl,at,the plaintiff,an unlicensed real estate broker,sued the defendant for a commission based on an alleged agreement.although the plaintiff did not list the property,the court held that he had engaged in real estate activities because as a,the plaintiff,like the listing broker,attempt ed to negotiate the sale of the property in question by introducing his customers to it,and thereby attempt ed to interest them in it.id.in doing so,the plaintiff served as a conduit for the negotiation and sale of the property,and in taking an active role in finding a purchaser for the defendant broker listed brokerage activity for which a connecticut real e
