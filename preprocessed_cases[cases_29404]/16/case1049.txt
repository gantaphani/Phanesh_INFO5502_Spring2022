opinion of the court 
at issue in this appeal is the interpretation of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods as it relates to a contract dispute between two corporations,one based in the united states and the other in argentina.the convention contains a provision allowing a contract to be proved even if it is not in writing but also authorizes a signatory state to make a declaration opting out of that and related provisions.the united states has not made such a declaration argentina has.the district court concluded that argentina declaration imposed a writing requirement and that the absence of a written contract in this case precluded the plaintiff claim.we disagree with that approach.we conclude that where,as here,one party country of incorporation has made a declaration while the other has not,a court must first decide,based on the forum state rules,which forum law applies,and then apply the law of the forum designated by the analysis.
we can not decide on this record whether new jersey or argentine law applies here.furthermore,because the parties have not briefed the issue and the district court did not address it,we are reluctant to determine whether the claim asserted here would survive under either jurisdiction laws.accordingly,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant and remand for further proceedings.
forestal guarani is an manufacturer of various lumber products,including wooden daros international,is a new corporation.in,forestal and daros entered into an oral agreement whereby daros agreed to sell forestal wooden to third parties in the united states.pursuant to that agreement,forestal sent daros worth.daros paid forestal a total of.forestal demanded the balance due but daros declined to pay.in april,forestal sued daros in the superior court of new jersey,asserting a claim based on daros refusal to pay.daros thereafter removed the case to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.in its answer,daros admitted that it had paid forestal in exchange for the but denied that it owed forestal any additional money.discovery ensued.
in june,daros moved for summary judgment,arguing that the parties lacked a written agreement in violation of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods,treaty doc,reprinted at.cisg,and that forestal could not otherwise substantiate its damages claim with credible evidence.the district court summarily denied the motion,concluding that genuine questions of material fact existed.the court later held a conference with the parties and ordered briefing on several specific questions regarding the applicability of the cisg.both parties complied and agreed that the cisg governed forestal claim.in october,the district court granted daros summary judgment motion,concluding that the cisg governed the parties dispute and barred forestal claim because the parties agreement was not in writing.the court also found that forestal had not adduced any other evidence of its alleged agreement with daros.forestal has timely appealed the district court ruling

the parties do not dispute that the cisg governs their dispute.while daros does not deny that it had a contract with forestal,the thrust of daros argument is that the parties do not have a written contract and that,under the cisg,the absence of a writing precludes forestal claim.while conceding that the cisg applies generally,forestal contests the district court ruling on the ground that the lack of a writing,in its view,is inconsequential in light of the parties course of dealing,as evidenced by forestal delivery of to daros and daros remittance of payments to forestal,as well as an accountant report and invoices forestal claims show that daros owes it money.

the cisg strives to promote certainty among contracting parties and simplicity in judicial understanding by reducing forum shopping,reducing the need to resort to rules of private international law,and establishing a law of sales appropriate for international transactions.butler,a practical guide to the cisg negotiations through litigation,at supp.footnote omitted.these goals are explicitly enshrined in the cisg.article directs a court,in interpreting the cisg,to be mindful of its international character and the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international trade.in furtherance of these principles,as relevant here,the cisg dispenses with certain formalities associated with proving the existence of a contract.specifically,article instructs that a contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form.it may be proved by any means,including witnesses.similarly,article permits a contract modification to be proved even if it is not in writing.and part ii of the cisg,titled formation of the contract,outlines requirements governing offer and acceptance but does not impose a writing requirement.
article elimination of formal writing requirements does not apply in all instances in which the cisg governs.article of the cisg carves out an exception to article,article and part ii.it says that 
a contracting state whose legislation requires contracts of sale to be concluded in or evidenced by writing may at any time make a declaration in accordance with article that any provision of article,article,or part ii of this convention,that allows a contract of sale or its modification or termination by agreement or any offer,acceptance,or other indication of intention to be made in any form other than in writing,does not apply where any party has his place of business in that state.
article,to which article refers,states that 
a ny provision of article,article or part ii of this convention that allows a contract of sale to be made in any form other than in writing does not apply where any party has his place of business in a contracting state which has made a declaration under article of this convention.the parties may not derogate from or vary the effect of this article.
the united states has not made an article declaration,so article governs contract formation in cases involving a united litigant and a litigant based in another signatory state.argentina,however,has made a declaration under article,thereby opting out of article,article and part ii 
our research has turned up almost no case law from courts in the united states informing how to address a case,such as this one,in which one state has made an article declaration and the other has not courts in foreign jurisdictions and commentators alike are divided over how to proceed in such a scenario.see uncitral digest of case law on the united nations convention on the international sale of goods,outlining the conflict.according to one school of thought,a court must at the outset conduct a analysis based on private international law principles to determine which state law governs contract formation,and then apply that law to a party claim.see,henry mather,choice of law for international sales issues not resolved by the cisg,com,citing various commentators and a decision by a hungarian court.our study of the available sources on the subject establishes this position as the clear majority view in contrast,under what appears to be the minority view,a court should simply require the existence of a writing without reference to either state law,though it is unclear what form such a writing would have to take to be considered sufficient.see,louis del duca,implementation of contract formation statute of frauds,parol evidence,and battle of forms cisg provisions in civil and common law countries,com,citing decisions by courts in russia and belgium 
although none of the supporters of what we perceive as the majority view have explained their reasoning in any detail,we conclude that the majority has it right.our conclusion is compelled by the cisg plain language.maximov united states,interpreting a treaty according to its plain language rocca thompson,similar.the cisg says that q uestions concerning matters governed by this convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or,in the absence of such principles,in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law choice of law.because argentina has opted out of articles and as well as part ii of the cisg,the cisg does not expressly settle the question whether a claim is sustainable in the absence of a written contract.so article tells us to consider the cisg general principles to fill in the gap.we have already outlined some of the general principles undergirding the cisg,but we fail to see how they inform the question whether forestal contract claim may proceed.indeed,given the inapplicability in this case of any of the cisg provisions relaxing or eliminating writing requirements,we do not believe that we can answer the question presented here based on a pure application of those principles alone.given that neither the cisg nor its founding principles explicitly or implicitly settle our inquiry,article reference to the rules of private international law is triggered.in other words,we have to consider the rules of the forum state,in this case new jersey,to determine whether new jersey or argentine form requirements govern forestal claim.see,zicherman korean air lines,
in making a determination in a case,new jersey courts ask which forum has the most significant relationship with the parties and the contract.see state farm mut.auto.ins.estate of simmons,keil westminster bank.to that end,the new jersey supreme court has adopted the principles set forth in and of the restatement second of conflicts of laws.see gilbert spruance.mfrs.ass ins.section directs courts to consider,among other things

we ordinarily decline to consider issues not decided by a district court,choosing instead to allow that court to consider them in the first instance.see,in re montgomery ward,cir montrose med.group participating sav.plan bulger,cir.this case bolsters the rationale behind our reluctance to wade into matters that the parties have not joined and that a district court has not addressed,as the record here sheds practically no light on many,if not most,of the considerations listed above.
it is true that we can affirm a district court ruling on any ground supported by the record.see travelers indem.dammann,cir.there is no dispute here that forestal contract with daros was verbal at best,so we could feasibly skip a analysis and apply both new jersey and argentine law to forestal claim to test its viability.new jersey statute of frauds provides that a contract for the sale of goods for the price of or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought stat.ann.while forestal claim might fail under that provision,the statute also makes several exceptions to the general rule.see id.the parties have not briefed,and the record in this case prevents us from concluding definitively,whether any such exception is applicable here.as for argentine law,we may safely assume that it requires some sort of writing,as article of the cisg permits a country to opt out of article only if its domestic law requires contracts of sale to be concluded in or evidenced by writing.we have looked at the argentine civil code it contains several provisions governing contract formation and ways of proving a contract.forestal offer of proof may or may not suffice under those provisions.in the end,we think it unwise either to venture into this outcome of which is determinative of this to engage in a largely speculative exercise about the viability of forestal claim under either jurisdiction law without the benefit of either any briefing whatsoever by the parties or any analysis by the district court on this point.because these issues deserve a full airing,we conclude that remand is a better course of action.
our conclusion that remand is appropriate is also driven by the posture in which this case reaches us.forestal is appealing from the district court grant of summary judgment for daros on daros motion.in other words,although it did not say so explicitly,the district court determined that daros had met its initial burden of showing that there remained no genuine questions of material fact and that daros was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.as we read daros moving papers,we understand daros to have sought to meet that burden by advancing two main arguments.first,daros argued that summary judgment was proper because,in its view,the cisg requires a writing in light of argentina article declaration and forestal did not produce a formal written contract.we have concluded,however,that such a position is wrong as a matter of law.as we have explained,the resolution of this case requires a analysis to determine whether new jersey or argentine form requirements govern as well as an inquiry into whether forestal offer of proof is adequate under whichever forum law that analysis designates.in other words,daros could not have met its initial summary judgment burden of showing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law when there was,in effect,no law to apply.
second,daros contended that forestal had submitted no credible evidence of a contract with daros.the district court agreed with that contention,concluding that there was no evidence that the parties ever had any contract at all.it is undisputed,however,that forestal sold wooden to daros and that daros gave forestal money in exchange.indeed,daros nowhere denies that the parties at the very least had a verbal contract for those sales.furthermore,forestal submitted an accountant certification,with supporting documentation,as well as invoices in an effort to substantiate its claim that it is owed money.there is also deposition testimony indicating that the parties had a contract.the district court did not expressly refer to some of these materials in its opinion,and we do not know why it evidently disregarded them.the court also rejected forestal reliance on the invoices forestal submitted,but did so based on new jersey law is,with no parallel analysis under argentine explaining its reference to that state law when the court had already decided that the cisg controlled this case.in short,we can not say at this stage that there is no genuine question of material fact as to whether the parties had or did not have some sort of contractual relationship and whether forestal can prove as much under whatever law actually controls this case.as a consequence,we are not persuaded that daros met its initial summary judgment burden on the record as it now stands 
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment for daros and remand for further proceedings.on remand,the district court may determine,based on new jersey rules,whether new jersey or argentine law governs and then apply that forum law to this case.our disposition does not suggest that a trial is necessarily warranted.summary judgment,or some other pretrial disposition,including a venue transfer,may be appropriate on a more developed record.
i believe that the issues addressed at some length by the court have not been properly preserved for appellate consideration.with respect to the merits,i have serious doubts as to the validity of the approach actually adopted by the majority.i therefore must respectfully dissent.
it is well established that this court generally refuses to consider an argument or issue that a party has failed to raise in the district court.see,cape henlopen sch,wl,at cir.may,finding that due process claim was never asserted in district court and refusing to address merits of constitutional argument raised for first time on appeal in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir stating that,in absence of exceptional circumstances,we will not consider issues raised for first time on appeal and explaining that party must present argument at appropriate time and with sufficient specificity in re surrick,cir we need not address the merits of surrick third and final the state court ruling violates his first amendment rights and therefore constitutes a grave injustice pursuant to rac ii d as he failed to adequately raise it before the district court.citing brenner local,united of carpenters joiners of,cir.similarly,we usually refrain from addressing an argument or issue not properly raised and discussed in the appellate briefing.see,surrick,at further,to the extent that surrick reply brief may be read to challenge the district court finding of waiver with respect to the first amendment argument that was asserted below,we conclude that his failure to identify or argue this issue in his opening brief constitutes waiver of this argument on appeal.citing kost kozakiewicz,cir.
both before the district court and now on appeal,forrestal has failed to raise the various issues resolved by the majority.specifically,it has failed to raise the issue of whether,in cases where one party country of incorporation has made an article declaration under the cisg while the country of the other party to the alleged contract has not done so,a court must initially decide,based on the forum rules,which country law applies and then apply the substantive law of the applicable jurisdiction.likewise,the parties have not briefed the specific question of whether new jersey or argentine law applies here.the majority itself acknowledges that the district court did not conduct a analysis and did not explicitly consider any form requirements,or any exceptions to those requirements,recognized under either new jersey or argentine law.in a letter dated may,this court even went so far as to direct forrestal counsel to respond to the following two questions 
is it your contention that a choice of law analysis must be conducted under new jersey law as the law of the forum state in order to decide whether the contract laws of argentina or the contract laws of new jersey govern here if so,please explain in detail why such an analysis was required and please explain where you raised and preserved this contention below 
is it your contention that the contract law of argentina would provide you with a legal claim even in the absence of a written contract if so,why also please explain where you raised and preserved this contention below 
through its counsel,forrestal eventually submitted a document that i believe is,at best,to our letter and ultimately unhelpful.
i believe that it would be inappropriate for this court to consider these cisg and issues at this juncture.in fact,the complexity and outright novelty of the cisg issue clearly weigh in favor of following our usual approach to arguments and issues.the majority itself notes that it has uncovered almost no case law indicating how we should address the situation in which one state has made an article declaration under the cisg,argentina and the other state has not made an equivalent declaration,the united states.in turn,it further observes that courts in other countries as well as various commentators are divided over how to proceed in such circumstances and that even the supporters of the position ultimately adopted in the majority opinion have not explained their own reasoning in any real detail.we should be especially reluctant to address a totally novel yet important issue of international law where we do not have the benefit of full and proper briefing by the parties.
finally,considering arguendo the merits of these issues which the court should not,i would still have considerable difficulty agreeing with the majority holding that a analysis is required here because such an approach appears to be at odds with the cisg itself.i acknowledge that the majority has clearly given this novel question a great deal of attention and has thoroughly,fairly,and competently explained its own reasoning.however,it still appears that,given the plain language of this international treaty,its structure,and its purposes,a written contract is required where,as here,one of the relevant countries has exercised its right to make an article declaration.in turn,because forrestal has clearly failed to produce the requisite written agreement,its contractual claim must accordingly fail as a matter of law.nevertheless,i reiterate that we should not reach the merits of this complicated issue at this time.
the first word in the appellant name is variably spelled in the record as forestal and forrestal.for the sake of consistency,we adopt the former spelling.
because this is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment,we view the evidence in a light most favorable to forestal,the nonmoving party.see fagan city of vineland,cir en banc.
after this appeal was docketed,daros counsel moved to withdraw from its representation of daros.the clerk of this court granted that motion.daros has not obtained new counsel and has not submitted an appellate brief.its former counsel has indicated that daros rests on its filings with the district court to support its position in this appeal.
