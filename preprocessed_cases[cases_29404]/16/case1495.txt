arete partners,sued rudolf gunnerman for breach of contract and fraud in connection with a settlement agreement entered by the parties.gunnerman appeals from the district court judgment finding in favor of arete on its fraud claim,arguing that the district court erred by misapplying texas law to find that gunnerman had fraudulent intent finding fraudulent intent based on the facts presented finding fraud because there was no evidence of reliance calculating arete damages and awarding exemplary damages.because the facts are insufficient to establish that gunnerman had fraudulent intent,we reverse and remand.
arete originally filed suit against gunnerman for fraud and breach of contract related to a securities sale.the parties signed a contractual settlement before the case reached the jury.a few months later,arete filed an amended complaint,alleging that gunnerman breached the settlement agreement.on the day of trial,the parties once again reached a settlement to resolve arete claims against gunnerman.
the terms of the agreement were read into the district court record by the attorneys for the parties.although the record reflects that there was considerable discussion and confusion as to the terms of that agreement during this process,it can,with persistence,be gleaned from that record that the parties agreed a judgment would be entered in favor of arete against gunnerman for million gunnerman would pay arete in cash gunnerman would transfer shares of unrestricted,fully tradeable sulphco stock into an escrow account at goldman sachs,with instructions to goldman sachs to transfer shares of sulphco stock per month to arete arete would sell no more than shares of sulphco stock per week when arete received a total of million from the sale of stock and the cash payment,arete would execute a release of the judgment and if and when arete realized from the sale of sulphco stock,arete would transfer any remaining stock back to gunnerman.the parties made it clear in the record that any release of the judgment did not end the contractual obligations of the parties.gunnerman was present in court when the agreement was set forth and stated on the record that he understood the settlement and agreed to its terms.
gunnerman timely paid arete in cash however,gunnerman never transferred shares into an escrow account.gunnerman counsel on securities matters informed him that the sale of sulphco shares would trigger certain reporting requirements under the securities and exchange commission rules.while those reporting issues were being resolved,arete agreed to accept a wire transfer payment based on the highest closing price for the week the shares were due to be sold.
gunnerman instructed his contact at goldman sachs to divide shares of sulphco stock into units of shares,in anticipation of having the shares transferred to arete.gunnerman counsel informed arete counsel that they anticipated that the shares would be transferred through physical delivery of the certificates to arete counsel office on a weekly basis and that they were in the process of drafting an escrow agreement to facilitate transfer of the shares.arete objected that gunnerman proposed course of action violated the agreement because the transfer of restricted shares violated the promise of fully tradeable,unrestricted shares,and physical delivery of shares violated the agreement to make a transfer into a goldman sachs escrow account.ultimately,gunnerman made three transfers of shares to arete,resulting in a transfer of shares in total.
after arete had sold shares of the stock,gunnerman offered to buy back the remaining shares that had already been transferred for the highest market price during the week of transfer.arete agreed not to sell the stock if gunnerman wired payment for the stock and also stated that if gunnerman continued to deliver the shares every week,arete would return the certificates to him when it received payment each week.subsequently,arete counsel informed gunnerman counsel that arete had not received stock for the weeks of april or may.arete counsel stated that gunnerman was in material breach of the agreement,and arete would begin the process of executing on its judgment unless gunnerman wired to arete account.a few days later,arete counsel sent an email to gunnerman counsel with the subject got your message i believe that we are still behind one week.i do not believe we got stock for the week of april.send the money everyweek sic for the highest prices will work great.but we need to get the money for week one.gunnerman counsel responded,ok.i spoke with stan to confirm.
as a result of this communication,the district court found that the parties modified their agreement,and neither party disputes that finding on appeal.under the modified agreement,in lieu of stock transfers,gunnerman agreed to wire transfer cash to arete at the end of each week,calculating the amount based on the highest closing price for sulphco stock for that week.although a formal draft of the parties amendment to their settlement agreement was prepared,it was never signed.following the parties agreement,gunnerman made cash payments of varying amounts,although the amounts did not appear to bear any particular relation to an identifiable method of calculating gunnerman obligations to arete.the parties continued to dispute both the timing and the amounts of gunnerman periodic cash payments.
after the payments stopped altogether,arete filed this suit against gunnerman,alleging causes of action for breach of contract and fraud.in response,gunnerman filed a motion to release the million judgment,even though it was undisputed that payments toward satisfaction of that judgment had not reached its full amount.at the time of trial,the total consideration in both cash and stock provided to arete by gunnerman was,which was the sum of the initial cash payment the actual proceeds of the shares of sulphco stock sent to arete by gunnerman and the total of the wire transfer payments made in lieu of gunnerman stock transfer obligations.
in a bench trial,the district court found in favor of arete on its causes of action for breach of contract and fraud.the district court noted that gunnerman had essentially conceded each of the elements of arete claim,and the only dispute on this claim was the proper measure of damages.the district court also found in favor of arete on its fraud claim.the court found that gunnerman never intended to keep two distinct promises to arete gunnerman never intended to permit arete to realize more than million and never intended to perform the agreement to transfer shares.the court concluded that the difference between the amount arete received and what it would have received if gunnerman had performed the modified agreement as promised was.the court found that arete was entitled to this amount as actual damages under both its fraud and causes of action.furthermore,because the district court found that arete damages were the result of fraudulent promises by gunnerman,the district court found that arete was entitled to in exemplary damages in addition to its actual damages.alternatively,the district court found that arete was entitled to actual damages plus attorneys fees under its contract claim.arete was required to make an election between these two alternative measures of recovery before the entry of judgment arete elected recovery based on its fraud claim,and the district court entered judgment.
gunnerman subsequently filed a motion to amend the judgment and the court findings of fact and conclusions of law,arguing that the district court had incorrectly found that gunnerman had fraudulent intent when he entered into the settlement agreement.the district court rejected gunnerman arguments and denied the motion.gunnerman then filed this appeal.
on an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error we will find clear error if the findings are without substantial evidence to support them the court misinterpreted the effect of the evidence or although there is evidence which,if credible,would be substantial,the force and effect of the testimony,considered as a whole,convinces the court that the findings are against the preponderance of credible testimony 
on appeal,gunnerman argues that,in finding fraudulent inducement,the district court incorrectly applied texas law and its factual findings were in clear error.under texas law,a fraud cause of action requires a material misrepresentation,which was false,and which was either known to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth,which was intended to be acted upon,which was relied upon,and which caused injury.a promise to do an act in the future is an actionable misrepresentation when made with the intent to deceive and with no intention of performing the act a party intent is determined at the time the party made the representation however,a party intent may be inferred by the party subsequent acts following the representation failure to perform,standing alone,is no evidence of the promissor intent not to perform when the promise was made.however,that fact is a circumstance to be considered with other facts to establish intent.even slight circumstantial evidence of fraud,when considered with the breach of promise to perform,is sufficient to support a finding of fraudulent intent.the evidence must be relevant to the defendant intent at the time the representation was made courts have held a party denial that he ever made a promise is a factor showing no intent to perform when he made the promise.the supreme court of texas has also noted that u sually,successful claims of fraudulent inducement have involved confessions by the defendant or its agents of the requisite intent.
gunnerman first argues that the district court incorrectly applied texas law to find that gunnerman had the requisite fraudulent intent.gunnerman maintains that the district court committed an error of law by applying the texas supreme court decision in spoljaric percival tours,rather than its decision in miga jensen spoljaric held that a promise to do an act in the future is actionable fraud when made with the intention,design and purpose of deceiving,and with no intention of performing the act.in miga,the texas supreme court concluded that there was no evidence to support the jury finding of fraud and held that a dispute at trial over the contract terms was not evidence that jensen did not intend to perform at the time he entered the contract the court held that this was a classic breach of contract case and that the wronged party had no cause of action for fraud.
gunnerman misapprehends the court decision in miga.miga did not supplant spoljaric instead,miga is an application of the legal principles discussed in spoljaric.the court held in miga that the parties dispute over contractual terms at trial was insufficient evidence that a party did not intend to perform.in other words,the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the test for fraudulent intent as set forth in spoljaric.here,in order for arete to recover under its fraud claim,arete was required to prove that gunnerman entered into the settlement agreement with the intention,design and purpose of deceiving,and with no intention of performing the act.
gunnerman contends that there is no evidence of fraudulent intent.the district court found that t he evidence of record establishes gunnerman never intended to keep two distinct promises to arete that arete would have the opportunity to sell shares of sulphco stock and that arete could achieve a maximum recovery of million as proceeds on the sale of sulphco stock.the district court based its finding of fraudulent intent on two factors gunnerman interpretation of the settlement agreement,and gunnerman pattern of malfeasance.
as a matter of law,the district court held that the parties had agreed that arete would have the opportunity to realize from gunnerman payment of together with the sale of shares of stock.gunnerman testified that his understanding of the agreement differed from the district court.gunnerman stated that although he understood that arete would have the opportunity to realize from the sale of stock if the market price were high enough,he thought that his payment of was to be credited toward his obligation to transfer shares of stock.
the district court found gunnerman interpretation of the parties agreement to be inconsistent and unbelievable and that gunnerman position was entirely fabricated after the fact.the court noted,
when the agreement was originally dictated into the record,there were clearly two separate obligations undertaken by for the payment of cash and one for the transfer of stock.the equivalency issues never appeared until gunnerman refused to transfer the stock to goldman sachs,as required under the original agreement.
the court found that gunnerman never intended to permit arete to realize any more than million and never intended to perform the agreement to transfer shares and that gunnerman used the modification to a transaction to create a colorable basis for his alleged confusion over the total amount of his obligations to arete.in its order denying gunnerman motion to amend the judgment,the court also found that gunnerman interpretation of the parties agreement was so facially meritless and that,for the purposes of ascertaining fraudulent intent,it was the equivalent of a denial that he ever made the agreement with arete.
we note that there was a possibility that arete could have realized a total of under the modified settlement agreement if the market price of the stock for which gunnerman did make payment had been higher.but even if gunnerman testimony as to his understanding of the agreement is at odds with the agreement actual terms,there is insufficient evidence of intent to defraud at the time the agreement was made.
as noted,in miga jensen,the texas supreme court held that a dispute over contract terms at trial was not evidence that the defendant did not intend to perform jensen conduct after miga resignation in and his dispute at trial over the contract terms are not evidence that jensen did not intend to perform when he offered miga the pge option in.this is a classic breach of contract case miga has no cause of action for fraud.in miga,jensen orally granted an option to miga to purchase of jensen interest in a corporation for a specific price about eighteen months later,miga resigned and attempted to exercise the option jensen presented miga with a written agreement that was to be a complete accounting,but it did not explicitly release miga option miga agreed to the terms of the termination agreement,but on the same day,he attempted to exercise the option and jensen refused to perform miga sued for breach of contract and fraud.at trial,jensen contended that the option had been for a scaled price,was subject to a if miga resigned,and was released by the termination agreement the parties reached when miga resigned the jury found against jensen and for miga on all issues,including fraud the supreme court of texas held there was no evidence that jensen did not intend to perform at the time he granted the option that court explicitly rejected the argument that jensen disagreement about the option terms was tantamount to a denial of the option agreement that the jury found he made.
the facts of the present case are indistinguishable from those at issue in miga.although the district court recognized that a good faith difference in interpretation over the meaning of a particular contract provision is not evidence of fraudulent intent,it attempted to distinguish miga based on a finding that gunnerman testimony regarding his understanding of his obligations under the original agreement was knowingly false.the district court reasoned that when a defendant puts forward a,facially meritless interpretation of a contract,the effect of which would be to relieve the defendant of some or all of his obligations under the contract,the interpretation is effectively the same as a denial that an agreement was ever made.this is contrary to texas authorities.to uphold a fraud finding on such a basis would permit a factfinder to find fraud simply by disbelieving that a party interpretation of an agreement was offered in good faith belief of its correctness.in other words,fraud could be based solely on a credibility determination when a witness testified as to his or her understanding of the terms of an agreement.the texas supreme court held otherwise in miga.
the district court conclusion is also contrary to the approach taken by the texas supreme court in formosa plastics.usa presidio engineers contractors,in that case,formosa had represented in a bid package it submitted to presidio and in the construction contract the two parties subsequently signed that presidio would have control over concrete deliveries formosa interpretation of its obligations under the contract in this regard was contrary to the specific and unequivocal terms of the contract and even formosa own witnesses admitted that,under the plain language of the contract,presidio had control over the scheduling and delivery of concrete.however,the court based its determination that there was legally sufficient evidence that formosa made representations with no intention of performing as represented not on this evidence but on direct evidence from a formosa employee that,contrary to the representation in the bid package it submitted to presidio and two weeks before the contract was signed,formosa decided to take over the delivery of the concrete without informing presidio presidio was not informed of this decision until after the contract was signed and a formosa employee testified that formosa acted deceptively by taking over the concrete delivery and scheduling when the bid package expressly provided that the contractor would have control,and that formosa knew that presidio would rely on this representation in preparing its bid.
even though the district court found gunnerman interpretation to be contrary to the plain terms of the agreement,gunnerman interpretation of the agreement,standing alone,is not evidence of fraudulent intent.the district concluded that gunnerman used the modification to a transaction to create a colorable basis for his alleged confusion over the total amount of his obligations to arete.but here again,there is no evidence that at the time the parties agreed to modify their settlement agreement,gunnerman had no intention of performing and intended that arete rely to its detriment on the modified terms.
in its order denying gunnerman motion to amend the findings of fact and the judgment,the district court stated that it also found gunnerman pattern of malfeasance to be persuasive evidence of gunnerman fraudulent intent,pointing to gunnerman alleged breach of an earlier settlement agreement in connection with this litigation.the district court is clearly entitled to assess gunnerman credibility based on gunnerman pattern of malfeasance.however,gunnerman conduct during proceedings and his prior alleged breach of a settlement agreement is not sufficient evidence to show that gunnerman did not intend to perform the settlement agreement at issue here.in a jury trial,generally we would not permit a party to introduce as evidence of fraud in the inducement the history of prior suits and settlements between the parties,discovery skirmishes or possible discovery abuses,or conduct that was displeasing to the trial judge.the same standards apply in a case.although sanctions for conduct during discovery and other proceedings may be warranted in some circumstances,gunnerman conduct is not evidence of fraudulent intent at the time that he reached the original or modified settlement agreement with arete,and imposition of punitive damages for any such conduct is impermissible.
because the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of fraud,we do not reach gunnerman remaining arguments regarding reliance and the proper measure of fraud damages.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse and vacate the district court award of actual and exemplary damages based on arete fraud claim,and we remand to allow arete to elect recovery under its claim.
this appeal challenges the specific finding of fraudulent intent by the district court a finding we review for clear error.in finding fraudulent intent,the district court relied on gunnerman indefensible reading of the contract and his efforts to avoid trial throughout the litigation,which involved tactics intended to delay and frustrate the opposing party and the court,including courthouse settlements he did not intend to honor,all resulting in three scheduled trials and two settlement agreements.seeing this conduct as sufficient evidence of fraudulent intent to support the district court findings that there was no intent to perform the settlement agreement when it was entered,i must dissent,respectfully.
as a preliminary matter,in characterizing the district court opinion as suggesting fraud could be based solely on a credibility determination when a witness testified as to his or her understanding of the terms of an agreement,the majority relies on statements made by the district court in its order denying gunnerman motion to amend findings of fact and motion to amend judgment,an order directed at specific objections to the court findings made by gunnerman.the isolating focus on that language unfairly describes the footing of the district court finding of an intent not to perform when the settlement agreement was signed,and does not fully capture the district court findings that are the subject of this appeal.the district court order also pointed to gunnerman pattern of conduct as the subject of its fourteen pages of findings of fact,a copy of which i attach.
these findings of fact make plain that the district court did not base its finding of fraud solely on the silliness of gunnerman contract interpretation.rather the district court relied on his pattern of conduct throughout the litigation,finding that his truculent ducking and dodging to escape judgment day evidenced an intent from the start not to perform the settlement agreement,which was a central part of his dodge despite its prominence in the district court findings,the history of gunnerman conduct is absent from the majority opinion arete originally sued gunnerman for breach of contract relating to a purchase of stock.the first trial was commenced on october,but before closing arguments the parties reached a settlement.having avoided judgment,gunnerman within days breached the settlement agreement.in february,arete sued gunnerman for the breach.judge sparks promptly set the case for a second jury trial for march.gunnerman responded with delaying tactics,refusing to be deposed and making himself unavailable for the deposition by repairing to south korea where he claimed he became ill and could not return.with the second trial imminent the parties reached another settlement agreement,the one at issue this,just as the first agreement,lived only long enough to avoid trial.this suit followed,alleging breach of contract and fraud.judge sparks set the case for trial for a third time for february,one year after the second setting.however,as the district court found,gunnerman again deployed his delaying tactics,failing to answer interrogatories under oath,failing to present himself for deposition,and breaching express representations he would appear for trial on february,findings unchallenged here.with regards to this last finding,gunnerman claimed through his daughter he was ill,and filed a medical statement the trial court found to be meaningless.
based on this conduct,including inconsistent and unbelievable testimony regarding his understanding of the parties agreement,the district court concluded that gunnerman never intended to fulfill the promises he made in the settlement agreement.
under texas law disagreement over contract interpretation alone is insufficient evidence that performance was never intended while texas courts carefully police the boundaries of contract law lest tort law run it over,it does so with its rule that even slight circumstantial evidence of fraud,when considered with the breach of promise to perform,is sufficient to support a finding of fraudulent intent.the majority goes much further and in doing so upsets this balance of operating spheres for tort and contract law.it does so at the expense of basic legal principles controlling fraudulent conduct gunnerman actions,described by the district court,are sufficient evidence to support the findings of fraud.that this conduct was sanctionable does not mean that it was not also evidence of an intent not to perform an agreement made to escape the judgment day of trial.this veteran district judge,with a lifetime of trial experience,was better equipped to make this judgment than this court.more to the point,a federal district court is not a mere entry gate to the court of appeals.it is an independent court to which we owe a legal duty of deference.we fail that duty today.put simply,that we might have reached a different conclusion in the first instance is of no moment.as i find no error in the judgment of the district court,and certainly not clear error,i respectfully dissent.

findings of fact and conclusions of law 
be it remembered on the day of february,the court called the matter for trial and the parties appeared through counsel.the court had set this case specifically and specially for trial on february,by order entered on december.the history of litigation between these parties is important to understand the following findings of fact.
on september,arete partners,arete filed suit against clean fuels technology,clean fuels and rudolf gunnerman in the district court of travis county,texas,suing both defendants for breach of contract in connection with arete purchase of clean fuels stock under a nations agreement.the case was timely removed to this court on or about october,and assigned cause number.a scheduling order was entered on january.on june,arete filed a second amended complaint alleging defendant gunnerman had not only breached the contract but also had committed fraud.jury selection and trial were scheduled for october.however,prior to jury selection,the parties agreed to the dismissal of clean fuels,and the case proceeded only against rudolf gunnerman.a jury was selected and trial proceeded on october.
after the presentation of the evidence,the preparation of the jury instructions,and before oral argument,the parties announced they had entered into a settlement agreement and requested the court to order a mistrial to allow the parties to effectuate the settlement.however,on february,arete riled its third amended complaint,again alleging defendant gunnerman breached his time the settlement he had failed to pay the agreed sum of million to arete,failed to secure this payment by escrowing one million shares of sulphco sulphco stock,and failed to transfer five hundred thousand shares of sulphco stock to arete.because of the circumstances,a second jury trial was scheduled for march.
in february,gunnerman refused to make himself available for deposition,and the court ordered him to be deposed within ten days of the court order or sanctions would be entered.arete filed a motion for summary judgment,and an extension of time to respond was granted because gunnerman had not been deposed.at that time,gunnerman deliberately made himself unavailable for the deposition by allegedly going to south korea.on february,in open court,counsel for gunnerman represented that gunnerman had become ill in south korea,was hospitalized,and would be unable to travel for weeks.the court then again extended the time to respond to the pending motion for summary judgment,but refused to continue the trial setting.
the second trial was to begin on march,and with a jury panel available,again the parties,through counsel,advised a settlement had been reached.this time the settlement agreement was dictated into the record and was clear and unambiguous.first,a judgment would be entered in favor of arete against gunnerman for million.second,a collateral agreement required gunnerman to pay arete the sum of cash on or before april.third,gunnerman was contractually obligated to transfer,by april,shares of unrestricted,fully tradeable sulphco stock into an escrow account at goldman sachs with instructions to goldman sachs to transfer shares of sulphco stock per month to arete.arete agreed to sell no more than shares of sulphco stock per week,and under this procedure,when and if arete realized from the sale of sulphco stock,any remaining stock would be transferred back to gunnerman.therefore,with the cash payment of the and possible recovery of from the sale of sulphco stock,arete could realize a maximum of million as a result of the settlement contract.the parties further agreed that when arete had received a total of million from all sale of the stock,the cash payment,and any other would execute a release of the march,judgment.the parties made it clear in the record any release of the judgment did not end the contractual obligations of the parties.gunnerman was in court and stated in the record he understood the settlement and agreed to the terms.thereafter,the jury panel was released and the judgment entered.
on october,arete partners,fried the instant suit in cause number against gunnerman for breach of contract and fraud,alleging specifically that gunnerman,again,deliberately failed to transfer the sulphco stock into the escrow account deliberately failed to deliver shares of sulphco stock per week to arete and moreover,never intended to comply with the contractual obligations he made to avoid trial number two on march.arete sued for contractual damages,alternately for fraud,and sought actual and punitive damages.
gunnerman then filed a motion to declare the judgment of march,in cause number,released when the undisputed evidence was all payments of every nature made by gunnerman to arete had not reached the million judgment amount.that motion was denied on december.
under those circumstances,trial in was immediately set for february.gunnerman continued in his delaying tactical manner by declining to answer interrogatories under oath,failing to present himself for deposition,and importantly,breaching express representations he would appear for trial on february.on the date set for trial,gunnerman lawyer advised he had been informed by gunnerman daughter that gunnerman was feeling ill and had been admitted to a hospital and was unable to attend the trial.a meaningless medical statement was produced and filed of record,but counsel for gunnerman indicated that,if he could supplement the record with gunnerman deposition to be taken at a later date,he would not file any motion for continuance.this procedure was agreed to by counsel for arete and the trial proceeded.plaintiff filed a trial brief along with a copy of gunnerman deposition on march,and briefing was completed on april.
based on the testimony and documentary evidence presented at the trial,along with gunnerman deposition testimony,the court makes the following factual findings.first,the parties original settlement agreement was clearly dictated into the record on march,and its terms can not reasonably be disputed.arete,for its part,was required to surrender its right to recover any more than million on the judgment itself in the original lawsuit.gunnerman,on the other hand,was obligated to perform two independent obligations.first,the agreement required gunnerman to make a cash payment of.independently,gunnerman was required to transfer to goldman sachs shares of unrestricted,fully tradeable sulphco stock for arete benefit.although there was a limit on the total amount arete could recover through the sale of the stock million for a grand total recovery of million after accounting for the cash payment the parties made clear that arete recovery of million would have no effect on gunnerman contractual obligations.rather,the only impact of arete realizing million would be the release of the agreed judgment.
although gunnerman made a timely payment of on march,almost immediately thereafter,it became clear he would not follow the terms of the parties original settlement agreement.initially,gunnerman alleges he was advised by his corporate counsel that because of certain sec rules,arete sale of sulphco shares would trigger certain complicated reporting requirements.while those reporting issues were being worked out,on april,gunnerman counsel sought permission for gunnerman to make a cash payment that would be equivalent to the sale of the shares of stock arete would have been permitted to sell for the week of april,ex.gunnerman counsel offered to base the cash payment on either the average closing price or the highest closing price for the week.id.counsel for arete responded that arete would accept a wire transfer payment based on the highest closing price for the week made by on the friday the week the shares were due to be sold.id.
april,came and went,and no shares of sulphco stock were escrowed.the following day,gunnerman counsel informed arete that he was preparing an escrow agreement and would begin making physical delivery of restricted shares to arete in the near future.ex.arete objected that gunnerman proposed course of action violated the agreement because the transfer of restricted shares violated the promise of fully tradeable,unrestricted shares and physical delivery of shares violated the agreement to make a transfer into a goldman sachs escrow account,which was intended to facilitate an efficient transfer.during the week of april,no escrow was made,no shares were transferred,and no cash wire transfer payment was made in lieu thereof.
on monday,april,gunnerman sent shares of stock via federal express to arete.two more deliveries of shares were made on april,and may.during this time,gunnerman offered to buy arete out of the agreement for the difference between the amounts arete had already received and million.arete declined gunnerman offer.
on may,counsel for arete wrote an email offering gunnerman an alternative to complying with the terms of the original agreement.he wrote 
i believe that we are still behind one week.i do not believe we got stock for the week of april.send the money everyweek sic for the highest prices will work great.but we need to get the money for week one.
ex.counsel for gunnerman responded ok.i spoke with stan to confirm.id.on june,gunnerman transferred to arete.according to gunnerman counsel,this amount was based on a theoretical sale of shares of sulphco stock at the highest closing prices during two different weeks in may.a formal draft of the parties amendment to their settlement agreement was prepared but was never signed.gunnerman continued to make cash payments of varying amounts through december of,none of which appeared to bear any particular relation to an identifiable method of calculating his accruing obligations to arete.
the parties agree that the total consideration in both cash and stock provided to arete by gunnerman was.this amount represents the initial cash payment on march,the actual proceeds of the shares of sulphco stock sent to arete by gunnerman and the total of the wire transfer payments made in lieu of gunnerman stock transfer obligations under the parties modified agreement.no stock or cash has been paid to arete since december.
arete asserts causes of action for breach of contract and fraud.to prove its cause of action for breach of contract,arete must establish the existence of a valid contract that it performed or tendered performance that gunnerman breached the contract and that it suffered damages as a result of gunnerman breach.hussong schwan sales,dist,no writ.arete also seeks recovery from gunnerman under a fraud theory.a promise to do an act in the future is actionable fraud when made with the intention,design and purpose of deceiving,and with no intention of performing the act.spoljaric percival tours.courts have held a party denial that he ever made a promise is a factor showing no intent to perform when he made the promise.id.at.
in his brief,gunnerman essentially concedes the presence of each of the elements of arete contract claim.his only dispute is over the proper measure of damages.in gunnerman view,the only damages to which arete is entitled is the difference between the value of the cash and stock he has already tendered to arete and million.in other words,gunnerman believes arete recovery should be limited.however,gunnerman theory that he owes no more than is entirely unsupportable based on the terms of the parties original agreement as well as the terms of the modified agreement,the latter of which replaced stock transfers with cash payments that were based on the equivalent of weekly sales of shares of stock at the highest closing price for each week 
at his deposition,gunnerman gave testimony regarding his understanding of the parties agreement that was both inconsistent and unbelievable.gunnerman position was the cash payment was to be included as a part of his obligation to make a transfer of shares.ex.at.while he insisted that arete could have gotten up to million had the stock been higher in price,he also stated that he did not agree that arete would have the opportunity to collect plus from the sale of stock.id.
gunnerman admitted he always intended to get credit on the shares of stock for the payment he made up front,id.at.this despite the fact that such a credit would have made absolutely no sense in the context of the original agreement.when the agreement was originally dictated into the record on march,there were clearly two separate obligations undertaken by for the payment of cash and one for the transfer of stock.the equivalency issues never appeared until gunnerman refused to transfer the stock to goldman sachs,as required under the original agreement.
the court finds gunnerman position that he always understood the payment could offset his obligation to transfer the shares was entirely fabricated after the fact.furthermore,the court finds that gunnerman initial requests to convert the agreement from a transaction to a transaction were part of the fraud he was attempting to perpetrate on arete and on this court.specifically,gunnerman used the modification to create a colorable basis for his alleged confusion over the total amount of his obligations to arete.that is,once he had induced arete to agree to accept cash in lieu of the required shares of stock,he would then,and only then,be able to claim with a straight face that the cash payment required by the agreement at the outset could be applied to his stock transfer obligations.the court expressly finds gunnerman never intended to permit arete to realize any more than million and never intended to perform the agreement to transfer shares.the evidence of record establishes gunnerman never intended to keep two distinct promises to arete that arete would have the opportunity to sell shares of sulphco stock and that arete could achieve a maximum recovery of million as proceeds on the sale of sulphco stock.indeed,it appears to the court that gunnerman is allergic to the truth.
under either a contract theory or a fraud theory,arete damages are properly measured under a calculus.see sava gumarska in kemijska industria advanced polymer sciences,no pet.the normal measure of damages in a breach of contract case is the measure.green allied interests,pet.denied texas law clearly recognizes damages for common law fraud.the measure of damages requires the court to look at the difference in value between what arete was promised and what it actually received.
arete has offered several different methods for calculating its damages,some of which are based on the prevailing price of sulphco stock on december,the date on which arete contends gunnerman decided to stop paying arete.pl.trial br.at.however,any method of calculating damages that presumes gunnerman obligations to transfer actual stock were still in place after may would clearly be improper since,as arete has shown,the parties agreed to an alternative arrangement whereby gunnerman was ultimately permitted to transfer cash in lieu of actual stock.instead,a proper analysis requires the court to begin by hypothesizing what would have happened had gunnerman performed his obli
