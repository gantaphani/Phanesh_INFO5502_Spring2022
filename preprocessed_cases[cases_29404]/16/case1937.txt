we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
before he was terminated in august,hamilton had worked for ge in louisville,kentucky over the course of three decades.he began working for ge in,and except for a few periods when he was laid off for reasons,hamilton held a variety of positions with ge.prior to,hamilton disciplinary record was relatively clean he was disciplined only three times,twice because of conflicts with coworkers and once for having beers in his car in,the relationship between ge and hamilton began to sour,and the series of events leading to this appeal ensued.
on june,frank whitehouse whitehouse,manager of plant relations for ge,waited by the front gate of the plant looking for hamilton.whitehouse asserts that he was waiting for hamilton because,recently,ge managers had been unable to locate hamilton when he was supposed to be working.at whitehouse aff.at.hamilton asserts that whitehouse decision to wait for hamilton was the beginning of whitehouse campaign to get jarrett hamilton.hamilton br.at.when hamilton appeared at the gate,whitehouse confronted him and asked him to explain his absence.hamilton stated that he had been on his lunch break.at whitehouse aff.at.however,after examining hamilton time card,whitehouse determined that hamilton had been gone for more than minutes,and,as a result of this violation of ge policy,ge suspended hamilton for a month id.
when hamilton returned to work on july,another incident arose.hamilton asserts that when he got to work,he asked his supervisor to honor his medical restrictions.at hamilton dep.at.hamilton states that when he did this,his supervisor suddenly started yelling at him and called for the guards to remove hamilton.id.hamilton says that he left the building rather than be removed by the guards and that later,when he sought help at the union hall he learned that ge had terminated him.at hamilton dep.at.ge alleges that hamilton was terminated in july because he was insubordinate and refused to follow the direction of his supervisor.at human resources manager michael luvisi aff.at.
after this termination,the union intervened,and hamilton,ge,and the union signed a last chance agreement lca on august.at lca.this lca gave hamilton his job back in exchange for his agreement that he would comply with all of ge rules and that if he violated any,he would be subject to immediate termination.id.hamilton also agreed that if,in the future,ge terminated him for violating the lca,any grievance filed protesting the discharge will not be subject to arbitration and that no legal action respecting said discharge will be filed.id.the lca was to be in effect for two years.id.
for almost a year following the lca,hamilton continued to work for ge without incident.on may,hamilton voluntarily came in to work on kentucky oaks day,an informal holiday for many ge workers.hamilton asserts that he volunteered to work only because he was told that he would be sanding doors and would not be required to work on the line.at hamilton dep.at.ge asserts that hamilton knew that he could be assigned to work anywhere within one of its plant buildings that day.at operations leader terry bale aff.at.during the work day,a supervisor told hamilton to take his lunch early and then to go work on the line.at,bale aff.at hamilton dep.at.from this point on,hamilton and ge accounts of the incident differ.hamilton states that because he felt that he was not required to comply with either of these orders,he asked to see a union steward.at hamilton dep.at.hamilton explains that his supervisor then started yelling at him,so he went to the line and began to work.id.hamilton asserts that while he was working on the line,his supervisor called the guards and had them escort hamilton out of the building.id.
the supervisor involved in the incident,terry bale bale,explains that after he told hamilton to work on the line,hamilton asked for a union representative.at bale aff.at.bale states that he offered to go find a union representative but that he ordered hamilton to work on the line in the interim.id.according to bale,hamilton continued to refuse to work and walked away from bale,so bale called the guards and had hamilton removed from the plant.id.when hamilton returned to work the next monday he learned that he had been terminated.hamilton br.at.the union intervened again,and hamilton was reinstated but given a suspension.id.on may,while serving this suspension,hamilton filed an charge against ge with the eeoc.
hamilton testified that when he returned to ge in june of,after filing his eeoc complaint,his supervisors greatly intensified their scrutiny of his work and harassed him more than they ever had before.at hamilton dep.at hamilton br.at.in the months between hamilton return and his final termination,the relationship between ge and hamilton continued to be strained.on july,hamilton and his union representative met with donald blair blair to discuss what ge considered to be ongoing deficiencies in hamilton job performance.at blair aff.at at blair memo.ge conceives of this meeting as having provided hamilton with a reprieve from the lca.ge br.at.hamilton insists that during this time,ge was scrutinizing his behavior in an effort to create reasons to discipline him.hamilton br.at.during this period,hamilton overheard bale and another supervisor discussing and making light of hamilton eeoc complaint.at hamilton dep.at.
the final event that led to this lawsuit occurred on august,when the line that hamilton was working on broke down,leaving hamilton with no work.the parties agree that when this happened,hamilton went to the lunchroom to eat his lunch.hamilton br.at ge br.at.the events that followed are highly contested.according to hamilton,after he had put his food in the microwave,blair told him to move some skids.at hamilton dep.at.hamilton says that he agreed to do the work,but that seconds later,while he was still putting his food away,blair and bale came back into the lunchroom and told him to gather his belongings and leave the plant immediately.id.hamilton asserts that he left the plant quietly and without swearing or throwing things.at hamilton dep.at.according to bale and blair,after the assembly line broke down,they found hamilton in the lunchroom and asked him to move the skids.at,bale aff.at,blair aff.at.bale and blair assert that after a few minutes had passed,they returned to the lunchroom and found hamilton there,continuing to prepare his food.id.both bale and blair state that after bale suspended hamilton and as they were escorting him out of the plant,hamilton swore at them and threw his badge down rather than handing it to either man.id.
this incident led to hamilton termination,and on august,ge sent hamilton a letter reading as follows 
your employment with ge is being terminated as a result of your unacceptable conduct and behavior in the workplace.despite repeated verbal and written warnings,you have failed to abide by the appliance park rules of conduct and ge policies subsequent to the lca you engaged in additional unacceptable conduct on more than one occasion.you refused specific work directions from your supervisor,and used unacceptable foul and abusive language.
at whitehouse ltr.to hamilton.
on december,hamilton filed suit against ge in state court,claiming that ge had violated the kentucky civil rights act kcra by terminating him in retaliation for having filed an eeoc complaint.see.ann.on december,ge filed a notice of removal to the district court based on diversity jurisdiction.see a.after discovery,ge moved for summary judgment and argued that,by signing the lca,hamilton had waived his right to bring this action and that his termination was the result of ongoing behavior problems which had begun before he filed his eeoc complaint.
on november,the district court issued an opinion granting ge motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the lca did not bar hamilton suit.the district court granted ge motion for summary judgment because it found that hamilton could not establish a prima facie case of retaliatory firing because he could not show that his eeoc complaint caused his termination.the district court also noted that even if hamilton could establish a prima facie case,hamilton could not show that ge proffered reason for firing him,ongoing behavior problems,was pretextual.
on appeal,hamilton argues that he provided enough evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory termination.hamilton states that the evidence he presented of temporal proximity between his eeoc complaint and his termination accompanied by the fact that his bosses belittled his complaint and heightened their supervision of him after he filed his eeoc complaint was sufficient to establish a causal connection between his eeoc complaint and his termination.hamilton also asserts that he made a sufficient showing of pretext by disputing the factual basis for the discharge and showing that it was contrived to fire him.hamilton br.at.in response,ge argues that the district court correctly concluded that hamilton failed to prove retaliation.ge also asserts that the district court erred in its conclusion that the lca does not bar this action and urges us to conclude that hamilton has waived his right to bring this suit.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.blair henry filters,cir.summary judgment should be granted only when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when we review a motion for summary judgment,we must view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
waiver based on the lca 
on appeal,ge argues that by signing the lca,hamilton waived his right to proceed to court should ge in the future and during the term of the lca determine that he had violated the lca and terminate his employment.ge br.at.we agree with the district court conclusion that the lca does not bar this action.
we have held that i t is the general rule in this circuit that an employee may not prospectively waive his or her rights under title vii.adams philip morris,cir.we further explained that 
an employer can not purchase a license to discriminate.an employment agreement that attempts to settle prospective claims of discrimination for job applicants or current employees may violate public policy unless there were continuing or future effects of past discrimination,or unless the parties contemplated an unequivocal,complete and final dissolution.
id.at citation and footnote omitted though hamilton does not bring any title vii claims and instead sues under the kcra,we have held that t he language of the kcra generally tracks the language of title vii and,thus,should be interpreted consonant with federal interpretation.morris oldham county fiscal,cir quoting meyers chapman printing.
ge asserts that kentucky law permits waivers of statutory claims.however,the two cases that ge cites to support this assertion concern agreements to settle existing claims based on an identified violation rather than waivers of prospective claims based on possible future violations.in frear industries,the plaintiffs brought suit to recover for injuries that they suffered when a certain pesticide was sprayed on their house.the agreement that the kentucky supreme court enforced was a settlement agreement in which the plaintiffs agreed to waive all claims against the defendant relating to the specific incident that had occasioned the plaintiffs suit.id.at.in american general life accident insurance hall,the plaintiff filed suit alleging that her boss had sexually harassed her.the plaintiff also sought and received workers compensation benefits based on her assertion that she suffered from psychological problems as a result of this sexual harassment.id.the kentucky supreme court held that because the plaintiff chose to seek workers compensation benefits,she had waived her ability to sue based on the same conduct of the employer.id.at.
both of the cases ge cites hold that when an individual is faced with a known violation,he or she may be able to waive his or her ability to pursue further legal action relating to that past violation.neither case,however,stands for the proposition that,under kentucky law,an employee can prospectively waive statutory claims relating to potential future violations.hamilton signed the lca nearly a year before he was terminated,and the lca does not represent his choice to forego future remedies based on ge future statutory violations.accordingly,because kentucky law does not dictate the contrary result,we conclude that hamilton lca does not bar him from pursuing this legal action.
retaliatory termination 
hamilton kcra claim that he was terminated in retaliation for filing an eeoc claim is evaluated using the same standard that we apply to federal title vii claims.see ford gen l motors,cir.when based on circumstantial evidence,this claim is evaluated using the analysis described by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see also abbott crown motor,cir ford,at.the burden first falls on hamilton who must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that he engaged in protected activity,the employer knew of the exercise of the protected right,an adverse employment action was subsequently taken against the employee,and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.niswander cincinnati ins,cir.once hamilton has made out a prima facie case,the burden shifts to ge to produce evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.id.if ge meets this burden,hamilton bears the burden of demonstrating that this legitimate reason is pretextual.id.
causal nexus 
the first three parts of the prima facie case are undisputed on appeal hamilton has established that he filed an eeoc complaint alleging age discrimination,ge knew about the complaint,and ge terminated his employment.ge contends,and the district court agreed,that hamilton can not establish any causal connection between his termination and his filing an eeoc charge.ge br.at.we can not agree.
in analyzing causation,the district court stated that u nder sixth circuit precedent,temporal proximity is not enough to satisfy the causation element of plaintiff prima facie case.at dist.op.at.we have recognized,however,that in some cases temporal proximity may be sufficient to establish causation.mickey zeidler tool die,cir.in mickey,we held that w here an adverse employment action occurs very close in time after an employer learns of a protected activity,such temporal proximity between the events is significant enough to constitute evidence of a causal connection for the purposes of satisfying a prima facie case of retaliation.id.at.hamilton case,however,does not rest on temporal proximity alone.instead,hamilton alleges that his bosses heightened their scrutiny of him after he filed his eeoc complaint.see jones potter,cir noting that an employer can not conceal an unlawful discharge by closely observing an employee and waiting for an ostensibly legal basis for discharge to emerge.on a motion for summary judgment,we view the facts in the light most favorable to hamilton,and he has testified in his deposition that ge increased its scrutiny of him after he filed his eeoc complaint.the combination of this increased scrutiny with the temporal proximity of his termination occurring less than three months after his eeoc filing is sufficient to establish the causal nexus needed to establish a prima facie case.
the district court minimized the importance of the scrutiny that hamilton alleges because the district court found that from the time of the lca on,ge understandably supervised hamilton work carefully.hamilton does not argue that his work had not been scrutinized before,but he states that the level of scrutiny increased greatly after he filed the eeoc complaint.the fact that the scrutiny increased is critical.the district court also emphasized hamilton prior disciplinary history.though this case includes information about the relationship between hamilton and ge,we must decide what made ge fire hamilton when it did.ge did not terminate hamilton until after he filed an eeoc complaint alleging age discrimination.we hold that this temporal proximity of less than three months combined with the assertion that ge increased its scrutiny of hamilton work only after the eeoc complaint was filed are sufficient to establish the causation element of a prima facie case of retaliatory termination.
ge asserts that after hamilton filed his eeoc complaint in may,ge had cause to fire him in june,but it chose not to,instead warning him and letting him continue working until his termination in august.ge argues that because it did not fire hamilton at the first opportunity that arose after he filed his eeoc complaint,the choice to fire him must not have been retaliatory.ge asserts that its favorable treatment,its decision to give hamilton another chance dissolves any inference of retaliatory motive on the part of ge.ge br.at.were we to adopt ge position,any employer could insulate itself from a charge of retaliatory termination by staging an incident to display its purported favorable treatment and then waiting for a second opportunity to terminate the employee.accordingly,we refuse to adopt ge argument,and we hold that an employer intervening favorable treatment does not insulate that employer from liability for retaliatory termination.
because we conclude that hamilton has established a prima facie case of retaliation,we consider whether ge has satisfied its burden of producing a legitimate nonretaliatory reason for terminating hamilton.ge argues that it terminated hamilton because of his persistent failure to abide by ge rules of conduct and the lca.ge br.at.assuming that this explanation constitutes a valid reason for termination,we next turn to the question of whether hamilton has sufficiently established that this proffered reason is pretextual.we hold that hamilton has made a sufficient showing of pretext and that summary judgment is not proper.
we have held that when an employer waits for a legal,legitimate reason to fortuitously materialize,and then uses it to cover up his true,longstanding motivations for firing the employee,the employer actions constitute the very definition of pretext.jones,at.hamilton has sufficiently alleged that this is exactly what happened to him ge increased its surveillance of his work after he filed an complaint with the eeoc and then ge waited for an opportunity to fire him.in addition to asserting that ge watched and waited for him to make a mistake,hamilton contests the factual basis for his termination.hamilton supervisors at ge suggest that they gave him minutes to put his lunch away before they returned to the lunchroom and fired him for refusing to follow orders.they also assert that when they returned to the lunchroom,hamilton used profanity as they escorted him out.hamilton contests these facts and states that he was preparing to return to work as requested but that only seconds passed before his supervisors returned to the lunchroom and fired him.he also denies using profanity.when we view these facts in the light most favorable to hamilton,it is clear that there is a genuine issue of material fact.based on the facts hamilton alleges,a reasonable could determine that ge waited for,and ultimately contrived,a reason to terminate hamilton to cloak its true,retaliatory motive for firing him.
ge asserts that hamilton subjective skepticism regarding the truth of ge proffered reason does not raise a triable issue as to pretext and cites mitchell toledo hospital,cir,in support of this proposition.ge br.at.ge reliance on this case is misplaced.in mitchell,the plaintiff was terminated for misuse of hospital property.id.at.the plaintiff admitted all of the conduct underlying this termination but contended that her conduct did not constitute misuse of hospital property.id.at.this court noted that plaintiff did only two things to rebut this proffered neutral reason for her termination she testified that she had heard that some other employees had done something allegedly similar but had not been fired,and she denied that her actions on december,constituted misuse of hospital property.id.at.this court determined that the plaintiff denial of the defendant articulated legitimate reason without producing substantiation for the denial is insufficient for a race discrimination claim to withstand a motion for summary judgment.id.at.hamilton has done much more than deny ge reason for firing him he contests the facts underlying the incident that led to his termination and he alleges that after he filed his eeoc complaint ge heightened its supervision of him in an attempt to find a seemingly legitimate reason to fire him.the plaintiff in mitchell made no such showings.
further,the holding in mitchell must be read in light of the supreme court subsequent holding in reeves sanderson plumbing products,d.in reeves,the supreme court explained the standard that a court must apply when it is reviewing a motion for judgment as a matter of law or a motion for summary judgment 
in doing so,however,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.thus,although the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.that is,the court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.
id.at.citations omitted quoting anderson liberty lobby,d charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure at ed.this reaffirmation of the familiar standard for review of a grant of summary judgment reinforces the fact that mitchell can not apply to cases,such as this one,in which the nonmoving party contests material facts.see matsushita indus,at.unlike the plaintiff in mitchell,hamilton has contested the facts underlying his termination and has alleged a question of material fact sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.
accordingly,we hold that hamilton has met his burden of raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding ge motivation for terminating him.because we also conclude that hamilton has sufficiently alleged a causal connection between his termination and his eeoc complaint,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to ge.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons discussed above,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent.i agree with the opinion of the district court and would affirm.
first,in this diversity of citizenship case governed by kentucky state law,i agree with the district court and the majority that the waiver signed by hamilton as part of his last chance agreement was ineffective to bar this prospective civil rights retaliation claim.
however,i respectfully dissent from the majority holdings that under kentucky law,the district court erred in ruling that hamilton failed to sustain his burdens of demonstrating the causal connection element of his prima facie case and establishing that defendant legitimate reasons for discharge were pretextual.
the events of august,which resulted in hamilton termination,are consistent with and are further illuminated by hamilton and undisputed pattern of defiance at general electric company ge.in my view,his terminati
