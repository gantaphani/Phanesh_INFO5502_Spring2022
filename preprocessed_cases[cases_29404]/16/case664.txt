background 
the,scholz design,scholz,alleges that three architectural drawings of homes it designed in the late were copied and posted on various websites by the defendants in violation of scholz copyrights.the plaintiff also makes related claims for breach of contract and violations of the digital millennium copyright act,et.
scholz created technical drawings,or blueprints,for three homes which it called the springvalley a,wethersfield b,and breckinridge a and submitted them to the copyright office in and together with the front elevation drawings that are the subject of this suit,each showing the appearance of the front of the houses surrounded by lawn,bushes,and trees.see scholz design,sard custom homes,llc,joint appendix at,cir,scholz was granted registration of copyrights based on all these submissions.
in february,scholz and sard custom homes sard entered into an agreement the builder agreement i permitting sard to construct homes using scholz home plans,including these three designs.see builder agreement i at.the contract required sard to pay scholz per square foot of each home constructed using its plans,up to a maximum of a year.id.at.scholz and sard renewed the contract for another term in the builder agreement ii.builder agreement ii at.both agreements required that sard not copy or duplicate any of the scholz materials nor use them in any manner to advertise or build a scholz design or derivative except under the terms and conditions of the agreement.builder agreement i at builder agreement ii at.
scholz alleges that,after the termination of scholz agreement with sard and in a manner not permitted by the agreement,sard and prudential connecticut realty prudential posted copies of scholz copyrighted drawings of the springvalley and wethersfield homes on two different websites to advertise sard ability to build the homes.am.compl.scholz also alleges that sard and coldwell banker residential real estate,coldwell banker copied scholz copyrighted image of the breckinridge design on coldwell banker website for the same unpermitted purpose.scholz further alleges that sard,prudential,and coldwell banker may have used,reproduced,displayed,distributed,marketed or advertised those designs through other means in addition to the websites identified.am.compl.
in october,scholz brought suit against the three defendants in the united states district court for the district of connecticut.the february,amended complaint alleges two counts of copyright infringement,two violations of the lanham act,et,breach of contract,and violations of the digital millennium copyright act dmca,et.am.compl.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing inter alia that the pictures could not have been copyrighted as architectural works because,the copyrights having been granted in and,they predate the architectural works copyright protection act awcpa,tit.vii and that the conceptual nature of these depictions means that they are not protected by scholz copyright because they contain insufficient detail from which a building could be constructed.scholz design,sard custom homes,llc,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.july.the district court janet bond arterton,judge agreed.the court,in its ruling on motions to dismiss,reasoned that copyright protection extends to the component images of architectural designs to the extent that those images allow a copier to construct the protected design,and therefore the copied images do not fulfill the intrinsic function of an architectural plan and thus the act of copying them does not violate any right protected by a copyright for architectural technical drawings.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
because it concluded that the plaintiff amended complaint did not state a claim for copyright infringement,the district court also granted defendants motion to dismiss claims alleging violations of the dmca and breach of contract,which,in the district court view,required that the plaintiff have a valid copyright infringement claim id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the plaintiff appeals.

ii.copyright infringement 
in order to demonstrate copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show ownership of a valid copyright and copying of the protectable elements of the copyrighted work see medforms,healthcare mgmt.solutions,cir.a certificate of copyright registration is prima facie evidence of ownership of a valid copyright,but the alleged infringer may rebut that presumption.mywebgrocer,llc hometown info,cir citing c.to qualify for copyright protection,a work must be original that is,it must be independently created by the author and possess at least some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.the work need not be particularly novel or unusual.mattel,goldberger doll,cir.t he requisite level of creativity is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily,as they possess some creative spark,no matter how crude,humble or obvious it might be.feist,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants principal argument,with which the district court agreed,was that the allegedly infringed drawings were not entitled to copyright protection because they lacked sufficient detail to allow for construction of the homes depicted.we disagree.copyright protection of a pictorial work,whether depicting a house,or a flower,or a donkey,or an abstract design,does not depend on any degree of detail.the rights scholz claims in this suit derive from the general copyright law and not from the awcpa,which has no relevance to the suit.
copyright for pictorial works 
scholz copyright allegations are straightforward it created three separate original drawings depicting homes,registered them with the copyright office,and the defendants without authorization made exact copies of those drawings on their websites.nothing more is required for a copyright claim.
the district court apparently was of the view that,because the drawings were architectural,something more was required for their copyright protection.it is law,however,that courts accept as protected any work which by the most generous standard may arguably be said to evince creativity.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright.justice holmes explained more than a century ago that i t would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves the final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations.bleistein donaldson lithographing.as noted above,the only requirement for copyrightability of a work is that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity no matter how crude,humble or obvious it might be.feist,at.
while we have not had occasion to consider a case presenting precisely the same issue as does this one we have said in affirming summary judgment for the defendants based on alleged copying of certain conceptual elements of an architectural sketch that,although the copying of ideas at issue there did not constitute infringement,we do not mean to suggest that,in the domain of copyrighted architectural depictions,only final construction drawings can contain protected expression.attia soc.of,cir.
we see no reason why scholz drawings depicting the appearance of houses it had designed should be treated differently from any other pictorial work for copyright purposes.andrew wyeth and edward hopper were famous for their paintings of houses,and claude monet for paintings of the houses of parliament and of rouen cathedral.none of these depictions of buildings were sufficiently detailed to guide construction of the buildings depicted,but that would surely not justify denying them copyright protection.if an exact copy of scholz drawings was made by the defendant,as alleged,and as appears to be the case based on the evidence submitted with the complaint,that would appear to constitute infringement.
copyright registration 
the defendants argue that scholz pictorial representations of the houses are not entitled to copyright protection because its certificates of registration referred to architectural technical drawings as the nature of authorship,and in the nature of work sections referred to blueprints.see,certificate of copyright at.this was significant,according to the defendants,because regulations promulgated under the awcpa,governing the copyright extended to buildings based on copyrighted architectural plans,provide that w here dual copyright claims exist in technical drawings and the architectural work depicted in the drawings,any claims with respect to the technical drawings and architectural work must be registered separately.c.
scholz registration of the subject drawings under section a occurred prior to passage of the awcpa.scholz accordingly was not seeking,and did not receive,registration under that later expansion of the copyright law.its registration of its drawings did not become invalid as the result of the subsequent passage of the awcpa.that later expansion of the copyright law is not involved in this suit.
c.the architectural works copyright protection act 
we think that the district court ruling likely stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the relationship both before and after enactment of the awcpa between the scope of protection for pictorial works such as these drawings under the copyright act,and that afforded architectural works under the copyright act.
while we think this to be a straightforward case of infringement,the district court did not.the defendants contended,and the district court agreed,that because the drawings at issue were architectural drawings,something more was required of them for copyright protection than would be required for any other pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work under section a.indeed,architectural works are currently afforded special status under the law.that special status is,however,irrelevant for purposes of this case because scholz is not alleging infringement under the awcpa,but under the protection of the copyright act for pictorial works.the fact that scholz drawings might or might not be protected under the awcpa,depending on various factors,does not deprive them of the protection they have as pictorial works regardless of those factors.
prior to the enactment of the awcpa,while architectural structures themselves did not receive copyright protection,architectural plans,blueprints,and technical drawings,as well as original,creative sketches of the type at issue here,were indeed covered under the copyright act protection of pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works.a 
scholz contends that the drawings are protected under section a,and not under section,which,as part of the awcpa,added protection for architectural works.according to scholz,the awcpa is therefore inapplicable.we agree.the awcpa did not affect the copyright protection that section a has long extended to architectural plans,drawings,and blueprints.
historically,copyright law provided limited protection to works of architecture.architectural plans,while not explicitly mentioned in the copyright act of,were covered under a provision affording protection to pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works.but architectural structures themselves were afforded virtually no protection.
after the awcpa,the holder of a copyright in an architectural plan has two forms of protection,one under the provision for an architectural work under a,and another under the provision for a pictorial,graphical,or sculptural work under a.
t peg.timber works,cir citations omitted see also oravec sunny isles luxury ventures,cir t he scope of copyright protection for architectural plans registered under a was unaffected by the awcpa,reprinted in.protection for architectural plans,drawings,and models as pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works under section a is unaffected by this bill the bill intention is to keep the copyright in the architectural work and the copyright in plans and drawings separate.an individual creating an architectural work by depicting that work in plans or drawing will have two separate copyrights,one in the architectural work section a,the other in the plans or drawings section a.
thus,prior to passage of the awcpa courts had held that use of copyrighted architectural plans to construct a building would not constitute infringement,but then as now,copying those plans would.see med.care,espiritu,d,explaining that prior to the passage of the awcpa most courts agree d that copying a structure depicted in plans,without copying the plans themselves,was not copyright infringement,but that an unauthorized copy of an architectural plan infringes on a technical drawing copyright see also imperial homes lamont,cir copyrighted architectural plans do not confer exclusive right to reproduce the depicted building med.care,d at a n structure or feature can not be an infringing copy of a technical drawing.the district court summarized this case law correctly when it explained that t he rule which emerges from the cases is that one may construct a house which is identical to a house depicted in copyrighted architectural plans,but one may not directly copy those plans and then use the infringing copy to construct the house.scholz design,wl,at,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.as a commentator recently explained 
even though our copyright statutes were silent about architecture until,it was well established that plans,blueprints and models were copyrightable writings under the act category of drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character,and then as pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works under the act.the scope of an architect copyright protection was,however,quite limited.the unauthorized copying of plans or blueprints constituted infringement,but most authorities concluded that plans were not infringed by using them,without the architect permission,to construct the building they depicted.moreover,the prevailing view was that an architect rights did not extend to the actual building derived from his or her plans.a building,as a useful article,could be protected by copyright only to the extent it had artistic features that could be identified separately from,and were capable of existing independently of,the structure utilitarian aspects.

d.the district court opinion 
sketches or drawings such as those allegedly infringed here,therefore,did receive protection before enactment of the awcpa,although the architectural works they depicted did not.the district court seems to have misunderstood the import and relevance of this distinction in concluding that under section a,architectural sketches or drawings are required to include a certain level of detail to receive protection.where the complaint alleges unlawful copying of a pictorial work registered under section a,there is no requirement of any level of detail.
the district court relied principally on three other cases in determining that the drawings at issue were not copyrightable.see scholz,wl,at,dist.lexis,at under attia,as well as jones,and lamont,copyright protection extends to the component images of architectural designs to the extent that those images allow a copier to construct the protected design.citations omitted.first,the court looked to attia,which examined whether the defendants had infringed the plaintiff drawings of a proposed expansion of new york hospital.at.the plaintiff had submitted a plan for the hospital modernization.he prepared a series of preliminary drawings and sketches illustrating his plan,which would have e
