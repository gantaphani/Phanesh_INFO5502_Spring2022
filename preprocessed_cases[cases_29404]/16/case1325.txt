in this case,a union is seeking to compel arbitration of grievances it filed against an employer.the district court held that the grievances were arbitrable,and we affirm.the suit was timely because the statute of limitations period does not begin until a party unequivocally refuses to arbitrate.in addition,despite the fact that the grievances were filed after the collective bargaining agreements had expired,it is clear from the contracts themselves that the parties intended to arbitrate their differences.
this suit involves a dispute over pension and health insurance benefits.the defendants are continental tire north america,a tire manufacturer and distributor,ctna health plan,the pension plan for employees of continental general tire,and certain affiliated companies collectively,ctna.the plaintiffs are a group of unions the united steel,paper and forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,and service workers international union,and its local union collectively,the union.the union was the representative for bargaining unit employees at ctna facility in charlotte,north carolina the charlotte plant.
on september,ctna and the union entered into two agreements that are at the center of this case a collective bargaining agreement governing terms and conditions of employment the cba and an agreement governing pension and insurance benefits the p i agreement.in addition to providing substantive terms and conditions of employment,the cba outlines a broadly applicable grievance procedure.it states 
the parties mutually agree that the procedure set forth herein is the proper vehicle for the settlement of any and all disputes arising between the parties during the life of said agreement,unless specifically excluded by the parties,shall be submitted and settled in accordance with the following procedure without resorting to any other action.
cba,art.iv.it then delineates a grievance procedure that culminates with an option for arbitration.it provides that t he decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties.cba,art.iv.
the p i agreement provides the substantive pension and health insurance benefits that are the subject of the union grievances,and it incorporates the cba grievance procedure in three separate places.it provides generally that t his agreement shall be subject to the terms and provisions of the grievance procedure as outlined in article iv of the collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the applicable laws.p i agreement,art.iv.
in addition,with respect to pension benefits,it provides specifically that the cba grievance procedure shall be used to resolve disputes over certain issues,including the amount of pension or other benefit to which an employee or pensioner is entitled under this agreement.id.at art.i,vi.with respect to health insurance benefits,it provides specifically that i n the event any dispute shall arise based on the question whether the company has provided the insurance benefits hereinabove described,such dispute shall be subject to the grievance procedure of the labor agreement including arbitration.id.at art.iii,iii,following each of these two specific provisions providing for arbitration,the p i agreement also states termination of the labor agreement shall not invalidate the use of its grievance procedure for the purposes of this paragraph.id.at art.i,vi,id.at art.iii,iii,
with respect to duration and termination more generally,the p i agreement explicitly states that it and the cba expire on april.p i agreement,art.iv.it also provides,however,that n otwithstanding the termination of the agreement for pension,service award,insurance and supplemental workers compensation benefits,the benefits described herein shall be provided for ninety days following termination.id.
before the agreements were set to expire on april,ctna notified the union that it needed to reduce costs at the charlotte plant and attempted to renegotiate the agreements in order to achieve the necessary reductions.these negotiations were not successful,and so ctna announced that it would have to cut production and lay off employees.between march and july,ctna laid off over bargaining unit employees from the charlotte plant.the cba and the p i agreement expired on april,in the midst of these layoffs.on may,ctna unilaterally implemented the terms of its last,best,and final proposal the implemented terms,which were later upheld by the nlrb.in contrast to the cba and the p i agreement,the implemented terms did not provide for arbitration.
based on the layoffs,on august,the union filed two grievances with ctna.in grievance,the union alleged that ctna violated article iii,iii,h of the p i agreement because it did not provide the months of extended health insurance benefits that it was required to under that section.in grievance,the union alleged that ctna violated article i,ix,a and a of the p i agreement,which provided for accelerated distributions of pensions,because it did not provide the contractually required amount of pension to which employee arnold hoffstetler and other employees are entitled as a result of the permanent discontinuance of tire making operations.
after ctna refused to arbitrate the grievances,on february,the union filed this suit under of the labor management relations act the lmra.the union sought to compel arbitration under the cba and the p i agreement,and,in the alternative,claimed that ctna breached the p i agreement in violation of of the lmra.both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the count to compel arbitration.the district court granted the union motion and dismissed its remaining claims without prejudice.ctna appeals.
ctna first argues that this suit is time barred.it contends that,as many courts have held,the statute of limitations from b of the national labor relations act,b,governs this suit to compel arbitration under of the lmra.see,aluminum,brick and glassworkers international union local green refractories,cir collecting cases.applying this statute of limitations,it asserts that the limitations period began on august,when rick schultheiss,ctna human resources manager for the charlotte plant,orally informed the union that ctna would not arbitrate,and thus the six months had expired when the union filed this suit on february,six months and five days later.assuming that the statute of limitations applies,we reject this argument because schultheiss statement did not commence the statute of limitations.
as we have previously explained,when a union demands arbitration and the employer expressly refuses,a cause of action to compel arbitration accrues,and the limitations period begins,with the refusal to arbitrate.local,international longshoremen association south carolina stevedores association,cir.there is a question as to whether a formal demand for arbitration is always necessary to begin the limitations period.see warehouse,production,maintenance and miscellaneous employees,furniture,piano and express drivers and helpers local union zenith logistics,cir holding that a formal demand is not required.we need not decide that question,however,because schultheiss statement does not satisfy the requirement that a party must unequivocally refuse to arbitrate before the limitations period begins.see,zenith logistics,at the period begins to run when the employer takes an unequivocal position that it will not arbitrate.quoting mccreedy local union,uaw,cir local joint executive bd.of las vegas,bartenders union local,culinary workers local union exber,cir green refractories,at niro fearn int l,cir.
according to schultheiss sparse affidavit,on august,upon receiving the union grievances,he informed the union representative that it was ctna position that the grievances were not arbitrable under the current grievance procedure and that he would give the grievances to rick ledsinger,ctna vice president,human resources for a written response.
this statement is far from unequivocal.by stating that he would give the grievances to a superior human resources officer at ctna,schultheiss suggested that his decision would be subject to further review.this gave the union good reason to doubt that schulthe
