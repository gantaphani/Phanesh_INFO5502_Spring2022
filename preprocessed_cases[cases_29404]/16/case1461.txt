this appeal arises from a dispute between castex energy and mc asset recovery mcar regarding the alleged breach of a purchase and sale agreement.castex appeals the district court denial of its motion to compel arbitration.for the following reasons,we affirm.
in,mirant corporation and its affiliates collectively,the mirant entities,mcar predecessors in interest,purchased interests in louisiana mineral properties and obtained a majority interest in a closely held corporation pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement psa with castex hereinafter the assets.in,the mirant entities agreed to sell the assets back to castex pursuant to another psa.after the closing of the psa,castex sold the assets to apache corporation.the mirant entities alleged breach of the psa and fraud,claiming castex should have disclosed the fact that it was negotiating with apache for a sale of the assets.
this lawsuit originated as a fraudulent transfer adversary proceeding initiated by some of the mirant entities in connection with mirant corporation bankruptcy.the original complaint sought to avoid the psa and the psa as constructively fraudulent transfers,but did not allege breach of the psa.two days after filing their original complaint,the mirant entities moved to stay the adversary proceeding.the bankruptcy court granted the request and stayed the case for months,until january.
once the stay expired,castex filed its answer to the original complaint.by that time,mcar had been designated as the assignee of the claims raised in the original complaint and successor in interest to the mirant entities.castex answer contained several affirmative defenses,including its right to compel arbitration.castex then requested a jury trial before the district court,and,on that basis,moved to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court.castex stated its intention to preserve its right to compel arbitration in a footnote in the motion to withdraw reference to the bankruptcy court,but it did not move to compel arbitration at that time.the district court granted the motion to withdraw reference to the bankruptcy court.
after castex answered,mcar filed its first amended complaint and largely abandoned its original grounds for relief and raised state law claims arising from the psa for breach of contract,fraud,violations of the texas blue sky law,and breach of fiduciary duty.castex did not move to compel arbitration at that time.instead,it filed a motion to dismiss under.b,b,and c,arguing that mcar complaint was deficient because it failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for relief.in a footnote in the motion,castex reserved its right to compel arbitration.
after filing its motion to dismiss,castex filed a motion for a protective order,seeking to stay discovery in the case,pending the district court resolution of its motion to dismiss.castex also filed a motion for relief from the court initial scheduling order,seeking relief from the requirement that the parties make initial disclosures pursuant to.the district court entered a protective order staying all discovery in the case pending the outcome of the motion to dismiss.mcar later moved for limited relief from the protective order in order to depose an employee of the mirant entities who was scheduled to leave his position.castex objected to this motion and the district court denied it.
before the district court ruled on the first motion to dismiss,mcar filed its second amended complaint.this complaint contained modified versions of the claims in the first amended complaint and added claims for fraud,fraudulent inducement,and statutory fraud under.bus.in response to the second amended complaint,castex filed a second motion to dismiss under.b,b,and c.once again,castex reserved its right to compel arbitration in a footnote but did not move to compel arbitration.castex also filed a separate motion to dismiss under rule b arguing that mcar lacked standing because it had not been assigned any claims outside of the bankruptcy avoidance claims contained in the original complaint.
mcar then filed a third amended complaint,which contained the same substantive causes of actions as the previous complaint but with more details added.castex filed a third motion to dismiss pursuant to rules b and b.as it had done in its previous motions to dismiss,castex reserved its right to compel arbitration in a footnote.in its third motion to dismiss,castex asked the district court to use its discretion to deny further amendments to mcar complaint and asked that the court dismiss all claims with prejudice.on september,the district court partially granted the motion,dismissing count vi breach of fiduciary duty with prejudice.the court denied the motion as to the remaining claims.
on october,castex filed a motion to compel arbitration before answering the third amended complaint.mcar responded to castex motion to compel arbitration by arguing that castex had waived that right by substantially invoking the judicial process.mcar also claimed it had been prejudiced by incurring in attorneys fees and costs in defending against the motions to dismiss.the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration.the district court noted that t here does not appear to be any dispute in this case over the existence or validity of the arbitration clause or whether mcar claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.the district court,however,held that castex had waived its right to compel arbitration because it had substantially invoked the judicial process by filing multiple motions to dismiss,seeking and partially obtaining a dismissal with prejudice,and waiting eighteen months before invoking arbitration.it also found that mcar suffered prejudice through delay,legal fees,and the dismissal of its claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
