opinion of the court 
nicole gardner appellant appeals the order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania granting summary judgment in favor of state farm fire and casualty company state farm,and denying summary judgment in appellant favor.at issue is the district court disposition of appellant claims arising out of state farm refusal to defend or indemnify its insured,kevin harper,in connection with negligence claims appellant asserted against harper in a state court action.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm.
kevin harper purchased a residence on sole street in mckeesport,pennsylvania the property sometime in the.harper lived at the property until march,when he moved in with his girlfriend on scott street,around the corner from the property.to maintain the mortgage on the property,he rented it to appellant pursuant to a march,written lease agreement.although the initial term of the lease agreement was six months,appellant continued to rent the property until february,when harper evicted her on account of her failure to keep current on the rent.meanwhile,on august,appellant mother,sharon ann gardner appellant mother,slipped and fell on the sidewalk outside the property and was injured.
harper had a homeowner insurance policy with state farm the policy.on march,appellant advised state farm of her mother fall and resulting injuries.as a result,state farm conducted an investigation,which included obtaining the statements of appellant and harper.pursuant to that investigation,state farm learned for the first time that harper was renting out the property.on april,state farm sent a letter to harper,denying coverage and explaining that the policy does not offer coverage for bodily injury when the property is held for rental and is no longer occupied by the insured.app.at.
on march,appellant mother passed away.on august,appellant filed a negligence action against harper on behalf of her mother estate in the court of common pleas of allegheny county the state court action.in a september,letter to harper,state farm reiterated that because harper held the residence premises for rental and did not occupy any part of it when this accident occurred,it was denying coverage and would not provide him with a defense to appellant claims.app.at.appellant obtained an entry of default against harper in the state court action on may,and the court entered judgment against harper in the amount of,plus costs and interest,on june.
on april,appellant counsel filed a praecipe for writ of summons in the court of common pleas of allegheny county,and captioned the case kevin harper state farm fire cas,even though appellant had not received an assignment of harper rights against state farm and harper had not authorized appellant counsel to act on his behalf.subsequently,on june,harper assigned his rights against state farm to appellant the assignment,and appellant executed the assignment on june.that same day,appellant served the praecipe for writ of summons on state farm.exactly one month later,on july,state farm removed the action to federal court.on september,appellant counsel filed a complaint against state farm,again in harper name,and on december,counsel filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure to substitute appellant,as administratrix of her mother estate,as the real party in interest.the district court granted that motion on december.
appellant complaint in this case asserts six claims breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,statutory bad faith pursuant to,violation of pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law the utpcpl,et,and a claim for punitive damages.appellant essential complaint is that state farm breached its contractual and statutory duties to harper by refusing to defend appellant suit against him,failing to indemnify him for the judgment against him,and failing to evaluate the case in good faith.at the completion of discovery,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted state farm motion,denied appellant,and entered judgment in state farm favor.
appellant asks us to find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in state farm favor and denying judgment in her favor our standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary.see fed.home loan mortgage scottsdale ins,cir.in reviewing the decision of the district court,we assess the record using the same summary judgment standard that guides the district courts.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
appellant first argues that the district court erred in finding that the policy afforded harper no coverage for her claims against him and therefore erred in entering judgment in state farm favor on her breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims.this argument is meritless.
in denying coverage for appellant claims,the district court relied on the following exclusion in the policy,the rental exclusion.
coverage l liability and coverage m medical do not apply to 
bodily injury or property damage arising out of the business pursuits of any insured or the holding for rental of any part of the premises by any insured.this exclusion does not apply 
to the rental or holding for rental of a residence of yours 
a on an occasional basis for the exclusive use as a residence 
appellant argued to the district court,and continues to argue,that the rental exclusion is inapplicable because harper rental of the property was on an occasional basis and was therefore subject to the exception set forth in subparagraph a,the occasional basis exception.in the alternative,appellant argues that the occasional basis exception is ambiguous and should therefore should be construed in harper favor.
under pennsylvania law,which the parties agree is applicable here,the interpretation of an insurance contract regarding the existence or of coverage is generally performed by the court.donegal mut.ins.baumhammers,quoting minnesota fire and cas.greenfield.when the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous,we must give effect to the language.id.quoting kvaerner metals div.of kvaerner,commercial union ins.on the other hand,where a provision of a policy is ambiguous,the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer,the drafter of the agreement.standard venetian blind am.empire ins.contractual language is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.hutchison sunbeam coal.
in rejecting appellant argument that the occasional basis exception was either ambiguous or plainly applicable under the circumstances of this case,the district court considered the definition of occasional in the edition of the dictionary,which is,in relevant part of or relating to a particular occasion,or encountered,occurring,appearing,or taken at irregular or infrequent intervals.app.at quoting collegiate dictionary,ed.the court held that under either of these definitions,coverage was not available for appellant claims as appellant rental was neither on a particular occasion nor taken at irregular or infrequent intervals.in this regard,the trial court emphasized that appellant rented the property continuously for almost one year which is,practically speaking,the entire term of the annually renewable policy.app.at.it further stated that requiring coverage under those circumstances would not be reasonable as it would distort the meaning of the policy language and would effectively transform a homeowner insurance policy into a landlord insurance policy and render the applicable exclusions meaningless.app.at.
we agree with the district court that,under the circumstances of this case,the rental exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage and the occasional basis exception is unambiguously inapplicable.appellant attempts to inject ambiguity into the occasional basis exception by arguing that the rental was on the single occasion of harper attempting to get caught up on his mortgage,and that it was likewise infrequent and irregular because it occurred for just an period over more than years of ownership.however,these arguments rely on unreasonable interpretations of the occasional basis exception.first,a homeowner rental of his property in order to finance his mortgage is nothing more than a business pursuit,which is exactly what triggers the application of the rental exclusion in the first place and,thus,can not also be the occasion that triggers the occasional basis exception.second,we reject the assertion that the relevant time period for assessing the infrequency or irregularity of the rental is the length of harper ownership rather than the term of the insurance policy,because the policy addresses only the rental term and plainly anticipates that the norm during that term will be the insured residing at the property,not renting it out.see,state farm fire cas.piazza,an occasional rental should be interpreted consistent with the purposes of a homeowner insurance policy which means that the circumstances of the rental must not negate the assumption that the homeowner is still the primary resident of the house,despite his or her temporary absence.thus,where,as here,the term of the policy is one year,an rental is anything but infrequent or irregular accordingly,under either definition of occasional,the occasional basis exception does not apply to save appellant claim from the rental exclusion.
we also find that the district court did not err in finding no coverage for appellant claims in the state court action,because a second exclusion in the policy,the insured location exclusion,also precluded coverage.that exclusion provides as follows 
coverage l liability and coverage m medical do not apply to 
bodily injury or property damage arising out of any premises currently owned or rented to any insured which is not an insured location 
app.at.the policy defines insured location,in relevant part,as the residence premises,and any part of any other premises used by you as a residence.app.at.residence premises is defined as the premises where you reside and which is shown in the declarations.id.
harper simply was not residing at the property at the time that appellant mother was injured.under pennsylvania law,an individual residence for purposes of an insurance policy is his factual place of abode,which is a matter of physical fact.amica mut.ins.donegal mut.ins.as such,when a person actually lives in one location,and sporadically visits,or keeps certain personal items at,another location,it is the location where he lives that is his residence.id.finding that daughter resided with mother,and not with father,when she only sporadically visited father and kept certain personal items at his home.here,the undisputed evidence shows that harper was living on scott street with his girlfriend during the appellant entire lease term.appellant nevertheless argues that the premises remained at least one of harper residences for purposes of the policy because he maintained a close connection with the property by keeping clothing,furniture,a safe and other personal items there,keeping a key and using it to enter the property frequently and without consent,receiving mail there,keeping the utility bills in his name and having the intent to return to the property,and actually returning there to live after appellant left.app.br.at.however,under pennsylvania law,these facts are irrelevant to a determination of harper residence.as a matter of physical fact,he was living not at the property but,rather,was living on scott street.thus,the property no longer qualified as an insured location under the definition of that term in the policy,and there was no coverage under the policy for any bodily injury that occurred there.
appellant argues,in the alternative,that even if state farm had no duty to indemnify harper under the policy,it should have at least defended him in the state court action as the duty to defend is determined by the scope of the allegations in the complaint and,here,the complaint specifically alleged that the property was harper residence and that he rented it to appellant on an occasional basis for the exclusive use as a residence.see frog,switch travelers ins,cir stating that to determine the existence of a duty to defend under pennsylvania law,the factual allegations of the underlying complaint against the insured are to be taken as true and liberally construed in favor of the insured.however,the law in pennsylvania is that an insurer need only provide a defense until it can confine the claim to a recovery that the policy does not cover.cadwallader new amsterdam cas,quoting lee aetna cas.sur,cir belser rockwood cas.ins,stating that duty to defend remains with the insurer until it is clear the claim has been narrowed to one beyond the terms of the policy.the record demonstrates that state farm investigated the facts underlying appellant claims prior to the commencement of the state court action and properly concluded that there was no coverage for those claims under the policy on account of harper rental of the property to appellant.in conducting that investigation,state farm was able to confine the claim to a recovery that the policy did not cover.cadwallader,at.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that state farm did not violate the policy by refusing to defend irrespective of appellant conclusory allegations in her complaint in the state court action.
appellant next argues that the district court erred in entering judgment in state farm favor on her negligence and statutory bad faith claims on statute of limitations grounds.the statute of limitations for both negligence claims and statutory bad faith claims pursuant to.ann.are two years.ann.ash cont l ins,sikirica nationwide ins,cir predicting that pennsylvania supreme court would apply a limitations period to a statutory bad faith claim.in this case,state farm sent a letter to harper on april,denying coverage for appellant mother bodily injury claim based on the rental exclusion,and the district court therefore concluded that the statute of limitations began to run on that date.see sikirica predicting that pennsylvania supreme court would hold the limitations period for bad faith claims would begin to run when coverage was denied.approximately two years later,on april,appellant counsel commenced the state court action against state farm with the filing of a writ of summons in harper name.however,as explained above,harper had not authorized the filing of the action in his name and had not yet assigned his rights against state farm to appellant.as he did not assign those rights to appellant until june of,the district court concluded that the action was not properly commenced until the assignment was fully executed on june,more than two years after the april,letter.it therefore found the bad faith and negligence claims to be.
appellant takes issue with the district court critical conclusion that the action was not commenced for statute of limitations purposes until the execution of the assignment.she specifically argues that federal rule of civil procedure c provides that an amendment that changes the party or the naming of the party relates back to the date of the original pleading,so long as the claim asserted arose out of the same conduct,transaction or occurrence set forth in the original pleading,as it did here.
in our view,however,rule c is simply not applicable here,as,by its own terms,it applies only to amendments to the party against whom a claim is asserted,that is,the defendant.c c emphasis added.indeed,the advisory committee notes to rule explicitly state that the relation back of amendments changing plaintiffs is not expressly treated in revised rule c and that the attitude taken in rule c toward change of defendants extends only by analogy to amendments changing plaintiffs.advisory committee notes on the amendments to the.the more applicable rule is federal rule of civil procedure,which provides that a n action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest
