through a series of transactions and agreements between and,defendants jp morgan chase bank,and jp morgan chase collectively,jp morgan,served as the agent for a consortium of lenders that advanced credit to venture holdings company,llc venture,which was owned by plaintiffs larry winget and the larry winget living trust collectively,winget.in,jp morgan and winget executed the most recent and significant amendment to their original credit agreement,and,at the same time,also executed guarantees and pledges of collateral.these documents allowed jp morgan significant access to winget companies,both venture and its subsidiaries.as venture financial situation deteriorated and the company initiated bankruptcy proceedings,jp morgan and the other lenders sought increasingly greater control over winget companies,eventually resulting in the takeover of one of venture subsidiaries.in an alleged attempt to force winget into a financial settlement,jp morgan and defendants black diamond commercial finance,llc,and black diamond capital management living trust collectively,black diamond collectively,jp morgan and black diamond are the defendants installed managers at venture subsidiaries that acted to significantly devalue the company assets and initiate additional bankruptcy proceedings.eventually,the assets of venture and its subsidiaries were sold pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code.winget brought its present claims of breach of the guaranty and pledge agreements and requests for declaratory judgments,following a suit by jp morgan,which sought inspection of the collateral.the district court dismissed winget complaint the complaint,holding that winget claims were barred by res judicata,and premature to the extent that they were claims regarding future attempts to repossess collateral.without seeking leave of the court,winget filed an amended complaint,which the district court struck.after filing,and losing,a motion for reconsideration,winget appealed.
winget now argues that the district court erred in i dismissing the complaint without granting winget leave to amend ii striking winget amended complaint iii failing to apply the correct standard of review when it dismissed the complaint iv looking to bankruptcy court orders in dismissing the complaint v not giving winget the benefit of every inference from the allegations in the complaint vi ignoring winget defensive claims as a guarantor vii holding that winget claims were barred by the april bankruptcy sale order and viii holding that the claims asserted in the complaint were premature.
factual and procedural background 
i.the winget companies 
beginning in the,winget developed,owned,and controlled a network of companies that supplied plastic parts to automobile manufacturers.the backbone of this network was two companies,their affiliates,and subsidiaries venture and deluxe pattern corporation deluxe.winget personally owned,either directly or indirectly,one hundred percent of the equity of both venture and deluxe.aside from venture and deluxe,winget also owned management,a michigan corporation,and venco,llc venco,a michigan limited liability company.in,winget purchased a foreign company that became venture asia pacific venture ap,the stock of which held.at the time of this agreement,and venco had a market value of approximately million.
ii.the eighth amendment,winget pledge,and winget guaranty 
on may,a consortium of lenders consisting of jp morgan,other banks,investment companies,and hedge funds collectively,the lenders provided credit to venture pursuant to a credit agreement the credit agreement.the parties subsequently amended the credit agreement eight times.the most recent,and only pertinent amendment here,was the eighth amendment the eighth amendment,which was dated october,and executed in connection with a complex workout negotiation initiated as a result of the rapid financial deterioration of venture and significant default under the credit agreement.
a.the eighth amendment 
pursuant to this agreement,the lenders agreed temporarily not to exercise available rights against venture and the collateral supporting the loans,and to extend further credit to venture.in exchange for these terms and the extension of additional credit,winget agreed to provide additional collateral to support the repayment of venture debt,and agreed to additional guaranties.winget,venco,and deluxe all entered into separate guaranty agreements wherein each independently guaranteed certain collateral,which included stock in and venco,and the collateral was pledged pursuant to pledge agreements.in some cases,these guaranties were enforceable solely through the stock from and venco,as both companies pledged their respective interests in venture ap and venture holdings.these guaranties were formalized in the winget guaranty,the winget pledge,and the consortium pledge,which were executed concurrently with the eighth amendment collectively,all four documents are the guaranty documents.
b.the winget guaranty,winget pledge,and consortium pledge 
in the winget guaranty,executed october,winget guaranteed venture debt,but the document limited winget personal exposure,as jp morgan only recourse for payment on the winget guaranty was foreclosure on certain pledged stock,including and venco stock.jp morgan was required to pursue any foreclosure under the winget guaranty pursuant to the terms of the winget pledges.the winget guaranty limited winget personal exposure to approximately million.
the winget pledge,also executed october,significantly increased the amount of collateral available to the lenders by covering winget equity interest in nine of its companies,which were under deluxe corporate umbrella.that same day,winget also executed another pledge agreement that covered winget interests in and venco the consortium pledge.
c.the last resort conditions 
as part of the guaranty documents,the lenders included language that winget refers to as the last resort conditions.the relevant portions of the last resort conditions read 
notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary,jp morgan shall not exercise any rights or remedies under this pledge agreement until all reasonable efforts shall have been made by it to collect the obligations from other collateral held by jp morgan it being intended that the collateral provided by this pledge agreement shall be realized upon by jp morgan only as a last resort.
notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary,no action will be brought for the repayment of the guaranteed obligations under this guaranty and no judgment therefore will be obtained or enforced against larry winget other than with respect to the pledged stock in accordance with the provisions of the related pledge agreements,provided that the guarantor shall be fully and personally liable for any damages arising from any violations of any of the agreements of the guarantor herein in favor of the lenders.
n otwithstanding any other provision in this pledge agreement or elsewhere,in the event i that jp morgan receives for application on the obligations an amount of not less than from the sale or financing of venture ap or venture holdings operations or from one or more outsider sources the obligations of the pledgor hereunder shall be deemed satisfied and the pledge created hereby shall be terminated.
aside from these three provisions,the guaranty documents also allegedly limited winget ability to operate venco,and their subsidiaries through the use of affirmative and negative covenants.the result of the provisions was that the guaranty documents were only enforceable from the proceeds of the sale of the interests in the pledged companies,namely deluxe,venco,and their subsidiaries collectively,the pledged companies,and the lenders could not attempt to enforce the guaranty documents until they had made all reasonable efforts to exhaust the collateral aside from the interests in the pledged companies.at any time,winget could terminate the guaranty documents by tendering million to jp morgan for the benefit of the lenders.
iii.the contribution agreement and bankruptcy proceeding 
on march,venture and its subsidiaries filed for chapter bankruptcy in the eastern district of michigan the bankruptcy proceeding.in order to allow venture to exit the bankruptcy proceeding,winget began negotiations with the lenders,the result of which was an agreement the contribution agreement,which was executed on september.
the contribution agreement called for a reorganization of winget companies,whereby deluxe,venco,and their subsidiaries would fall under the umbrella of venture.winget agreed to this restructuring in exchange for one hundred percent of the equity in the newly restructured venture.under the contribution agreement,winget was not required to agree to exit financing in an amount exceeding million.winget argued that its amount was critical to maintaining venture any amount under million would provide venture with insufficient liquidity to run the company,and any amount above million would require payments that venture would be unable to satisfy.
as the bankruptcy proceeding commenced,black diamond became the lender to venture,financing the company operation during the bankruptcy proceeding.in taking this position,black diamond acquired substantial interests from the lenders,including jp morgan interest in its capacity as a lender.
in the months following the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding,the defendants began to negotiate with venture and the unsecured creditors,without winget participation,to create another plan that would enable exit financing exceeding million.winget maintained that any such plan would be unenforceable per the terms of the contribution agreement,and alleged that with this knowledge,and winget expected rejection of a new plan,the defendants formulated a scheme to coerce winget into participation the scheme.
iv.the scheme 
winget alleged that the defendants created the scheme to coerce winget to contribute its interests in the pledged companies to the lenders collateral pool.winget claimed that the scheme was motivated by the pledged companies market value of million,which winget believed the defendants hoped to use as part of a foreclosure sale to satisfy black diamond and many of the lenders.winget alleged that the following were the principal components of the scheme 
i the defendants agreement in april to provide venture with financing to fund legal fees for a lawsuit against winget purporting to seek million 
ii threats by black diamond to stop making loans to venture unless deluxe filed a bankruptcy petition 
iii executing proxies to vote the shares of deluxe as for winget and voting those proxies to replace the directors of those companies with the defendants own nominees 
iv immediately upon taking control of deluxe,removing winget and others from management,replacing them with inexperienced management and committing to enforce the contribution agreement and 
v seeking enforcement of the contribution agreement for exit financing in an amount in excess of million.
winget further maintained that during a period in may,the defendants and their attorneys drafted documents that allowed the lenders to take over the control of deluxe.in total,the documents i allowed the lenders to remove the directors of deluxe,ii installed new directors and managers chosen by the defendants,and iii absolved these new directors of any liability resulting from the execution of the defendants directives.winget claimed once in position,these new directors,who lacked experience in the automotive industry,began performing actions that devalued deluxe to the extent that on may,deluxe joined venture in the bankruptcy proceeding,which was contemporaneous with the filing of an amendment to the contribution agreement.at the time of the filing,the combined value of the pledged companies and venture assets exceeded the debt winget owed to the lenders.
this amendment to the contribution agreement allowed for million in exit financing.winget objected and refused to perform the contribution agreement due to this amendment.on january,the bankruptcy court ordered the contribution agreement unenforceable against winget due to the exit financing condition.
v.the bankruptcy court order 
on april,the bankruptcy court ordered the sale of substantially all of venture and deluxe assets pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code the sale order.the sale commenced in may,and the proceeds of the sale were applied to venture outstanding balance under the credit agreement.following the sale,however,a large amount of venture debt remained outstanding under the credit agreement.
vi.procedural history 
jp morgan chase bank,winget 
on october,jp morgan brought suit against winget to i enforce its rights to monitor certain collateral under the winget guaranty,and ii obtain a declaratory judgment that it had satisfied the last resort conditions.on june,after winget filed an answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims,the district court ordered winget counterclaims severed from jp morgan suit and litigated in a parallel proceeding.the district court then declined to entertain the declaratory judgment claim,upon which jp morgan moved for judgment on the pleadings on its claim for specific performance of its rights under the guaranty documents to monitor the pledged collateral.winget appealed this decision and we affirmed the district court decision.jp morgan chase bank,winget,cir holding that the last resort conditions did not apply to jp morgan inspection rights and that specific performance was the appropriate remedy.
b.the present case 
after the district court severed winget counterclaims,winget filed the complaint on august.winget asserted four counts in the complaint.in count one,winget alleged that the defendants breached the guaranty documents and winget sought a declaration that it was no longer bound by its obligations under the guaranty documents.in count two,winget sought a declaratory judgment to redefine and interpret the last resort conditions.in count three,winget sought damages for alleged impairment of collateral,namely impairment of deluxe value.in the final count,count four,winget again asserted impairment of collateral,but asked the court to hold that the lenders be allowed to purchase winget interest in deluxe at its fair market value as of may.
on february,after the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint,the district court held a hearing on the motions.after further proceedings,the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that winget claims were either barred by res judicata or were future claims that were premature.the district court held that because winget claims were based on the scheme,winget had an opportunity to litigate those claims before the bankruptcy court entered the sale order.further,the district court held that any claim based on future efforts of the defendants to collect collateral was premature.
the district court made its ruling on the defendants motions on march,the dismissal order,and filed its judgment on march.on march,before it received the judgment,winget filed an amended complaint without leave of the court.the district court struck the amended complaint.on march,winget filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider the dismissal order.on april,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration,noting that the arguments raised by winget could have been raised in the initial briefing to the court.even after considering winget new arguments,the district court determined the arguments did not alter the court legal conclusions and that winget claims were barred by res judicata.

discussion 
i.the district court acted within its discretion in dismissing the complaint without leave to amend.
because winget did not request leave to amend the complaint,the district court decision not to grant leave to amend the dismissal order was within its discretion.the district court does not abuse its discretion in failing to grant a party leave to amend where such leave is not sought.stambaugh corrpro,cir unpublished decision quoting sinay,at see also evans pearson,cir the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiff first request for leave to amend her complaint because she failed to state the grounds for relief with particularity.requiring the district court to both state the reasons for its dismissal and then allow winget to amend the complaint without winget having asked permission would be akin to mandating the district court to issue an advisory opinion.plaintiffs are not entitled to an advisory opinion from the court informing them of the deficiencies of the complaint and then an opportunity to cure those deficiencies.pr diamonds,chandler,cir quoting begala pnc bank,ohio,cir emphasis in begala omitted.
winget argues that the district court was required to give him the opportunity to amend the complaint and quotes united states ex rel.bledsoe,at,for this proposition w here a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim,a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the complaint with prejudice.quoting eeoc ohio edison,cir.while winget correctly quotes united states ex rel.bledsoe,it also states that,denial may be appropriate,however,where there is futility of the amendment quoting morse mcwhorter,cir see kottmyer maas,cir a district court may deny a plaintiff leave to amend his or her complaint when the proposed amendment would be futile.futility is certainly the case here winget claims were not dismissed for lack of specificity,failure to allege an element of a claim,or other deficiencies.rather,winget claims were dismissed because they were either barred by res judicata or were premature.regardless of the merits of these claims,or the various ways in which winget might phrase them in subsequent complaints,winget can not pursue them.
winget attempts to circumnavigate the res judicata and prematurity bars by arguing that it could have pled three additional matters that would have cured any defect in the complaint.these matters are i the context of the sale order and the intent of the parties who drafted that order,ii allegations that a later order by the bankruptcy court could be interpreted as demonstrating that the sale order was not intended to,and did not,preclude the claims in the complaint,and iii pleading of the current impact of harm to winget,venco,and from compliance with the negative covenants included in the guaranty documents.however,none of these matters would lift the res judicata bar for winget.
with respect to the first two matters,winget argues that because of their potential impact on the interpretation of the sale order,they save winget from res judicata.however,the cases that winget cites for this proposition are contract cases that involve the interpretation of ambiguous and conflicting contractual language.see greenberg,at discussing internal inconsistencies in the policy language terry barr sales agency,cir concerning a dispute about an oral contract klapp united ins.group.agency,addressing terms that irreconcilably conflict.furthermore,the district court held that the terms of the sale order were clear,and matters concerning the interpretation of court orders,such as sale orders,are questions of law.brady,at 
as for the third matter,these claims would not be new to an amended complaint winget raised them at the hearing on the motion to dismiss.further,even taking winget claims as it is experiencing present harm from restrictions imposed in the negative not render these claims ripe for litigation.any allegations of past wrongdoing are barred by res judicata,and present harm does not become justiciable until the defendants attempt to collect the collateral.
because any amended complaint would have been futile,the district court did not abuse its discretion in not granting winget leave to amend the complaint.
ii.the district court correctly struck winget amended complaint.
winget argues that the district court erred in striking winget amended complaint,which winget filed after the dismissal of the complaint,without first seeking and obtaining leave of the court.winget points to.a for the proposition that it had a right to file an amended complaint without leave of court because,as of the dismissal order,the defendants had not yet answered the complaint.winget also argues that the dismissal order was not a final order dismissing the complaint rather,winget contends that the final order was not entered until the march,judgment.winget also quotes our language in network communications michigan bell,cir,that an order dismissing a complaint is not a final order when it is possible for a plaintiff to file an amended complaint resurrecting the lawsuit.
however,winget citation here,as above,is misguided.in network communications,we held that while the plaintiff original complaint was dismissed by summary judgment,the district court expressed specific intent to adjudicate a pending motion to amend the complaint.such an expression by a district court would make it possible for a plaintiff to resurrect an otherwise expired lawsuit.there was no such expression on the part of the district court here rather,the district court made it clear that winget claims can not be brought,as they were either barred by res judicata or were premature,and an amended complaint could not remedy these problems.
winget does indeed correctly interpret rule a to allow a plaintiff to file an amended complaint without leave of court when the defendant has not filed a responsive pleading.a motion to dismiss is not considered a responsive pleading under rule a.see ohio cas.ins.farmers bank of clay,cir.therefore,to the extent that the defendants had not responded to the complaint,winget was free to file an amended complaint without leave of court.however,winget dilemma is not that the defendants answered the complaint,but that the district court entered a final judgment prior to winget filing its amended complaint.
we have interpreted rule a to require a party to seek leave of court to amend its complaint once the district court has entered a final judgment.belle fbi,cir after judgment has been entered,a complaint may not be amended without leave of court.unpublished decision.winget argues that the dismissal order was not a final order,and that the final order was entered on march,with the entry of the judgment.as winget did not file its amended complaint until the morning of march,before the entry of the judgment,the distinction is critical to its argument.unfortunately,however,winget draws a distinction without a difference.with the dismissal order the district court clearly intended to dispose of the complaint and winget case in their entirety.even though the district court waited until march,to enter judgment in this case,the intention and effect of the dismissal order were a final judgment.as such,winget was required to seek leave of court before filing an amended complaint.because winget did not do so,the district court did not err in dismissing winget amended complaint.
iii.the district court employed the correct standard of review in examining the complaint.
in reviewing a district court dismissal of a case pursuant to.b,we,like the district court,take all allegations as true.greenberg,at.however,we,like the district court,need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.murphy sofamor danek group,in re sofamor danek group,cir.w e conduct essentially the same analysis as the district court in that we take the plaintiff factual allegations as true and if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claims that would entitle it to relief,then dismissal is proper.greenberg,at quoting weiner klais,cir.the district court can not grant a motion to dismiss based on its disbelief of the plaintiff factual allegations.murphy,at.w hen an allegation is capable of more than one inference,it must be construed in the plaintiff favor.sinay lamson sessions,cir.
after reviewing both the complaint and the dismissal order,it is clear that the district court applied the correct standard of review,accepting as true winget allegations.the district court conducted a thorough analysis of winget claims and determined that even taking the allegations as true,the claims were either barred by res judicata or were premature.such determinations did not rest on a disbelief of winget factual allegations or failure to accept them as true rather,the determinations were the only possible legal conclusions the court could reach after accepting winget facts as pled.for instance,even accepting as true that the defendants did engage in a scheme to devalue deluxe and force winget to accept the defendants terms,any litigation resulting from the scheme was barred by res judicata.further,accepting as true winget allegation that the defendant actions devalued collateral,such claims are premature until the defendants attempt to collect on that collateral.under any analysis the complaint could not have survived the motions to dismiss.
winget argues that the district court erred in not drawing all inferences in its favor.specifically,winget contends that the district court should have construed the sale order so as not to bar winget claims,namely that the district court should have determined that the sale order was not a final order.winget conducts a lengthy examination of the sale order to support its argument,but to no avail.to hold that the sale order was not a final order would require a legal conclusion on the district court part.winget asks us to hold that the district court was required to accept winget legal conclusions as true,and we,like the district court,are not required to do so and do not err in a refusal.see murphy,at.further,any interpretation of the language of the sale order is also a question of law,thereby necessarily requiring a legal conclusion on the part of the district court.see brady,at.because winget was not entitled to have all of its allegations accepted as true,the district court did not err in refusing to accept as true winget legal conclusions.
furthermore,it is clear that there is no set of facts that winget could prove that would entitle it to relief.see greenberg,at.regardless of what facts winget might have pled and the district court accepted as true,winget claims were continuously barred by res judicata or premature for the reasons stated below.
iv.the district court acted without error in looking to the bankruptcy court orders when dismissing the complaint.
when reviewing a motion to dismiss,a district court may not consider matters beyond the complaint.kostrzewa city of troy,cir citing james moore et,moore federal practice ed.if the district court considers evidence outside the complaint,it effectively converts the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.id.citing.b see also carter stanton,d.the district court must then give the parties a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by rule.id.citing.b.other circuits have held,however,that the district court may look to certain documents outside the complaint and such action does not result in a conversion of the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.the third circuit,in southern cross overseas agencies,wah kwong shipping group,cir,wrote,to resolve a b motion,a court may properly look at public records,including judicial proceedings,in addition to the allegations in the complaint.citing numerous third circuit opinions for this proposition.specifically,on a motion to dismiss,we may take judicial notice of another court opinion not for the truth of the facts recited therein,but for the existence of the opinion,which is not subject to reasonable dispute over its authenticity.id.
here,winget argues that the district court improperly took judicial notice of facts in the bankruptcy court documents in dismissing the complaint.examining the dismissal order,it appears that the court looked to two bankruptcy court documents the sale order and winget own objections to the sale order,which were eventually resolved.although the district court quotes a paragraph from winget objection to the sale order,the district court did so not in a way that took judicial notice of the facts in the paragraph,but rather in a way that took notice that winget made an objection to the sale order based largely on the same claims in the complaint,and then later withdrew that objection.the district court also points to the sale order only to say that it was a final order for res judicata purposes.in neither case did the district court act improperly or accord the bankruptcy court documents undue weight.accordingly,the district court did not err in looking to the bankruptcy court documents when examining the complaint.
v.the district court did not err in ignoring the independence of winget claims as a guarantor.
winget asserts that even if the district court correctly interpreted the bankruptcy documents and applied the proper rules of construction under.b in interpreting the complaint,it erred by precluding winget claims as an independent guarantor.winget cites wallace hardware abrams,cir,to support its argument that this circuit has recognized that the doctrine of res judicata claim preclusion does not preclude a guarantor independent,defensive claims even if they arise out of the same facts and claims that the principal debtor and the creditor here defendants resolved in a prior bankruptcy proceeding.winget reliance on wallace hardware for this proposition is misplaced,as it incorrectly cites the holding in that case.
unlike the present case,wallace hardware involved a guaranty agreement that permitted a creditor to compromise a claim against the principal debtor without discharging the guarantor liability.id.noting that the courts will generally enforce such an agreement.the question before us in wallace hardware was whether the guarantor could assert defenses ordinarily reserved for the principal in an action brought by the creditor when the principal was insolvent.id.after noting that a discharge in bankruptcy does not ordinarily affect a guarantor liability,we allowed the guarantor to set off the principal defenses against the creditor due to the principal insolvency.id.the facts and issues of wallace hardware did not deal with res judicata and whether a final sale order in bankruptcy serves to bar any claims that a party to that proceeding could have brought at the time of sale.id.
alternatively,in direct contrast to winget argument,we have held that r es judicata bars not only the parties to an earlier bankruptcy proceeding from later bringing suits which should have been brought in the context of the proceeding,but also those in privity with the parties.browning,at citing sanders confectionery,heller,cir.privity in this sense means a successor in interest to the party id.winget sole opportunity to bring its claims was prior to the bankruptcy court entry of the sale order.winget can not now bypass the res judicata bar and its failure to bring timely suit by arguing that its claims are independent as a guarantor and permissible without citing to any authority for such an assertion.consequently,the district court correctly ignored the alleged independence of winget claims as a guarantor.
vi.the district court correctly held that winget claims were barred by res judicata.
the district court held that o verall,winget
