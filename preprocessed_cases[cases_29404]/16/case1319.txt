this case involves a claim by two former coal miners,gregory parsons and david boothe,to collect retirement health benefits allegedly owed to them by power mountain coal company power mountain,a coal operator in west virginia.under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to which power mountain was a signatory,a coal operator is responsible for the health benefits of certain miners whose last signatory classified employment was with such employer.power mountain asserted that it was not their last signatory employer,but the designated arbitrators under the collective bargaining scheme disagreed.the district court upheld the arbitrators decisions,and we affirm.lest we risk the disruption of the carefully negotiated rules governing relations within the coal industry,we decline to the judgment of arbitrators interpreting a complicated collective bargaining scheme comprised of interwoven agreements.
parsons and boothe are umwa members who worked for many years as coal miners for pehem industries pehem,a company that at one time operated a coal preparation plant in west virginia.in,parsons and boothe were laid off from their jobs with pehem.
later that same year,power mountain purchased the plant where parsons and boothe had previously worked.as a result of its purchase,power mountain became subject to two labor contracts between the umwa and numerous coal operators.specifically,power mountain assumed its predecessor obligations under the national bituminous coal wage agreement of nbcwa and also became a direct signatory to the national bituminous coal wage agreement of nbcwa.power mountain also inherited a duty to honor the panel rights of pehem employees.under the panel system,employees were placed on a panel and given the opportunity to be recalled back to employment,in order of seniority,for any work falling within the scope of the nbcwa work jurisdiction clause.
while the nbcwa was in effect,however,power mountain hired contractors for work allegedly falling under the nbcwa work jurisdiction clause.as a result,a number of umwa members,including several panel members,filed grievances against power mountain,seeking to collect pay for the work they claimed they were contractually entitled to perform.without admitting liability,power mountain settled the grievances for a total of almost in two separate settlement agreements,one in and one in.both settlements were short and included brief disclaimers,reciting that the agreements would not set a precedent for future cases.
neither agreement specified how the monies were to be distributed.as a practical matter,power mountain simply paid the bulk sum to the local union,which in turn distributed the proceeds in equal shares to those union members who likely would have been hired if not for the alleged violation.specifically,the local union determined that if power mountain had not hired the contractors,then parsons and boothe,given their relative seniority on the panel,would have been recalled to employment for power mountain.parsons and boothe therefore received a proportionate share of the and settlement proceeds.power mountain claims it had no knowledge of who might or did receive such distributions.
the settlement payments received by parsons and boothe gave rise to the claim for health benefits in this case.the central purpose of the nbcwa is to provide lifetime health benefits to retired,and disabled umwa members and their dependents.the nbcwa places the burden for these lifetime benefits on a miner last signatory employer,and,if the last signatory employer is out of business,on the benefit plan.
to achieve its overarching goal of lifetime benefits,the nbcwa works in tandem with a set of separate plans and trusts,which establish a comprehensive,albeit complicated,scheme specifying who is eligible for what benefits and from whom.one such plan is the pension plan.all questions of pension eligibility are determined under the detailed rules of the pension plan,as adjudicated by the plan trustees trustees.as explained by article viii a,t he trustees shall have full and final determination as to all issues concerning eligibility for benefits.
in the instant case,the trustees determined that as a result of the settlement payments,power mountain was required to pay retirement health benefits to parsons and boothe under article xx c i of the nbcwa,which requires an employer to provide certain health benefits to pensioners under the pension plan and trust whose last signatory classified employment was with such employer.see also nbcwa,art.xx h.the trustees conclusion that power mountain was obligated to pay health benefits under this section rested on two findings.
the trustees first determined that parsons and boothe were pensioners under the pension plan and trust because they were eligible for a special permanent layoff pension.to receive such a pension,a retired miner must have worked a minimum of twenty years of signatory service,with hours of credited service per year.in calculating the number of hours of credited service,the pension plan treats hours actually worked and hours constructively worked virtually the same.in this sense,and consistent with the trustees past practice,settlement agreements may lead to awards of credited service if the settlement payments are back pay representing compensation for hours that the employee ought to have worked but did not.the basis for this general rule is article i a,which provides that back pay,which is agreed to by an employer and intended to compensate an employee for periods which the employee would have been engaged in a performance of duties for the employer,yields credited service for hours worked.using this provision,the trustees interpreted the and settlement payments as back pay,and the resulting adjustment to credited service for hours worked meant that parsons and boothe met the threshold for a special permanent layoff pension.
second,the trustees concluded that the settlement payments made power mountain parsons and boothe last signatory employer.an employee last signatory employer is the employer on his last day of credited service.here,because parsons and boothe last day of credited service derived from settlement payments made by power mountain,it was attributable to power mountain.in other words,the trustees found that the settlement agreements represented constructive employment and that power mountain constructive employment of plaintiffs paying them for hours they did not work,but should have worked was sufficient to make it their last signatory employer.
when parsons and boothe attempted to enroll in its health benefits plan,however,power mountain denied their claims,insisting that it was not their last signatory employer.in response,the umwa invoked the resolution of dispute rod procedure under article xx e of the nbcwa.under this provision,contested issues of health benefits are adjudicated by the trustees of the benefit plan trustees.after evaluating a disputed matter,the trustees typically issue an opinion,commonly referred to as a rod,which shall be final and binding on the parties.in rods for both parsons and boothe,the trustees informed power mountain that the subsidiary question of parsons and boothe last signatory employer would be addressed by the trustees through the procedure authorized by article xx g of the nbcwa.under this provision,the trustees were authorized to promptly investigate and determine the eligibility or ineligibility of any beneficiary whose right to receive benefits from the trusts has been challenged by any employer.
as to both parsons and boothe,the trustees reaffirmed their earlier conclusion that power mountain was properly named as the last signatory employer and informed the trustees of this determination in a thoroughly reasoned letter.the trustees issued rod opinions in parsons case on january,and in boothe case on october.in both rulings,the trustees not only adopted the trustees decision on the issue of last signatory employer but also confirmed the existence of additional facts crucial to a determination of eligibility.the trustees concluded power mountain was required to provide health benefits to parsons and boothe.
when power mountain refused to comply with the rod decisions,the umwa,parsons,and boothe sued in the southern district of west virginia,seeking,in part,enforcement of the rods as arbitration awards.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court subsequently granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied defendant.parsons power mountain coal,wl.the district court held that eligibility issues,including the issue,were subject to arbitration under the nbcwa,and that the rods were thus subject to the deferential standard of review afforded to arbitration awards.id.at.as the court explained,courts must enforce an arbitrator decision on a matter properly submitted to arbitration so long as the decision draws its essence from the agreement.id.at citing united steelworkers enter.wheel car.the court found that the rods in this case satisfied this circumscribed level of review and that enforcement was therefore warranted.id.
this court has previously recognized that rod opinions,issued under the authority of the nbcwas,are arbitration awards.see,e,upshur coals umwa,dist,cir.and arbitration awards are entitled to considerable deference.united paperworkers int l union misco.as the supreme court has instructed agreements commonly provide grievance procedures to settle disputes between union and employer with respect to the interpretation and application of the agreement and require binding arbitration for unsettled grievances.in such cases,courts play only a limited role in review ing the decision of an arbitrator.id.
under this standard,we must uphold a rod so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and is not merely the arbitrator own brand of industrial justice.steelworkers enter.wheel car.a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.misco,at see also mountaineer gas oil,chem.atomic workers int l union,cir.
power mountain contends,however,that the rods must be overturned,either because they do not deserve the usual deferential review or because they do not survive it.in appealing the district court ruling,power mountain asserts several grounds of error.we address each in turn.
power mountain begins by arguing that the standard of review generally applicable to arbitration awards does not apply here,at least not to the precise question of whether power mountain was plaintiffs last signatory employer.as to this issue,power mountain contends there was an impermissible delegation.according to power mountain,the trustees had an arbitral duty to decide the issue,and their referral of the issue to the trustees therefore constituted an abdication of their authority as arbitrators.under these circumstances,power mountain suggests that the designation is entitled to no deference.
we find this argument unpersuasive.reviewing questions of a labor arbitrator authority de novo,mountaineer,at,we see nothing improper about the trustees choice to request and accept the trustees decision on the singular issue of whether power mountain was plaintiffs last signatory employer.
the parties bargained for arbitration and were free to set the procedural rules for arbitrators to follow if they chose.misco,at.here,by signing the nbcwa,power mountain opted to give the trustees considerable leeway as arbitrators.article xx e of the nbcwa imbues the trustees with complete authority to resolve disputes in final and binding decisions and further permits them,without limitations,to develop procedures for the resolution of such disputes.nothing in the agreement constrains their ability to consult the trustees.
in fact,the trustees decision to enlist the advice of the trustees was fully contemplated by the collective bargaining agreements in place.several provisions support this conclusion.as the trustees noted in their rods,article xx g of the nbcwa assigns to the trustees the task of promptly investigat ing and determin ing the eligibility or ineligibility of any beneficiary whose right to receive benefits from the trusts has been challenged by any employer.moreover,article viii b of the pension plan cloaks the trustees with the further powers contained in the rod provision of the nbcwa,thereby indicating that the trustees responsibilities do not necessarily cease once the rod process begins.finally,and importantly,article viii a of the pension plan vests in the trustees a full and final determination power as to all issues concerning eligibility for benefits.this court has repeatedly recognized that this provision imparts broad discretionary authority to the trustees.see sargent holland,cir lockhart umwa pension trust,cir boyd trs.of umwa health ret.funds,cir see also baker umwa health ret.funds,cir.
power mountain,however,responds that the trustees were given the power only to determine eligibility for pension benefits,not health benefits.this argument is unavailing.whatever allure such a distinction between pension and health benefits might have in theory,it breaks down in practice where,as here,issues of pension and health benefits are so intimately related that they are impossible to untangle.in this case,for example,power mountain liability for health benefits depended on plaintiffs eligibility for pension benefits.only if the settlement agreements constituted back pay warranting credited service did plaintiffs become entitled to a pension,and only if they were entitled to a pension could they collect health benefits from their last signatory employer.in addition,power mountain status as last signatory employer for purposes depended on plaintiffs last day of credited service for pension eligibility purposes.
moreover,the trustees themselves decided the larger issue of whether parsons and boothe were eligible for health benefits,calling upon the trustees expertise only as to a solitary,narrow question.power mountain status as last signatory employer was but a small piece of the puzzle.to support its ultimate conclusion that power mountain was responsible for plaintiffs health benefits,the trustees needed to first establish that plaintiffs were entitled to health benefits at all.they therefore addressed whether plaintiffs met the service hours and age requirements,determined the effective dates of eligibility,and identified the agreements to which power mountain was a signatory.far from simply handing over their duties,the trustees retained for themselves several crucial aspects of parsons and boothe claims.thus,because the trustees performed their arbitral role consistently with the rod procedure under the nbcwa,their rod opinions warrant deference.
power mountain next argues that the district court erred in enforcing the rods because the trustees are not neutral arbitrators.under the collective bargaining agreements,the benefit plan,which the trustees administer,is obligated to pay the benefits of any retired employees whose last signatory employer is out of business.if the benefit plan decided that pehem rather than power mountain was parsons and boothe last signatory employer,the benefit plan would have had to pay their benefits,inasmuch as pehem was out of business.power mountain contends that this conflict of interest warrants overturning the rods.in support,it relies primarily on the supreme court decision in metropolitan life ins.glenn,which held that when an employer administers an employee benefit plan,both determin ing whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pay ing benefits out of its own pocket,there is a conflict of interest that a reviewing court should consider in determining whether the plan administrator has abused its discretion.see also firestone tire rubber bruch.
under glenn,however,a conflict of interest is simply one factor among many to be weighed,glenn.at,and by no means compels reversal.we also note that the conflict in glenn was weighed in the context of a court abuse of discretion review,id.at,while any potential conflict in this case would be considered in the context of the eve
