this case arises from the unprecedented destruction brought to the mississippi gulf coast by hurricane katrina in august.the hurricane completely destroyed the home of,john and claire tuepker the tuepkers.their residence and the property contained therein were insured by,state farm fire and casualty company state farm.when state farm refused to compensate the tuepkers for their losses,the tuepkers on november,sued state farm in the district court below,federal jurisdiction being based on diversity of citizenship.state farm filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under.b.the district court denied the motion.this interlocutory appeal is before us under b.
context facts and proceedings below 
a proceedings 
the tuepkers complaint identified their state farm issued homeowner policy,with policy period august,to august,and attached a representative copy of the subject policy.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that o n august,the insured residence and the personal contents therein were completely destroyed by hurricane wind,rain,storm surge from hurricane katrina this loss was covered under the subject policy.there is nothing left of the insured residence or contents but a slab.the complaint further included the allegations that 
regardless of whether the total damage to plaintiffs insured property was caused by hurricane wind,storm surge proximately caused by hurricane wind,or both,the flood exclusion,which state farm defines in the subject policy and in its denial letter as flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,tsunami,seiche,or overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,all whether or not driven by wind,is not applicable here and in any event,is modified by the hurricane deductible 
and that t his flood exclusion is ambiguous and deceiving when read in conjunction with the hurricane deductible.the relief sought in the complaint includes,inter alia,declaratory relief,and the declarations sought include a declaration that any damage to plaintiffs insured residence and property caused by storm surge is not excluded under the subject policy and that the subject policy flood exclusion is not applicable and is ambiguous.
state farm,in late december,filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under.b and b asserting,inter alia,that in respect to the declaratory relief sought,the complaint fail s as a matter of law,because the claims for insurance coverage are barred by the plain language of the plaintiffs policy,that the policy water damage exclusion is valid and enforceable,and unambiguously excludes losses that would not have occurred in the absence of water damage and applies to water damage from hurricane and storm surge,and that t he hurricane deductible endorsement does not provide coverage for hurricane damage not covered under the policy,including storm surge damage,nor does it render the policy ambiguous.
the district court,in its may,order,denied state farm motion to dismiss in accordance with its memorandum opinion of the same date,in which the court,inter alia,construed,as a matter of law,a number of the relevant provisions of the state farm policy,primarily including the policy water damage exclusion clause and the clause,which introduces that and other related exclusions,commonly known as the clause or acc clause.the court also addressed the policy hurricane deductible endorsement and its personal property coverage windstorm or hail peril,as well as the burden of proof.the opinion holds that interpretation of the terms of an insurance policy present questions of law,not fact and that where the terms of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous,they are to be enforced as written.it further holds that 
losses directly attributable to water in the form of a storm surge are excluded from coverage because this damage was caused by the inundation of plaintiffs home by tidal water from the mississippi sound driven ashore during hurricane katrina.this is water damage within the meaning of that the water damage policy exclusion.the exclusion found in the policy for water damage is a valid and enforceable policy prevision.
under applicable mississippi law,where there is damage caused by both wind and rain covered losses and water losses excluded from coverage the amount payable under the insurance policy becomes a question of which is the proximate cause of the loss.to the extent that the state farm policy is inconsistent with this settled rule of mississippi law,the exclusionary language is invalid.
the court also held the clause ambiguous and ineffective to exclude damage proximately caused by wind or rain,stating 
i also find that the language in the state farm policy that introduces subsection of section not covered is ambiguous.the provisions in question purport to exclude from coverage losses that would otherwise be covered,such as wind damage,when that covered loss happens to accompany water damage an excluded loss.
i find that this language in the state farm policy creates ambiguities in the context of damages sustained by the insured during a hurricane.these provisions purport to exclude coverage for wind and rain damage,both of which are covered losses under this policy,where an excluded cause of loss,water damage,also occurs.i find that these two exclusions are ambiguous in light of the other policy provisions granting coverage for wind and rain damage and in light of the inclusion of a hurricane deductible as part of the policy.
to the extent that plaintiffs can prove their allegations that the hurricane winds or objects driven by those winds and rains entering the insured premises through openings caused by the hurricane winds proximately caused damage to their insured property,those losses will be covered under the policy,and this will be the case even if flood damage,which is not covered,subsequently or simultaneously occurred.
the court further held that state farm had the burden of proving that the water damage exclusion applies to the plaintiffs claims.
state farm,after the court denied its motion to alter or amend,then moved the court to certify to this court under section b its may,order and opinion as involving the controlling legal question of whether the cause language in state farm homeowner policies is ambiguous and unenforceable.the tuepkers opposed the motion as limited to that one particular issue but acknowledged that the criteria for section b certification were met provided that all of the rulings made by the court on the substantive legal issues surrounding interpretation of the state farm contract are also certified for appeal.thereafter,the district court,on september,issued its order certifying under section b its may,order and opinion interpreting the state farm policy in the noted respects as involving controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an appeal will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation the order states that this certification is limited to the interpretation of the various provisions of the subject insurance policy under the factual circumstances presented.
in october,both state farm and the tuepkers timely filed with this court their respective petitions for permissions to appeal under fed,rule,and on november,a motions panel of this court granted those petitions 
b policy provisions 
the state farm homeowner policy had two relevant property coverage provisions.these are contained in its section property coverages and are as follows 
section insured 
we insure for accidental direct physical loss to the property described in coverage a,except as provided in section not insured.
coverage property 
we insure for accidental direct physical loss to property described in coverage b caused by the following perils,except as provided in section not insured.
there next appear subparagraphs.through.in each of which a coverage b covered peril is listed and described,subparagraph of which is as follows 
windstorm or hail.this peril does not include loss to property contained in a building caused by rain,snow,sleet,sand or dust.this limitation does not apply when the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain,snow,sleet,sand or dust enters through this opening.
this peril includes loss to watercraft of all types and their trailers,furnishings,equipment,and outboard motors,only while inside a fully enclosed building.
the next portion of the property coverages section of the policy is entitled section not insured.it consists of three parts numbers.and.the second of which.commences as follows 
we do not insure under any coverage for any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.we do not insure for such loss regardless of a the cause of the excluded event or b other causes of the loss or c whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss or d whether the event occurs suddenly or gradually,involves isolated or widespread damage,arises from natural or external forces,or occurs as a result of any combination of these.
this is the noted clause or acc clause.immediately after it there next appear subparagraphs a through f in each of which an excluded event under.is listed and described,subparagraph of which is as follows 
water damage,meaning 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal water,tsunami,seiche,overflow of a body of water,or spray from any of these,all whether driven by wind or not 
water or sewage from outside the residence premises plumbing system that enters through sewers or drains,or water which enters into and overflows from within a sump pump,sump pump well or any other system designed to remove subsurface water which is drained from the foundation area or 
water below the surface of the ground,including water which exerts pressure on,or seeps or leaks through a building,sidewalk,driveway,foundation,swimming pool or other structure.
however,we do insure for any direct loss by fire,explosion or theft resulting from water damage,provided the resulting loss is itself a loss insured.
the policy also includes a hurricane deductible endorsement which provides 
the following deductible language is added to the policy 
deductible 
the hurricane deductible percentage shown in the declarations applies only for direct physical loss or damage to coverage property caused by wind,wind gusts,hail,rain,tornadoes,or cyclones caused by or resulting from a hurricane as defined above.the deductible for loss caused by each hurricane occurrence is the amount determined by applying the deductible percentage shown in the declarations to the coverage limit shown in the declarations.
in the event of a hurricane loss,this deductible will apply in place of any other deductible stated in the policy.in no event will this deductible be less than the section i deductible amount shown in the declarations.
all other policy provisions apply.
discussion 
as the court below correctly ruled,and as all parties recognize,the governing substantive law is that of mississippi.we address the proper interpretation and legal effect of the state farm policy under mississippi law,and hence our review is de novo.leonard nationwide mutual ins,cir gladney paul revere life ins,cir anglin gulf guaranty life ins,so d.
we limit our discussion to the issues raised by the parties on appeal whether damage resulting to the tuepkers home from the storm surges is an excluded peril that is not covered by the policy whether the acc clause in the state farm policy is ambiguous and whether the efficient proximate cause doctrine applies in this case.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
water damage exclusion 
state farm urges this court to affirm the district court conclusion that the water damage exclusion is valid under mississippi law and that it includes losses attributable to storm surge.the tuepkers argue that damages caused by storm surge are not excluded from coverage by the water damage exclusion.
the water damage exclusion states that water damage includes damages caused by,among other things,flood,waves,tidal water,and overflow of a body of water,all whether driven by wind or not.these words accurately describe the influx of water into the tuepkers home that was caused by the katrina storm surge.furthermore,courts have held that similarly worded water damage exclusions apply to flooding that occurs during a hurricane.see in re katrina canal breaches,cir concluding that under louisiana law,similar water damage exclusions in insurance policies are unambiguous and that flooding resulting from the damage to the levees during hurricane katrina fits squarely within the generally prevailing meaning of the term flood,and is,thus,excluded from coverage by the policies bilbe belsom state farm fire and cas,slip op.at,wl.july,finding that under louisiana law,the state farm acc clause and water damage exclusion at issue in this case are unambiguous and that water damage caused by the inundation of the plaintiff home from tidal water from lake pontchartrain is water damage within the meaning of state farm policy exclusion in interpreting an almost identical water damage exclusion and applying mississippi law this court has found that storm surge is little more than a synonym for a tidal wave or flood,both of which are perils excluded by the state farm policy.leonard,at.in leonard,we concluded that the lack of a specific reference to a storm surge in the water damage exclusion did not render the policy ambiguous or allow the insured party to recover for losses caused by the storm surge associated with hurricane katrina.id.at.our opinion in leonard specifically relied on the katrina canal breaches litigation opinion and on the district court opinion here for the holding that the katrina storm surge was unambiguously excluded water damage 
we conclude that under mississippi law,the water damage exclusion is valid and that the storm surge that damaged the tuepkers home is a peril that is unambiguously excluded from coverage under state farm policy.therefore,we affirm the district court ruling on this issue.
the tuepkers urge this court to uphold the district court conclusion that the acc clause was ambiguous.they argue that the acc clause is unenforceable because it conflicts with other provisions in the policy,namely the express coverage for losses attributable to wind and the hurricane deductible endorsement.state farm argues that the acc clause is not ambiguous because it can not be construed to have two or more reasonable meanings and it does not conflict with any other provisions in the policy.we agree with state farm.
under mississippi law,if the words of an insurance policy are plain and unambiguous,courts will afford them their ordinary meaning.anglin,so d at.
this court has recently ruled that a nationwide mutual insurance company acc clause,which is similar to that in the state farm insurance policy in this case,is not ambiguous under mississippi law.leonard,at the acc clause and subsequent water damages exclusion at issue in leonardread 
we do not cover loss to any property resulting directly or indirectly from any of the following.such a loss is excluded even if another peril or event contributed concurrently or in any sequence to cause the loss 
water or damage caused by material 
flood,surface water,waves,tidal waves,overflow of a body of water,spray from these,whether or not driven by wind.id.at emphasis deleted.
the state farm acc clause does differ from the nationwide acc clause in that it states that the policy does not cover any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.however,this difference does not introduce any ambiguity or significantly differentiate the clause from the acc clause at issue in leonard.both clearly state that excluded,any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the excluded not be covered even if a nonexcluded event or peril acts concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to cause the loss in question.thus,leonard governs this case,and compels the conclusion that the acc clause in state farm policy is not ambiguous,and should be enforced under mississippi law.as the leonard opinion d
