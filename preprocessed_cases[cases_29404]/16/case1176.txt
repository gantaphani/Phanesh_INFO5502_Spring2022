this case presents a question of jurisdiction under the civil enforcement provision of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a.pascack valley hospital the hospital sued the united food and commercial workers international union local,group reimbursement welfare plan the plan in state court for breach of contract.the plan removed the case to federal district court and moved for summary judgment.the hospital moved to remand.the district court held that the hospital breach of contract claims against the plan were completely by erisa and therefore raised a federal question supporting removal under a.we hold that,under the complaint rule,the hospital complaint does not present a federal question that would support removal.we further hold that the hospital state law breach of contract claims are not completely by erisa civil enforcement provision because the hospital could not have brought its claims under erisa.we will therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand to that court with instructions that it,in turn,remand these proceedings to the state court whence they came.
the plan is an employee welfare benefit plan as defined by erisa.the plan is a reimbursement plan only it reimburses participants and beneficiaries for medical expenses but does not itself provide medical care.
magnet,is an independent consultant.magnet has organized a network of hospitals that have agreed to accept discounted payment for medical services provided to beneficiaries of group health plans in return for the plans promise to encourage beneficiaries to use network hospitals.network hospitals do not contract directly with the plans.instead,magnet enters into separate contracts with individual plans,and separate contracts with individual hospitals.
around,the plan entered into a subscriber agreement with magnet.in,the hospital entered into a network hospital agreement with magnet.section of the subscriber agreement governs hospital payment,and provides that the discounted rate offered by the hospital will be forfeited unless claims are timely paid 
subscriber shall pay network hospitals for covered services furnished to eligible persons.
pursuant to a valid assignment from eligible person,subscriber shall directly pay network hospitals for covered services provided to eligible persons within thirty days after date of receipt of submitted clean claims 
for other claims,payment shall be made within thirty days of receipt of all records and other information necessary for proper claims adjudication.
where obligated,if subscriber fails to pay within the appropriate time frame,the subscriber acknowledges that it will lose the benefit of the magnet discounted reimbursement rate and that network hospital is then entitled to bill and collect from subscriber and eligible person its customary rate for services rendered.if subscriber fails to make the payment,the network hospital may pursue any remedies available against subscriber and eligible person.
in,the hospital provided medical services to kimberly rovetto and betty psaras.both psaras and rovetto were eligible persons under the subscriber agreement,and the medical services provided to psaras and rovetto were covered services under the subscriber agreement.the hospital alleges that the plan failed to pay the hospital for the services rendered to psaras and rovetto according to the terms of the subscriber agreement.the hospital contends that claims for those services were properly submitted on april,and october.the hospital further contends that it received payment on these claims at the discounted rate on june,and november,respectively.according to the hospital interpretation of of the subscriber agreement,the plan failure to pay these claims within thirty days of receipt effected a forfeiture of the discounted rate provided in the network hospital agreement.the hospital therefore seeks to recover the allegedly forfeited discount from the plan.
on october,the hospital filed suit in the superior court of new jersey.
the complaint alleges that the hospital is a beneficiary to the subscriber agreement between magnet and the plan,under which the plan became obligated to pay the hospital for eligible medical services provided by the hospital,and was required to comply with certain terms and conditions of the hospital contract with magnet,the network hospital agreement,requiring payment in the time period specified in said contract.the complaint alleges that the plan breached this contract by improperly taking a discount on the services provided to psaras and rovetto despite the plan failure to make timely payment under the subscriber agreement 
the plan removed the case to the district court.thereafter,the plan moved for summary judgment and the hospital to remand the case to state court.the parties motions focused on whether,under the doctrine of complete,the hospital state law breach of contract claims raised a federal question.the district court heard oral argument on the parties motions on september.the next day,on september,the district court issued an opinion and order granting the plan motion for summary judgment,denying the hospital to remand,and dismissing the complaint without prejudice.the district court opinion and order states in relevant part 
defendant believing that plaintiff state law claims are completely preempted by erisa in that plaintiff now stands in the shoes of the plan beneficiaries as assignee,and therefore defendant believes the facts show it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and 
plaintiff believing the action is not preempted by erisa since plaintiff is not a participant or beneficiary under erisa and therefore there is no federal law claim,and therefore the matter should be remanded to the state court and 
this court being in agreement with and adopts the reasoning of counsel for defendant as stated on the record,and further rejects the arguments put forth by counsel for plaintiff and 
this court agrees with and adopts the analysis and holding as set forth in charter fairmount institute,alta health strategies.and 
this court being satisfied that the doctrine of complete preemption having been met in this case and 
as this case falls within the complete preemption exception to the well pleaded complaint doctrine,removal to federal court was proper,and remand to state court would be inappropriate 
footnote omitted.the hospital filed a timely notice of appeal on october.
before turning to the district court removal jurisdiction,we must first address our own appellate jurisdiction.although the district court purported to grant summary judgment in favor of the plan,the district court actually dismissed the hospital complaint without prejudice.that disposition allowed the hospital,which emphatically disavows an erisa claim for benefits,to replead its complaint under erisa civil enforcement provision.the hospital declined to do so and instead filed this appeal.

a civil action filed in a state court may be removed to federal court if the claim is one arising under federal law,a.under the complaint rule,the plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to remain in state court so long as its complaint does not,on its face,affirmatively allege a federal claim.beneficial bank anderson,d.to support removal,a right or immunity created by the constitution or laws of the united states must be an element,and an essential one,of the plaintiffs cause of action.franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d quoting gully first bank in meridian.federal is ordinarily a defense to a plaintiff suit and,as such,does not appear on the face of a complaint.anderson,at.franchise tax,at.
on its face,the hospital complaint does not present a federal question.rather,the complaint asserts state common law claims for breach of contract.the complaint does not expressly refer to erisa and the rights or immunities created under erisa are not elements,let alone essential elements,of the plaintiff claims.the even erisa provision,a,may the hospital state law claims is not a sufficient basis for removal.franchise tax,at.

although the complaint rule would ordinarily bar the removal of an action to federal court where federal jurisdiction is not presented on the face of the plaintiff complaint,the action may be removed if it falls within the narrow class of cases to which the doctrine of complete applies.aetna health davila,d metro.life ins.taylor,d.as a corollary of the complaint rule,complete recognizes that congress may so completely a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.taylor,at.accord anderson,at.when the federal statute completely the cause of action,a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,is in reality based on federal law.
erisa civil enforcement mechanism,a,is one of those provisions with such extraordinary power that it converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.davila,at quoting taylor,at.as a result,state law causes of action that are within the scope of a are completely and therefore removable to federal court.taylor,at.difelice,at.the supreme court has recently clarified the inquiry in such cases 
it follows that if an individual brings suit complaining of a denial of coverage for medical care,where the individual is entitled to such coverage only because of the terms of an employee benefit plan,and where no legal duty state or federal independent of erisa or the plan terms is violated,then the suit falls within the scope of erisa a b.in other words,if an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b,and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions,then the individual cause of action is completely by erisa a b.

accordingly,this case is removable only if the hospital could have brought its breach of contract claim under a,and no other legal duty supports the hospital claim.id.a federal court may look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether a plaintiff has artfully pleaded his suit so as to couch a federal claim in terms of state law.pryzbowski,at internal quotation omitted.
we conclude that the hospital could not have brought its claims under a because the hospital does not have standing to sue under that statute.section a of erisa allows a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action,inter alia,to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b by its terms,standing under the statute is limited to participants and beneficiaries franchise tax,at.erisa carefully enumerates the parties entitled to seek relief under.the parties agree that the hospital is neither a participant nor a beneficiary,and that the hospital does not have standing under erisa to sue in its own right.
the parties dispute whether,under the law of this circuit,the hospital can obtain standing under a by virtue of an assignment of a claim from a participant or beneficiary we need not resolve this dispute,however,because there is nothing in the record indicating that psaras and rovetto did,in fact,assign any claims to the hospital.
as the party seeking removal,the plan bore the burden of proving that the hospital claim is an erisa claim.difelice,at.accordingly,the plan bore the burden of establishing the existence of an assignment.hobbs blue cross blue shield of,cir.the plan concedes that the record contains no evidence of an express assignment,whether oral or written,from either psaras or rovetto to the hospital.instead,the plan argues that t he magnet contract itself establishes the hospital claim as an assignment from the participant.appellee br.at.essentially,the plan argues that under the subscriber agreement,the hospital only right to demand money from the plan comes from the participant assignment of her right to reimbursement,appellee br.at,therefore,the hospital must be suing on an assignment from psaras and rovetto.
the plan argument is a non sequitur.whether the subscriber agreement requires the hospital to obtain an assignment in order to demand payment from the plan says nothing about whether an assignment was in fact made.because neither psaras nor rovetto are parties to the subscriber agreement,that document can not,in and of itself,establish an assignment of their claims.at best,the plan interpretation of the subscriber agreement provides an affirmative defense to the hospital breach of contract claims,that the plan has no contractual liability absent a valid assignment.the plan argument may therefore entitle it to judgment on the hospital breach of contract claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.it does not,however,convert those breach of contract claims into derivative claims for benefits under a 
nor can we find an actual assignment based on any other documents in the record.
section of the summary plan description,entitled how benefits will be paid,provides if you qualify for hospital care and are entitled to reimbursement,and the hospital has sent in an assignment executed by you,we will pay the hospital directly thus,the plan itself contemplates an independent act by which a participant or beneficiary assigns his or her claim to the hospital.the record contains no evidence that psaras or rovetto undertook such an act.
the plan offers the certification of kathy pridmore,the plan director of medical benefits,to support a finding of an assignment.pridmore broadly declares that,in her experience,the plan has consistently followed the claims and claim review procedures contained in the summary plan description.the plan argues that pridmore declaration constitutes evidence of routine practice that supports an inference of an assignment.see.we disagree.pridmore does not declare that the plan routinely
