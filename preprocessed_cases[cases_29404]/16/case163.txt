on november,charles mckenna entered into a loan refinancing agreement with wells fargo bank,evidently to help pay for his children college education.as part of the transaction,charles mckenna and his wife,suzette mckenna,granted wells fargo a mortgage on their residence in south orleans,massachusetts.on the same day,wells fargo provided the mckennas with a disclosure form stating the loan amount and terms.on november,the mortgage was recorded at the barnstable county registry of deeds.
charles mckenna died of a heart attack on may,at age,leaving his wife as administratrix of his estate.some time thereafter,suzette mckenna fell behind on her monthly mortgage payments.under massachusetts law,if a mortgage gives the mortgage holder the power of sale as the mckennas mortgage did,the mortgagee may foreclose without a court judgment ordering the sale after a limited judicial procedure to establish that the mortgagor is not a present or recent member of the armed forces,which suzette mckenna was not 
wells fargo successfully brought such a proceeding in massachusetts land court in october.then,on january,wells fargo sent suzette mckenna a statutory notice of foreclosure sale informing her that the bank intended to auction her home on or after february of that year.suzette mckenna countered by writing to assert a right to rescind the mortgage and then filing suit to preclude the foreclosure sale her lawsuit being the origin of the appeal now before us.
in a letter that she sent to wells fargo on february,suzette mckenna claimed a right to rescind on the grounds that wells fargo had provided her and charles mckenna with only one truth in lending disclosure statement at the time of the loan rather than two copies,and wells fargo had understated the finance charge in its truth in lending statement by more than.on february,suzette mckenna filed a complaint in barnstable county superior court seeking an injunction to prevent wells fargo from proceeding with the foreclosure sale.five days later,the superior court issued a preliminary injunction restraining wells fargo from taking further action to sell suzette mckenna home 
on march,wells fargo removed the case to the federal district court in massachusetts.the bank asserted that federal question jurisdiction existed over what it deemed incorrectly to be suzette mckenna federal claims,supplemental jurisdiction over her related state law claims,and diversity jurisdiction over the entire action due to the amount in controversy and diversity of citizenship.no one thereafter appears to have contested subject matter jurisdiction,although wells fargo has raised challenges to our appellate jurisdiction,which we address below.
following a amended complaint filed on september,wells fargo moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.b,and the district court granted the motion.mckenna wells fargo bank,jlt,dist.lexis,wl,the b order.suzette mckenna timely motion to alter,amend,or vacate the judgment.e,b the motion for reconsideration,was denied on may.suzette mckenna filed a notice of appeal on june.
at the outset we face questions relating to the district court subject matter jurisdiction which we are required to consider sua sponte where jurisdiction is in doubt.mcculloch velez,cir.here,wells fargo primary assertion in its removal papers that there is federal question jurisdiction present in this case turns out to be mistaken because no federal claim is presented.in the end,however,diversity jurisdiction does appear sufficient to support the state statutory claims that are asserted in the complaint.
the federal truth in lending act tila gives homeowners a right to rescind certain credit transactions,a,and creates a private right of action for damages,which would ordinarily satisfy federal question jurisdiction.but although suzette mckenna amended complaint makes passing reference to the federal tila,she styles all of her claims as arising under state law,including the massachusetts consumer credit cost disclosure act mcccda.laws ch.
this may have been done because a federal tila claim for rescission must be brought within three years of the transaction,f,while the mcccda allows four years.laws ch,f,and mckenna suit appears to satisfy the latter time requirement but not the former.there are also unsettled questions as to what federal rights are displaced and what others remain where,as is the case with massachusetts,the federal reserve has exempted a state from various tila provisions on the grounds that state law establishes substantially similar requirements.see palmer champion,cir discussing one such unsettled question.
while the mcccda was closely modeled after the tila and,in most respects,mirrors its federal counterpart,divittorio hsbc bank usa,na in re divittorio,cir quoting mckenna first horizon home loan,cir,an mcccda claim on its own almost surely does not satisfy federal question jurisdiction,belini,at relying on supplemental jurisdiction statute,for federal jurisdiction over mcccda claim.
one precedent suggests that federal courts continue to have federal question jurisdiction over any civil suit claiming violation of an exempt state disclosure requirements,ives grant,cir.but we are not persuaded our circuit has only found such federal question jurisdiction to exist where,unlike this case,the plaintiff explicitly pleads a federal section claim under tila.see belini,at bizier globe fin,cir.
however,the removal can be supported by diversity jurisdiction,which requires that the parties be citizens of different states and that the amount in controversy exceed.see a.suzette mckenna is a citizen of massachusetts.well fargo,a national bank,is a citizen of the state where it is located,this is the state designated in its articles of association as its main office,wachovia bank,schmidt,and wells fargo is a citizen of south dakota for diversity purposes.hargrow wells fargo bank.lexis,at,wl,at cir.july.
as for the requirement,n umerous district courts have held that,where a complaint seeks to invalidate a loan secured by a deed of trust,the amount in controversy is the loan amount,ngoc nguyen wells fargo bank,d,although other courts have calculated the amount in controversy by reference to alternative criteria,including,inter alia,the unpaid principal balance on the note as of the date of removal,see rc lodge,llc se prop.holdings,llc,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.july,
the rule,of course,has the advantage of perfect simplicity,hertz friend,we place primary weight upon the need for judicial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible and unlike a rule based on the amount already paid or the balance still due,the approach can not be manipulated through strategic timing of a filing.connectu llc zuckerberg,cir concerns about and strategic behavior may offer special justifications for jurisdictional rules.so there is much to be said for such an approach.
however,the subject has not been briefed or indeed even raised,so it is wiser to reserve the question of which test this circuit would approve it is enough here that by any of the suggested tests the matter in controversy exceeds.this is readily demonstrated,particularly because for dismissal on grounds,i t must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount,stewart tupperware,cir quoting paul mercury indem.red cab.
wells fargo disclosure statement listed the loan amount as and the annual percentage rate as percent,with monthly payments over a year period,ending with a balloon payment of due in december.thus,both the face value and the amount still due exceed the threshold,as does the sum of the monthly payments already made a month over about a period.wells fargo deemed the property to be adequate security for a loan as of november,making it highly likely that on removal,the property was worth at least.
having settled the district court jurisdiction,we next must confront the extent of our own appellate jurisdiction.in her notice of appeal,suzette mckenna stated that she hereby appeals from the order on plaintiff motion for reconsideration of this district court memorandum of order entered in this action on may,underlining in original.but whereas the notice of appeal lists only the denial of the motion for reconsideration,mckenna opening and only brief on appeal directly attacks only the district court original rule b order.
the problem here has regularly bedeviled circuit courts and has not been consistently resolved.a notice of appeal from a final order of the district court must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed,fed.c b and,with certain exceptions,the notice must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.fed.a a.the supreme court deems these rule and requirements to be jurisdictional.torres oakland scavenger.
jurisdiction is a term used multiple ways,but it is settled that a civil appeal filed out of time is barred,that the error in timing can not be waived,and that circuit courts are expected to notice the error sua sponte if not raised by the opponent.browder.dep t of.thus,if suzette mckenna had filed no reconsideration motion but waited days before appealing from the original dismissal of her case,the appeal would be barred,and suzette mckenna would be left only with a malpractice suit against her lawyer.
while mckenna appeal was not filed within days of the original march,dismissal,that time limit was suspended once she filed a motion for reconsideration under rule e and b on april.see fed.a a time to file an appeal does not begin to run until last order on a rule motion,provided that motion is timely filed,or last order on a rule motion,provided that motion is filed no later than days after judgment is entered.and,after that motion for reconsideration was denied may,suzette mckenna filed a timely notice of appeal june,but one limited to the order on reconsideration,raising a prickly recurring problem.
technically,an appeal that attacks only an order denying reconsideration can fairly be limited by the court solely to issues raised in the reconsideration motion but so long as that order is timely appealed,courts have some latitude to consider other grounds originally urged against the underlying dismissal,especially where the issues on original dismissal and the reconsideration order overlap or are intertwined after all,rules and govern the appeal of orders and not of issues,and it is debatable how far the wrong order objection is truly one of jurisdiction.see wright miller,federal practice procedure thomson reuters.
the need to provide finality argues strongly against exceptions where no timely appeal is taken,torres,at rejecting any good cause exception to rules and,even though a court may be generous in finding that an appeal was timely,scarpa murphy,cir citing inexcusable neglect by the post office.but a timely appeal,although limited to the denial of a rule e motion,tells the appellee that the judgment is not final.whether and when a court should go beyond the grounds raised is the more difficult question.
even in our own circuit,t he law on this issue is less clear than the cases claim it to be.town of norwood new eng.power,cir,cert.denied.see note,above.but we need not pursue the issue because full as opposed to limited review does not alter the outcome in this case.see markel am.ins.díaz santiago,cir united states fernández hernández,cir,cert.denied.regardless of the standard of review,we find no error.
turning to the merits,the first,second,third and fourth counts of suzette mckenna complaint all state essentially the same claim that wells fargo is no longer the holder of the note for suzette mckenna loan and therefore can not foreclose on her home this is a claim that has some force both in doctrine and policy but it depends entirely on the law of massachusetts which in the absence of a federal claim or defense governs the terms on which a mortgage can be foreclosed.to understand the problem,some mortgage mechanics must be understood.
typically,the borrower mortgagor grants to the lender mortgagee both a right to recover the outstanding balance evidenced by a promissory note and a security interest in the property,which is evidenced by a mortgage instrument.eaton fed.mortg.ass n,powell on real property matthew bender.yet t he holder of the mortgage and the holder of the note may be different persons,lamson abrams,because the note may be transferred after the mortgage is made.see generally unif.commercial code to,to on negotiability of promissory notes.allowing a mortgagee who is not also a note holder to foreclose creates a risk that the borrower might remain liable to the true note holder even after the mortgagee had seized and sold the property.see powell on real property b i.
the rule appears to have been that a mortgagee who was not also a note holder could only foreclose on mortgaged property if it were acting as the note holder trustee.eaton,at discussing and early century case law.however,the relevant massachusetts foreclosure statute states that t he mortgagee or person acting in the name of such mortgagee may,upon breach of condition and without action,do all the acts authorized or required by the power of sale.laws ch,emphasis added.
this language,which imposed no requirement that the mortgagee also hold and surrender the note,was sometimes read as the district court did in this case to allow foreclosure of massachusetts mortgages by someone who held the mortgage but did not demonstrate ownership of the note,aliberti gmac,llc,d,valerio bank,d.while suzette mckenna appeal was pending before us,the issue came before the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc,and we held suzette mckenna case in abeyance.
on june,the sjc decided eaton federal national mortgage association,which held that massachusetts foreclosure statutes should hereafter be construed as suzette mckenna urges,that is,to require the foreclosing mortgage holder to possess the note as well or be acting as agent of the note holder,see id.at but,given concerns about past reliance on the statutory language and the possible impact on past title transfers,the sjc made its new rule applicable only to mortgage foreclosure sales for which the mandatory notice of sale has been given after the date of this opinion.id.at.
eaton,of course,is binding upon us,including its decision to make the new rule apply only prospectively.see wainwright stone,federal courts bound by state high court holding that construction of state statute will only be prospective.as wells fargo issued the mandatory notice of sale to suzette mckenna on january,more than months before the date of the decision in eaton,the sjc decision gives her no protection.nor does suzette mckenna claim that anyone else has sought to sue her on the note.
suzette mckenna fifth count asserts that she has a right to rescind her mortgage loan pursuant to the massachusetts consumer credit cost disclosure act mcccda.laws ch.under section of the mcccda,a borrower who mortgages her principal dwelling as part of a consumer credit transaction may rescind the transaction for up to three days.laws ch,a.however,if the creditor does not provide the borrower with the required information and rescission forms,then the right of rescission extends until the required documents are provided although no longer than four years.id.f.
the mcccda regulations echo this statutory provision,describing the required documents as all material disclosures regs.c lexisnexis specifying that the creditor provide each borrower with two copies of a notice of the right to rescind,id.and obligating the creditor to disclose,inter alia,the finance charge associated with the transaction,id.suzette mckenna alleges that wells fargo did not provide the required amount of copies of the notice to cancel and underdisclosed the amount of the finance charge,allegedly giving rise to an extended right of rescission under.laws ch.
suzette mckenna does not dispute that she received one copy of a document entitled notice of right to cancel on november.the district court stated that as long as a borrower receives one such notice,the rescission period is not extended.mckenna,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.the district court cited king long beach mortgage,d,where another district judge so construed the counterpart federal scheme,similar in substance to the massachusetts rules,compare,with regs.
the massachusetts rescission statute may not cleanly resolve the matter but it says nothing about the lack of multiple copies being a basis for rescission the time period for rescission is only extended from three days to four years if the borrower does not receive an appropriate written notice singular.laws ch,h,i b and the relevant regulations specify the conditions under which a borrower has an extended right of rescission,regs.c d,in a different subsection than the requirement,id.
if it were necessary to go beyond the language of the statutes and regulations,one might fairly point out that the purpose of the extension is to give the consumer the information needed to decide intelligently whether to cancel one copy performs this function as well as two,at least in a case where the mckennas never parted with their first copy of the form.anyway,the more straightforward reading of the statute and regulations makes lack of notice,not the number of copies,the predicate for rescission.
suzette mckenna fifth count also asserts that wells fargo tila disclosure statement underdisclosed the amount of the finance charge by more than,that figure being the regulation threshold to give rise to an extended right to rescind under.laws ch.see regs.c.a letter attached to the complaint alleges that the closing attorney overcharged us for title insurance.
the district court dismissed this claim on the grounds that fees for title insurance are not finance charges under the relevant regulations,mckenna,dist.lexis,at,wl,at,although it acknowledged in a footnote that fees for title insurance in a transaction secured by real property may qualify as finance charges if the fees are not bona fide and reasonable in amount,dist.lexis,at,wl,at quoting regs.g.

here,on motion for reconsideration,suzette mckenna by affidavit furnished information suggesting that the lawyer who represented wells fargo in the loan refinancing charged for title insurance rather than the base policy rate of and that the latter was a typical rate for title insurance on a loan.this is effectively an attempted amendment to the complaint,which must be done within days of a motion to dismiss unless the opposing party consents to a later amendment or the court grants leave,see.a,and here,the attempt was too late by more than six months.

the massachusetts unfair trade practices statute also requires plaintiffs to submit a demand letter to defendants days prior to filing a private action under chapter,id,which suzette mckenna did not do.the demand letter requirement is not merely a procedural nicety,but,rather,a prerequisite to suit,rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir quoting entrialgo twin city dodge,designed to encourage negotiation and settlement and as a control on the amount of damages.slaney westwood auto.
the district judge dismissed the count for lack of a demand letter,mckenna,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.suzette mckenna now claims that no demand letter was required because she says a violation of the massachusetts consumer credit cost disclosure act is a per se violation of chapter,see.gen law ch.but the purposes of the demand letter requirement would be served whether the violation was easily proved or not,and no such exception for per se violations is supported by massachusetts law.
the demand letter requirement does not apply if the claim is asserted by way of counterclaim or,or if the prospective respondent does not maintain a place of business or does not keep assets within the commonwealth.gen laws ch.in addition to her contention regarding per se violations,suzette mckenna argues that the demand letter requirement does not apply here because she is asserting her claims defensively against a foreclosure action and because wells fargo does not maintain a place of business keep assets within the commonwealth.
no counterclaim or is involved in this case,and the purposes of the demand letter requirement are implicated by the relief mckenna seeks in her complaint,in particular the claim for damages.and wells fargo clearly keep assets within massachusetts,one of those assets being a real property interest in the home where suzette mckenna resided.see bank ass ibanez,under massachusetts law,mortgagee holds legal title to mortgaged property see also wells fargo bank na premier capital,llc.case involving wells fargo real property interest in centerville,massachusetts.
