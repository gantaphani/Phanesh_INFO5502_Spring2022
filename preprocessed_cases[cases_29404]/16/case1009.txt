opinion of the court 
oxford health plans,llc,and ivan sutter are parties to a primary care physician agreement,drafted by oxford,which contains a broad arbitration clause.neither the arbitration clause nor any other provision of the agreement makes express reference to class arbitration.nevertheless,when a dispute arose regarding oxford alleged failure to make prompt and accurate reimbursement payments to participating physicians,an arbitrator construed the broad text of the clause to authorize class arbitration.oxford contends that the supreme court decision in stolt nielsen animalfeeds international,d,requires vacatur of the award authorizing class arbitration.we disagree,and we will affirm the order of the district court denying oxford motion to vacate the award.
by their primary care physician agreement the agreement,the parties agreed that sutter would provide primary care health services to members of oxford managed care network in exchange for compensation at predetermined reimbursement rates.they also agreed to arbitrate their disputes under the agreement by a clause that states 
no civil action concerning any dispute arising under this agreement shall be instituted before any court,and all such disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in new jersey,pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association with one arbitrator.
a dispute arose in april,when sutter accused oxford of engaging in a practice of improperly denying,underpaying,and delaying reimbursement of physicians claims for the provision of medical services.sutter filed a complaint on behalf of himself and a class of health care providers against oxford and other health insurers in new jersey superior court,alleging breach of contract and other violations of new jersey law.oxford moved to compel arbitration of sutter claims against it under the agreement.sutter opposed the motion,arguing that referral of the class claims to individual arbitration would violate new jersey public policy.he urged the superior court either to refuse to enforce the clause or to certify the class before sending the claims to arbitration.in october,the superior court granted oxford motion to compel arbitration and ordered that all procedural issues,including those of class certification,be resolved by the arbitrator.
the parties commenced arbitration before william barrett and submitted to him the question of whether the arbitration clause in their agreement allows for class arbitration.by memorandum and order dated september,he determined that it does.framing the question as one of contract construction,the arbitrator turned first to the text of the arbitration clause.he described the clause as much broader even than the usual broad arbitration clause it was unique in his experience and seem ed to be drafted to be as broad as can be.app.the arbitrator thus determined that the clause first phrase,no civil action concerning any dispute arising under this agreement shall be instituted before any court,embraces all conceivable court actions,including class actions.because the clause second phrase sends all such disputes to arbitration,he reasoned that class disputes must also be arbitrated.thus,the arbitrator concluded that the clause expressed the parties intent to authorize class arbitration on its face.app.he observed that an express for class arbitration would be required to negate this reading of the clause.he mused,however,that it would be bizarre for the parties to have intended to make class action impossible in any forum.since he found the clause unambiguous,the arbitrator did not reach sutter argument that any ambiguity in the clause should be construed against its drafter,oxford.the arbitrator subsequently incorporated this clause construction into his partial final class determination award,dated march.
in april,oxford filed a motion to vacate the award in the district court,arguing that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers and manifestly disregarded the law by ordering class arbitration.the district court denied oxford motion in october,and a panel of this court affirmed in february.sutter oxford health plans,llc,cv,dist.lexis,aff app x cir.the arbitration thereafter proceeded on a classwide basis.
this action represents oxford second foray into federal court to vacate the award authorizing class arbitration as in excess of the arbitrator powers.since oxford first unsuccessful attempt at vacatur,the supreme court decided stolt nielsen animalfeeds international,d,in which it held that an arbitral panel had exceeded its authority by allowing class arbitration when the parties had reached no agreement on the issue.see id.at.oxford contends that stolt nielsen controls this case and compels the conclusion that the arbitrator construction of the clause was in excess of his powers.oxford first moved the arbitrator for reconsideration of his clause construction award,but the arbitrator distinguished stolt nielsen and reaffirmed his construction of the parties clause.oxford then moved the district court to vacate the arbitrator most recent award or,in the alternative,to reconsider its own decision denying vacatur.the district court denied oxford motion and granted sutter to confirm the award.sutter oxford health plans,llc,cv,cv,dist.lexis.oxford appeals.

a more deferential standard of review applies to the arbitration award itself.we do not entertain claims that an arbitrator has made factual or legal errors.rather,mindful of the strong federal policy in favor of commercial arbitration,we begin with the presumption that the award is enforceable.see moses cone memorial hosp.mercury const,d.an award may be vacated only upon one of the four narrow grounds enumerated in the federal arbitration act 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
