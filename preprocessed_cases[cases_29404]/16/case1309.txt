consumer products,lp,to georgia pacific corporation,is a leading of,inter alia,paper products and dispensers for such products for the home and the setting,hotels,stadiums,restaurants,etc.this case implicates two related products first introduced by in october 
touchless paper towel dispenser 
dispenser and paper toweling with a,feel designed specifically for use in and operation of 
dispensers 
toweling.although actually sells 
toweling to janitorial supply distributors,who,in turn sell it to their respective customers,hotels,stadiums,restaurants,only leases 
dispensers to such distributors,who,in turn,are permitted to sublease them to their respective customers.the leases and subleases expressly provide that only 
toweling can be used in 
dispensers and stickers on the inside of 
dispensers reinforce the limitation.
the face of every 
dispenser bears four registered trademarks owned by 
collectively,we refer to the first three of these trademarks as the marks,which are the three trademarks at issue on appeal.
on july,after one of competitors,von drehle corporation vd,started marketing and selling to distributors an inferior paper toweling specifically manufactured by vd for use in 
dispensers,brought the present civil action against vd,alleging the following four causes of action at issue on appeal unfair competition in violation of a of the lanham act.a contributory trademark infringement in violation of of the lanham act,unfair competition in violation of north carolina common law and tortious interference with contractual relationships in violation of north carolina common law vd counterclaimed for violation of the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act nc udtpa.ultimately,on for summary judgment with respect to all of claims,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of vd.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of with respect to vd counterclaim.
now appeals the district court summary judgment ruling with respect to its four claims set forth above,and vd the district court summary judgment ruling with respect to its single counterclaim.for reasons that follow,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of vd with respect to claims for contributory trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act,unfair competition under north carolina common law,and tortious interference with contract under north carolina common law,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of with respect to vd counterclaim under the nc udtpa.
in analyzing de novo whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of vd,we view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to,as the nonmoving party.garofolo donald heslep,cir.claims are based upon the following facts.
for many years,has designed,manufactured,and sold what those in the paper towel dispenser industry call universal dispensers.other companies,including vd,also design,manufacture,and sell universal dispensers.universal dispensers accept and are intended to accept paper toweling from multiple manufacturers.however,with the introduction of 
dispensers,sought to introduce a dispenser tied directly to the,one that intended would only operate with,and one in which the restroom visitor would expect to dispense,
toweling.in this way,sought to create a situation akin to a branded soda fountain dispenser,which the user expects to dispense only genuine products.
turning to the specifics of 
dispensers,they dispense a amount of paper toweling upon activation of an electronic motion sensor,without the user having to touch the dispenser in any manner,thus providing a hygienic experience superior to that of a manual paper towel dispenser otherwise requiring the user to touch the dispenser.at the time of their introduction in october,
dispensers were the only electronic,paper towel dispensers available in the marketplace.
invented the 
dispenser with the intent that it would operate with only,
toweling,which toweling has a like feel created by using a tad process.although the packaging of 
toweling bears the marks,
toweling itself bears no source identifying marks.to reinforce desire to create a branded dispenser situation akin to the soda fountain dispenser,every 
dispenser bears a inside of it stating that such dispenser is the property of and may be used only to dispense the products identified on its exterior.although uses its 
mark only with 
dispensers it uses the marks 
on many of its other products,such as brawny paper towels and quilted northern toilet paper.notably,vd does not dispute that 
dispensers have been an extremely successful product for and that many commercial facilities in the united states have installed 
dispensers.
dispensers to distributors via a lease agreement furnished by.such lease agreement grants a distributor permission to sublease 
dispensers to the customers that shall be approved by.a typical example of this supply chain is when leases 
dispensers to a distributor,who in turn subleases them to a hotel operator for use in the hotel public restrooms.notably,although argues that it is a party to the subleases between distributors and the customers,the sublessees,the record does not support such a finding.
also to reinforce its desire to create a branded dispenser situation akin to the soda fountain dispenser,the lease agreements between and its distributors provided that 
dispensers would remain the property of and that only branded towels shall be used in 
u se of other unauthorized product s is strictly prohibited.id.moreover,the lease agreements provided,in relevant part 
use of dispensers by others 
distributor shall sublease the dispensers to the customers that shall be approved by and set forth in exhibit a attached hereto customers.all subleases of dispensers to customers shall be solely upon the terms and conditions of this agreement and of the sublease registration form sub form which is attached hereto as addendum.
the sub form must be fully executed by distributor for each customer location in which dispensers are to be installed.execution of the sub form does not transfer ownership of the dispensers by to distributor or customer.
vd is a corporation organized under the laws of north carolina,with its principal place of business in hickory,north carolina.like,vd manufactures paper towel products for the market.with one exception not relevant to this appeal,vd sells its products throughout the continental united states to janitorial supply distributors who,in turn,sell to customers such as hotels and restaurants.notably,although vd actually sells its products to distributors,it directly markets its products to customers via its sales personnel either by themselves or in conjunction with the sales personnel of distributors making sales calls on such customers to encourage them to purchase vd products from the distributors.brothers raymond von drehle and steven von drehle,who each hold a stake in vd,run the company,with raymond serving as vd chairman and steven as its president.
by,vd knew about and its sales personnel had inspected 
dispensers.then,in july,vd specifically developed a toweling for use in 
dispensers vd toweling.notably,vd toweling is of a lower quality than 
toweling,with a slick,scratchy feel.in a july,vd chairman raymond von drehle told all five members of vd industrial sales team that each would be receiving two rolls of the hardwound which will fit the gp enmotion dispenser and directed them to g ive us some feedback from your customers asap.internal quotation marks omitted.in his deposition in this case,chairman raymond von drehle testified that inherent in his direction was that his sales staff go show the sample toweling to distributors,customers,and have them use it in the enmotion dispenser,in order to get their feedback.he also testified that if he did receive feedback,he could not remember what it was,but that he assumed that it was positive,because he would have remembered negative feedback.
in august,with its newly developed toweling,vd embarked on a sales campaign,through its sales personnel,to put its toweling in the hands of distributors for resale to customers to stuff in 
dispensers the record leaves no doubt on this point.first,at the time vd developed and began selling its toweling,
dispensers were the only paper towel dispensers on the market which could accept a wide toweling.second,vd chairman raymond von drehle and vd sales manager for virginia and north carolina duke thomas,as well as some of vd other sales staff,on occasion even referred to vd toweling as the enmotion towel.third,vd president steven von drehle testified in his deposition on august,that vd intends for the towel to be stuffed in the enmotion dispensers,and that every roll of the towel that has been sold to date,is going to be used in an enmotion dispenser.fourth,vd chairman raymond von drehle testified in his deposition on august,that vd sales force,at least orally,has promoted the use of the towel for use in gp enmotion dispenser,and that vd designed and intended for the toweling to be stuffed in 
dispensers.since vd began selling its toweling in august,its sales of such steadily increased,because its lower quality allowed vd to sell it for a lower price than 
toweling.some of vd sales personnel,however,did receive negative comments from some distributors about the lower quality of vd toweling as compared to 
in early january,after learning of vd stuffing campaign,sent vd a cease and desist letter,informing it that its conduct constituted trademark infringement and tortious interference with contractual relations.in a response letter dated march,vd defended its conduct regarding its toweling as legitimate competition and denied that such conduct infringed intellectual property rights or interfered with its contractual rights.
argued below and continues to argue on appeal that vd,by inducing and facilitating the stuffing of 
dispensers with vd toweling,created confusion as to the source of such toweling among restroom visitors,thus creating the potential to harm its reputation and goodwill.on this issue,the record contains the results of three empirical studies from which a reasonable jury could find that stuffing vd toweling in 
dispensers created a significant amount of consumer confusion as to the source of the paper toweling being dispensed.
in the first study,a national survey conducted in by expert witness,eli seggev of the study participants expected there to be an association of various degrees between the source of 
dispensers and the source of the toweling being dispensed,and expected such toweling to be the same brand as the dispenser.in the second study,conducted in by seggev,of consumers expected there to be an association of various degrees between the source of 
dispensers and the source of the toweling being dispensed,and expected the toweling in 
dispensers to be the same brand as the dispenser.in the third study,conducted in september by vd expert witness kenneth hollander,believed that the paper towel dispenser and the paper toweling being dispensed would originate from the same source.
appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of vd with respect to its contributory trademark infringement and unfair competition claims under the lanham act,its unfair competition claim under north carolina common law,and its tortious interference with contractual relationships claim under north carolina common law.vd the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of with respect to its counterclaim alleging violation of the nc udtpa.
contributory trademark infringement and unfair competition claims under the lanham act and its unfair competition claim under north carolina common law are all based upon the same intentional conduct by,vd express marketing of its toweling to distributors and customers and its selling of such toweling to distributors all for the purpose of customers stuffing toweling in 
dispensers,thus creating confusion as to the source of toweling dispensed from 
dispensers among restroom visitors.notably,the parties do not dispute that,under the facts of this case,viewed in the light most favorable to,the tests for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act are essentially the same as that for common law unfair competition under north carolina common law all focus on the likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods involved.see people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney peta,cir listing same elements for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act and virginia common law of unfair competition amp.foy,cir north carolina law of unfair competition is not dissimilar to the federal law of trademark infringement charcoal steak house of charlotte,staley,under north carolina common law,unfair competition is the child of confusion.moreover,because vd did not itself physically stuff its toweling in 
dispensers,claims under the lanham act and its unfair competition claim under north carolina common law must be analyzed under the judicially created doctrine of contributory trademark infringement,derived from the common law of torts.see inwood,ives,william warner eli lilly,tiffany nj ebay,cir.accordingly,we analyze the three claims simultaneously.all rise or fall,for purposes of this appeal,upon whether has proffered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that vd is liable for contributory trademark infringement.
our first stop on our journey to resolve this question is the supreme court decision in inwood laboratories,ives laboratories.in inwood,the plaintiff,a name brand drug manufacturer,sued three generic drug manufacturers for trademark infringement under of the lanham act,after some pharmacists indisputably mislabeled the generic drug cyclandelate,manufactured by the defendants,as plaintiffs trademarked version cyclospasmol.id.at.although the plaintiff did not allege that the generic manufacturers had actually applied the trademark cyclospasmol to their respective generic versions,the plaintiff did allege the defendants had induced pharmacists illegally to substitute a generic drug for cyclospasmol and to mislabel the substitute drug cyclospasmol,by marketing their cyclospasmol generic versions to wholesalers,hospitals,and retail pharmacies via catalog entries comparing prices and revealing the colors of the generic capsules id.at.
after a bench trial,the district court found the generic manufacturers were not liable for trademark infringement under of the lanham act.inwood,at.
in reaching that conclusion,the court first looked for direct evidence that the generic manufacturers intentionally induced trademark infringement.since the generic manufacturers representatives do not make personal visits to physicians and pharmacists,the y were not in a position directly to suggest improper drug substitutions.therefore,the court concluded,improper suggestions,if any,must have come from catalogs and promotional materials.the court determined,however,that those materials could not fairly be read to suggest trademark infringement.
the trial court next considered evidence of actual instances of mislabeling by pharmacists,since frequent improper substitutions of a generic drug for cyclospasmol could provide circumstantial evidence that the petitioners,merely by making available imitative drugs in conjunction with comparative price advertising,implicitly had suggested that pharmacists substitute improperly.after reviewing the evidence of incidents of mislabeling,the district court concluded that such incidents occurred too infrequently to justify the inference that the generic manufacturers catalogs and use of imitative colors had impliedly invited druggists to mislabel.moreover,to the extent 
mislabeling had occurred,the court found it resulted from pharmacists misunderstanding of the requirements of the new york drug substitution law,rather than from deliberate attempts to pass off generic cyclandelate as cyclospasmol.
id.at internal citations omitted.on appeal,the second circuit,without expressly stating that the district court findings were clearly erroneous,and for reasons not relevant to the issues in the present appeal,concluded that the generic manufacturers had violated of the lanham act.inwood,u.at.
the supreme court then granted certiorari to consider the circumstances under which a manufacturer of a generic drug,designed to duplicate the appearance of a similar drug marketed by a competitor under a registered trademark,can be held vicariously liable for infringement of that trademark by pharmacists who dispense the generic drug.id.at.in resolving this issue,the court held 
l iability for trademark infringement can extend beyond those who actually mislabel goods with the mark of another.even if a manufacturer does not directly control others in the chain of distribution,it can be held responsible for their infringing activities under certain circumstances.thus,if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark,or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement,the manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.
in a subsequent case,the court characterized its ultimate holding in inwood as observing that a manufacturer or distributor could be held liable to the owner of a trademark if it intentionally induced a merchant down the chain of distribution to pass off its product as that of the trademark owner or if it continued to supply a product which could readily be passed off to a particular merchant whom it knew was mislabeling the product with the trademark owner mark.sony of am.universal city studios.
the next step in our analytical journey is to apply the teachings of inwood to the facts of the present case.assuming arguendo that the stuffing of 
dispensers with vd toweling by customers constitutes trademark infringement under the lanham act,the record contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find,under the test for contributory infringement announced in inwood,that vd is liable for contributory trademark infringement.more specifically,assuming arguendo that the stuffing of 
dispensers with vd toweling constitutes trademark infringement,the record contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that vd directly induced such infringement and continued to supply its product to distributors knowing that such infringement was taking place.vd candidly admits that it developed its toweling for the specific purpose of customers stuffing 
dispensers,which dispensers were the only ones on the market at the time to accept wide toweling.moreover,the record supports a finding that vd sales personnel made sales calls on distributors and customers to market vd toweling as a less expensive alternative to 
toweling.and,leaving no doubt as to vd intentions,vd president steven von drehle testified in his deposition,a year and a half after had sent its cease and desist letter to vd,that vd intends for the towel to be stuffed in the enmotion dispensers,and that every roll of the towel that has been sold to date is going to be used in an enmotion dispenser.
because vd can not be liable for contributory trademark infringement without corresponding direct trademark infringement,inwood,at,the next stop on our analytical journey requires us to decide whether the record contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the stuffing of 
dispensers with vd toweling by customers constitutes trademark infringement under the lanham act.we would decide this question in the affirmative,if this record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that possesses one or more trademarks customers used one or more of such trademarks in commerce in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution or advertising of goods,and in a manner likely to cause confusion in the relevant public,a peta,at perini perini,cir amp,foy,cir north carolina law of unfair competition is not dissimilar to the federal law of trademark infringement yellowbrix,yellowbrick solutions,d,the north carolina common law of unfair competition in the context of trademarks and tradenames is similar to the federal law of trademark infringement.
the first element of this test is met on the present record.under the lanham act,a trademark includes any word,name,symbol,or device used by an individual to identify and distinguish his goods from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods,even if that source is unknown.as we recently explained 
a trademark puts the purchasing public on notice that all goods bearing the trademark originated from the same source and are of equal quality.thus,a trademark not only protects the goodwill represented by particular marks,but also allows consumers readily to recognize products and their source,preventing consumer confusion between products and between sources of products.
george,llc imagination entertainment,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.given that has registered the marks with the united states patent and trademark office,from the summary judgment record,a reasonable jury could find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the marks displayed on the 
dispensers are valid and protectable trademarks.see brittingham jenkins,cir under b,a certificate of registration of a mark serves as prima facie evidence that the registrant owns the registered mark,has properly registered it under the lanham act,and is entitled to its exclusive use in commerce thus,under u.a,registration creates a presumption of the registrant ownership of the mark,subject to any applicable legal or equitable defenses or defects.
the second,third,and fourth elements are also met on the present record.by stuffing 
dispensers with vd toweling,customers used one or more of the marks in commerce in connection with the distribution of goods,the distribution of vd toweling.this situation is no different from a hotel placing a brand fountain dispenser in its lobby for the complimentary consumption of its patrons,while surreptitiously stocking it with generic cola.there is no question that,in such a case,the hotel is using the trademark to service its customers,in commerce by distributing generic cola in a brand fountain dispenser.
this brings us to the fifth element,which was the centerpiece of the parties legal battling below.the fifth element focuses upon whether the alleged infringer used the plaintiff trademark in a manner likely to cause confusion in the relevant public.just who is the relevant public or relevant audience to put it differently is the most hotly debated issue on appeal.below,the district court held that vd was entitled to summary judgment in its favor with respect to contributory trademark infringement and unfair competition claims under the lanham act and its unfair competition claim under north carolina common law on the basis that no evidence existed that vd marketing and selling of its toweling for stuffing in 
dispensers caused confusion for the distributors or the customers.in so holding,the district court rejected legal theory that restroom visitors who consume toweling from 
dispensers in hotels,stadiums,and restaurants,constitute the relevant audience for purposes of the required analysis.on appeal,vd defends the district court reasoning,while contends that it is at odds with fourth circuit precedent recognizing that confusion can be actionable under the lanham act.
we agree with that the district court erred in limiting its likelihood of confusion inquiry to distributors who purchased toweling and their respective customers.while transitory public confusion will not satisfy the likelihood of confusion element,fourth circuit case law makes room for the factfinder to consider confusion among the public in the inquiry if it can be shown that public confusion will adversely affect the plaintiff ability to control his reputation among its laborers,lenders,investors,or other group with whom plaintiff interacts.perini,at.
