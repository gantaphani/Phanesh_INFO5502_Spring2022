iii.discussion 
provenzale argues that all questions regarding a preliminary injunction based on the claim are moot.to be cognizable in a federal court,a suit must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests it must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character rice,at.provenzale employment ended on july.by its own terms,the covenant expired one year later,on july.provenzale argues that the relief guy carpenter of an expired agreement through an not available under texas law.
guy carpenter responds that injunctions are equitable in nature and that district courts may impose injunctions that last beyond a contract provision expiration date.see,premier indus.indus.fastener,cir applying texas law and stating that an argument that the trial judge exceeded his discretion by enjoining the appellants beyond the time specified in the contract is without merit.we agree with guy carpenter.the expiration of the contract limit does not make this issue moot.if this court remands,the district court has the power under texas law to craft an injunction that extends beyond the expiration of the covenant.exercising this equitable power might be particularly appropriate given the district court delay before ruling on the motion to reconsider.
we note that neither case provenzale cites in support of his mootness argument is relevant to the facts of this case.see electric dowco electrical products,cir holding an appeal of injunction moot where the injunction expired three months before the appellate court heard arguments in the case john ray sons,stroman,finding that reforming,shortening the length of a covenant would be an exercise in futility because the time limit in the covenant expired before the district court entered judgment.
substantive arguments
