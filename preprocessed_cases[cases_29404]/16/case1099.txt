opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to explore the limits of the all writs act,a,as it relates to actions by one federal court that may affect those in a different federal court.specifically,in this case,natalie grider and kutztown family medicine,representing a class of approximately doctors in central pennsylvania,filed a suit against keystone health plan central,keystone keystone two former owners,highmark,highmark and capital blue cross capital and each company chief executive officer,joseph pfister,john brouse,and james mead.the suit alleges that keystone claims handling practices violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and pennsylvania prompt pay statute.stat.around that time,similar nationwide claims were consolidated by a multidistrict litigation mdl panel in the united states district court for the southern district of florida florida mdl,which declined to add the grider case as an action because it was at a more advanced stage in its proceedings.recently,however,as the parties in the florida mdl moved towards a comprehensive settlement agreement,the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania issued an injunction under the all writs act prohibiting the grider defendants from settling or attempting to settle claims in the florida mdl that would have the effect of also settling the claims in grider.the question presented to us is whether this is a permissible exercise of power under the all writs act.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it is not,and we will therefore vacate the injunction issued by the district court.
a.the grider case 
this case involves a certified class of approximately doctors in central pennsylvania who were providers with the keystone health maintenance organization hmo,which operates exclusively in central pennsylvania.these doctors had signed contracts with keystone to provide medical services to patients who subscribed to the keystone hmo.to receive reimbursement for services they provided to subscribers,the doctors submitted claims on forms provided by keystone,using a standardized set of numerical codes provided by the american medical association,which are referred to as cpt codes.these codes are provided for virtually every medical procedure in order to avoid variations in descriptions given by doctors.because each code only represents a single procedure,one visit to a doctor may result in a reimbursement claim containing multiple cpt codes.a typical claim form,for instance,may have one code for the office visit itself,and another for the administration of a particular test.
during the class period certified by the district court,when a doctor within keystone network submitted one of these claim forms,it was processed through a company named synertech,synertech.synertech is located in central pennsylvania,and used a proprietary software system owned by tingley,to process these claims.
in addition to being reimbursed on a basis,many doctors in keystone network also received reimbursements for certain pools of employees of a large contractual capitation arrangements with keystone.approximately of the certified class members in this case are family practice providers,most of whom were under contractual capitation arrangements with keystone.under these capitation agreements,doctors are paid a set monthly fee in exchange for providing basic medical as examinations and treatment for minor a pool of patients.more complicated medical procedures not on the list of capitation services are supposed to be billed to keystone and paid on a basis.
on october,the plaintiffs in this case filed an action in pennsylvania state court,which the defendants promptly removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the suit alleges that keystone violated rico by not processing and paying claims as it had promised to do in its contracts and other communications with the doctors in its network.according to the plaintiffs,keystone used automated systems and software built into synertech computerized claims processing operations to systematically bundle two or more cpt codes.by doing so,it would pay for only one procedure,thereby reducing payments to doctors.the plaintiffs also allege that keystone used synertech software to systematically downcode the doctors claims by automatically changing the cpt code on a claim form to a less costly procedure.
in terms of the capitation agreements,the plaintiffs allege that keystone secretly reduced monthly capitation payments to participating doctors.specifically,they claim that keystone shaved capitation payments by secretly shifting patients off of a doctor capitation roster to dummy accounts set up by keystone,whereby doctors continued to treat the insured patient and keystone continued to collect premiums for medical insurance paid by or on behalf of the member,but retained those premiums for itself instead of paying them to the doctor and delaying capitation payments to providers for newly enrolled members assigned to that doctor capitation roster.
in addition to these claims,the complaint also alleges violations of pennsylvania prompt pay statute,which requires insurers to reimburse doctors within days after receiving a reimbursement claim.
on december,following three years of discovery,the district court certified a class of providers in the keystone network who were alleged to have been defrauded by the practices described in the complaint.the class includes 
all medical service providers in connection with medical services rendered to patients insured by keystone health plan central who during the period january,through october,
submitted claims for reimbursement on a basis for covered services which claims were denied or reduced through the application of automated edits in the claim processing software used by defendants to process those claims 
received less in capitation payments than the provider was entitled through the use and application of automated systems to shave capitation payments in the manner alleged in plaintiffs amended complaint filed october.
grider keystone health plan,wl.now that the class is certified,the case appears to be headed towards trial.
b.the love and solomon cases in florida 
the grider case was just one of many similar cases that were being filed around the country at the time.on may,three doctors from alabama,one doctor from puerto rico,and the medical societies of south carolina,louisiana,northern virginia,and puerto rico,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of florida against separate blue cross and blue shield companies throughout the united states blues defendants,and their national trade association,the blue cross and blue shield association the association.capital and highmark are among the specifically named defendants,but keystone is not the case,which is now known as the love case formerly,it was known as thomas,was eventually assigned to district judge federico moreno.it alleges a national conspiracy among the blues defendants,with the association as the hub,to bundle and downcode claims and to delay payments to providers under contract with the defendant hmos.
on november,thirteen chiropractic physicians,podiatrists,physical therapists,and psychologists from florida,texas,oregon,and arizona filed the action now known as solomon.the solomon case involves essentially the same claims as love.as in love,both capital and highmark are named defendants.although the complaint purports to include the subsidiaries of all of the named defendants as defendants themselves,it does not specifically list keystone as a defendant in the case.
the love and solomon cases are part of the consolidated multidistrict proceedings being conducted in the united states district court for the southern district of florida mdl pursuant to.on march,highmark and capital filed notice with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation pursuant to c ii arguing that the grider case would be appropriate for transfer to the florida mdl proceedings as a action.keystone did not join the motion to transfer.on august,the chairman of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation entered an order denying transfer of the grider case to the florida mdl.the order explained that 
while grider shares some questions of fact with actions in this litigation previously centralized in the southern district of florida,inclusion of grider in proceedings in the southern district of florida will not necessarily serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation.we point out that grider is nearly three years old with a discovery cutoff date of less than five months away.moreover,alternatives to section transfer exist that can minimize whatever possibilities there might be of duplicate discovery,inconsistent pretrial rulings,or both.
grider,wl,quoting judicial panel on multidistrict litigation order denying transfer,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the grider case continued to proceed independently of the florida mdl.
grider injunction decision 
on november,highmark counsel announced that highmark had joined a substantial majority of blues defendants in love who had decided to settle that litigation,and that the grider claims would be released under a broad release negotiated as part of that settlement.however,because of the confidentiality of the pending settlement agreement,highmark counsel would not discuss any details at that time.plaintiffs counsel in love subsequently confirmed that highmark had agreed to settle the love litigation,and that the release in love would also release claims against all present and former subsidiaries of any defendant in love,which would include keystone.
after learning of this pending settlement agreement,the plaintiffs in grider filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against highmark,capital,and other,to enjoin them from settling the grider claims as part of the florida love and solomon settlements.subsequently,on january,the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania granted the injunction sought by the plaintiffs.its order provides that 
it is ordered that plaintiffs motion for an injunction is granted.
it is furth e r ordered that pursuant to the all writs act,a,the court enjoins defendants keystone health plan central,highmark,john brouse capital blue cross james mead joseph pfister their attorneys,including,but not limited to,michael martinez,kimberly krupka,kathleen taylor sooy,sandra girifalco,mary hackett,steven siff and their respective law firms and anyone acting o n their behalf or in concert with them,from settling,or attempting to settle,the class and subclass claims in,or any part of,the within litigation,which claims the undersigned certified by order and opinion dated december,and filed december,and which are pending before this court,in any other forum without the express approval of this court.
it is further ordered that the aforesaid persons and firms are specifically enjoined from settling,or attempting to settle,the certified class and subclass claims in,or in any part of,the within matter in the multidistrict litigation currently pending before united states district judge federico moreno in case number mdl in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,miami division,in the cases known as love,et blue cross and blue shield association,et,case number solomon,et blue cross and blue shield association,et,case number and any other related case or cases.
in granting this injunction,the district court explained that i n doing so,i am not enjoining judge moreno from taking any action in his mdl cases in florida.nor am i enjoining any of the parties in the florida litigation,including highmark,and capital blue cross,from settling any of the florida plaintiffs claims in the florida litigation,which in my view are different than the class claims which i certified in this pennsylvania litigation.id.at.the court emphasized that the defendants will still be able to settle the love and solomon claims in florida.id.at.
indeed,the district court arrived at this view,in part,based on statements from the defendants themselves,who had argued at various times earlier in the proceedings that the grider case was distinct from the florida mdl.in response to discovery requests regarding the florida mdl,for example,capital stated that the mdl concerns unrelated defendants with different payment policies,different payment practices,and different payment software,and explained that love and solomon do not involve defendant keystone health plan central hmo.
proposed settlement agreement reached in love 
on april,after engaging in mediation,the plaintiffs in the love case announced that they had reached a settlement with a majority of the named defendants.the settlement provides that the settling defendants will pay million to members of the settlement class and will adopt a range of new policies and procedures concerning their business practices.in exchange,the settling defendants will be released from all causes of action,judgments,and claims of every kind that were or could have been asserted against any of the released parties by reason of,arising out of,or in any way related to the transactions and conduct giving rise to the settlement agreement.love blue cross blue shield association et.settlement agreement,at.the settlement class is defined in the agreement as 
a ny and all physicians,physician groups and physician organizations who provided covered services to any plan member or any individual enrolled in or covered by a plan offered or administered by any person named as a defendant in the complaint or by any other primary licensee of the blue cross and blue shield association or by any of their respective current or former subsidiaries or affiliates,in each case from may,through the preliminary approval date.the class shall exclude i all persons who,in accordance with the terms of this agreement,execute a timely request for exclusion from the class and ii the blue parties,their affiliates and any of their officers,directors and employees.
id.at.under this definition,the love settlement class would include grider and nearly all of the pennsylvania physicians she represents in the grider litigation.
in light of the progressing settlement activity in the florida mdl and the likelihood that it will impact the claims in grider,the affected parties have filed the appeals currently before this court.specifically,currently before us are the consolidated appeals of capital,james mead,keystone,and joseph pfister highmark and john brouse and crowell moring and its attorneys.
we exercise jurisdiction over this case pursuant to a.when determining whether or not a district court has the authority to issue an injunction under the all writs act,we exercise plenary review.see,in re diet drugs prods.liab.litig.ii,cir.once that authority has been established,a district court decision to issue such an injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.in addition,w e review the terms of an injunction for an abuse of discretion,underlying questions of law receive de novo review,and factual determinations are reviewed for clear error.id.quoting in re prudential ins.of am.sales practice,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the all writs act provides that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.the all writs act confers on courts extraordinary powers that are firmly circumscribed.alabama army corps of eng rs,cir quoting itt cmty.dev.barton,cir.
typically,the all writs act has been used by federal courts to enjoin action by state courts that threatens the federal court jurisdiction.in this context,the act restricts injunctions under the all writs act that have the effect of staying a state court proceeding to those expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of a federal court jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
in in re diet drugs products liability litigation i,cir in re diet drugs,for example,we upheld an injunction that had been issued under the all writs act to stop the parties from litigating in state court.there,patients had brought various class action cases against diet drug manufacturers after a link had been discovered between the drugs and valvular heart disease,and the cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.id.at.after the consolidation,the court issued an order conditionally certifying a class containing six million members and approving a settlement agreement that had been reached.as this was happening,however,one of the plaintiffs whose case had been transferred to the mdl filed an action in texas state court,seeking to certify an independent class.in so doing,that plaintiff sought an order from the texas court all of the members of this new class from the pennsylvania mdl settlement class,which was granted.id.at.in response,the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania issued an order enjoining and declaring the texas court order null and void.id.at.
in upholding the injunction,we were careful to explain the narrow circumstances under which such an order would be appropriate without more,it may not be sufficient that prior resolution of a state court action will deprive a federal court of the opportunity to resolve the merits of a parallel action in federal court.id.at.rather,t he traditional notion is that in personam actions in federal and state court may proceed concurrently,without interference from either court,and there is no evidence that the exception to was intended to alter this balance.id.quoting vendo,d plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted.as we explained,
i n ordinary actions in personam,e ach court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time,without reference to the proceedings in the other court.whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other,the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principle of res adjudicata by the court in which the action is still pending 
id.quoting kline burke constr.
thus,we concluded in in re diet drugs that it may not be sufficient that state actions risk some measure of inconvenience or duplicative litigation.id.citing in re,cir.rather,an injunction under the all writs act is appropriate only when the state court action threatens to frustrate proceedings and disrupt the orderly resolution of the federal litigation.id.quoting winkler eli lilly,cir.that is,the state action must not simply threaten to reach judgment first,it must interfere with the federal court own path to judgment.id.
of course,to the extent that this framework is useful in the current context,it is important to note that we are dealing with the use of the all writs act to enjoin another federal court,not a state court.although the appellants repeatedly resort to the rule explained above that parallel proceedings do not disturb the jurisdiction of either court,we made it clear long ago that this rule generally applies only when one court is a state court and the other is a federal court.as we explained,the parallel proceedings rule clearly ha s no application to a situation in which two actions are pending in courts of equal dignity within the judicial system of a single sovereignty.crosley hazeltine,cir.in any event,this is not important here because grider and the florida mdl cases are not actually parallel proceedings,as we have traditionally used that term.to be considered parallel proceedings,t he one must be materially on all fours with the other t he issues must have such an identity that a determination in one action leaves little or nothing to be determined in the other.smith,cir quoting congress credit ajc int l,cir.although there is overlap between grider and the florida mdl cases,none of the parties contend that they are identical in this regard.
although in re diet drugs concerned an injunction against action in a state thus involved the terms of the is still instructive in the instant case.indeed,the lack of cases in which the all writs act has been used to enjoin settlement efforts in another federal court is telling.it is clear that the act is generally used to prohibit activities in another court that threaten to undermine a pending settlement in the enjoining court.see,carlough amchem,cir upholding an all writs act injunction directed at a state court action that threatened to derail a pending settlement in a complex multidistrict class action case.when the act has been used to block settlement efforts in another court,it is typically because a party was deliberately using that forum to circumvent a pending settlement agreement in the enjoining court.this was the case in both in re lease oil antitrust litigation,d,and in re managed care litigation,d.
in in re lease oil antitrust litigation,an mdl panel had consolidated a series of cases asserting violations of federal antitrust laws in the united states district court for the southern district of texas.after this consolidation,other plaintiffs filed an antitrust suit in alabama state court,which did not include the federal claims.in the state forum,a settlement was proposed that would have released the federal claims pending in the texas mdl.d at.facing this situation,the texas mdl court explained that an injunction was necessary to protect its jurisdiction over the exclusively federal antitrust claims the court needs to act in order to prevent the parties before it from possibly pursuing an inadequate or collusive settlement in state courts which would release the apparently stronger claims in the instant case.id.at.thus,the court enjoined the parties before it from entering into settlements in any other forum without its approval.
the clearest example of a court applying the all writs act to enjoin settlement efforts in another federal court actually came in the context of the florida mdl in this very case.in in re managed care litigation,the united states district court for the southern district of florida found that one of the defendants had attempted to circumvent its authority by filing and immediately attempting to settle a suit in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois.d at.the court explained that 
a dmittedly,in most instances,the issuance of an injunction would be in order to protect a settlement.here,instead this court seeks to prevent a settlement.this court is well aware of the strong public interest favoring settlements.however,it can not turn a blind eye to the underhanded maneuvers cigna took to obtain this settlement agreement.cigna snookered both this court and judge murphy in illinois in an obvious attempt to avoid this court jurisdiction.
id.at emphasis in original.accordingly,the florida court,emphasizing its role as an mdl court,enjoined cigna from participating in the illinois settlement.
based on the limited precedent in this area,there does not appear to be any basis for the injunction in this case.although significant resources have been invested in the grider litigation to this point,there is simply no support for the proposition that a court may enjoin parties from participating in or reaching a bona fide settlement in another federal court that may dispose of claims before when there is no pending settlement in the enjoining court and the other federal court is an mdl court charged with attempting to reach a global settlement 
first,unlike in in re lease oil antitrust litigation and in re managed care litigation,there is no evidence of any collusion or wrongdoing by the grider defendants.rather,there is a consolidated mdl in florida that appears to have reached a settlement on claims similar to the ones in grider after mediation.indeed,because of the injunction issued by the district court,attorneys from capital and highmark were not even at the table when the existing settlement agreement was formed,subduing any suggestion that they were trying to manipulate the settlement to deliberately affect the grider claims.
second,a n injunction under the all writs act invokes the equitable power of the court thus,as is similarly the case for
