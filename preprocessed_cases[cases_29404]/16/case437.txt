this case raises a new issue of importance under the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.the question is whether the doctrine of issue preclusion applies so as to bind one state commission to apply the findings and conclusions of another state commission in disputes between the same parties about the interpretation of identical contract language contained in different state interconnection agreements.
the district court concluded that the full faith and credit clause compelled application of the doctrine.its order bound the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte,which was interpreting a massachusetts interconnection agreement between global naps,global and verizon new england,verizon,to follow the earlier decision of the rhode island public utility commission ripuc as to the effect of a prior order by the federal communications commission fcc on the parties rhode island interconnection agreement.on de novo review,we reverse.the district court reasoning is contrary to the language of and policies behind the tca.
underlying this legal issue is the question of whether verizon owes an estimated to million in payments to global as reciprocal compensation for calls placed by verizon customers to global customers connected through an internet service provider isp in massachusetts during the period from july,to june.
the dte ruled on june,that verizon did not owe the reciprocal compensation sought.on global federal court challenge to the dte order,the court vacated and remanded the dte order,ruling that the dte could not base its decision on an interpretation of the interconnection agreement that was contrary to the interpretation reached by the ripuc on that point its remand,however,also allowed that differences between massachusetts and rhode island law might lead the dte to a different ultimate outcome as to payment of reciprocal compensation.global naps,verizon new,global naps ii,d.verizon and the dte took this interlocutory appeal.we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
the tca was enacted to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers.stat.at.one of the overriding aims of the tca was to introduce competition into the market for local telephone service,which previously had been monopolized by entities created after the break up of the american telephone and telegraph company at t.see verizon commc ns.fcc,d.under the tca,incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs that is,the former local phone allow competitive local exchange carriers clecs to interconnect with their phone networks.see c.interconnection allows customers of clecs to receive calls from,and place calls to,customers of ilecs.
the tca imposes a number of duties on local exchange carriers.see id.most important,for present purposes,is the duty of all local exchange carriers,whether incumbent or competitive,to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.id.b.as between two local exchange carriers,a reciprocal compensation arrangement is one in which each of the two carriers receives compensation from the other carrier for the transport and termination on each carrier network facilities of telecommunications traffic that originates on the network facilities of the other carrier.for example,generally when a customer of local exchange carrier a calls a customer of local exchange carrier that b must complete the must share with b some of the revenues it receives from its customer to compensate b for use of its facilities.see.bell.worldcom,cir.the fcc has ruled that the reciprocal compensation obligations under b only extend to traffic that begins and terminates within a local area.see local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of,wl subsequent history omitted pac.bell telecomm,cir.
the tca requires ilecs to negotiate interconnection agreements with clecs to provide the terms of interconnection and fulfill the duties enumerated in,including the duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements.c.these agreements can be concluded through voluntary negotiation or mediation,id.a,or if these methods fail,through compulsory arbitration,id.b.alternatively,a clec has the option of adopting one of the ilec interconnection agreements that had been previously approved within that state.id.i.once the parties finalize their interconnection agreement,it must be submitted to the relevant state commission for approval.id.e.
a battle has ensued over whether traffic is local telecommunications traffic subject to reciprocal compensation within the meaning of the tca.see,bell atl.fcc.the debate centers around the question of whether isp traffic terminates at an isp when a user in one state dials into a local isp and visits a website hosted on a server in another state.the issue could be argued both ways.one could consider such calls to terminate at the isp,with communications between the isp and the website considered a separate transaction unrelated to the call.alternatively,one might consider the call to have terminated in the state where the web server is located.see id.at.generally,clecs like global tend to have more isp customers than do ilecs like verizon.since isps receive calls that are generally much longer than voice calls,and do not place calls of their own,carriers with more isp customers will be net beneficiaries of a reciprocal compensation scheme that includes isp traffic.clecs and ilecs,then,have opposing interests.see id.at.
in,global and verizon began negotiations for an interconnection agreement in rhode island.global naps ii,d at.rather than submitting their dispute over reciprocal compensation for isp traffic to arbitration,verizon and global agreed to the following compromise provision,the language of which is at the heart of the present dispute 
the parties disagree as to whether isp traffic constitutes local traffic as defined herein,and the charges to be assessed in connection with such traffic.the issue of whether such traffic constitutes local traffic on which reciprocal compensation mus t be paid pursuant to the tca is presently before the fcc in and may be before a court of competent jurisdiction.the parties agree that the decision of the fcc in that proceeding,or of such court,shall determine whether such traffic is local traffic as defined herein and the charges to be assessed in connection with isp traffic.if the fcc or such court determines that isp traffic is local traffic,as defined herein,or otherwise determines that isp traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation,it shall be compensated as local traffic under this agreement unless another compensation scheme is required under such fcc or court determination.until resolution of this issue,verizon agrees to pay gnaps reciprocal compensation for isp traffic emphasis added 
contemporaneous interconnection agreements between global and verizon in new york,maine,new hampshire,and vermont contained an identical provision.the massachusetts interconnection agreement in effect between the parties at this time did not contain this provision.
on february,the fcc issued its ruling in docket no,the proceeding specifically referred to in in this decision,the fcc concluded that traffic is largely interstate and thus did not fall under the reciprocal compensation duties imposed by.local competition provisions in the telecomms.act internet traffic order,wl.the fcc suggested that its decision might cause some state commissions to their decisions to the extent that they are based on a finding that isp traffic terminates at an isp server.id.at.but the fcc also stated that it did not intend to preclude state commissions from determining,pursuant to contractual principles or other legal or equitable considerations,that reciprocal compensation is an appropriate interim compensation rule pending final rulemaking by the fcc on such compensation for.id.
soon after the fcc issued the internet traffic order,verizon stopped making reciprocal compensation payments to global under the rhode island interconnection agreement and other agreements containing.global filed a complaint with the ripuc under the rhode island agreement,contending that it was entitled to continued payments because the condition for resolution of the issue had not been met it argued that the internet traffic order had left to state commissions the ability to determine whether reciprocal compensation payments were required under contractual principles or other legal or equitable considerations.verizon argued to the contrary that the fcc had effectively resolved the issue in deciding that isp traffic was interstate traffic not subject to the reciprocal compensation duties imposed by.the ripuc agreed with global and found that the internet traffic order did not resolve the issue of whether isp traffic constitutes local traffic for which reciprocal compensation must be paid under the interconnection agreement.it relied in part on a prior order in which it had held that in the absence of a federal rule establishing an appropriate interstate mechanism,it had the authority to resolve disputes concerning reciprocal compensation provisions contained in interconnection agreements.it appears that at the time,the ripuc had not yet come to any conclusion on whether isp traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation it had only just opened a general inquiry into the issue.the ripuc remarkably concluded the undisputed fact that global has filed a complaint against verizon creates a presumption that the issue has not been resolved.since verizon could not rebut this presumption,ripuc found that clearly and unambiguously requires verizon to make reciprocal payments to global.verizon did not contest this ruling,and resumed reciprocal compensation payments to global for isp traffic in rhode island.
meanwhile,in massachusetts,the story developed quite differently.global naps and verizon first interconnection agreement in massachusetts was signed in global naps ii,d at.in october,the dte ruled that fcc precedent bound it to conclude that isp traffic was subject to reciprocal compensation.id.but after the fcc issued its internet traffic order,the dte revisited its october decision.in may,the dte held that as of february,the date of the internet traffic order,local exchange carriers in massachusetts were no longer required to pay reciprocal compensation for traffic.id.at.in this order,the dte referred to the internet traffic order as liberating,since it had previously felt bound by fcc precedent to treat isp traffic as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation under the tca id.
on march,in the first appeal of the internet traffic order,the circuit vacated the internet traffic order and remanded to the fcc,finding that the fcc rationale for treating traffic as interstate traffic for the purposes of reciprocal compensation was inadequate.see bell atl.at.the circuit was to revisit this issue later.
in the interim,on june,the fcc approved the merger of verizon predecessors into verizon.see application of gte,transferor,and bell atl,transferee merger order,wl.as one of the conditions for approval of the merger,the fcc required verizon to allow a clec in any one state to adopt any of verizon interconnection agreements previously approved by a different state commission.id.app.d at see also i allowing a clec to adopt one of an ilec interconnection agreements previously approved within that state.the provision containing this condition is referred to by the parties and the district court as paragraph.paragraph included the following language verizon shall not be obligated to provide pursuant to this paragraph any interconnection arrangement unless it is consistent with the laws and regulatory requirements of the state for which the request is made.merger order,at.
on july,global notified verizon that,pursuant to paragraph,it wished to adopt the rhode island interconnection agreement for the parties dealings in massachusetts.however,verizon and global disagreed as to whether could be adopted under paragraph.on november,the parties agreed that,effective back to july,global could adopt in massachusetts all provisions of the rhode island agreement that were consistent with paragraph,thus reserving verizon right to contest the adoption of.during pendency of negotiations between the parties,verizon did not pay global reciprocal compensation for traffic.
on april,global filed a complaint with the fcc,claiming it was entitled to adopt and seeking damages based on its interpretation of that section.on february,the fcc held that verizon was required to offer the entire rhode island agreement,including,to global in massachusetts.see global naps,paragraph order,wl.importantly,it also noted that under the terms of paragraph,only the relevant state commission may ultimately decide whether particular terms of the agreement should be adopted in that state,and if so,what those terms mean.id.at emphasis added.the fcc also held that global damages claim was premature because the dte had yet to approve an interconnection agreement between the parties that contained the contested provision.id.at.
in the meantime,the fcc issued an order in response to the circuit remand of the internet traffic order.see local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of order on remand,wl.in the order on remand,the fcc held once again that the provisions of section b do not extend to traffic but rested its decision on different legal grounds.id.at.in addition,the fcc set up a new compensation scheme for traffic,which would become effective starting june.the fcc also made clear that it had exclusive regulatory authority to address the issue,so that state commissions no longer have the power to do the same.id.at.in its consideration of the order on remand,the circuit held that the fcc could not validly base its actions on the new legal grounds.see worldcom,fcc.it did not vacate the fcc order,but found the agency needed to provide a different rationale.id.at.the result is that the order on remand still remains in force.see verizon.global naps,cir.
thus,the parties here agree that the order on remand resolved the question of reciprocal compensation for isp traffic by setting up a new compensation scheme from june,going forward but in massachusetts there remains the question of reciprocal compensation for traffic between july,when the language of the rhode island agreement went into effect in massachusetts through the massachusetts interconnection agreement and june,when the alternative compensation scheme in the order on remand went into effect.see global naps ii,d at.
in march,verizon submitted the massachusetts interconnection agreement containing terms identical to those in the rhode island agreement for retrospective approval by the dte.before the dte,global argued that since it and verizon had fully litigated the issue of whether the internet traffic order was resolution of this issue under the identically worded rhode island agreement before the ripuc,the dte was collaterally estopped from relitigating the same.the dte rejected global argument.the dte approved the massachusetts agreement in its entirety on june,but held that it was not bound by ripuc interpretation and reached its own interpretation.it noted that paragraph allowed the dte to ensure that the agreement was consistent with the laws and regulatory requirements of the state for which the request is made.the dte made note of its prior particular,its may order finding that the internet traffic order had held that isp traffic was interstate traffic and thus not subject to reciprocal compensation under the tca.the dte concluded that based on this precedent it was required to find that the internet traffic order was resolution of the issue under the meaning of.therefore,global was not entitled to reciprocal compensation for traffic during the relevant time period,between july,and june.
global filed suit challenging the dte ruling global asserted a number of claims in its complaint,including,most importantly for our review,a claim that the dte decision not to be bound by the ripuc decision on the issue violated the full faith and credit clause of the constitution.see global naps ii,d at.the district court issued a lengthy and thoughtful decision on august,granting in part global motion for summary judgment.id.at.the court found the ripuc conclusion regarding the effect of the internet traffic order on could not be relitigated before the dte.id.at.the court noted,however,that it was possible that,in view of the state of the law in rhode island in,the issue was not resolved,but,in view of the state of the law in massachusetts,the issue was resolved.id.at.thus,the court remanded the case to the dte to determine whether and when massachusetts state legal or equitable principles that might serve as the foundation of any obligation to pay reciprocal compensation were so that the issue was resolved within the meaning of the parties agreement through a combination of the internet traffic order and massachusetts state law.id.at.
verizon and the dte each appealed,arguing that the district court incorrectly applied the full faith and credit clause.global,claiming that the district court erred in remanding the case to the dte rather than reversing the dte decision outright.
we first address the question of appellate jurisdiction.
while neither party challenges jurisdiction,w e have an obligation to inquire sua sponte into our jurisdiction over the matter.doyle huntress,cir citing florio olson,cir it is clear that the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to review state agency determinations under the tca for compliance with federal law,pursuant to.global naps,verizon new,cir.however,subject to a few exceptions not applicable here,we have appellate jurisdiction only over final decisions of the district courts under.generally,a district court order that remands to an administrative agency for further proceedings is not considered a final decision within the meaning of.see mall,marsh,cir.here we are faced with a remand order.
verizon and the dte argue that we nonetheless have jurisdiction over this appeal because it falls in the category of cases in which an immediate appeal by a governmental agency is allowed,because otherwise the agency would be unlikely to obtain review.colon sec y of health human,cir see also marsh,at suggesting jurisdiction would be appropriate in cases where unless review is accorded immediately,the agency likely would not be able to obtain review.
this court has recognized our ability to review orders remanding agency proceedings in situations similar to this one.see colon,at united states alcon,cir lopez lopez sec y of health,educ.welfare,cir.
for example,in colon,the district court had remanded a social security disability insurance benefits case to the secretary of health and human services,ordering him to reopen an earlier decision that had denied benefits.colon,at.the secretary appealed that order.we found that we had appellate jurisdiction because otherwise the secretary was unlikely to obtain review of this important issue which is distinct from the underlying merits of the claim of disability.id.we noted that if the secretary decided to grant benefits on remand,it would be doubtful whether the secretary could then appeal from his own decision to grant benefits.id.even if the secretary decided to deny benefits,a rguing that the district court has no jurisdiction to order the secretary to reopen a previous final decision after that decision,in fact,has been reopened is largely an academic exercise.id.at.
similarly,the eleventh circuit,in considering a tca case,held that it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal by the florida public service commission and bellsouth of a district court order remanding the case to the state commission 
t here is a widely recognized distinction between remands where a district court simply orders the agency to proceed under a certain legal standard,and in situations where a district court remands for further consideration of evidence.a remand order generally is found appealable in the former cases because the agency,forced to conform its decision to the district court mandate,can not appeal its own subsequent order.
mci telecomms.bellsouth telecomms,cir internal citation omitted citing occidental petroleum sec.other circuits considering an appeal under the tca challenging a district court order that had remanded to a state commission seem to have assumed they had jurisdiction sub silentio.see.bell.mccarty,cir sw.bell.pub.util.comm n,cir us commc ns,jennings,cir mci telecomm.bell,cir at t commc ns of the states,bellsouth telecomms,cir.
for reasons similar to those given in colon,we hold we have appellate jurisdiction over this matter.the circumstances of this case make clear that if review is denied at this stage,the dte will be unable to obtain review of this important issue distinct from the underlying merits of the claim of disability,see colon,at,because the district court has simply order ed the agency to proceed under a certain legal standard,mci,at internal quotation marks omitted.if on remand from the district court,the dte were to reverse course and find that global was due reciprocal compensation,the dte would be unable to appeal its own order for the purpose of raising the issue raised here.even if one of the parties appealed this hypothetical later decision,the dte would be placed in the awkward position of challenging the district court original decision,while simultaneously defending its subsequent order applying the district court legal standards.alternatively,if the dte once again denies global claim for reciprocal compensation,and global were to once again appeal this determination,the dte appeal of the district court original ruling would be largely an academic exercise of little practical significance.see colon,at.in this scenario,the most salient issue on appeal would instead be whether the dte alternative grounds were sufficient to support its decision.
since we have jurisdiction over dte appeal,we may also hear verizon appeal raising the same issue.see mci,at hearing appeal of both the state commission and a private party naacp sugar,w hat matters for the purposes of our appellate jurisdiction is whether the district court not any particular party challenging properly before us.
global is a different matter.global argues that the district court erred in ordering a remand to the dte rather than reversing the dte decision outright.in a nutshell,global argument is that the dte is constrained by its own administrative precedent from finding that reciprocal compensation can not be paid.these arguments go to the heart of the underlying debate between global and verizon,and in making these arguments global asks us to reach issues not decided by the district court.we decline to do so,and find that global is not properly before us.
we turn now to the merits of the appeal.the district court held 
a state public utility commission conclusions of state law relating to an interconnection agreement are entitled to preclusive effect in subsequent proceedings before other states public utility commissions to the same extent that they would receive preclusive effect in the first state courts.
global naps ii,d at.it implicitly held that rhode island law would require the dte to be bound by the ripuc decision.the district court based its decision on its view that principles of collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,rooted in the full faith and credit clause required such a holding.see avx cabot,cir describing the difference between issue and claim preclusion.we review this conclusion of federal law de novo.
the full faith and credit clause provides full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records,and judicial proceedings of every other state.and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,records,and proceedings shall be proved,and the effect thereof.const.art.iv.congress,exercising its power under this provision,passed,which provides that the acts,records and judicial proceedings of any state shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from which they are taken.
there is no claim that the full faith and credit clause compels full faith and credit be given to the unreviewed decisions of state administrative agencies.and,under university of tennessee elliott,d,the statute,does not apply to unreviewed decisions of state administrative agencies.however,supreme court precedent makes clear that we must determine whether application of a federal common law rule of issue preclusion is appropriate here.
to set the scene,we describe briefly the requirements of federal issue preclusion law,but do not rest on that ground.we also assume arguendo that issue preclusion applies to an unreviewed administrative agency proceeding see bath iron works,office of workers,cir t he subject of preclusion in administrative contexts is a complex one,with many variations and it is perhaps well not to generalize too broadly.
in monarch life insurance ropes gray,cir this court set forth the following federal preclusion principles both the proceedings involved the same issue of law or fact the parties actually litigated the issue in the prior proceeding the first court actually resolved the issue in a final and binding judgment and its resolution of that issue of law or fact was essential to its judgment,necessary to its holding.id.at emphases in original see also in re bankvest capital,cir.we have serious doubts about whether this test could be met on the facts presented here,because it is not at all clear that the ripuc and the dte decided the same issue of law or fact.the ripuc here came to the conclusion that federal law viz,the internet traffic order did not resolve the issue within the meaning of the parties rhode island agreement,relying at least in part on the fact that the question of reciprocal compensation was still open in rhode island.the dte,in contrast,found that the internet traffic order did resolve the issue,but based its finding on its well established position on the issue of reciprocal compensation.indeed,as of may,after the internet traffic order had liberat ed it from its earlier assumption that federal law required reciprocal compensation,the dte had come to a settled conclusion that reciprocal compensation was not required 
it is against the backdrop of its may order that the dte decided the present question of whether the fcc internet traffic order resolved the issue of reciprocal compensation for traffic.no similar position guided the ripuc in making its decision.it is difficult,then,to see for preclusion purposes why the dte and ripuc decided the same issue of law or fact.see wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.preclusion may be defeated by showing that there has been a substantial change in the legal climate suggesting a new understanding of the governing legal rules that may require a different application.
nonetheless,we do not rest on this ground because there is of necessity a prior analysis.as the supreme court made clear in elliott,we must first answer the preliminary question of whether application of a federal common law rule of issue preclusion would be consistent with congress intent in enacting the tca.elliott,at.see also astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d.we find that,on the facts of this case,it would not.
elliott controls the structure of analysis.in elliott,a discharged employee of the university had filed a complaint with a state administrative agency,claiming his discharge was racially motivated.at.when his claims were denied by the state agency,rather than seeking review in the state courts,the employee went to federal district court with claims under title vii of the civil rights act of,the constitution,and the civil rights statutes.id.the district court granted summary judgment for the university on the ground that the state administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect.id.at.the supreme court noted first that the full faith and credit statute,did not apply to unreviewed administrative factfinding.id.at.as a result,the court had to fashion federal rules of preclusion in the absence of a governing statute.id.it determined that,with respect to the employee title vii claim,the question of whether the state administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect depended on whether a rule of preclusion would be consistent with congress s intent in enacting title vii.id.at.the court concluded based on the language and legislative history of title vii that congress did not intend unreviewed state administrative proceedings to have preclusive effect on title vii claims.see also solimino,at.holding that unreviewed findings of a state administrative agency with respect to an age discrimination claim had no preclusive effect on federal proceedings under the age discrimination in employment act.in resolving the present dispute,we ask the same question as to congressional intent in enacting the tca.
the district court distinguished elliott and solimino because a s they involved decisions to be made by the federal government,rather than a state,they were governed by the common law of issue preclusion rather than the full faith and credit clause.id.at.however,there is nothing in those cases to suggest that their holdings on the preclusive reach of judicially unreviewed decisions of state agencies were limited to situations where the subsequent case was in federal court.
in order to find that issue preclusion applies,the district court held that there is nothing explicit or implicit in the tca that indicates that congress intended to depart from the traditional rules of preclusion.id.we disagree.our examination of the tca leads us to conclude that to apply principles of issue preclusion,at least in the situation presented here,would contravene the intent of congress.
in a sense,issue preclusion rules are about allocation of authority to decide a question.general application of the federal common law of issue preclusion would threaten two different allocations of power under the tca the allocation among the commissions of each state as to the effectuation of their state policies and the allocation of power between the fcc and the states.
the model under the tca is to divide authority among the fcc and the state commissions in an unusual regime of cooperative federalism,see.telecomms.regulatory,cir,with the intended effect of leaving state commissions free,where warranted,to reflect the policy choices made by their states.see huber et,federal telecommunications law ed.rather than placing the entire scope of regulatory authority in the federal government,congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation under the prior regime.id,at.we see little indication that congress intended its explicit allocation of authority between state commissions to be generally displaced by common law rules that themselves allocate authority.
the goal of preserving a role for the state regulatory commissions is reflected in a number of provisions in the tca.congress expressly left with the states the power to enforce any regulation,order,or policy of a state commission that establishes access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers is consistent with the requirements of this section and does not substantially prevent implementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.d.while the tca prevents states and localities from passing laws hav ing the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications service,id.a,it allows a state to impose,on a competitively neutral basis,requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service,protect the public safety and welfare,ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services,and safeguard the rights of consumers,id.b.
the role played by state commissions is especially important with respect to interconnection agreements.state commissions are given the authority to resolve though arbitration or mediation any open issues in ongoing negotiations
