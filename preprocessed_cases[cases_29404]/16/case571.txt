this appeal requires us to address,apparently for the first time,several provisions contained in new york franchised motor vehicle dealer act the dealer act,codified at new york vehicle and traffic law sections.the plaintiff,beck chevrolet,is the proprietor of a chevrolet dealership of the same name the corporation and dealership are referred to hereinafter collectively as beck.beck brought suit against its franchisor,general motors,llc gm,for claims arising under the dealer act,and state contract law claims,for imposition of unfair and unreasonable performance standards,unfair modification of the franchise agreement,and refusal to deliver vehicles.the district court alvin hellerstein,judge,granted gm motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims in beck first amended complaint,but granted it leave to assert two claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under the dealer act,sections c and gg.following a bench trial,the district court dismissed the second amended complaint and gm counterclaim for rescission of the franchise agreement.it also denied each party application for attorney fees.
several of the issues we must consider in order to resolve this appeal require that we address unsettled questions of new york law.beck challenges the district court rulings that gm performance metrics are neither unfair nor unreasonable and that gm expansion of beck sales area did not constitute a modification of its franchise agreement under section of the dealer act.we conclude that new york state law is insufficiently developed in these areas to enable us to predict with confidence how the new york court of appeals would resolve these questions.we therefore certify to the court of appeals two questions concerning the application of the dealer act.we affirm the district court dismissal of beck claims for attorney fees and unfair allocation of vehicles,and gm counterclaim for rescission of the participation agreement.
background 
beck,located in yonkers,new york,is a retail dealer in chevrolet automobiles.it is operated under a set of franchise agreements entered into with the defendant,gm,which is a limited liability company whose sole member is a citizen of delaware with its principal place of business in michigan.
in,general motors old gm entered into widely reported bankruptcy proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.in the course of those proceedings,old gm,the defendant gm predecessor corporation,sought to shrink its dealer network in an effort to reduce competition among retail dealers in general motors automobiles and improve the profitability of the remaining individual franchises.
as part of this effort,old gm offered two types of agreements to its franchisees.some were offered a participation agreement,under which their franchises would continue,while others were offered a wind down agreement,under which their franchises would be terminated in exchange for cash payments to them.beck initially executed a wind down agreement in which it agreed to terminate its operations in or before october in exchange for a payment to beck of approximately.
old gm subsequently sold substantially all of its assets and assigned its interest in all its participation and wind down agreements with franchisees to gm,the defendant in this case.beck asked gm to reconsider old gm decision to terminate the franchise.gm agreed to offer beck a participation agreement in place of the wind down agreement.the parties executed that agreement in september.
from that point on,two contracts governed beck relationship with gm a dealer sales and services agreement the dealer agreement,which contains standard provisions that set out the basic terms of the relationship between gm and any dealer franchise,and a september participation agreement,which further modified and supplemented the basic dealer agreement.together,these agreements govern several issues central to this dispute,including beck primary geographic area of responsibility and the performance standards to which it is subject.the terms of these agreements are all subject to the dealer act,which also contains certain mandatory provisions governing the relationship.
performance monitoring formula 
the primary issue on appeal relates to gm use of a retail sales index rsi to measure its dealers sales performance.in arriving at the rsi value for a particular dealership,gm assigns each dealer an area of primary responsibility and,in some instances,an area of geographic sales and service advantage agssa.an area of primary responsibility is a geographic area in which a dealer is expected to sell gm automobiles and otherwise represent gm.urban areas of primary responsibility,such as the part of westchester county,new york,in which beck is located,are typically served by more than one gm dealer.gm accordingly subdivides those areas into agssas,for each of which a single dealer is responsible.both the areas of primary responsibility and the agssas are composed of census tracts drawn by the census bureau agssas and areas of primary responsibility are dealers are allowed to sell and market vehicles to consumers outside of their own agssas.the function of these territory markers is not to protect dealers from competition but to provide a benchmark against which gm can measure dealers sales.
in determining an rsi for a chevrolet dealer such as beck,gm divides the dealer actual retail sales by its expected sales,which are calculated as described below.expressed as a formula 
dealers are required to attain an rsi of at least,which gm contends is an average score total sales measures all of a particular dealer actual sales in a particular period of time.the expected sales metric is based not on the raw state average among dealers,but on an adjusted statewide average market share for chevrolet products in the dealer agssa 
gm calculates each dealer expected sales by first taking into account all new motor vehicle registrations in the united states.it then compiles the registrations by census tract and subdivides them into segments of the motor vehicle market,based on types of automobiles.to choose two examples,small sport utility vehicles are a segment,as are sedans.
gm adjusts the expected sales figure for statewide and local characteristics.first,it takes into account chevrolet market share within the segments in which it competes on a statewide basis.for example,because chevrolet does not compete in the luxury sedan segment of the market,that segment is excluded when calculating chevrolet statewide market share.chevrolet does compete in the markets for sedans and pickup trucks,however.if,hypothetically,there are sedans sold in new york state and of those are chevrolets,chevrolet will have a percent market share in new york state among sedans.if there are pickup trucks sold in new york state,and of those are chevrolets,chevrolet will have a percent market share in new york state among pickup trucks.
second,the expected sales figure takes into account the relative popularity of a particular segment in the dealer agssa.in other words,the percentages described above are used to calculate each dealer expected sales.if chevrolet is a particularly strong statewide competitor in the market for a particular type of car pickup trucks,for example but the market for pickup trucks in a particular likely urban or suburban agssa is relatively small,then the dealership expected sales targets for pickup trucks would be relatively low.for example,a chevrolet dealer in an agssa in which only four total pickup trucks are purchased in a given year would be expected to sell only one chevrolet pickup truck,while a dealer in an agssa in which pickup trucks are purchased in a given year would be expected to sell.gm asserts that these adjustments reduced beck targets by more than percent from the unadjusted state average.beck does not contend otherwise.
local adjustments do not account for local brand popularity,however.for example,dealers like beck operating in the southern part of the state downstate do not receive a downward adjustment in sales expectations even though chevrolet,as a brand,is more popular in upstate markets than in yonkers,beck location,and elsewhere in westchester county and some nearby suburban counties.
beck performance under the current rsi formula 
the dealer agreement establishes the basic outlines of gm performance evaluation process.specifically,it provides that a dealer rsi is satisfactory only if it is equal to or greater than.if the dealer rsi is above and in the top fifteen percent statewide,it is classified by gm as superior.
if performance falls below satisfactory,gm is authorized by the participation agreement to take one or more remedial measures set forth in article of the dealer agreement.the ultimate step possible in this process is termination of the agreement on ninety days prior written notice.the participation agreement further provides 
in addition to the rsi,gm will consider any other relevant factors in deciding whether to proceed under the provisions of article to address any failure by dealer to adequately perform its sales responsibilities.gm will only pursue its rights under article to address any failure by dealer to adequately perform its sales responsibilities if gm determines that dealer has materially breached its sales performance obligations under this dealer agreement.
according to gm,gm prefers not to terminate dealers who fall below target levels,and has remedial programs to help improve performance at those dealerships.
beck rsi was considerably lower than in the years leading up to gm bankruptcy reorganization.the participation agreement established a roadmap for improving beck performance in stages,requiring beck to attain an rsi of in,in,and in.but beck rsi fell far short of these targets,remaining close to in each year.gm ultimately waived the participation agreement performance requirements for the calendar year,but began enforcing performance targets in.
inventory issues 
beck asserts that many of its performance issues derived from its inability to obtain adequate inventory from gm.gm uses a vehicle allocation system called turn and earn,through which a dealer allotted inventory is calculated as a function of past sales.while beck was operating under the wind down agreement,it was not permitted to place orders for new vehicle inventory with gm.according to beck,beck depressed inventory caused sales to slow.beck argues that as a result of this slowdown,it could not order adequate inventory under the turn and earn process even after it entered into the participation agreement which permitted it to order vehicles from gm.
in an effort to boost sales,gm instituted a special vehicle allocation process that was in effect from october through january.the program was designed to allow dealers to order more vehicles during those four months than the turn and earn program would have permitted.despite its depressed inventory in the months leading up to the program launch,beck objected to the program as a poison pill and recipe for disaster.letter from russell geller,vice president,beck chevrolet,to james bunnell,general manager sales operations,general motors llc.the program,beck asserted,would result in the delivery of too many vehicles too quickly,and would overload beck facilities,imposing high additional costs.id.the vehicles would be delivered in winter,an unpopular season for purchasing new cars in new york,and beck would be unlikely to sell them in a timely fashion.beck opted not to participate heavily in the allocation program,declining,or percent,of the vehicles gm offered to it.gm urged beck to reconsider its approach in two letters sent in november,but apparently to no avail.
after gm ended the program and resumed its ordinary turn and earn process,beck started ordering more cars than gm allocated.for example,in january,while the special allocation was in effect,gm offered beck vehicles beck ordered only.gm resumed its ordinary process in february,at which point gm shipped only vehicles.beck ordered.this imbalance continued for the remainder of,with beck ordering between and vehicles each month,and gm shipping between and fewer vehicles than beck had requested.although beck sold fewer cars than it had in its inventory in,beck contends that it could have sold more had gm honored its requests for an additional vehicles between february and december.
extension of the participation agreement 
as noted,beck signed a participation agreement with gm in.but during,beck operated under a dealer agreement,which was set to expire on april.the parties anticipated renewing the dealer agreement only if beck attained its performance target an rsi of.but,because of the allocation issues,gm waived the performance requirements for.attaining an rsi of for was no longer a prerequisite to gaining an extension.instead,gm sent beck a letter on april,offering to extend the dealer agreement to april,and conditioning any further extension on beck meeting specified conditions 
if dealer beck meets its year end rsi and csi customer satisfaction index performance requirements under the participation agreement,and if dealer is otherwise in compliance with its obligations under the dealer agreement,gm will then further extend the dealer agreement to april,to correspond with dealer year end rsi and csi requirements.
however,should dealer not meet its performance requirements,or should dealer otherwise not be in compliance with its obligations under the dealer agreement,gm shall have no obligation to extend the dealer agreement beyond april.
letter from william flook,zone manager,general motors llc,to leon geller,dealer operator,beck chevrolet.gm noted that beck would be deemed to have accepted the offer simply by opening for business on may.
beck considered this to be an unlawful modification of the terms of its franchise because it conditioned renewal on accepting new terms.beck brought suit in supreme court,westchester county in an effort,inter alia,to stop the modification from going into effect one day later,on april,gm sent a letter explaining that the april letter was intended solely to extend the chevrolet dealer sales and service agreement to april,not to modify the terms of existing agreements,and that the agreements applicable between the parties would remain in full effect according to their terms.letter from william flook,zone manager,general motors llc,to leon geller,dealer operator,beck chevrolet.
enlarging beck market area 
at about the same time,on april,gm informed beck that based upon its review of its dealer network,gm had concluded that it should make changes to the areas of responsibility or agssas for many gm dealerships.the letter,which stated that it was provided pursuant to new york vehicle traffic law ff,notified beck that its agssa would be increased by four census tracts in westchester and fairfield counties and reduced by seven census tracts in bronx county.letter from william flook,zone manager,general motors llc,to russell geller and leon geller,dealer operators,beck chevrolet.the practical effect of this change was to increase beck expected sales.
procedural history 
on april,as noted,beck brought suit against gm in new york state court alleging violations of the new york dealer act for,inter alia,modifying the franchise agreement without due cause,applying arbitrary or unfair sales performance standards,refusing to deliver vehicles,and unlawful nonrenewal of the franchise,as well as claims for breach of the dealer agreement,and breach of gm fiduciary duties.based on the diversity of citizenship of the parties,gm removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.following beck filing of an amended complaint,gm moved for summary judgment.the district court granted gm motion on july,dismissing beck first amended complaint in its entirety.beck subsequently filed a second amended complaint,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on two of its dealer act claims.gm counterclaimed for rescission of the participation agreement.
following a september bench trial,the district court ruled in gm favor on the claims in beck second amended complaint,denied both parties applications for attorney fees,and dismissed gm counterclaim as moot and legally insufficient.beck,on appeal,challenges most of the district court rulings against it,and gm from the dismissal of its claim for rescission.
while this case was pending in the district court,gm sought to terminate beck franchise agreement.beck initiated state administrative proceedings challenging the termination.on the same day that we heard oral argument in this appeal,the administrative court ruled that gm statewide rsi standard was unreasonable as to downstate chevrolet dealers and that gm had therefore failed to demonstrate due cause to terminate beck franchise agreement.beck chevrolet,motors llc,no.fmd dep t of motor veh.
discussion 
beck argues that first,gm method of calculating rsi is not fair or reasonable under dealer act section gg because it does not account for local brand preferences second,gm expansion of beck agssa constituted a modification of beck franchise in violation of dealer act section ff third,gm violated dealer act section a by refusing to deliver all of the inventory beck ordered and fourth,beck was the prevailing party on its price discrimination and unlawful modification claims and therefore is entitled to attorney fees gm also appeals from the district court dismissal of its counterclaim for rescission of the participation agreement.finally,both sides challenge some of the district court evidentiary rulings.

ii.reasonableness of gm performance metrics 
beck primary contention on appeal is that gm performance standards are unreasonable,arbitrary or unfair under dealer act section gg.the district court granted gm motion for summary judgment on beck claim for damages under that section and,following a bench trial,ruled in gm favor on beck request for injunctive relief.beck contends that the district court erred in reading an egregiousness requirement into the dealer act,misread relevant case law,and improperly constrained beck ability to present its case.
insofar as we and the parties can determine,neither the new york court of appeals nor the appellate division of the new york supreme court has interpreted section gg prohibition of unreasonable,arbitrary or unfair sales or other performance standard s.the parties therefore rely principally on legislative history,administrative decisions,and several cases interpreting more or less similar state laws.
we look to the dealer act legislative history primarily in an effort to understand the scope of judicial involvement in overseeing relationships that the new york state legislature envisioned.unfortunately,the legislative history is largely inconclusive on this point.there is support for both the position that the state legislature intended the courts to correct unequal bargaining power and cabin franchisors ability to impose conditions on dealers and the position that it simply intended to protect franchisees against arbitrariness and gross injustice.
the dealer act was passed in in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare by 
regulat ing motor vehicle manufacturers,distributors and factory or distributor representatives and dealers of motor vehicles doing business in this state in order to prevent frauds,impositions and other abuses upon its citizens and to protect and preserve the investments and properties of the citizens of this state.
veh.traf.law.beck argues that the legislature further intended to establish an equilibrium of bargaining power between the motor vehicle manufacturer and the motor vehicle dealer.assembly mem.in support,bill jacket,ch,at.establishing equilibrium was apparently thought necessary in light of the great disparity in bargaining power between motor vehicle manufacturer and motor vehicle dealer.id.the bill therefore sought to provide certain basic protections for the dealer in areas where such protection wa s deemed necessary.id.
section gg,added by amendment in,established new dealer protection,making it unlawful for a franchisor t o use an unreasonable,arbitrary or unfair sales or other performance standard in determining a franchised motor vehicle dealer compliance with a franchise agreement.the parties disagree about the proper reading of this provision.beck contends that a performance standard that fails to take into account external forces that affect dealers performances,such as local brand preferences,is unreasonable.gm argues that only unjust,deceptive,irrational,or capricious standards run afoul of section protections,and that its requirements are none of those.
more specifically,beck contends that the district court erroneously read an egregiousness requirement into section gg,under which a court will reverse only egregious or deceptive decisions of the franchisor.the district court expressed agreement with the first circuit position in coady toyota motor distributors,cir,interpreting the massachusetts dealer bill of rights.laws ch,that a distributor acting honestly is entitled to latitude in making commercial judgments,and i n this context,it is only the egregious decision that should be labeled arbitrary or unfair.coady,at.chapter forbade arbitrary or unfair modifications to franchise agreements.see id.at.the court reasoned that the applicable massachusetts provision did not demand perfection in allocation or warrant a substitution of judicial for business judgment.id.at.instead,the egregiousness standard imposed by the law is highly deferential to the franchisor.see id.
beck contends that it was inappropriate for the district court to adopt that interpretation of section gg.the new york provision,beck argues,casts a wide net,forbidding not only arbitrary standards but also unreasonable ones.beck reply br.at.it is possible that the inclusion of unreasonable in section gg is meant to signify a higher bar for franchisors actions than review.see,stat.law instructing that each word in a statute should be given distinct effect according to its ordinary meaning.that reading might also comport with the law general purpose to protect motor vehicle dealers against the superior economic power of the franchisors.bronx auto mall,am.honda motor,aff on the opinion of the district court,cir per curiam.
it is not clear,however,that the amendment that created section gg was intended to have such a broad effect.some of the legislative history suggests that the legislature was primarily concerned with performance standards that were too confusing or too poorly communicated to be understood and followed by automobile dealers.see sponsor,bill jacket,ch,at emphasizing that the amendment brings more openness in dealer franchisor communications mem.in support,bill jacket,ch,at mark schienberg,president of the greater new york automobile dealers association,explained that section gg will prevent misunderstandings and override performance standards that are too complicated and insufficiently communicated.it may be,then,that the statute was designed only to ensure that franchisors performance standards are transparent and comprehensible,and that their substantive requirements are not egregious.
assuming arguendo that beck reading of the statute is correct,we address its core contention that the statewide average gm uses to determine expected sales is unreasonable for its failure to account for local variations in brand popularity.the relevant facts regarding this performance standard are essentially undisputed.first,gm performance metric is based on a statewide sales average that does not account for depressed brand popularity,the relative unpopularity of chevrolet automobiles,in the relevant markets.second,gm metric does account for some local variation based on the popularity of a given vehicle segment,such as pickup trucks,small sport utility vehicles,and sedans.third,under the relevant agreements,a failure to meet an rsi of could result in gm termination of the franchise or other remedial measures.
on these facts,the district court decided that the use of a statewide average was administratively convenient,objective,and easily understood,and that gm formula adequately adjusted for local conditions through its segmentation analysis.the court appeared to adopt gm contention that applying a more localized standard would doom the entire make of chevrolet vehicles to mediocrity because it would not encourage better sales in underperforming areas.trial tr.at,special app x.for these reasons,it concluded that the metric was reasonable.
the few reported decisions addressing performance standards have not adopted consistent interpretations of what is reasonable or acceptable.in a related context,the new york department of motor vehicles recently determined that although honda use of statewide averages to gauge sales effectiveness was not a perfect system,it was also not patently unreasonable,arbitrary,or unfair.hartley buick gmc truck,am.honda motor,no.fmd at,dep t of motor veh,aff,dep t of motor veh.admin.app.bd.
several other administrative courts have reached the opposite conclusion,however,rejecting statewide performance standards in favor of those that take local variations into account.most relevant for present purposes,the administrative law judge alj who considered beck challenge to gm notice of termination concluded that f or the new york city metropolitan area,the rsi standard of gm is unreasonable in part because it does not realistically reflect the chevrolet sales challenges that beck and other new york metropolitan dealers face.beck chevrolet,motors llc,no.fmd,at dep t of motor veh.although beck has not argued that we are bound by that decision our desire to avoid potentially inconsistent results in state,federal,and administrative courts in part motivates our decision to certify this issue to the new york court of appeals.
beck also relies heavily on north shore,general motors,no.mvrb.may,aff in relevant part sub nom.general motors illinois motor vehicle review board,d,aff,in which an illinois alj resolved a challenge to gm proposed addition of dealerships in the greater chicago area.the alj concluded that measuring sales performance based on comparisons between similar market areas was preferable to using a statewide or nationwide standard.see motors state motor vehicle review,discussing the state motor vehicle review board decision.although not decided under the new york dealer act or a provision similar to its section gg,the illinois courts expressly decided that a standard that takes local variations,such as import bias,into account is a superior method of determining performance.id.
an administrative court in texas reached the same conclusion in a similar case,reasoning that it was 
patently unfair to conclude that a standard is appropriate for comparison with a given market if most of the markets used in creating the standard are fundamentally dissimilar to the market at issue.stated another way,an alj can not endorse a process that characterizes a market as underperforming simply because it fails to meet a standard so profoundly influenced by markets bearing so little resemblance to the market in question.

and the united states district court for the southern district of new york recently denied a defendant motion to dismiss a similar claim under the new york dealer act.see cms volkswagen holdings,llc volkswagen grp.of,d,s,reconsideration and reargument denied,wl,dist.lexis.
these decisions are,of course,not binding on us,but they are instructive.that several aljs who routinely consider disputes between franchisors and franchisees have concluded that statewide averages are not reasonable performance indicators gives us pause.it seems sensible enough to conclude that car dealers located in different parts of a single state would face different barriers to success,including variations in local brand preferences.by failing to take this into account,the existing performance standards make it likely that that the dealers will be concentrated in the areas in which gm brands are the weakest.
at the same time,however,section gg does not mandate that franchisors impose individually tailored or perfectly just performance standards.it prohibits only performance standards that are unreasonable,arbitrary or unfair.and,as the district court recognized,gm performance standards have significant virtues,including ease of administration,predictability,uniformity,and encouragement of innovation in struggling markets.they give gm greater flexibility to demand changes or shut down unproductive dealerships.and,importantly,they appear to represent the industry standard.
recognizing these competing considerations and the absence of existing guidance from the new york court of appeals,we think it best to certify the following question to it for its determination 
is a performance standard that requires average performance based on statewide sales data in order for an automobile dealer to retain its dealership unreasonable,arbitrary,or unfair under new york vehicle traffic law section gg because it does not account for local variations beyond adjusting for the local popularity of general vehicle types 
iii.modification of the dealer agreement 
beck also appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment against it on its claim that changes to its agssa constituted an unfair modification of its dealer agreement under section ff of the new york vehicle traffic law.that subsection provides that it is 
unlawful for any franchisor,notwithstanding the terms of any franchise contract t o modify the franchise of any franchised motor vehicle dealer unless the franchisor notifies the franchised motor vehicle dealer,in writing,of its intention to modify the franchise of such dealer at least ninety days before the effective date thereof,stating the specific grounds for such modification.
veh.traf.law ff.modification is defined as any change or replacement of any franchise if such change or replacement may substantially and adversely affect the new motor vehicle dealer rights,obligations,investment or return on investment.id.ff.upon receiving notice of an intended modification,the franchisee may challenge the modification as unfair.a modification is unfair if it is not undertaken in good faith is not undertaken for good cause or would adversely and substantially alter the rights,obligations,investment or return on investment of the franchised motor vehicle dealer under an existing franchise agreement.id.ff.
the april,letter notifying beck that gm had increased beck agssa by four census tracts stated that it was provided pursuant to new york vehicle traffic law ff.letter from william flook,zone manager,general motors llc,to russell geller and leon geller,dealer operators,beck chevrolet.beck argues that gm thereby acknowledged that the revision constituted a modification under the dealer act for which gm failed to demonstrate good cause.the dealer agreement states,however,that gm retains the right to revise the dealer area of primary responsibility at general motors sole discretion consistent with dealer network objectives.if the agreement expressly reserves to gm the power to unilaterally revise the area of primary responsibility,such a revision might not constitute a contract modification.
the district court concluded that the exercise of contractually conferred discretion generally does not constitute a modification of the contract.see also,subaru distribs.subaru of,d,periodic quota amendments contemplated by contract did not constitute amendments to dealer agreement in re kerry ford,ohio app d,use of service bulletins to provide updated service standards did not modify the contract where they were contemplated by the sales and service agreement.but we are not convinced that the dealer act contemplated that result.if the act was designed to protect franchisees from manufacturers disproportionate bargaining power,we might read section ff to proscribe contractual provisions that allow manufacturers to circumvent the act protections by retaining unilateral discretion to revise specified elements of the dealer agreement.
moreover,under the dealer act,a modification is any change of any franchise if such change or replacement may substantially and adversely affect the new motor vehicle dealer rights,obligations,investment or return on investment.veh.traf.law ff.gm argues that the word franchise refers to the dealer agreement,and because a change to the agssa has no impact on the dealer agreement,a change to the agssa is not a modification.but the statute defines a franchise not in terms of a single agreement,but as a written arrangement.veh.traf.law.this arrangement might extend beyond the dealer agreement to include secondary documents,including those defining beck agssa.only one new york court has addressed this issue so far as we know,and it concluded that a change to the dealer area of primary responsibility does constitute a modification under section ff.see van wie chevrolet,motors llc,at.onondaga cnty.june.
on the other hand,if the dealer act was designed to do no more than ensure clarity in communications and negotiations between franchisor and franchisee,it most likely would not apply to gm express reservation of the right to modify beck agssa.in the absence of any state appellate court decisions indicating how the new york court of appeals would rule on this issue,we also certify the following question for its determination 
does a change to a franchisee area of primary responsibility or agssa constitute a prohibited modification to the franchise under section ff,even though the standard terms of the dealer agreement reserve the franchisor right to alter the area of primary responsibility or agssa in its sole discretion 
iv.vehicle allocation 
beck next contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its claim that gm wrongly refused to deliver requested vehicles.this claim also arises under the dealer act,but unlike the claims discussed above,we are confident that we can correctly resolve this question without certification to the new york court of appeals.see licci ex rel.licci lebanese canadian bank,sal,cir w e need not certify if we are confident that we can correctly resolve the matter at issue ourselves.
under the dealer act,it is unlawful to refuse to deliver in reasonable quantity and within a reasonable time after receipt of a dealer order to any franchised motor vehicle dealer any vehicle covered by such franchise which is publicly advertised by such franchisor to be available for immediate delivery.veh.traf.law a.although d isputes over reasonableness are usually fact questions for juries,lennon miller,cir,s ummary judgment is appropriate when the party has failed to set forth any facts that go to an essential element of the claim,king crossland sav.bank,cir.
beck relies on an affidavit submitted by its to support its claim.we conclude that the uncontested facts asserted in it are insufficient to allow beck to prevail.they establish only the following beck had low inventory entering as a result of having entered into the wind down agreement in.under that agreement,beck was not allotted any new inventory.gm had a turn and earn vehicle allocation system by which dealers were allocated inventory based on prior sales.beck argues that low inventory under the wind down agreement yielded low sales in,which made it difficult to its inventory after it signed the participation agreement.
beck acknowledges,however,that it had sufficient inventory to meet demand at all times in and and that it refused cars offered to it.in,for example,beck received vehicles and sold only,leaving plus any remaining inventory from unsold entering.gm administered its special allocation program from october through january,which would have enabled beck to receive additional inventory each month.beck acknowledges that it refused to take part in the program,arguing that it would have resulted in too much inventory during the winter months.but beck own ordering patterns appear to disprove beck explanation of the basis for its refusal to participate in the special allocation program.gm offered beck vehicles in january.beck ordered only,refusing the other.in the next two months,after the special allocation program had ended but still during winter,beck ordered cars significantly more than its allocation.beck offers no explanation for its refusal to take the extra cars offered in january in light of its substantial order in the following two months.moreover,beck had more than adequate inventory to satisfy its sales of cars.
on these facts,the district court properly determined that the admissible evidence wa s insufficient to permit a rational juror to find in favor of the plaintiff.amorgianos passenger,cir.even if beck could have benefited from a different vehicle allocation system,and even if it could have sold additional vehicles had gm allocated them,beck provides no evidence suggesting that gm system for allocating vehicles was unreasonable or unfair.to the contrary,gm employed an equitable allocation system based on past performance.when it became clear that the system was inadequate for dealers who had entered wind down agreements before signing participation agreements,gm modified the system to offer additional inventory.beck refused the vast majority of what gm offered,including of the vehicles offered in january.nevertheless,it ordered vehicles beyond gm allocation in the following two months.gm refusal to deliver to beck exactly the number of vehicles it asked for in the month it asked for them does not constitute a failure to deliver a reasonable quantity of vehicles within a reasonable time.veh.traf.law a.
attorney fees 
beck also asserts that it is entitled to attorney fees on two claims dismissed by the district court,arguing that it was the prevailing party as to those claims because gm voluntarily abandoned the policies that beck had challenged.although attorney fees frequently are statutorily limited to prevailing parties,see,in any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter,the court or agency,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee.except as otherwise provided by this title,the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs,a party need not qualify as a prevailing party in order to receive a fee award under the dealer act.
the dealer act provides that the court may award necessary costs and disbursements plus a reasonable attorney fee to any party.veh.traf.law.the district court declined to grant attorney fees to either party both because the p laintiff wa s the losing party and because an award of attorneys fees would not be appropriate given the good faith nature of the claims and defenses order at,special app x.we review a district court fee determination for abuse of discretion.mcdaniel cnty.of schenectady,cir.
setting aside the question whether beck was required to be the prevailing party in order to qualify for an attorney fee award,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying beck fee request.the court denial of fees was not based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.in re sims,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the contrary,its d
