prior to june,jerry keizer owned of kgr stock.the other were owned by grand valley investments,llc gvi,a limited liability company consisting of the four grasman brothers larry,jack,russ and rick.gvi also fully owned and operated an equipment business in hudsonville known as grand valley equipment company,gvec keizer had no interest in gvec.kgr is located in grand rapids,michigan and is in the business of selling construction,farm and landscaping equipment such as tractors and commercial mowers.
in april,united approached gvi with a letter of intent to purchase the stock of both kgr and gvec for.united letter did not acknowledge the fact that keizer owned a significant amount of kgr stock among other things,the letter proposed that at closing,united would enter into employment agreements with the four grasman brothers and that the grasman brothers would enter into a agreement,but there was no reference to keizer.
gvi,by contrast,clearly was aware that it did not own all of the kgr stock and that in order for the proposed sale with united to proceed,gvi needed to control all kgr stock.accordingly,gvi forwarded a copy of united letter of intent to keizer,along with a proposed stock option agreement through which gvi would buy keizer stock in kgr.the stock option agreement recited that keizer owned kgr shares compared to gvi.it further acknowledged that united had approached gvi about purchasing all of gvec stock and that the kgr shares would be included in the proposed transaction.
for,keizer granted gvi an option to purchase his kgr shares for.keizer agreed that if gvi exercised the option,keizer would enter into an agreement not to compete with kgr or gvec for five years other than in newaygo county and otherwise in form and substance acceptable to united,for which kgr shall pay keizer.further,upon exercising the option,kgr would enter into a employment agreement with keizer that could be terminated only for just cause.
at this time,gvi also was aware that keizer owned or partially owned grant,a competing equipment sale and rental business in newaygo county.gvi also was aware that grant had sold equipment to customers in the grand rapids area,outside of newaygo county.it is undisputed that over of grant customers were located outside newaygo county both before and after the sale of kgr stock to united.
according to keizer,the stock option agreement mentioned that newaygo county would be excluded from the agreement because keizer had so requested at a meeting with the grasmans and their attorney,stephen kretschman,on april.keizer wanted an assurance incorporated into the provision that if things did not work out with united as his new employer that he could do business as usual in newaygo with grant keizer signed the modified stock option agreement later that day.
on may,kretschman,the grasmans attorney,wrote united attorney,john arndts,about the anticipated employment agreement with keizer.kretschman letter stated that he anticipated that keizer employment agreement would be along the lines required of the grasmans,but,in the case of the,excluding newaygo county,where his son operates a competing business.on may,arndts wrote back with a form employment agreement for jerry keizer to sign.arndts further stated,w ith respect to excluding newaygo county from the provisions of jerry agreement with kgr,we need more information concerning what competitive activities are contemplated in newaygo county by his son and jerry.
thereafter,united made little effort to get any additional information regarding the competitive activities of grant.united asserts that its inquiries were limited because the grasmans had informed it that grant was a business in which keizer and his son or were involved,but that it was a very small business with a different product line from the grasmans and that it did business only in newaygo county.united does not claim,however,that keizer misled it about grant prior to purchasing kgr and gvec stock.in fact,united never made any inquiries of keizer about grant until months after keizer had signed his employment agreement.
the final version of keizer employment agreement contained the provision with the newaygo exclusion.the grasmans attorney,kretschman,had incorporated the exclusion into the form employment agreement that had been provided to him by united attorney.kretschman testified that he incorporated the newaygo county exclusion into keizer employment agreement with kgr to reflect the fact that there was a business in newaygo county that would otherwise fall within the scope of the that should be excluded from it.on june,keizer sold his kgr stock to gvi.on the same day,he signed the employment agreement with kgr.

b.the plain language of defendant keizer agreement 
as noted above,keizer entered into an employment agreement with united predecessor,kgr.paragraph of the agreement contains a covenant not to compete such covenants are enforceable under michigan law.see.comp.laws ann.a a covenant that restricts an employee from engaging in employment or a line of business after termination of employment is enforceable if the agreement or covenant is reasonable as to its duration,geographical area,and the type of employment or line of business.the covenant reads,in relevant part,as follows 
n either keizer nor any of his affiliates shall,anywhere in the target area,as herein defined,directly or indirectly,acting individually or as the owner,shareholder,partner,or employee of any entity engage in the operation of any equipment sale,rental or leasing business.
the central question is what does it mean to engage in the operation of a competing business in the target area united argues that soliciting business from and selling to customers within the target area is tantamount to operating a business in the target area.defendants argue that to operate a business in the target area the business must be physically located in the target area.in this court view,defendants are correct.
as the district court noted,when ordinary speakers refer to where a business is operated,they refer to the location of the business for example,a retail store in grand rapids would not be said to operate in newaygo county simply because a customer drives from newaygo to purchase an item at the grand rapids store,even if the store actively advertised in newaygo.emphasis in original.indeed,this proposition becomes clearer with a more extreme example.if keizer were to relocate grant to the north pole,the warehouse,inventory and employees,send direct mailings and make telephone calls to potential customers in the target area and then personally deliver the goods,the common sense understanding of this would be that keizer operates his business in the north pole,even though he sells to customers in the target area.bianchi auto.club of,holding that common sense is a proper basis for contract interpretation.see also lozada dale baker oldsmobile,when the contract terms are plain and unambiguous,a court will construe the contract as it is written and presume the parties intent is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms in the contract.citing pierson sand gravel,pierson township.britton john hancock mut.life ins,contracts which are unambiguous are not open to construction and must be enforced as written.citations omitted.
united cites to a dictionary that defines operation as a process or series of acts aimed at producing a desired result or effect a method or process of productive activity.appellant reply br.at quoting webster ii,new college dictionary.united argues that the phrase engage in the operation of in is equivalent to engage in a series of acts,such that keizer acts of selling to customers in the target area amounted to his engagement in a series of prohibited acts in the target area.this court has discovered,however,that,with specific regard to a business,dictionaries define operation to mean a business activity or enterprise.oxford english dictionary online edition from the second print ed.the word operate is defined as t o direct the working of to manage,conduct,work a railway,business,id.see also webster third new int l dictionary to manage and put or keep in operation whether with personal effort or not.taken together,these definitions strongly indicate that in the business context an operation requires a discrete physical location,such as a railway or a grocery store.but even assuming that an operation can transcend a particular physical location,the definition of operate indicates that management or oversight is an essential element of a business operation.here,there is no evidence that keizer has managed a competing enterprise in the target area.although keizer allegedly carried out some sales and deliveries in the target area,these transactions did not involve management or oversight of grant business.
united cites several cases that purportedly support its plain meaning interpretation of the.on the surface,the strongest case united cites is collen source edp,texas.in that case,william collen had agreed to a restrictive covenant which stated that he would not directly or indirectly,enter into or be engaged as a sole proprietor,partner,stockholder,or employee in any personnel placement business in the city of dallas,and within a radius thereof.id.at.collen argued that the covenant restrained him only from physically establishing a business in the proscribed area,and therefore,he was not prohibited from working for a company whose office is located outside of that area,but soliciting personnel placement business in dallas.id.at.in affirming the lower court enforcement of the covenant against collen,the texas court engaged in little analysis,instead merely summarizing the facts and holdings of two lumber turner,and hartung hilda miller.see id.at.
this court does not find collen to be persuasive authority for two reasons.first,the texas court appeared to flout the plain language of the restrictive covenant,which,on its face,limited collen only from working for a personnel placement business in,physically located within a defined area.collen abided by the plain terms of the covenant,and it is inexplicable why the court read the covenant expansively to include working for such a business located outside of the defined area.second,collen was decided under texas law,not michigan law,which commands the courts to narrowly construe restrictive covenants.see maleki,noting that the michigan uniform trade secrets act does not remove such covenants from disfavored status,and narrowly limits them to reasonableness in protecting only a competitive interest,duration,geographic area,and type of employment,vacated after settlement.
the two decisions relied upon by the collen court in no way advance united argument herein.in,the covenant restricted sales the business of selling in littlefield,texas or within ten miles thereof,at.keizer covenant,in contrast,restricts the operation of any business in the target area.had the drafters of keizer covenant intended to restrict sales or deliveries in the target area and not just the presence of a business in that area,they easily could have specified a sales limitation in the covenant.they did not.in fact,it was because the covenant in additionally restricted shipments into the defined areas that the texas court enforced the covenant against the defendants.the court suggested that without this specific restriction,the defendants conduct would have fallen outside of the more general prohibition against engaging in the business of selling in those areas.see id.at holding that the specific restriction on deliveries into littlefield was designed to prohibit sales which might not come strictly within the terms of the former provisions,and to prevent an evasion of such provisions.
united reliance on the alabama court decision in dixon royal cup,so d,is misplaced for the same reasons.in dixon,a salesman agreed not to engage in the business of selling particular items within a defined geographic area.id.at.he specifically agreed not to solicit or take orders for or sell or deliver any such merchandise in that area.id.at.again,keizer agreed to no such specific geographic restrictions on selling construction equipment.unlike the drafters of the agreement in dixon,the drafters of keizer employment agreement could have specified a prohibition on soliciting orders from or delivering merchandise to customers in the target area,but did not.
if anything,the dixon case undermines united argument.the alabama court noted that engaging in business,as used in a restrictive covenant in an employment contract,involves not only the servicing or soliciting of customers,but also means the setting up of an office or place of business for soliciting or servicing customers.id.at emphasis added citing harrington,frick.assuming arguendo that the phrase engage in business is linguistically equivalent to engage in the operation of any business,on the facts of this case,it is undisputed that keizer did not set up an office in the target area.accordingly,under dixon,keizer did not run afoul of the restrictive covenant because he did not engage in business in the target area.
the second decision cited by the texas court of appeals in collen also does not support united plain language argument.in hartung,the sellers gave the buyers the exclusive right to use the name hilda miller.the sellers further agreed not to engage in the furniture business under that name nor any other name within the district of columbia.hartung,at.the sellers opened up a competing furniture business under the hilda miller name in a nearby maryland suburb,advertised the business in district of columbia newspapers and sold to district of columbia residents.id.at.although the court enforced the covenant as to the sellers use of the hilda miller name,the court refused,on vagueness grounds,to enforce the more general prohibition against engaging in the furniture business in the district of columbia.id.at.since there is no allegation in this case that keizer the united name,it is difficult to see how hartung is relevant.regardless,the language of the hartung covenant focused on engaging in the furniture business,sales within the district of columbia,unlike keizer covenant which focuses on the situs of the operation from which sales emanate 
even assuming that united broad interpretation of operating a business is plausible,any ambiguity in the language,which was crafted by united predecessor in interest,must be construed against united and in favor of keizer.see higgins lawrence,it is well settled in the law of contracts that language will be construed against the party drafting the instrument.citations omitted see also de bruyn produce romero,an ambiguous document must be construed against the drafter of the document.it is undisputed that united drafted the form employment agreement was then modified by its to the contract gvi.under of the employment agreement,united succeeded to gvi rights and obligations under the agreement.accordingly,united stands in the same position as gvi relative to keizer with regard to how the agreement must be interpreted.just as would have to be construed against gvi,as the drafter,so too must it now be construed against united,as gvi successor.for this reason as well,the district court was correct in holding that keizer did not breach of the employment agreement by operating a business located outside of the target area,but that conducts business inside the target area.
c.the extrinsic evidence 
assuming arguendo that the operative language from is ambiguous,the court can look to parol evidence to construe it as long as that evidence is not inconsistent with the written words.see ditzik schaffer lumber,the parol evidence rule operates to exclude evidence of prior contemporaneous agreements,whether oral or written,which contradict,vary or modify an unambiguous writing intended as a final and complete expression of the agreement.detroit bank trust coopes,noting that the test for the admissibility of parol evidence is whether the proffered parol evidence is inconsistent with the written language internal quotation marks and citations omitted.when interpreting an ambiguous contract with extrinsic evidence,summary judgment is proper so long as the extrinsic evidence presented to the court supports only one of the conflicting interpretations.gencorp,at.as discussed below,the extrinsic evidence supports only one interpretation of the agreement,that of keizer.
it is undisputed that united via gvi was aware of keizer ownership interest and personal involvement in grant before entering into the employment agreement.during negotiations,united attorney was explicitly advised that would have to exclude newaygo county from the because keizer son operates a competing business in that county.united had the opportunity to conduct due diligence on the extent to which grant competes with united,but chose to rely on the verbal assurance of a gvi representative that grant was not a competitor.united never corroborated this assurance by requesting written substantiation or by speaking with keizer.had united requested documentation,it would have discovered that of grant customers were located in the target area and that grant sells similar products.thus,on this factual record,there is no evidence that the parties meant to curtail grant rent all business in any fashion.indeed,the negotiation history shows that the newaygo county exclusion was meant to protect keizer interest in that business.thus,the extrinsic evidence shows that the parties intended to restrict keizer ability to compete by limiting the location of the business which he might operate.
united counters that the most important piece of extrinsic evidence is keizer stock option agreement with gvi.there,keizer agreed that he would enter into an agreement not to compete with kgr or gvec for five years other than in newaygo county and otherwise in form and substance acceptable to united,for which kgr shall pay keizer.emphasis added.united argues that the stock option agreement shows that the parties intended to preclude keizer from competing with united anywhere except within newaygo county.appellant br.at.
united argument is not persuasive.this language merely labels the type of agreement to which keizer would later agreement not to compete it does not even begin to define the scope of that agreement.as the instant dispute shows,a provision can be narrow or broad,depending on the specific language of the agreement thus,the stock option agreement does not create a disputed issue of fact about the meaning of.moreover,even assuming that the stock option agreement somehow obligated keizer not to compete with united in the target area,as discussed above,the other evidence shows that of the employment agreement creates no such obligation.accordingly,the employment agreement dictates keizer obligations,not the stock option agreement.see cmi int l,intermet int l,when two agreements cover the same subject matter and include inconsistent terms,the later agreement supersedes the earlier agreement.citation omitted.
defendant keizer and alleged breach of keizer employment agreement 
united argues that keizer has violated the provision,even accepting the district court interpretation of.united cites to evidence that keizer has been doing business with mulder and grand equipment company,competitors located in the target area.appellant br.at.in the target area,keizer has sold equipment at auctions,placed two or three pieces of used equipment on a vacant lot with a for sale sign,attended a trade show,advertised his business,solicited customers through mass mailings and placed a few pieces of equipment for sale or rental at mulder.id.at.this evidence,however,shows only that keizer has done some business,selling or renting equipment in the target area,not that he has operated a business located in the target area.
in addition,united has not articulated a basis for holding grant liable for breaching a contract to which it was not a signatory,namely,keizer employment agreement.since grant was not a party to the agreement,summary judgment on the breach of contract claim was proper for grant on this independent ground.
defendant mulder alleged violation of the michigan uniform trade secrets act.
united has not pressed its contract and breach of confidentiality claims against keizer and.accordingly,united has waived any challenge to the district court dismissal of count ii michigan uniform trade secrets act with respect to keizer and grant and the portion
