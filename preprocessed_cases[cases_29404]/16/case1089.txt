discussion 
this court exercises plenary review over a grant of summary judgment,onyeanusi pan am.world airways,cir,and reviews de novo pure questions of law and the application of law to uncontested facts,ilchuk att y of,cir.
this case is and the relevant facts were well catalogued by the district court.we repeat them herein below as necessary to our discussion.our resolution of the issues was aided not only by a review of the record,briefs,and case law,but also by oral argument.
classification of lep profit and lep japan 
the characterization of lep profit and lep japan as either indirect carriers or freight forwarders turns on the specific involvement of each in the arrangement and oversight of the troglitazone shipment at issue.it presents a close question in the instant factual setting.there is no dispute as to the parties respective roles in the shipment and the terms of the documents that they drafted,filled in,or were governed by.the challenge lies in fitting what they did neatly within the category of indirect carrier or freight forwarder under the analysis that is customarily used.see zima roman pazinski.
both lep profit and lep japan urged that they were freight forwarders in connection with this shipment the district court examined the functions performed by each and,after a thorough and analysis,concluded that they had instead acted as indirect carriers.we have reviewed the relevant case law distinguishing between freight forwarders and indirect carriers,and agree with this conclusion.accordingly we will affirm this aspect of the district court order.
ii.limitation of liability 
the extent of fedex liability and consequently of lep profit and lep japan depends entirely on how we read article c of the warsaw convention,with article from the limitation of liability carriers who fail to list agreed stopping places on the air waybill.here,the relevant transportation of goods was from japan to puerto rico,with stops in anchorage,alaska,and newark,new jersey.the fedex flight from anchorage crashed while landing on the newark runway,and the entire shipment of pharmaceuticals was destroyed.none of the air waybills prepared in connection with the shipment listed anchorage,nor did they indicate that once flight the fedex flight from tokyo to anchorage terminated in anchorage,the cargo would be transferred onto flight,which in turn would terminate at newark airport,where the cargo was to be transferred by truck to jfk.seized upon this omission as its basis for imposing liability on fedex,lep profit,and lep japan for the full value of the goods rather than the per pound limitation under the warsaw convention.
our ruling in this regard has limited significance because the hague protocol,which became effective in,changed the relevant provision so as to require listing of only those stopping places that give international character to an otherwise domestic or flight nevertheless,it is of obvious significance to the parties involved in this mishap,which occurred in,and parties to any other cases currently in litigation involving incidents subject to the warsaw convention 
the district court concluded that the agreed stopping places requirement should be read as limited only to flights that had both their place of origin and destination within the territory of a single high contracting party,but had an interim stop outside the territory of the party,a flight from los angeles to new york,with an interim stop in toronto.the district court reasoned that the driving force of c as a whole is to ensure notice and acknowledgment,not as to every stop,but as to stops that pertain to and indicate the international character of the shipment of the flight.dist.op.at.consequently,the district court continued,c requirement to list agreed stopping places is inextricably related to making sure the parties are aware of the international character of the flight,and not a very general and overly burdensome notice requirement that requires every stop to be listed.dist.op.at.it reasoned that,here,because the origin of the shipment and the destination were in different countries,no stopping places needed to be listed,and the exception to limited liability did not apply.thus,the district court granted fedex motion for partial summary judgment and held that fedex was entitled to limited liability under the convention.
we respectfully disagree with the district court conclusion that the strictures of article c are satisfied as long as the air waybill gives the shipper notice of the international nature of the shipment.based on the convention plain text,the drafting history of article,and its overall structure,we do not find its application to be so limited.rather,we find the jurisprudence of the court of appeals for the second circuit,which requires the listing of all stopping places contemplated by the carrier and which represents the prevailing view in this area,see fireman fund ins.panalpina,c,wl,at,to be both persuasive and on point the meaning the district court gave to the language of c requires an additional caveat that simply does not appear in the text.moreover,the later change effectuated by the hague protocol could just as easily be viewed as changing and restricting,rather than clarifying,the exceptions for limited liability.in addition,the drafting history of the convention reveals another animating purpose for the need to list agreed stopping places,namely the desire of shippers to know precisely where their goods would be landing so as to anticipate the applicability of other laws,potential risks,customs regulations,and the like 
finally,we find that the mere listing of flight as and on the air waybills at issue was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of article c,as the record indicates that the information relayed was not complete thus,having failed to satisfy the requirement that anchorage be listed as an agreed stopping place,we conclude,pursuant to article,that no carrier involved in this direct or avail itself of the limited liability provisions of the warsaw convention accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of fedex.
