opinion of the court 
former university chaplain lynette petruska appeals an order from the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania dismissing her federal employment discrimination and state law claims against gannon university gannon or the university,the private catholic diocesan college that employed her from july,until october.the district court dismissed petruska complaint for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,holding that the ministerial exception a doctrine rooted in the first her claims.
this court has not previously ruled on the viability or the scope of the ministerial exception.today,we join seven of our sister circuits in adopting the exception and hold that it applies to any claim,the resolution of which would limit a religious institution right to choose who will perform particular spiritual functions.
petruska title vii discrimination and retaliation claims,as well as her state civil conspiracy and negligent retention and supervision claims,are barred by the ministerial exception insofar as they implicate a church right to select its ministers under the free exercise clause.because resolution of petruska fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims do not limit gannon free exercise rights,and because an evaluation of these claims would not violate the establishment clause,they are not precluded by the exception.nevertheless,petruska has failed to plead fraud with particularity as required by federal rule of civil procedure b.accordingly,we will affirm the district court order dismissing petruska title vii discrimination and retaliation claims,as well as her state civil conspiracy,negligent retention and supervision,and fraudulent misrepresentation claims.for the reasons set forth below,we will remand her breach of contract claim for further consideration by the district court.
factual and procedural background 
for purposes of a motion to dismiss,we must accept as did the district plaintiff factual allegations.see mortensen first fed.sav.loan,cir explaining the standard of review for rule b and rule b motions accordingly,the facts set forth below are drawn from petruska first amended complaint.
gannon university is a private catholic diocesan college located in erie,pennsylvania.gannon hired petruska as the university director of social concerns on july.at that time,reverend nicholas rouch was the university chaplain.when rouch left to study in rome for a period of three years,he was promised that he could resume his position as chaplain when he returned.in his absence,the university appointed an interim chaplain,who held the position until june of.when the interim chaplain resigned,monsignor david rubino promoted petruska to permanent university chaplain on july,with the advice and consent of bishop trautman,the chair of gannon board of trustees the board.petruska was the first female in gannon history to serve in that position.as such,and cognizant of the promise made to rouch,petruska specifically sought assurances from rubino that she would not simply be replaced when rouch returned or another qualified male became available.rubino assured her that future decisions regarding her tenure as chaplain would be based solely on her performance,not her gender.
several months after her appointment,in march of,rubino was forced to take a leave of absence when allegations surfaced that he was having a sexual affair with a female subordinate.thereafter,another female employee accused rubino of sexual harassment,and petruska was instrumental in bringing this claim to the attention of bishop trautman and thomas ostrowski.rubino formally resigned in may of,and ostrowski was appointed acting president.following rubino resignation,and at bishop trautman behest,gannon began a campaign to rubino misconduct.petruska to the university response 
in july of,ostrowski met with bishop trautman,as well as rouch,who had by then returned from rome.bishop trautman notified ostrowski that he had created a new for mission and that he had appointed rouch to fill it.the position was created without input from any other university officials and did not include a job description.at that meeting,the bishop informed ostrowski that he was to remove petruska as university chaplain.when ostrowski refused,bishop trautman instructed him to restructure the chaplain division by placing it under the leadership of rouch.ostrowski also refused to take part in the proposed restructuring.
on july,ostrowski told petruska about his meeting with rouch and bishop trautman.he explained the proposed restructuring and asked petruska how she would respond if the chaplain office were placed under rouch leadership.petruska indicated that she would challenge this decision,and ostrowski conceded that the proposed action was being taken on the basis of her gender.although ostrowski stated that he would try to prevent the restructuring and petruska removal,he later explained that he could delay,but not prevent,these events.
on october,petruska signed a revised contract,which was equivalent to those of the other at gannon.her contract was thereby extended until june.from march to may of,ostrowski repeatedly suggested that petruska consider accepting another position at gannon,because bishop trautman and reverend rouch would never let her remain as university chaplain.ostrowski was removed from consideration in the presidential search on april.
on may,antoine garibaldi was appointed president of gannon and he began his tenure on july.after garibaldi became president,some of petruska responsibilities were reassigned and she was instructed to limit her comments at university events.
on august,garibaldi notified petruska that he had decided to restructure and informed her that she would be removed from the president staff and that the chaplain division would report to rouch.garibaldi did not present the restructuring proposal to the university president council as required by gannon governance manual.petruska informed garibaldi that she knew that this action was being taken against her because of her gender and told him that she would be open to a buy out of her contract.although garibaldi indicated that he would be willing to discuss the restructuring,he later declined to discuss the matter with petruska.after meeting with garibaldi,petruska orally requested information about filing a discrimination grievance with the university review council,but was notified in a letter dated august,that the university review council was not a proper forum because her complaint was directed against the president and chair of the board.
on september,rouch called petruska and indicated that he wanted to discuss the restructuring.she declined to meet with him until she resolved her concerns about the university discriminatory conduct with garibaldi.that same day,petruska sent an to garibaldi,stating that she intended to speak publicly about the questionable motives underlying the restructuring,but noted that she was willing to meet with him to discuss how all parties could move forward if ricarda vincent,the president of her community,was permitted to attend.garibaldi did not respond.petruska later learned that,during a telephone conversation between bishop trautman and vincent,the bishop yelled at vincent.the next day,october,vincent told petruska that she could not take any action against gannon,nor was she to make any comment about gannon discriminatory conduct.faculty,staff,and students were informed of petruska demotion from the head of the chaplain division.
on october,rouch once again contacted petruska regarding the restructuring.in response,she sent an email to garibaldi,noting that she had not yet received an answer to her request for a meeting.the next day,garibaldi responded to petruska,indicating that the university would take appropriate action if she did not report to rouch.believing that she was about to be fired,she tendered her resignation with notice on october.the following day,rouch and bob cline,gannon human resources director,entered petruska office and told her that her resignation was accepted effective immediately.
based on these events,petruska filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on august.upon exhausting her administrative remedies,she received a letter.she filed this action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania against gannon university,members of the board of trustees including trautman,garibaldi,and vincent,rubino,and rouch.petruska asserted six claims gender discrimination in violation of title vii against all defendants retaliatory discrimination in violation of title vii against all defendants fraudulent misrepresentation against gannon,rubino,and trautman civil conspiracy against trautman,garibaldi,and rouch breach of contract against gannon and garibaldi and negligent supervision and retention against gannon and its board.gannon moved to dismiss petruska claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of jurisdiction,or in the alternative,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the district court granted the motion,concluding that the ministerial exception barred adjudication of petruska claims.
ii.gannon motion to dismiss 
the district court granted the motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of jurisdiction.although we agree that the ministerial exception applies in this case,we conclude that the exception does not act as a jurisdictional bar,but rather,is best viewed as a challenge to the sufficiency of petruska claim under rule b.see,elvig calvin presbyterian church,cir bryce episcopal church in the diocese of colorado,cir.
at issue in a rule b motion is the court very power to hear the case.mortensen,at.a rule b motion,by contrast,tests the legal sufficiency of plaintiff claim.in other words,for purposes of resolving a rule b motion,the question is whether the plaintiff would be able to prevail even if she were able to prove all of her allegations.id.
in this case,the question does not concern the court power to hear the is beyond cavil that a federal district court has the authority to review claims arising under federal rather whether the first amendment bars petruska claims.see elvig,at federal question jurisdiction is statutorily established,giving district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.in that respect,as the tenth circuit noted in bryce,assertion of the ministerial,in that case,the church autonomy doctrine is akin to a government official defense of qualified immunity,which is often raised in a rule b motion.bryce,at.the exception may serve as a barrier to the success of a plaintiff claims,but it does not affect the court authority to consider them.we therefore review petruska complaint to determine whether she has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.so construing the motion to dismiss,we have jurisdiction under.jordan fox rothschild frankel,cir.our review is plenary.id.
iii.the ministerial exception to title vii 
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race,sex,national origin,or religion and forbids retaliation based on an employee opposition to practices made unlawful under the statute.the statute exempts religious entities and educational organizations from its nondiscrimination mandate to the extent that an employment decision is based on an individual religious preferences.see a providing an exception for religious corporation,association,educational institution,or society with respect to employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on of its activities see also e permitting religious educational institutions to hire and employ employees of a particular religion.by its terms,however,title vii does not confer upon religious organizations the right to make those same decisions on the basis of race,sex,or national origin.rayburn gen l conf.of seventh day adventists,cir.
the questions presented in this case are whether applying title vii to gannon decision to restructure would infringe upon its free exercise rights and whether adjudication of petruska title vii claims would result in unconstitutional entanglement under the establishment clause.every one of our sister circuits to consider the issue has concluded that application of title vii to a relationship would would risk violating the first amendment and,accordingly,has recognized some version of the ministerial exception to the extent that a claim involves the church selection of other words,its choice as to who will perform particular spiritual functions most of these circuits have held that the exception bars any inquiry into a religious organization underlying motivation for the contested employment decision 
although we have not previously confronted a factually appropriate case in which to determine whether the ministerial exception is constitutionally warranted,we have acknowledged and cited with approval its application by other courts of appeals.see little wuerl,cir citing mcclure salvation army,cir rayburn,relying on this basic principle,courts have consistently found that title vii does not apply to the relationship between ministers and the religious organizations that employ them,even where the discrimination is alleged on the basis of race or sex.geary visitation of the blessed virgin mary,cir citing scharon,at indeed,when the employee who challenges an employment decision is a member of the clergy,some courts have refused to allow even this limited inquiry.because we conclude that a federal court resolution of a minister title vii discrimination or retaliation claim would infringe upon first amendment protections,we now join those courts in adopting the exception 
a.the free exercise clause of the first amendment 
the first amendment of the united states constitution provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.const.amend.i.the religion clauses extend to both legislative and judicial action,see kreshik saint nicholas cathedral,d,and apply equally to state and federal laws,see elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d citing cantwell connecticut.
the free exercise clause protects not only the individual right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires,employment division,dep t of human resources of oregon smith,d,but also a religious institution right to decide matters of faith,doctrine,and church governance.kedroff nicholas cathedral.see also serbian orthodox diocese milivojevich,d c ivil courts are bound to accept the decisions of the highest judicatories of a religious organization of hierarchical policy on matters of discipline,faith,internal organization,or ecclesiastical rule,custom,or law.emphasis added.in ministerial exception cases,those rights are interrelated.
first,like an individual,a church in its collective capacity must be free to express religious beliefs,profess matters of faith,and communicate its religious message.unlike an individual who can speak on her own behalf,however,the church as an institution must retain the corollary right to select its voice.a minister is not merely an employee of the church she is the embodiment of its message.a minister serves as the church public representative,its ambassador,and its voice to the faithful.accordingly,the process of selecting a minister is per se a religious exercise.as the fifth circuit explained the relationship between an organized church and its ministers is its lifeblood.the minister is the chief instrument by which the church seeks to fulfill its purpose.mcclure,at.matters touching this relationship must necessarily be recognized as of prime ecclesiastical concern.id.at consequently,any restriction on the church right to choose who will carry its spiritual message necessarily infringes upon its free exercise right to profess its beliefs.this right is squarely at issue in petruska first amended complaint.
the second right protected by the free exercise church right to decide matters of governance and internal also implicated by gannon decision to restructure.the vice president for mission and ministry and the university chaplain at gannon both serve spiritual other words,the primary duties of those employees include teaching,spreading the faith,church governance,supervision of a religious order,or supervision of participation in religious ritual and worship.see rayburn,at.accordingly,gannon decisions regarding who to install in those positions and the manner in which their duties would be divided were decisions about who would perform those constitutionally protected spiritual functions.those choices are protected from governmental interference by the free exercise clause.
the ministerial exception,as we conceive of it,operates to bar any claim,the resolution of which would limit a religious institution right to select who will perform particular spiritual functions.accordingly,in this case,the relevant question with respect to each of petruska claims is whether application of the state or federal law will limit gannon right to choose who performs particular spiritual functions on its behalf.petruska asserts six claims in her first amended complaint two violations of title and retaliation counts i and ii,respectively fraudulent misrepresentation count iii civil conspiracy count iv breach of contract count v and negligent supervision and retention count vi.we conclude that resolution of counts i,ii,iv,and vi would impose unconstitutional limits on gannon first amendment right to the free exercise of religion.consequently,we hold that they are barred by the ministerial exception.
petruska title vii claims 
petruska alleges that gannon demoted and constructively discharged her from her position as university chaplain based on her gender and retaliated against her on the basis of her opposition to sexual harassment at the university.her discrimination and retaliation claims are premised upon gannon decision to restructure,a decision which petruska argues was merely pretext for gender discrimination.it is clear from the face of petruska complaint,however,that gannon choice to restructure constituted a decision about who would perform spiritual functions and about how those functions would be divided.accordingly,application of title vii discrimination and retaliation provisions to gannon decision to restructure would violate the free exercise clause for that reason,petruska title vii claims counts i and ii should be dismissed.
petruska argues that gannon waived its right to raise the ministerial exception as a defense by failing to raise it before the eeoc accepting state and federal funds with conditions limiting discrimination and repeatedly and publicly representing itself as an equal opportunity employer.we find these arguments unpersuasive.
first,as the district court correctly noted,although a plaintiff has an obligation to exhaust her administrative remedies as a prerequisite to suit,we are aware of no authority that requires a defendant to proffer every possible defense or legal argument before the eeoc,much less to raise all constitutional challenges,mcginty new york,cir concluding that failure to raise eleventh amendment immunity as a defense did not result in waiver in subsequent federal court action under the adea marie allied home mortgage,cir holding that appellee did not waive right to raise arbitration defense in district court by failing to raise it before eeoc brennan king,cir same.moreover,as a general rule,an administrative agency is not competent to determine constitutional issues.see,weinberger salfi,d exhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency process,so that the agency may function efficiently and so that it may have the opportunity to correct its own errors,to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise,and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review plainly these purposes have been served once the secretary has satisfied himself that the only issue is the constitutionality,a matter which is beyond his jurisdiction to determine but bethlehem steel occupational safety and health review commission,cir concluding that in context of osha enforcement cases,there are compelling reasons for insisting that fourth amendment claims for suppression of evidence be tendered first to the commission.
in this case,we can see no reason that the general rule regarding agencies lack of competence to resolve constitutional claims should not apply.the eeoc has no special expertise to resolve first amendment claims,nor is gannon assertion of the ministerial exception related to the eeoc jurisdiction or administrative procedures.we therefore can not conclude that gannon failure to raise the ministerial exception before the eeoc resulted in a waiver of its right to raise it in federal court 
second,gannon did not waive its first amendment rights by representing itself as an equal opportunity employer or by accepting federal and state funds.a waiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.johnson zerbst.c ourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.id.citation omitted.here neither gannon invocation of equal employer language nor its acceptance of funds constitutes a waiver of its first amendment rights.by invoking the equal opportunity language,gannon acknowledged only that it would comply with title vii to the extent the statute applies to its employment decisions.it does not apply in this context.we thus agree that gannon did not waive its right to raise the ministerial exception and we conclude that the district court properly applied the exception to petruska title vii claims.
petruska state tort law claims 
petruska first amended complaint also contains three state tort claims civil conspiracy count iv,negligent supervision and retention count vi,and fraudulent misrepresentation count iii.the civil conspiracy and negligent supervision claims turn on petruska ability to prove that gannon restructuring constituted an unlawful or tortious act.because the first amendment protects gannon right to of its reason for doing can not consider whether the act was unlawful or tortious and,therefore,these claims must be dismissed.
by contrast,petruska fraudulent misrepresentation claim requires no such conclusion.to establish a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation,a plaintiff must prove a misrepresentation,a fraudulent utterance thereof,an intention by the maker that the recipient will thereby be induced to act,justifiable reliance by the recipient upon the misrepresentation and damage to the recipient as the proximate result.martin lancaster battery.unlike petruska civil conspiracy or negligent supervision claims,which require proof of the unlawful act or intentional harm,the resolution of petruska fraudulent misrepresentation claim does not turn on the lawfulness of the decision to restructure,but rather upon the truth or falsity of the assurances that she would be evaluated on her merits when she was initially appointed as university chaplain in july of.
because the state prohibition against fraud does not infringe upon gannon freedom to select its ministers,resolution of petruska fraudulent misrepresentation claim would not violate the free exercise clause.nevertheless,we conclude that petruska has failed to plead fraud with particularity as required by federal rule of civil procedure b,and accordingly,affirm the district court dismissal of that claim see christidis first pennsylvania mortg.trust,cir indicating that the pleading requirements of rule b appl y not only to fraud actions under federal statutes,but to fraud claims based on state law.
petruska state law contract claim 
in count v of her first amended complaint,petruska alleges that pursuant to her contract with gannon,she was entitled to serve on the president staff and lead the chaplain division.she claims that by changing her responsibilities,gannon breached its contract.
on its face,application of state contract law does not involve limits on gannon right to select its ministers unlike the duties under title vii and state tort law,contractual obligations are entirely voluntary.as the court noted in minker baltimore annual conference of united methodist church,a church is always free to burden its activities voluntarily through contract,and such contracts are fully enforceable in civil court.see also,rayburn,at like any other organization,churches may be held liable upon their valid contracts.enforcement of a promise,willingly made and supported by consideration,in no way constitutes a limit upon a church free exercise rights.accordingly,application of state law to petruska contract claim would not violate the free exercise clause.
b.the establishment clause 
above and beyond its free exercise argument,gannon contends that resolution of petruska claims would violate the establishment clause.because we conclude that petruska failed to plead fraud with specificity and that her title vii,civil conspiracy,and negligent retention and supervision claims are barred by the free exercise clause,we need not address those claims further.petruska claim for breach of contract,however,remains subject to review under the establishment clause.based upon our analysis in geary visitation of the blessed virgin mary parish school,cir,we can not conclude that review of this claim would,at the outset,unconstitutionally entangle the court in religion,and we therefore remand it to the district court.
in lemon kurtzman,d,the supreme court set forth a test to determine the validity of a statute under the establishment clause first,the statute must have a secular legislative purpose second,its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion and finally,the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.only the entanglement prong is at issue in evaluating petruska contract claim.
entanglement may be the government is placed in the position of deciding between competing religious the state and church are pitted against one another in a protracted legal battle.see,catholic,at.therefore,courts typically consider the character of the claim,the nature of the remedy,and the presence or absence of a direct conflict between the secular prohibition and the proffered religious doctrine.geary,at.
in geary,the question presented was whether judicial review of a catholic school teacher age discrimination in employment act adea claims would excessively entangle the courts where the school stated reason for the adverse employment decision was based on the plaintiff marriage to a divorced man in violation of church doctrine.id.we concluded that resolution of geary adea claims would not offend the establishment clause because the inquiry was limited to whether the school discriminated against geary on the basis of her age and canceled her insurance in retaliation for her suit.id.geary did not challenge the validity of the religious doctrine she merely claimed that the religious doctrine did not motivate the suit.id.at.we therefore held that when the pretext inquiry neither traverses questions of the validity of religious beliefs nor forces a court to choose between parties competing religious visions,that inquiry does not present a significant risk of entanglement.id.at.
the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit took a similar approach to a minister breach of contract claim in minker,at.minker involved a methodist minister claim that he was orally promised a more suitable pastorship,but was denied such a position based on his age.id.at.the minker court affirmed the dismissal of the minister adea and state law discrimination claim as well as a contract claim based on the methodist church book of discipline,but reversed the dismissal with respect to the oral contract claim.id.at.the court acknowledged that inquiry into the church reasons for failing to meet its contractual obligation could constitute excessive entanglement under the establishment clause,but nevertheless concluded that minker claim could be adduced by a fairly direct inquiry into whether there was an offer,acceptance,consideration,and breach.id.at.the court further noted that if resolution of the contract claim required inquiry into the church ecclesiastical policy,the district court could grant summary judgment on entanglement grounds.
although the ministerial exception does not apply to lay employees,we are presented with no principled reason to distinguish between clergymen and laity for purposes of determining whether resolution of a contract dispute will unduly entangle us under the establishment clause.therefore,the question is whether petruska breach of contract claim can be decided without wading into doctrinal waters.much like the claims in geary and the oral contract claim in minker,petruska breach of contract claim do es not inevitably or even necessarily lead to government inquiry into gannon religious mission or doctrines.geary,at.resolution of this claim does not turn on an ecclesiastical,at least not at the outset.if gannon response to petruska allegations raise issues which would result in excessive entanglement,the claims may be dismissed on that basis on summary judgment.such a conclusion,however,is not inevitably drawn from the face of petruska complaint.we will therefore remand this claim for further consideration by the district court.
iv.conclusion 
the first amendment protects a church right to decide matters of faith and to declare its doctrine free from state interference.a church ability to select who will perform particular spiritual functions is a necessary corollary to this right.the function of petruska position as university chaplain was ministerial in nature,and therefore,her title vii,civil conspiracy,and negligent retention and supervision of which directly turns on the propriety of gannon personnel be dismissed.likewise,petruska fraud claim was not plead with sufficient particularity to withstand a motion to dismiss.accordingly,we will affirm the district court order with respect to these claims.for the reasons set forth above,however,we will be remand petruska contract claim for further consideration by the district court.
as discussed infra,gannon motion to dismiss was framed in the alternative.although we conclude that it is most properly construed as a rule b motion,we note that the standard is the same when considering a facial attack under rule b or a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b.mortensen,at.
petruska activism with respect to gender and issues was not limited to her role in the rubino affair.in,while she was still the director of social concerns,petruska served on the university sexual harassment committee.at the time of her appointment to that committee,the university was in the process of revising its sexual harassment policy,and several of gannon lawyers had advocated limiting the time period in which grievances could be filed.petruska opposed this proposal,and her view ultimately,after she became chaplain and subsequent to rubino resignation,petruska was appointed as chair of gannon institutional integrity committee.in this position,she was integrally involved in preparing a report for gannon middle states accreditation,which criticized the university policies and procedures related to discrimination and harassment.despite a request from gannon president,the committee refused to modify portions of its report which were critical of the university.
as the district court correctly noted,there are two types of rule b motions those that attack the complaint on its face and those that attack subject matter jurisdiction as a matter of fact.when considering a facial attack,the court must consider the allegations of the complaint as true,and in that respect such a rule b motion is similar to a rule b motion.mortensen,at.however,as the court explained in mortensen the factual attack differs greatly for here the trial court may proceed as it never could under b or.because at issue in a factual b motion is the trial court jurisdiction there is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the eviden
