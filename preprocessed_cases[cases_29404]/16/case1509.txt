facts and proceedings 
in our review of a district court grant of summary judgment,we present the facts in the light most favorable to the party 
the facts of this case are sadly familiar on august,hurricane katrina completely obliterated wiley biloxi,mississippi home,save for its slab.wiley had insured his with state farm for.wiley policy contained a water damage exclusion that included an cause provision,however,and state farm denied wiley claim.
in october,wiley and state farm entered the mdi hurricane katrina mediation program.according to wiley,the state farm representative informed him that mississippi law entitled state farm to deny his entire claim because his home had been destroyed by the storm surge,an excluded peril under his policy.wiley took this description of the law to be true,and,after considering and rejecting several offers,signed a settlement agreement the settlement in exchange for.the settlement provided that if the insured s discovers additional insured damage that was not known to the parties prior to this mediation,the insured s may file a supplemental katrina claim,which shall be treated as a new claim.wiley maintains that the state farm representative assured him that the settlement entitled him to or seek additional compensation for his losses.
over a year after the settlement,wiley received a letter from state farm the letter,which explained that pursuant to the agreement reached between state farm and the mississippi department of insurance,state farm had wiley claim and was prepared to offer him an additional.in exchange,wiley would have to sign a release the release,in which he would agree to release,acquit,and forever discharge state farm from any and all claims that wiley has or could have asserted,now or in the future arising out of or related to the damage or loss from hurricane katrina 
wiley contends that between the time of the settlement and the letter,he had learned from his neighbor,a civil engineer,that not solely storm caused part of the damage to his property.wiley consequently refused to sign the release and in may,brought this suit against state farm,alleging breach of contract and tortious breach of contract.
after completion of discovery,state farm moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of wiley claims.state farm grounded its motion on the doctrine of settlement and release based on the settlement.in december,the district court agreed,but held its order in abeyance and offered wiley two weeks in which to present an affidavit that set forth any new additional insured damage that might support his claim.wiley subsequently moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied and,in the same opinion,also rejected wiley for the first time in his motion to the letter and release constituted a waiver of the settlement.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction under a so we apply the substantive law of the forum state,in this case mississippi 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine issue of material fact a fact is material only if its resolution would affect the outcome of the action and an issue is genuine only if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.we may,however,affirm a grant of summary judgment on any legal ground raised below,even if it was not the basis for the district court decision.
the district court held that the settlement barred wiley suit because it unambiguously constituted a complete release of all claims arising from insured damage known to wiley at the time of the settlement,the total loss of his insured property.on appeal wiley makes several claims of error the settlement did not constitute a full,final,and complete settlement of wiley claims in the alternative,the letter constituted a modification or waiver of the settlement state farm should be estopped from relying on the settlement because its agent misled wiley with respect to state farm ability to deny wiley any benefits under his policy and also with respect to wiley right to pursue additional payment for his losses under the settlement.state farm continues to defend on the ground that the settlement constitutes a settlement and release of all wiley claims,as held by the district court.
a.the settlement,letter,and release 
the settlement 
titled mississippi department of insurance hurricane mediation program settlement agreement,the settlement is a standard,form with blank spaces for the parties names.it states in relevant part

the unsigned release states in relevant part 
releasor releases,acquits,and forever discharges the released parties state farm from any and all claims that releasor has or could have asserted,now or in the future,against the released parties,arising out of or related to damage or loss from hurricane katrina to property insured by state farm 
as noted,wiley did not accept the offer of an additional and did not sign the release.
mississippi law 
the mississippi supreme court has established a approach to contract interpretation that begins with the text and applies the familiar four corners test,which focuses exclusively on an objective reading of the words employed in the contract to the exclusion of parol or extrinsic evidence.only if the contract is unclear or ambiguous is a court authorized to resort to canons of interpretation and parol evidence 
whether the settlement was a final settlement 
there can be no serious argument that the settlement unambiguously represented the full,complete and a total final payment for all insured damages that were known to wiley at the
