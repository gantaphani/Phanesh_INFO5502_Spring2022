brian goldman,trustee for the chapter bankruptcy estate of walter nieves debtor,brought suit against various defendants to avoid a series of transfers of an acre parcel of real property in maryland the property originally owned by the debtor.by consent orders,the trustee accomplished avoidance of the property initial and second transfers.trial proceeded against the third transferee,capital city mortgage corporation ccm.the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of the trustee and avoided the transfer,finding that ccm did not show it was a transferee that takes for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer avoided.b.ccm appealed to the district court,which affirmed.ccm appeals once more.we affirm.
according to its president,alan nash,ccm lends money to people or institutions that have difficulty getting credit elsewhere.its website advertises that ccm does not rely on credit scoring and has generous debt to income ratios.the website also explains to potential customers that ccm can lend money e ven if you or a client have an existing bankruptcy.
on april,michael nastasi went to ccm office and filled out a credit application for financial mortgage services,llc financial.in applying for a loan for financial,nastasi dealt directly with ccm president,alan nash.nash met with nastasi for less than an hour.
nastasi told nash that he was the sole member and resident agent of financial.however,nastasi never provided nash with financial articles of organization or operating agreement.id.ccm never attempted to verify that nastasi owned financial or that nastasi was authorized to take out loans for the company.this failure occurred despite the fact that nastasi,according to nash,was confused about the name of his llc because i think in some documents he listed f i r s t and some of them he listed it s.
in the credit application he filled out for financial,nastasi provided only the addresses for financial and nastasi,the tax id number for financial,and the address of the property,which was apparently represented as the only property owned by financial.the application contained no financial information for financial.ccm never obtained any financial information for financial despite nash statement at trial that ccm is always concerned with the creditworthiness of our borrowers.
ccm never viewed financial deed for the property listed in the credit application.nastasi provided nash with only a legal description of the property and a appraisal valuing the property at.the copy of the appraisal noted that it was performed before financial took title to the property.
nevertheless,ccm decided to make a one year,loan to financial for,at a rate of with two points.the loan was secured by the property.ccm only recourse against financial in the event of default,therefore,was to foreclose on the property.the bankruptcy court found that ccm may have anticipated,and even hoped for a payment default.in fact,financial never made a payment on the loan,causing the accrual of large penalties and a default interest rate of.total payoff for the loan as of november,was.
prior to settling the loan on may,ccm obtained a title insurance commitment from paramount title escrow,llc paramount.paramount obtained,per ccm instructions,a certificate of good standing for financial issued by the maryland state department of assessments and taxation sdat.
the title commitment from paramount insured title for.it identified financial and ccm as parties to the deed of trust,listed the property description,and committed to insure fee simple title.it did not indicate that any records search was undertaken by paramount,nor did it provide the results of any such search.id.the bankruptcy court found no evidence that ccm requested any title or record search.id.it did not perform one itself.
the title commitment was issued on april,at eight j.financial did not record its deed to the property until later that same day.therefore,paramount insured title before it could confirm that financial actually owned the property.all of the foregoing facts led the bankruptcy court to find that little,or no effective records search was undertaken.
the certificate of good standing was obtained on april.nash could not recall whether he inspected the good standing certificate prior to closing the loan on may.the trustee expert on real estate transfers and closings testified that a certificate of good standing is not satisfactory and would require updating within a week of closing.indeed,ccm conceded at the hearing before the district court that it had at least been aware before closing on the property that financial legal status was uncertain,but had nonetheless relied on the april certificate of good standing.
the loan closed on may.the deed of trust states that the grantor is first financial mortgage services,llc.the signature page,however,contains an illegible signature from a manager for financial mtg svce,llc.the trustee expert testified that a manager may not sign on behalf of an llc unless authorized by the operating agreement.the trustee also testified that critical parts of the notary were left out because it failed to identify the individual who appeared and signed the deed on behalf of financial,rendering the deed invalid.similarly,the deed of trust note states that the maker is first financial mortgage services,llc.the signature page contains an illegible signature for the maker and gives no indication as to who signed it or with what authority.ccm recorded the deed of trust on june.the expert also testified that in his customary approach,he would not have accepted the deed that financial took on the property because the deed was not notarized,was not acknowledged,and did not comport with the loan documents.ja.these deficiencies impair the ability of the person on the deed to borrow money on the property.ja.
two years before the ccm loan closed,the debtor assets were frozen as a result of a department of labor investigation into the debtor company.prior to august,the debtor had owned the property with his son,michael nieves.on august,the debtor and his son transferred the property to edgardo nieves edgardo,the debtor brother,for zero consideration the initial transfer.the deed identifies the initial transferee as edgardo nieves,his brother and states no consideration tax,and no title examination.two months later,on october,the debtor and his son entered into a consent judgment with the secretary of labor in the amount of.
on march,two months before the ccm loan closed,the debtor filed for bankruptcy under chapter.while the debtor chapter petition was pending,edgardo transferred the property to financial on april,by deed dated april,the second transfer.financial was owned by nastasi,a friend of the debtor and edgardo.this deed was recorded on april,at.the deed recited an alleged consideration of.it was not notarized.
at the time of the second transfer,financial was not a valid entity its charter had been forfeited on october.id.articles of reinstatement for financial were filed with sdat on april,causing it to regain temporarily good standing.id.however,the articles of reinstatement were voided by sdat on may,retroactive to april,because the proper fees were not paid by financial.id.the check financial submitted with its articles of reinstatement had bounced.ja.the bankruptcy court found that at all times relevant to the matter before the court,financial was not a legal entity.
as explained above,financial later received from ccm,secured with a deed of trust to the property,on may.ccm recorded the deed of trust on june.
the debtor chapter petition was dismissed on august,and the debtor filed the instant chapter petition on october.on december,the debtor bankruptcy trustee commenced adversary proceedings against edgardo and financial in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland to avoid the fraudulent transfers and recover the property,pursuant to and.on april,the trustee filed an amended complaint adding ccm as a defendant.j.it is undisputed that both the initial transfer and the second transfer were avoidable as fraudulent transfers pursuant to.by consent orders,the initial transfer and the second transfer were avoided on august,and august,respectively.
on august,ccm consented to the sale of the property by the trustee and to escrow pending the result of the adversary proceeding.the property was sold by the trustee for on june.
the trustee action proceeded to trial against ccm on november.the bankruptcy court issued its decision in favor of the trustee on october,and avoided the third transfer to ccm.the bankruptcy court further ordered that the trustee may recover for the benefit of the estate the proceeds from the sale of the property.
ccm appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court of maryland on october.the district court affirmed on august.ccm filed a timely notice of appeal to this court on september.
in an appeal from a bankruptcy proceeding,we apply the same standard of review that the district court applied when it reviewed the bankruptcy court decision.bowers atlanta motor speedway,in re se.hotel,cir.the legal conclusions of both the district court and the bankruptcy court are reviewed de novo and the factual findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error.chmil rulisa operating in re tudor,ii,cir.
section of the bankruptcy code allows the bankruptcy trustee to avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim.b.this section is commonly used to avoid,under state law,fraudulent transfers from the debtor estate.
in addition to avoiding transfers,the bankruptcy trustee is allowed to recover the avoidable property,or the value of such avoidable property,from the initial transferee or any immediate or mediate,subsequent transferee of an initial transferee.a.a trustee has an absolute right to recover from the initial transferee.a.any immediate or mediate transferee of the initial transferee,however,has an affirmative defense to recovery if such transferee takes for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer avoided.b.o nce the plaintiff has established that a party is an immediate or mediate transferee of the initial transferee,a defendant claiming a defense to liability under b bears the burden of proof.tavenner smoot in re smoot,
the bankruptcy code does not define what it means to take in good faith or without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer avoided.ccm asserts that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in their interpretations of both legal standards in this case.we address the knowledge prong of before the good faith prong because it is the only one this court has ever commented on.
this court has only once before interpreted the knowledge prong in b.in smith mixon,we ruled that knowledge,for purposes of b,does not mean constructive notice,cir.rather,the term knowledge includes only actual notice.id.
ccm argues that the bankruptcy court erred in deciding that mixon did not categorically limit knowledge to facts of which a defendant was completely cognitive.to the extent the bankruptcy court held ccm to a constructive or inquiry notice standard to determine ccm knowledge,regardless of what it actually knew,we agree.mixon confirms that does not impose a requirement of due diligence on every transaction.
however,the mixon opinion is not limited to its statement that knowledge means only actual notice.at.mixon goes on to explain the meaning of knowledge by quoting from collier on bankruptcy 
the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states intended the standard to mean if the transferee knew facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property transferred was recoverable.t he transferee should be held to have knowledge of the voidability of the transfer if,inter alia,he has reasonable cause to believe that a petition may be filed.
at quoting king,collier on bankruptcy at ed.
mixon actual notice standard means that there is no duty to investigate,to be a monitor for creditors benefit when nothing known so far suggests that there is a fraudulent conveyance in the chain.in re bressman,cir citing mixon,at.however,mixon also makes clear that knowledge is satisfied if the transferee knew facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property transferred was recoverable.in re nordic village,cir quoting mixon,at,rev on other grounds sub nom,united states nordic village.mixon actual notice standard,therefore,does not require actual knowledge of the transfer voidability.instead,actual knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the transferred property was voidable is all that is required to show knowledge.
as for the good faith prong,the bankruptcy court and the district court applied an objective standard to determine if ccm took the property in good faith,and ccm challenges this reading of the statute.the bankruptcy code does not provide a definition for good faith and this court has never defined good faith as it pertains to b.we now hold that good faith,as used in b,should be determined under an objective standard.
in determining good faith for the purposes of a b defense,courts should analyze what the transferee knew or should have known instead of examining the transferee actual knowledge from a subjective standpoint.gold laines in re laines,quoting brown third bank in re sherman,cir internal quotations and citations omitted see also,collier on bankruptcy endorsing an objective good faith test.however,like mixon,what the transferee should have known depends on what it actually knew,and not what it was charged with knowing on a theory of constructive notice.in other words,a transferee does not act in good faith when he has sufficient actual knowledge to place him on inquiry notice of the debtor possible insolvency.gold,at quotations and citations omitted.in so holding,we arrive at the same conclusion as the three other circuit courts that have addressed the issue.see brown,at hayes palm seedling partners in re agric.research tech.group,cir bonded fin,european am.bank,cir.
an objective good faith analysis is counseled by this court opinion in huffman commerce sec.in re harbour,f d cir.huffman addressed whether an initial transferee of avoided property could be considered a mere conduit outside the scope of altogether.id.at.huffman endorsed the idea that might not apply on equitable grounds to such an initial transferee when the transferee took in good faith.id.at.the initial transferee in hufman,however,could not make out a showing of good faith because of her wil l ful ignorance in the face of facts which cried out for investigation.id.
the good faith standard applicable to immediate and mediate transferees should be the same as the good faith standard for initial transferees.consistent with huffman,we apply an objective good faith standard for the defense available to immediate and mediate transferees in b.immediate and mediate transferees do not take in good faith if they remain wil l ful ly ignoran t in the face of facts which cr y out for investigation.at.
moreover,our analysis comports with the development of the good faith standard in other areas of commercial law.the uniform commercial code,for instance,uses a similar good faith standard in two commercial settings determining holders in due course,see,and the implied duty of good faith in contracts,see.where it applies,good faith generally means honesty in fact and observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.see b emphasis added see also black law dictionary ed defining good faith as honesty in belief,faithfulness to one duty or obligation,and observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business.
good faith thus contains both subjective honesty in fact and objective observance of reasonable commercial standards components.under the subjective prong,a court looks to the honesty and state of mind of the party acquiring the property.see,triffin pomerantz staffing,llc.under the objective prong,a party acts without good faith by failing to abide by routine business practices.see rudiger charolais ranches van de graaf ranc
