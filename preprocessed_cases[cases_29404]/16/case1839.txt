defendant zurich insurance company issued plaintiff parkans international,a commercial package policy of primary insurance including crime coverage,and an excess custom cover policy ccp.after suffering a loss caused by the fraud of a third party,parkans submitted a claim under the crime coverage of the primary policy.zurich denied coverage,and parkans sued under both the primary policy and the ccp seeking coverage and damages.after a jury trial,the district court entered judgment for parkans.for the following reasons,we reverse and render.
background and procedural history 
parkans agreed to purchase scrap metal from adusa export,promising payment with an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by a bank of parkans choice and confirmed by a bank of adusa choice.parkans chose marine midland which issued the letter of credit.payment would occur at sight upon presentation of certain documents.using fraudulent documents,adusa obtained payment,despite never having shipped the scrap metal.wells fargo the confirming bank paid adusa under the letter of credit,and marine midland withdrew funds from parkans account to pay wells fargo.parkans,having sustained almost a loss because of the fraud,notified its insurance broker,who said the loss was not covered.the perpetrators remain at large.
after filing a claim for indemnity under the primary policy,parkans brought this action alleging that zurich breached its contracts by failing to indemnify parkans under both the primary policy and the ccp.parkans also asked for tort damages against zurich,alleging bad faith and violations of the texas insurance code and deceptive trade practices act dtpa.zurich denied coverage under both policies and denied any wrongdoing.
parkans moved for partial summary judgment on the primary policy,arguing that the crime coverage for forgery applied.zurich moved for summary judgment on both policies and on the damage claims.the court granted parkans motion finding coverage under the primary policy and denied zurich motion.
the remaining issues went to trial by jury.after having been instructed that the loss was covered under the primary policy and that zurich failure to pay the claim was a breach of the primary policy,the jury found that zurich failed to comply with the ccp.the jury also found that zurich knowingly engaged in unfair and deceptive practices.the jury awarded million for breach of contract,million on the tort claims,and for attorneys fees at trial.the district court entered final judgment against zurich only on the breach of contract award and attorneys fees,awarding interest and statutory damages as well.zurich appeals.
ii.primary coverage and the parkans loss 
the crime coverage at issue under the primary policy provides 
we will pay for loss involving covered instruments resulting directly from the covered causes of loss.
covered instruments checks,drafts,promissory notes,or similar written promises,orders or directions to pay a sum certain in money that are 
made or drawn by or drawn upon the insured 
made or drawn by one acting as the insured agent 
or that are purported to have been so made or drawn.
covered causes of loss forgery or alteration of,on or in a covered instrument.
finding coverage under the foregoing provisions,the district court determined on summary judgment that adusa obtained payment on the letter of credit by presenting forged documents to wells fargo,including forged certificates and a forged bill of lading.this court reviews de novo the trial court decision on summary judgment.cas.chevron pipe line,cir 
the summary judgment evidence establishes that the irrevocable letter of credit was payable at sight upon the presentation of certain documents,namely,a commercial invoice,a packing list,a certificate of weight,a quality and weight certificate from a qualified surveying firm,on board bills of lading issued to the order of marine midland by the shipper,and adusa signed statement certifying that one set of documents was sent by courier to parkans immediately after shipment.adusa presented documents purporting to be those documents required by the letter of credit,most on its own letterhead,with an inspection quality and weight certificate ostensibly from alfred knight a surveying firm and bills of lading ostensibly from crowley american transport a shipping company,although all the documents were fraudulent.
zurich contends that even if forgeries occurred,they were not covered because they were not forgeries of covered instruments.to be a covered instrument,a document must be a check,draft,promissory note,or similar written promise,order or direction to pay made or drawn by or drawn upon parkans made or drawn by one acting as parkans agent or purported to have been so made or drawn.even if we view the letter of credit as a similar promise to pay,it can not be a covered instrument because it was neither made by,drawn by,or drawn upon parkans or its agent,nor purported to have been so made or drawn.
the district court recognized that parkans may not have been the technical drawee in the transaction,but treated parkans as such simply because it was the party who ultimately suffered the loss.the district court quoted from and embraced the reasoning of omnisource cna,which held omnisource to be the drawee i n the sense of to draw as to withdraw,to call on funds,or to get from a source.omnisource quoted from black law dictionary,american heritage dictionary and webster new universal unabridged dictionary,in order to define drawee.
a contextual analysis of the contract is the proper approach to determine the meaning of contractual terms.see gulf metals,chicago ins,pet.denied.the policy uses the term drawn in the context of the specific listed instruments and similar promises,orders,or directions to pay.in the commercial paper context the phrases drawn by and drawn upon are not ambiguous and have a definite legal meaning.a contract term that can be given a definite or certain legal meaning is not ambiguous.national union fire ins.cbi.we will not therefore interpose multiple dictionary usages.
the letter of credit itself identifies the drawee as the advising bank,marine midland and not parkans.neither the letter of credit nor any of the fraudulent documents presented by adusa were made or drawn by or drawn upon parkans.nor were any of those documents made or drawn by or drawn upon one acting as parkans agent.in the letter of credit transaction,marine midland acted as principal for itself not as agent for parkans.see republic bank northwest bank.finally,none of the documents were purported to have been made or drawn by or drawn upon parkans within the meaning of the policy.the remaining documents were all ostensibly made by adusa or legitimate enterprises,not parkans.adusa direction to wells fargo to pay via wire transfer,even if we consider it a forgery,was not drawn upon parkans.accordingly,none of the documents in this case are covered instruments.we therefore reverse the partial summary judgment in favor of parkans and render judgment for zurich,finding no coverage under the primary policy.
iii.excess coverage under the ccp 
zurich moved for judgment as a matter of law that no coverage existed under the ccp.we review denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law using the same standard as the district court factual issues are reviewed only for the presence of substantial evidence supporting the verdict,and legal issues are reviewed de novo heller,grammco computer sales,cir.
the ccp applies excess of,but in the same manner and on the same basis as the primary insurance shown on our schedule a as applying to coverage part.even if the crime coverage in the primary policy is intended to be included in the meaning of the foregoing clause,the loss in this case is excluded because,as discussed above,the documents involved are not covered instruments as defined in the primary policy.
parkans has alternatively argued that ccp provides a function,and thus applies here regardless of underlying coverage.parkans points to no provision in the ccp,however,specifying coverage if primary insurance does not apply.to the contrary,the ccp has a maintenance provision,requiring that the primary insurance must continuously provide no less coverage than written on our schedule a at inception of our policy.furthermore,if the primary coverages listed in schedule a are not maintained,the ccp coverage will apply in the same manner as if the primary insurance were still in effect,maintained and collectible.we hold that these provisions in the ccp preclude coverage by showing the intention that the ccp serve only as an excess layer above that insurance listed in schedule a,none of which is applicable to the parkans loss.commercial union ins.walbrook ins,cir coverage implicated by clause providing a retention for each occurrence not covered by the specified underlying policy.
iv.the tort claims 
the jury also found that zurich engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice that caused damage to parkans,and did so knowingly zurich had moved for judgment as a matter of law on those claims,so we review legal issues de novo and factual issues for substantial evidence in support of the verdict.heller,at.
on these claims zurich is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,because it had a reasonable basis for denial of coverage.see transportation ins.moriel,insured claiming bad faith must prove that insurer had no reasonable basis for denying or delaying payment of the claim.this shields zurich whether the tort claims are or statutory.id.breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing higginbotham state farm mut.auto.ins,cir claims under dtpa and of the texas insurance code require same predicate for recovery as a bad faith cause of action see also emmert progressive county mut.ins,writ denied insurer will not be faced with a tort suit for challenging a claim of coverage if there was any reasonable basis for denying coverage violations of texas insurance code,claims under texas deceptive trade practices act,and tort citing lyons millers cas.ins.since there was a bona fide dispute justifying the insurer failure to pay,the insurer,as a matter of law,did not act in bad faith.
moreover,the jury essentially found no tort injuries independent of the contract damages there can be no recovery for damages for mishandling claims unless the complained of actions or omissions caused injury independent of those that would have resulted from a wrongful denial of policy benefits.provident american ins.castaneda,claims of insurance code violations and under dtpa.

vi.conclusion 
because no covered instrument was made or drawn by or drawn upon parkans,the crime coverage for forgery under the primary policy does not apply.zurich not parkans was entitled to summary judgment on coverage under the primary policy.the ccp provides only excess and not coverage,so it does not apply to fill the gap in primary coverage.there is no basis for recovery under the tort claims.no attorneys fees or statutory damages are due plaintiff.
the judgment previously entered in favor of parkans is reversed,and judgment is rendered for defendant zurich insurance company denying all relief to parkans.
reversed and rendered.
to the detriment of the insured,the majority gives the terms of this insurance policy their technical,rather than popular,meaning.because this method of interpretation contravenes established canons of texas insurance law,i respectfully dissent.
the threshold question is whether parkans letter of credit is a covered instrument.the policy defines covered instruments as 
checks,drafts,promissory notes,or similar written promises,orders or directions to pay a sum certain in money that are 
made or drawn by or drawn upon parkans 
made or drawn by one acting as parkans agent 
or that are purported to have been so made or drawn.
because the policy provision refers to checks,drafts,and promissory notes,the majority argues that the word drawn must be read in context according to its meaning under the ucc.it therefore concludes that the phrase drawn by or drawn upon limits coverage to transactions in which the insured is the actual drawee under texas commercial paper law.since midland bank was technically the drawee in this transaction,the court holds that the letter of credit was not drawn upon parkans and therefore was not a covered instrument.
the majority interpretation conflicts with basic principles of texas insurance law.when interpreting an insurance contract,texas courts will read its terms in their plain,ordinary,and popular sense unless the policy defines a term in some other way texas courts disfavor interpretations that limit coverage,and they construe ambiguities in favor of the insured under these principles,parkans was covered for its loss.
in the present context,the relevant popular definition of draw is to withdraw or to take or receive money from a source of supply.under this reading,the letter of credit was drawn upon parkans because the funds stolen in this transaction were ultimately drawn from parkans account and,to the extent that it is unclear whether the policy requires that parkans be the technical drawee of the instrument,we are compelled to construe this ambiguity in favor of coverage.
the majority rejects this plain reading of the policy in favor of a more technical one.relying on gulf metals industries,chicago insurance the majority argues that the policy must be read in the commercial paper context and according to ucc definitions.the majority reliance on gulf metals is,however,misplaced.at issue in gulf metals was the meaning of the phrase sudden and accidental as it appeared in an insurance policy the district court held that the term sudden adds a temporal element,meaning abrupt or brief.the insured disagreed,arguing that sudden does not necessarily carry a temporal meaning.citing various dictionary definitions,the insured argued that the word can also mean unexpected,and that this uncertainty of meaning proves that the policy is ambiguous 
the texas appeals court rejected the insured argument noting that the word sudden appeared in conjunction with the word accidental,the court reasoned that sudden must add a temporal requirement.because accidental describes an unforeseen or unexpected event,the court held that to ascribe the same meaning to sudden would render the terms redundant and violate the rule that each word in a contract be given effect.thus,both of the proffered interpretations were ordinary,or popular the court was not rejecting a interpretation in favor of a technical one.rather,the court held that,in context,sudden was clearly being used in its popular temporal sense.
contextual arguments like the one used in gulf metals are useful for interpreting terms that have multiple common meanings,but not for choosing a technical interpretation over a reasonable common interpretation.in this case,for instance,the phrase drawn upon can not mean that the instrument must be sketched or illustrated upon parkans corporate headquarters,because the policy clearly uses the phrase in the context of monetary withdrawals.but there is nothing in the context of the policy that limits the word drawn to its technical meaning under the ucc.the term is not specifically defined,and the policy makes no reference to the texas business and commerce code.under texas insurance law,if zurich intended for the term to have a definition other than an ordinary one,it was required to define the term accordingly 
texas courts will sometimes interpret a term in an insurance policy according to its usage within a particular vocation,trade,or industry.reliance on trade usage is,however,only appropriate when the insured is acquainted with and has adopted the usage for example,in mescalero energy,underwriters indemnity general agency,a texas appellate court applied
