alan clukey brought this procedural due process claim against his former employer,the town of camden the town,pursuant to alleging that the town deprived him of a constitutionally protected property interest in his right to be recalled to employment without due process of law.the district court dismissed clukey complaint,adopting the magistrate judge conclusion that while clukey did have a protected property interest in his recall right,his claim was foreclosed by the availability of a state law claim.
although the court was correct that clukey complaint alleged a protected property interest in his recall right,we can not accept its conclusion that clukey potential recourse to state law foreclosed his claim.hence,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
we draw the following facts,which we take as true,from the complaint and documents incorporated by reference into the complaint.see lass bank of america,cir.
plaintiff alan clukey was a police dispatcher with the camden police department for years until his department was eliminated in and he was laid off.at the time of his,clukey was the most senior employee in his department.
the terms of clukey employment with the town were governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba between the town and the fraternal order of police.in critical part,article,section of the collective bargaining agreement provides that 
in the event it becomes necessary for the employer to layoff employees for any reason,employees shall be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority,by classification,with bumping rights.bumping shall not be allowed between the police function and the dispatcher function.employees shall be recalled from according to their seniority provided they are qualified to fill the position.police function and dispatcher function shall be treated separately 
the affected employee has recall rights for twelve months from the date of such lay off.
article of the cba provides a formal grievance procedure for dealing with any dispute between the parties as to the meaning,or application,of the specific terms of the agreement.the grievance procedure provides for an escalating interactive process and an informal hearing.if the employee remains dissatisfied at the conclusion of the informal process,she can request arbitration.the decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties for the duration of the agreement.
in the twelve months following clukey termination,at least two positions opened with the police department for which clukey was qualified one position as an administrative assistant and one as a parking enforcement officer.the town did not recall him to either position.indeed,the town filled these positions with new hires without providing clukey any notice that he was not being recalled,or explaining how he could appeal this determination.
clukey and his wife dera clukey brought suit in federal court against the town of camden under,alleging that the town had deprived him of his property interest in his right to be recalled without providing him due process of law in violation of the constitution procedural due process guarantees the town filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss clukey claims,arguing that clukey did not have a constitutionally protected property interest in his right to be recalled.
in reviewing the defendant motion,the magistrate judge determined that clukey did have a property interest in his right to be recalled,but ultimately concluded that our decision in ramírez arlequín,cir,compelled the conclusion that clukey claim was not cognizable under.in particular,the magistrate judge recommendation relied heavily on our conclusion that 
a claim of breach of contract by a state actor without any indication or allegation that the state would refuse to remedy the plaintiffs grievance should they demonstrate a breach of contract under state law,does not state a claim for violation of the plaintiffs right of procedural due process.
id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.concluding that,like the plaintiff claim in ramírez,clukey claim was one for breach of contract,the magistrate judge recommended dismissal.the district court adopted the recommendation,dismissing clukey complaint for failure to state a claim clukey appeals.
to state a procedural due process claim under,the plaintiff must allege facts which,if true,establish that the plaintiff had a property interest of constitutional magnitude and was deprived of that property interest without due process of law.see garcía rubiera fortuño,cir.our review of the trial court dismissal of clukey complaint is de novo.see ramírez,at.
clukey property interest in his right to be recalled 
property interests in public employment 
the threshold issue in a procedural due process action is whether the plaintiff had a constitutionally protected property interest at stake.mard town of amherst,cir citing cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill.the due process clause guarantees individuals procedural protections from state actions that deprive those individuals of their property interests in certain entitlements and benefits.see,goldberg kelly,property interest in welfare benefits perry sindermann,public employment goss lopez,attendance at public schools memphis light,gas water div.craft,utility services barry barchi,professional licenses.
the town asserts,without citing any precedent,that it is impossible for clukey to have a property interest in his right to recall because no property interest in continued employment can exist if one is not already employed.this argument ignores the centrality of state law to the property interest inquiry.the critical inquiry in a procedural due process case involving a right of employment is whether the plaintiff has a legitimate claim of entitlement grounded in state law,not whether one is already employed.see paul davis,noting that the property interests protected by the due process clause attain this constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially recognized by state law see also town of castle rock,gonzales,souter,concurring t he federal process protects the property created by state law.the supreme court has emphasized that it is the prerogative of the states to define property,and i t is not the business of a court adjudicating due process rights to make its own critical evaluation of those choices and protect only the ones that,by its own lights,are necessary.fuentes shevin.as such,our inquiry must begin by considering whether an entitlement grounded in state law exists,recognizing that the types of interests protected as property are varied and,as often as not,intangible,relating to the whole domain of social and economic fact.logan zimmerman brush,quoting mut.ins.tidewater transfer,frankfurter,dissenting see also town of castle rock,at resolution of the federal issue begins with a determination of what it is that state law provides.
in considering whether state law creates an entitlement,we look primarily to the discretion state law accords state actors to withhold the entitlement from individuals.in general,a benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.town of castle rock,at.rather,the more circumscribed is the government discretion under substantive state or federal law to withhold a benefit,the more likely that benefit constitutes property.beitzell jeffrey,cir see also colburn trs of,cir property interests exist when an employer discretion is clearly limited so that the employee can not be denied employment unless specific conditions are met.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.
that a tenured public employee has a protected property interest in continued employment is beyond question.see loudermill,at.tenure is not the only employment benefit,however,that can be protected by the constitutional guarantees of due process.for example,we have held that where a public employer collective bargaining agreement uses mandatory language,the public employees covered by that agreement have a constitutionally protected property interest in injury leave benefits.see mard,at.similarly,we have joined a majority of our sister circuits in concluding that public employees may have a protected property interest in their rank such that they may not be demoted without due process.see acosta orozco rodriguez de rivera,cir see also ciambriello cnty.of nassau,cir collecting cases.we have also held that physicians can have a property right in privileges at public hospitals.see lowe scott,cir.at least one of our fellow circuits has also determined that public employees can have a property interest in a veteran preference in promotions.see carter city of,cir concluding that armed forces veteran had interest not in the promotion per se,but in being given a preference when his promotion is considered.
although we have never addressed whether the right to be recalled following a can be a constitutionally protected property interest,we have addressed closely analogous situations,such as the right to be reinstated following a period of disability leave.in laborde garcia puerto rico telephone,cir,we considered whether a puerto rico statute created a property interest in reinstatement for public employees who sought to return to their previous positions following a period of disability.the statute provides that the employer shall be under the obligation to reserve the job filled by the laborer or employee at the time the accident occurred,and to reinstate him therein,provided certain conditions were met.laws ann.tit.the employer argued that the employees could not have a right to reinstatement because such rights are only expectations of employment,which may or may not be fulfilled.laborde garcia,at at.rejecting this argument,we found that the language of the statute so narrow ed the employer discretion to decide not to reinstate the employee to her previous employment that it amounted to a legitimate claim of entitlement to that continued employment.id.internal quotation marks omitted see rivera flores,cir addressing the same statute and describing the process due see also harhay town of ellington bd.of,cir determining that laid off teacher had protected property interest in her place on a reappointment list buttitta city of,cir determining that state law governing compulsory disability leave for police officers creates in police officers a property interest in being returned to the department for an opportunity to demonstrate their fitness for active duty stana sch.dist.of pittsburgh,cir determining that public school teacher had property interest in her position on list determining eligibility for promotions and transfers.
directly addressing the question of whether a public employee has a property interest in a recall right,the seventh circuit has determined that the existence of the right depended on whether the state law at issue created such a substantive right in the employees.see chi.teachers union bd.of,cir per curiam.in that case,the city of chicago,facing a budget crisis,laid off tenured teachers in the summer of.id.at.as the budget situation improved,approximately half of those laid off teachers were recalled to new positions.however,some teacher openings were filled with new hires,rather than the tenured teachers who had been laid off.id.at.the tenured teachers who were not recalled brought suit against the state alleging,inter alia,that the state had deprived them of their property interest in their right to be recalled without due process.
after initially determining that the teachers did have a substantive right to recall,see chi.teachers union bd.of,cir.march,the panel,in response to a petition for rehearing en banc,decided to certify to the illinois supreme court the question of whether illinois law granted the teachers such a substantive recall right.
taking on the certified questions,in chicago teachers union board of education,the illinois supreme court compared two separate illinois statutes one governing teachers in chicago and one governing illinois teachers outside of chicago.the court concluded that the statute governing chicago teachers did not create a property interest in recall because the statute did not contain any mandatory language and concerned primarily the powers of the board,not the rights of the individual teachers.see id.at discussing.comp.stat.ann.by contrast,the statute governing teachers outside of chicago did create a substantive right to recall because the statute contained mandatory language and focused on the rights of the individual teachers themselves.see id.discussing.comp.stat.ann.
clukey property interest 
under maine law,a constitutionally protected property interest can be created in a public employment contract.see krennerich inhabitants of town of bristol,in maine a property interest in continued employment may be established by contract,statute,or by proof of an objectively reasonable expectation of continued employment.citing mercier town of fairfield,me see also rivera flores,at recognizing that a collective bargaining agreement can give rise to protected property interests ciambriello,at same.
thus,we must examine the language of the cba itself to see whether it so narrows the town discretion to rehire clukey that clukey had a legitimate claim of entitlement to be recalled to police department positions for which he was qualified.see laborde garcia,at.the relevant provision of the cba,article provides 
employees shall be recalled from according to their seniority provided they are qualified to fill the position the affected employee has recall rights for twelve months from the date of such lay off.
emphasis added.
we agree with the district court that the plain language of this proviso compels a conclusion that clukey had a property interest in his right to be recalled.the intent of the bargaining parties to grant employees an entitlement to recall could not be clearer.by its terms,this proviso vests the recall rights in the individual affected employee and provides the town no discretion in qualified employees with requisite seniority employees shall be recalled.
indeed,the language in article is so obviously that the town does not seriously contend otherwise,conceding in its briefs that article creates conditional recall rights for certain laid off employees.thus,rather than arguing that the cba creates no rights at all,the town argues that the language in the cba defines the recall right so narrowly that clukey was only entitled to be recalled to a position as a dispatcher,rather than any position in the police department for which he was qualified and most senior 
the town rests much of this argument on the sentence in article that reads police function and dispatcher function shall be treated separately.according to the town,this sentence can only mean that dispatchers have a right to be recalled only to open positions involving dispatcher functions.since clukey has not specifically plead that he was not recalled to a job involving dispatcher functions,he has not established the deprivation of a property interest.
before the district court,the town itself pressed a different interpretation of this language that it now says on appeal has one meaning.in its motion to dismiss,the town argued only that the shall be treated separately language meant that clukey recall right did not extend to the parking enforcement officer position,presumably because this was a position involving police function.the town did not argue that this language meant clukey could not be recalled to the administrative assistant position or that he could be recalled only to positions involving dispatcher function.
clukey plausibly offers yet another interpretation of the disputed language that the treated separately language is about seniority and not the scope of the recall right itself.in other words,the treated separately language parallels the language in the procedures.when a police position becomes open,if there is a police officer on the recall list,he is automatically entitled to seniority for that position.if there are no police officers on the recall list,then the position goes to the most senior dispatcher.
mindful that this appeal is before us from a dismissal for failure to state a claim,we need not decide the meaning of this sentence.rather,having found the phrase plausibly susceptible to different interpretations,we resolve the ambiguity in clukey favor,and thus reject the town argument that the language of article clearly limits the scope of clukey recall right to jobs involving dispatcher function.see lass,at holding that ambiguous contract provisions foreclose dismissal of complaint see also subaru distribs.subaru of,cir we are not obliged to accept the allegations of the complaint as to how to construe a contract,but at this procedural stage,we should resolve any contractual ambiguities in favor of the plaintiff.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court was correct in its determination that clukey has stated facts which,if true,establish that he has a constitutionally protected property interest in his right to be recalled to employment with the police department of the town of camden.we turn now to the question of whether he has adequately alleged that the town deprived him of that interest without constitutionally sufficient process.
b.the process due 
it is well established that in every case where a protected property interest is at stake,the constitution requires,at a minimum,some kind of notice and some kind of opportunity to be heard.see dusenbery united states,loudermill,at while the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest in public employment,it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest,once conferred,without appropriate procedural safeguards.alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.exactly what sort of notice and what sort of hearing the constitution requires,however,vary with the particulars of the case.see morrissey brewer,n ot all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.zinermon burch,due process is a flexible concept that varies with the particular situation.
to resolve this question,we use the familiar test laid out by the supreme court in mathews eldridge.we determine the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.id.at.
both parties press us to make a more specific determination about the process due clukey pursuant to the mathews test.in particular,the parties dispute whether clukey was entitled to any process whether or not an individual is entitled to notice is often a difficult,question.see ciambriello,at the determination of whether one is entitled to a hearing is.however,as we explain,resolving this appeal does not require us to address this question.
the complaint alleges that the town failed to provide clukey with any notice of any kind whatsoever.this allegation is fatal to the town argument.see memphis light,at concluding that even where opportunities to be heard existed,due process is not satisfied if affected individuals are given no notice of those opportunities,at holding that even where affected individuals had or should have had actual knowledge about deprivation,due process still required individualized notice collins marina martinez,cir concluding that without suitable notice,the opportunity for plaintiff to be heard is a charade.the mathews test is a balancing test used to determine what sort of notice and what sort of hearing is required in a particular case.it excludes the premise that public employees may be deprived of a property interest without any notice at all.
this is not to say,of course,that the town on remand is foreclosed from offering evidence of the administrative and financial costs it would have to bear in order to provide various procedural protections to its aggrieved employees.we leave it to the district court to engage in a mathews analysis on a more developed factual record if doing so becomes necessary to resolve the case.for present purposes,however,clukey uncontested allegation that he received no notice either before or after the town deprived him of a protected property interest in employment is in itself sufficient to state a procedural due process claim under.
c.the availability of alternative remedial schemes 
the district court concluded that clukey claim was foreclosed by the availability of state law remedies.following the district court lead,the town also urges us to find that any claim clukey might otherwise have is foreclosed by the availability of either state law contract remedies,or the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement.as we will explain,the existence of these alternative remedies does not foreclose clukey claim.
state law breach of contract claims 
the court conclusion that the availability of a state law breach of contract claim foreclosed any claim clukey might otherwise have rests on a misunderstanding of the application of our opinion in ramírez arlequín,cir,to this very different case.ramírez was a classic breach of contract case concerning a dispute between a municipality and an independent contractor over the municipality alleged refusal to pay the contractor for work it had performed pursuant to a contractual agreement between the parties.we held that the availability of a traditional state law breach of contract claim for damages foreclosed any argument from the contractor that the state had deprived it of due process.see id.
our decision in ramírez rested heavily on the supreme court opinion in lujan g g fire sprinklers.in that case,the court addressed a california statutory scheme that allowed state agencies to withhold payments to public works contractors if that contractor or its subcontractors failed to comply with certain provisions of the california labor code.id.at.plaintiff subcontractor g g sprinklers alleged that the state had deprived it of property without due process when the state withheld payments following a state agency determination that g g had engaged in unfair labor practices.id.at.assuming without deciding that g g had a property interest in receiving the payments,the court concluded that where a government contractor only claim is that it is entitled to be paid in full,a state law breach of contract claim was all the process due.id.at.the court was careful,however,to distinguish the facts in lujan from cases where plaintiffs allege that they are presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property,or to pursue a gainful occupation.id.
here,we are not dealing with a contractual dispute over compensation for past work performed analogous to ramírez or lujan.the property right at issue in this case is the right to be employed if certain conditions are met.lujan made clear that the right to pursue a gainful occupation can not be fully protected by an ordinary suit.concepción chaparro ruiz hernández,cir quoting lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted see also baird bd.of,cir discussing lujan and concluding that deprivation of property interest in employment would not be satisfied by claim.in fact,there is a long history of case law in this circuit holding that public employees who have been deprived of a property interest in employment without due process may bring a claim in federal court regardless of the availability of a state law claim.see,concepción chaparro,at cotnoir of me,cir see also godin machiasport sch.dep t bd.of directors,d,holding that public employee failure to pursue appeal process under maine rule of civil procedure did not preclude her from bringing procedural due process claim under.
the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement 
the town also argues that
