opinion of the court 
this is a dispute between rival labor unions and an employer over the proper assignment of work under a collective bargaining agreement and the employer obligation to make contributions to the benefit fund of the union that performed none of the contested work.despite mandatory arbitration provisions in both the collective bargaining agreement and the trust fund agreement,a minority of aggrieved benefit fund union trustees brought suit under the labor management relations act and the employee retirement income security act for an accounting and recovery of contributions allegedly due their fund for work performed by a rival union concluding the trust agreements required a majority of the trustees to institute suit,the district court dismissed this action for lack of standing.we will affirm.
plaintiff invokes federal jurisdiction under of the labor management relations act of lmra,and under and of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,although this matter reflects the underlying tension between the lmra and erisa in the collective bargaining context,the applicable law in this particular case is provided by the lmra.

plaintiffs thomas kilkenny and william taylor are union trustees for the local benefit funds a group of employee benefit plans cosponsored by the local operative plasterers and cement masons international association and a bargaining association known as the master plasterers company of philadelphia,a subdivision of the interior finish contractors association.defendant long,is a plastering and drywall contracting company who was represented by the interior finish contractors association for collective bargaining purposes.
the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the local plasterers union and the interior finish contractors association provides that the work of erection and installation,including cutting and fitting of rigid insulation,including the mechanical fastening of same,as used in the fabrication of exterior insulation finished system and similar type systems,shall be the work of the plasterers.the agreement requires employers to make contributions of fringe benefits to the local employee benefit funds for all employees represented by the union while the employees are working in the jurisdiction of the union.when disputes arise between the employer and union concerning interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement,the agreement mandates arbitration 
in december,long contracted to perform work on a construction project at downingtown high school in chester county,pennsylvania.part of this project involved fastening rigid foam insulation.long assigned this work to members of plasterers local and to members of a rival union,the carpenters union.both local and the carpenters union believe the mechanical fastening of rigid foam insulation is work that should be performed exclusively by their respective members.long divided the fastening work,allegedly assigning the mechanical fastening of rigid foam insulation to carpenters union members,and the fastening to local plasterers union members.long made all required contributions for the mechanical fastening work to the carpenters union benefit fund,but none to the plasterers union benefit fund,as their members had not performed any of that work.
believing the collective bargaining agreement obligated long to make benefit contributions for the mechanical foam insulation work to local or not local members performed the trustees kilkenny and taylor brought suit without the approval of the other four trustees and without pursuing arbitration.after suit was filed,the trustees met and discussed the pending lawsuit.the employer trustees requested the lawsuit be withdrawn,but the union trustees were opposed.a deadlock ensued between the employer trustees and the union trustees.
subsequently the employer trustees sought to have the deadlocked motion arbitrated under lmra c and the local pension plan trust agreement like the collective bargaining agreement,the local pension plan trust agreement provides for arbitration when disputes arise 
if the trustees are unable to agree upon or settle any of the matters arising under the administration of the fund,the trustees representing the employer and the trustees representing the union will attempt to agree upon the designation of an impartial arbitrator the decision of the arbitrator so agreed upon or appointed by the american arbitration association or by the district court shall be final and binding on all concerned.
notwithstanding these provisions,kilkenny and taylor refused to submit the deadlocked dispute to arbitration,contending that as erisa fiduciaries,they were entitled to bring suit in federal court.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs action for lack of standing,concluding the employer appointed trustees had not authorized the lawsuit,and the union trustees can not act alone in this regard.if,as here,the trustees are deadlocked in any matter of trust administration,the trust agreements provide for an arbitration procedure to resolve the impasse.the union trustees have not invoked the arbitration procedure.since the union trustees do not presently have standing to bring this action,the complaint is being dismissed.district court order,citing alfarone bernie wolff const,cir.this appeal followed.
the local employee benefit funds are employee benefit plans governed by the labor management relations act and the employee retirement income security act.as noted,the lmra requires that employee benefit funds receiving employer contributions be jointly administered by an equal number of employee and employer representatives.c b.in the event of a deadlock between the trustees,the lmra requires the employer and employee representatives to agree on an impartial umpire to decide the dispute id 
erisa protects employee pensions and other benefits by providing insurance specifying certain plan characteristics in detail and by setting forth certain general fiduciary duties applicable to the management of both pension and nonpension benefit plans.varity howe,d.erisa fiduciaries include persons who exercise discretionary authority or control,respecting management or administration of a benefit plan.a.fiduciaries are required to discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and their beneficiaries and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of erisa.a.as fiduciaries,trustees must take action against employers who fail to contribute to the fund as required by the plan.this obligation could require the trustees to commence suit,or to picket the employer but some action must be taken to safeguard beneficiaries credited service.rosen hotel rest.employers bartenders union of philadelphia,cir.accordingly,erisa permits fiduciaries to sue in federal court as a means of enforcing the terms of a benefit plan.a.
as we have recognized,there is often tension between the judicial remedies provided by erisa and the arbitration favored by general principles of labor law.viggiano shenango china div.of anchor hocking,cir.we have observed 
erisa provides for immediate access to the federal courts without resort to the labor arbitration forum in proper circumstances.see schneider moving storage robbins,d.but that result does not automatically follow in each instance where there is a controversy over some phase of an employee welfare plan as defined by erisa.resort to arbitration may still be appropriate where the parties contest the meaning of a term in a collective bargaining ag
