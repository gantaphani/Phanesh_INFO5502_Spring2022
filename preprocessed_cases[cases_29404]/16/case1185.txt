ii.discussion 
underinsured motorist insurance uim is a first party coverage intended to supplement the inadequate motoring liability insurance of an.theodore smetak,underinsured motorist coverage in minnesota old precedents in a new era,mitchell,see also paylor hartford ins,purpose of uim is to protect an insured and his or her additional insureds from the risk that a negligent driver of another vehicle will cause injury and will have inadequate coverage to compensate for the injuries caused by his or her negligence quoting wolgemuth harleysville mut.ins.
under pennsylvania prior insurance scheme,the commonwealth required motorists to carry uninsured,but not underinsured,motorist insurance.pennsylvania motor vehicle insurance act.repealed,a.as a result,individuals who were involved in accidents with tortfeasors driving uninsured vehicles would be able to recover on their own policies,but would not be able to recover were the tortfeasor merely to have underinsured his or her vehicle.paylor,at c laimants would find themselves in a better position were the tortfeasor vehicle totally uninsured,rather than underinsured.quoting davis gov t employees ins.
the pennsylvania legislature rectified this anomaly by passing the motor vehicle financial responsibility law.mvfrl,which mandated the issuance of both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage as part of every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued in the commonwealth.paylor,at.in,the mvfrl was amended to require that an insurance company continue to offer underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage,but to eliminate the requirement that an insured accept those coverages.id.at citing.a.
the mvfrl has presented the pennsylvania courts with many issues involving claimants eligibility for underinsured motorists benefits and exclusionary clauses in automobile insurance policies.see also,windrim nationwide ins,eichelman nationwide ins,burstein prudential prop.and cas.ins,colbert,at.this case is the latest in that long line of decisions.at their base are two principles of contract interpretation.a clear and unambiguous contract provision must be given its plain meaning.burstein,at.however,contract provisions will not be enforced if to do so would be contrary to a clearly expressed public policy.id.appellees do not claim that the language of the clause that the district court deemed to bar their recovery is ambiguous rather,they claim that to enforce that language would be contrary to the public policy expressed by the pennsylvania legislature in the mvfrl.
public policy of the mvfrl 
the pennsylvania supreme court has cautioned against invalidating contract provisions because of vague public policy concerns articulated by the courts.eichelman,at.it has noted that p ublic policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interest.id.o nly dominant public policy will justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy,manifested by long governmental practice or statutory enactments,or by violations of obvious ethical or moral standards.id.
the predecessor legislation to the mvflr,the act,embodied the public policy concern of maximum feasible restoration to accident victims.burstein,at.but,according to the pennsylvania supreme court,the mvflr parted emphasis from that principle.while other public policies may underlie the mvflr,its dominant and overarching public policy is legislative concern for the spiralling consumer cost of automobile insurance.id.at.and the court continues to assert that whether public policy concerns justify invalidating an exclusionary clause in an insurance contract must be determined on the facts of each case.colbert,at citing paylor,at.
validity of household exclusion clauses 
in paylor,the pennsylvania supreme court first addressed the validity of exclusion clauses under the mvfrl.paylor involved a family car exclusion,which excludes a vehicle owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of the named insured or any family member from the definition of an underinsured motor vehicle.at.in other words,if an insured is injured by a family car which is underinsured,the policy will not compensate the insured as it would had the insured been injured by a third person.janet paylor sued on behalf of her mother,betty dymond,who was killed in a accident involving the motor home operated by her husband,fred dymond.id.at.the motor home was insured by foremost insurance company the dymonds other three vehicles were insured by hartford insurance company.id.paylor recovered the limits of the liability coverage under the foremost policy,and then sought to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the hartford policy.id.hartford denied coverage based on the family car exclusion,and the supreme court upheld the insurance company denial.id.
the court first rejected paylor suggestion that any sort of contractual exclusion was per se invalid.id.at rejecting arguments that the family car exclusion is repugnant to the purposes and policy of the mvfrl.instead,it adopted an approach in which t he enforceability of these clauses is dependent upon the factual circumstances presented in each case.id.at.the court announced
