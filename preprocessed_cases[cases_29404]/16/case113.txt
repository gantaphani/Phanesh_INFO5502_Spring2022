this case arises out of nearly twenty years of litigation conducted along multiple fronts between real estate development entities on the one hand and the condominium entities generated by this development on the other.since at least,the condominium associations and the idc development entities idc,idc properties,and idc clambakes,the in this matter have been disputing the ownership and use of certain property on goat island in the city of newport,rhode island.
the focus of the matter now before us is framed by the fact that idc properties constructed and defendant idc clambakes operated the newport regatta club on the contested property after the associations had asserted that the rights of idc entities to own or develop the property had lapsed.eventually the rhode island supreme court found in favor of the associations.the associations thereafter sought to evict idc properties from the land,and idc clambakes declared bankruptcy.this case comes to us on appeal from a bankruptcy court decision and concerns the question whether idc clambakes trespassed on the associations property or whether,through their actions during the pendency of the litigation,the associations impliedly consented to operation of the regatta club by idc clambakes while title to the land remained unclear.
despite ongoing formal disputes in the state and federal courts,the parties apparently enjoyed a generally congenial relationship regarding the regatta club.the associations did not challenge building,liquor,or operating permits for idc properties during construction other than to question the sufficiency of planned parking space and zoning compliance.instead,various members of the associations regularly contracted with the regatta club for event space for annual meetings and private events.
the record is marbled with contradictory evidence regarding manifestations of consent for clambakes to operate on the property.ultimately,however,we find that the bankruptcy court decision as to implied consent is a plausible interpretation of a problematic record.that decision is fully reasoned and supported by the evidence.accordingly,we affirm as to that issue but nevertheless find it necessary to remand as to the issue of whether compensation is owed for clambakes authorized use and occupancy.
the material facts and history are essentially undisputed.for the sake of clarity,we summarize only those facts pertinent to this appeal.a more complete factual and procedural history underlying the protracted litigation may be found in decisions of the district court,the bankruptcy court,and the rhode island supreme court.see,in re idc clambakes,s,wl,at,in re idc clambakes,am.condo.ass,idc,america i.
in and,idc properties constructed the newport regatta club on a piece of property known throughout this litigation as the reserved area in spite of an ongoing dispute over ownership and development rights to the land.idc properties began this development with full knowledge of plaintiffs claims and after they voluntarily entered into a tolling agreement.in re idc clambakes.the associations,idc properties,and thomas roos the sole shareholder of each of the idc entities entered into this tolling agreement on january,having engaged in years of discussions and negotiations regarding the validity of amendments to the condominium master declaration purporting to grant idc properties the right to develop the land when it did.after several extensions,the tolling agreement was set to expire on may.
during the process of construction and permitting for the regatta club,the associations formally objected only to the parking requirements.when idc properties filed for a building construction permit,the america condominium association raised a concern by writing to the zoning officer that,it our understanding that a permit application has been filed with your office for the purpose of constructing a bldg while we do have a particular objection as to the land use with respect to the building itself,we do have a substantial problem with the parking requirements for that the associations were aware that clambakes applied for a liquor license transfer and sought to delay the transfer,but only so the zoning board of appeals could resolve the parking issue dispute.ultimately,the city council approved the liquor license transfer from dorell,to idc clambakes,the entity created in to lease and operate the regatta club,and the debtor appellee in this action.nevertheless,roos has stipulated that idc properties built the regatta club at a time when he understood that the associations were trying to say that properties had no right to construct the regatta club.
idc clambakes was not a party to the tolling agreement,and because the lease between idc properties and idc clambakes was never recorded and clambakes did business under the name newport regatta club,the record remains vague regarding the extent to which the associations understood or were aware of the precise role clambakes had in the development and operation of the regatta club.
on may,about six months after the use and occupancy certificate was approved,clambakes began operating the regatta club and three days before the tolling agreement expired,the associations filed a state court action against roos,idc properties,and idc,seeking damages and a declaration that the voting scheme that purported to extend development rights to idc at the time it built the regatta club was invalid.this action did not involve any claims of trespass,or appear to involve any issues related to trespass or damages flowing therefrom.goat island condo.ass,idc clambakes,see also america i,at.over the next six years,the parties litigated ownership of the reserved area in the rhode island state courts until april,when the rhode island supreme court declared that title to the reserved area rested with the unit owners in common ownership and not with idc.am.condo.ass,idc,america ii.
meanwhile,during this protracted and contentious litigation over ownership of the property,the harbor houses condominium association,a plaintiff below but not an appellant in this appeal,contracted with clambakes to use the regatta club for its annual meetings and various condominium unit owners regularly contracted with clambakes to host private events at the regatta club.none of the associations made any effort to enjoin clambakes or to evict it from the property.it was not until after the rhode island supreme court decision in america ii that the associations filed for writs of execution and ejectment.
following the rhode island supreme court decision in america ii,clambakes tried a variety of initiatives to avoid the seemingly inevitable consequences of the court ruling.one week after the decision in america ii,clambakes filed a civil action in rhode island superior court,arguing among other things that it owned the contested property by adverse possession.two months later,on june,clambakes filed the current chapter case to trigger the automatic stay,see,and stave off enforcement of the state court judgment while relitigating some of the issues that the state courts had already addressed.these strategies proved unsuccessful.eventually,a bankruptcy plan was confirmed for clambakes.
the district court vacated the bankruptcy court initial decision,see goat island condo.ass,at,and remanded the case for a more thorough development of the facts and compliance with due process on remand,the bankruptcy court held a trial and,relevant to this appeal,held that clambakes was not liable for trespass between march,and april,because the associations impliedly consented to clambake operation of the regatta club.the bankruptcy court denied any award of damages for this period.
both parties appealed to the district court.the district court affirmed,see in re idc clambakes,wl,and this appeal followed.
we review the bankruptcy court decision without deference to the district court ruling.the court of appeals undertakes an independent review of a bankruptcy court order,utilizing the same appellate standards governing the district court review.in re laroche,cir.thus,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.jeffrey desmond,cir in re,cir.
a factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.in re the bible speaks,cir.if the bankruptcy court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we may not reverse.id.at.however,we may affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court on any ground supported by the record.in re carp,cir.
mixed questions of law and fact invok e a sliding standard of review braunstein mccabe,cir.the more fact intensive the question,the more deferential the level of review though never more deferential than the clear error standard the more law intensive the question,the less deferential the level of review.see sierra fria donald evans,cir.
rhode island law,which governs this trespass action,defines a trespasser as o ne who intentionally and without consent or privilege enters another property.bennett napolitano.there is no question that the associations have made out two of the basic elements for a trespass claim clambakes intentionally and voluntarily entered the land and the land was in the associations rightful possession.clambakes does not dispute this.the relevant question on appeal is whether the bankruptcy court appropriately found implied consent.
we address two preliminary issues before turning to the substance of the bankruptcy court decision.in doing so,we confront two arguments mounted by the associations which,while technically accurate as statements of legal principle,have no bearing on this case.
mistake as to ownership 
the associations first argument that a mistake as to ownership is not a defense to trespass misses the point.mistake as to ownership played no role in the bankruptcy court determination,and therefore was not the source of any error.further,any mistaken belief by clambakes that idc properties owned the land does not have the preclusive effect appellants suggest.the fact that clambakes entered into a lease with idc properties,which was under the mistaken belief that it owned the disputed property,does not preclude a finding that clambakes may have thought it had the associations implied consent to operate.the two forms of permission are not mutually exclusive,particularly in a situation where all parties involved understood that title was in dispute.neither of the associations cited cases,campbell lederer realty,rhode island economic development v.the parking,can support the proposition that an entity entering into a lease for contested property with the apparent landowner is thereby prohibited from also seeking or receiving permission from another party claiming ownership.
reasonable reliance 
the associations next argument that there can be no apparent consent without a finding of reasonable reliance finds no application in this appeal.appellants appear to contend that the bankruptcy court made no finding of reasonable reliance,despite the court specific statement that the associations conduct demonstrates a continuing unequivocal expression of consent,upon which clambakes reasonably relied.in re idc clambakes,at emphasis added.the propriety of this finding presents a separate issue,discussed in more detail below,but the argument that this case warrants reversal for failure to find reasonable reliance can not withstand even the most cursory glance.
with those preliminary issues resolved,we move on to the substantive issues underlying the central question of implied consent.
consent,in any form,is fatal to a claim for trespass consent can be spoken or unspoken,express or implied,and there is no requirement that it be communicated to the actor.restatement second of torts.apparent consent arises from the parties conduct and from context.griggs ryan smith,cir.it is sufficient that a party reasonably understands words or conduct as conveying consent.restatement second of torts this is true e ven when the person concerned does not in fact agree to the conduct of the other as long as his words or acts or even his inaction justify the other in acting in reliance upon them.id.at cmt.however,there is no consent if a reasonable person would not understand from the words or conduct that consent is given even though he honestly so believes id.
we first address whether the bankruptcy court appropriately found that actions by the associations reasonably conveyed apparent consent.we then turn to the question whether the bankruptcy court properly found that clambakes did,in fact,reasonably rely on those actions.
manifestation of apparent consent 
the bankruptcy court determination that the associations actions manifested consent for clambakes operation of the regatta club falls within that court authority as fact finder.to be sure,the evidence is not one sided.there is evidence in the record sufficient to support either a finding of consent or a finding of no consent as well as evidence irreconcilably inconsistent with either alternative outcome.yet determinations of the character and weight of the evidence are best left to the finder of fact.united states young,cir t he trial judge,who hears the testimony,observes the witnesses demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand,sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.and w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,a factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.in re the bible speaks,at.
the associations rely on the parties long history of bitterly contentious disputes over ownership of the property,arguing that their own actions foreclose the possibility of any manifestation of consent when understood in the context of the specter of the parties various legal struggles.the associations entered into the tolling agreement with idc,idc properties,and roos before idc properties began building the regatta club,in order to preserve their claims that the voting scheme purporting to extend development rights for idc was invalid.thus,from the very outset and before the regatta club was built,let alone operating at full scale under clambakes management the associations manifested some opposition to development on the disputed property.the associations also opposed certain permits and licenses required for the construction of the regatta club,though never on grounds of trespass.they opposed the building permit,stating,w hile we do have a particular objection as to the land use with respect to the building itself,we do have a substantial problem with the parking requirements for that,as well as for other commercial parking on and around that site.the associations also delayed the liquor license transfer based on the parking concerns but did not raise any other objection and the city council ultimately approved the transfer.
having failed to prevent the construction of the regatta club,the associations notably declined to take action against the club operation until after resolution of the state court litigation.as the bankruptcy court noted,clambakes continued to operate the regatta club for more than seven years,with no written or verbal notice,signage,or any other type of claim made against clambakes to quit the premises.in re idc clambakes,at.the only evidence in the record of a effort opposing clambakes operations is a letter from daniel kinder,an individual unit owner,to the newport city council opposing clambakes application to expand its outdoor entertainment license.kinder states that idc applies for a license to which it had no right.idc does not own the property in question.however,this letter is dated may,after the rhode island superior court decision in favor of the associations,albeit before the rhode island supreme court final decision.the associations also lean heavily on a letter from the american condominium association to the mayor of the city of newport,dated june,more than a year after clambakes began operating the regatta club which seeks to enforce an unheeded november cease and desist letter against idc properties ordering it to halt construction of a gazebo or pavilion at the regatta club.this letter can not support the weight the associations seek to place on it.read in context,the letter does not seek to eject clambakes operation,but rather to ensure that idc does not,in any way,use or occupy the structure prior to the resolution of the zoning issues emphasis added.this,then,is not an effort to halt the regatta club operation permanently,but apparently only to enforce the zoning ordinances governing parking and liquor moreover,there does not appear to be any evidence in the record that clambakes or roos ever saw this letter,and it therefore does not bear on the associations manifestation of consent one way or the other.
the completion of the regatta club did not,of course,mark the end of hostilities between the parties.in may,just before the expiration of the tolling agreement,the associations filed a state court action that dragged out for more than six years regarding ownership of the land.in october,they recorded a notice of lis pendens.however,these disputes over ownership of the land are not necessarily equivalent to disputes over operations taking place on the land during the pendency of the ownership issue litigation.as the associations point out,roos has testified that the associations were challenging every single right that they could possibly think of.but,in that statement,he was commenting on the time frame in when idc properties was beginning construction,not the time frame which revealed the associations apparent disinclination to challenge the actual operation of the regatta club.in fact,in the swirling fog of the litigious war between the parties,this small but discernible area of calm and clarity is especially striking.as the bankruptcy court supportably found,it is clear that the associations and the roos entities have fought over and litigated every conceivable issue except clambakes occupancy and operation of the regatta club in re idc clambakes,at emphasis in original.
for these reasons,the associations actions and inactions do not necessarily foreclose the possibility that it reasonably manifested apparent consent for clambakes operations.and in support of its holding,the bankruptcy court relied on a number of other factors affirmatively indicating consent.
first,the bankruptcy court put particular emphasis on the fact that the associations specifically omitted clambakes from the tolling agreement,all subsequent extensions,and the america litigation.id.at from the outset,clambakes was never included as a party to the tolling agreement during the construction and even after it commenced operations,clambakes still was not added as a party to the tolling agreement clambakes was not a party in the america litigation.on appeal,the associations contend that the bankruptcy court committed clear error because t here is no evidence in the record that supports the conclusion that the associations knew that clambakes as opposed to idc properties or idc,was operating the regatta club 
the evidence in the record on this issue is a jumble of contradictions on the one hand,idc properties held itself out as the operator of the regatta club in its answers to interrogatories letters from the regatta club to the associations frequently came from idc,the lease between idc properties and clambakes was not recorded all of the event contracts for the regatta club were in the name of idc,and clambakes has described itself as a bookkeeping entity.on the other hand,a newspaper reported clambakes as the owner of the regatta club when the liquor license was granted letters from raymond morrissette,president of the american condominium association,and kinder both acknowledge clambakes applications for various licenses to operate the regatta club and the associations asked for a list of clambakes shareholders during the state court litigation.resolution of this evidence based on its character,weight,and credibility involves determinations of fact by the trial court to which we defer,absent clear error.see in re the bible speaks,at young,at.the bankruptcy court determination finds reasonable support in the record,and we therefore find no clear error in the bankruptcy court reliance on this determination.
second,during construction of the regatta club,the associations specifically stated we do have a particular objection as to the land use with respect to the building itself,we do have a substantial problem with the parking requirements for that see in re idc clambakes,at.the associations suggest this letter is taken out of context and merely asserts no disagreement as to the impact of the building zoning on the number of required parking spaces.a review of the fuller context of the letter belies the associations argument and indicates that the letter means precisely what it says.
third,the harbor houses condominium association contracted with clambakes to use the regatta club for its annual meetings and various condominium unit owners regularly contracted with clambakes to host private events.see id.it is true that the individual unit owners do not have the power to bind the associations,laws a granting the unit owners association the right to enter into leases,licenses and concessions over the common elements,and that the associations currently maintain that they did not,in fact,consent to clambakes operation of the regatta club.however,the actions of individual owners and one of the associations themselves,freely contracting at market rates for meeting and event space without objection,are the kinds of actions that manifest consent and justify reasonable reliance e ven when the associations do not in fact agree to the conduct of the other.restatement second of torts at cmt.c.the associations should have understood that their repeated,public patronage of the regatta club and that of their members reasonably contributed to a manifestation of apparent consent.
fourth,the bankruptcy court considered that,until the america ii decision in,the negotiations and litigation concerned ownership of the land only,not the operation of the business,and never included a claim for trespass,ejectment,or eviction.the bankruptcy court stated that this apparently consensual relationship between clambakes and the associations continued for more than seven years,with no written or verbal notice,signage,or any other type of claim made against clambakes to quit the premises.in re idc clambakes,at.the associations argue that this fourth factor a is inconsistent with the statute of limitations and b would impermissibly require them to move for a preliminary injunction rather than allow them to rest on their claims for legal and equitable remedies at final judgment.both arguments misunderstand the bankruptcy court ruling.
a party may bring a claim for trespass until the last day passes for determining when the statute of limitations runs.but if the party consents to the use of the property,no trespass exists to which the statute of limitations would apply.the bankruptcy court did not hold that the associations waited too long to bring their valid claim.it held that they had no claim in the first instance due to their apparent consent.id.at.
furthermore,the bankruptcy court did not suggest that the associations must move for a preliminary injunction preventing clambakes encroachment on the property or else risk manifesting consent.a party can choose the relief it seeks,but it must actually seek the relief it wants.the bankruptcy court grounded its finding that the associations manifested consent on the fact that they specifically did not seek to hold any idc entity liable for trespass or to eject or evict them,but rather focused their claims exclusively on land ownership.the associations now say they wanted all of the idc entities to cease operations on the disputed property,but they did not meaningfully pursue such relief until after the decision in america ii.to be sure,the associations did identify this kind of relief in the prayers of their state court complaint,where they demanded judgment for a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring restoration of the property to their condition as of december,before construction of the regatt
