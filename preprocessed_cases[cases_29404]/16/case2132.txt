this appeal asks this court to again review the supreme court decision in prima paint flood conklin,d,and to construe the breadth of the supreme court holding therein.specifically,this appeal requires the court to examine two areas of law,the severability of arbitration provisions under prima paint and the application of the parol evidence rule under ohio law,as applied to the former.although the primary issue presented by the parties concerns the application of the parol evidence rule under ohio law,the severability issue must first be addressed.

background 
the appellee,samuel glazer glazer or appellee,brought this action against appellants lehman brothers,and affiliated investment companies the lehman brothers companies and appellants sg cowen securities and societe generale the sg cowen companies collectively,the appellants based on the alleged theft of frank gruttadauria gruttadauria,a former employee and broker with the appellants.glazer had several investment accounts with the appellants through gruttadauria gruttadauria engaged in a complex system of fraud and theft as an investment broker during his approximately fifteen years working for the appellants and has previously pled guilty to criminal charges relating to this wrongdoing.
in,glazer established investment accounts with the appellants through gruttadauria.in doing so,glazer signed four contracts with sg cowen an account agreement,a margin agreement,an option contract,and an account agreement in connection with a prior,option agreement collectively,the account agreements.prior to the creation of those accounts with gruttadauria,glazer signed an option agreement with sg cowen through broker david tissue in the tissue account or the option agreement.each of these five agreements contain broad arbitration provisions that are now at issue.
glazer filed this action in,seeking damages from the appellants for gruttadauria misconduct and theft.specifically,glazer brings claims under the securities and exchange act,b,other federal securities laws and ohio state law.the appellants claim that glazer claims should be submitted to arbitration pursuant to arbitration clauses contained in the five agreements.
this is the second time glazer claims have been presented to this court.previously,his claims were heard with six similar actions in a consolidated appeal,fazio lehman brothers,cir,after the district court denied the appellants motions to stay pending arbitration in those cases.the facts underlying this and other stockbroker fraud cases involving the appellants and gruttadauria were set forth in fazio.id.at.
in the prior appeal,a panel of this court reversed the district court refusal to enforce the various arbitration agreements contained in the investment contracts with the appellants.id.at.the only question presented in that interlocutory appeal was whether similarly worded arbitration clauses in the various plaintiffs brokerage account agreements mandated arbitration of their claims.id.at.because the panel could not reach the issues regarding whether the arbitration clauses were enforceable,it remanded each action for a determination of whether the arbitration clauses,analyzed independently from the account agreements,are valid.id.at.thus,this court specifically remanded with instructions to consider the particular claims of the plaintiffs regarding the validity of the arbitration clauses standing apart from the account agreements as a whole.id.at.
turning to the instant action,upon remand and following a period of discovery,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on september,pursuant to.subsequent to the hearing,on october,the district court issued an order and memorandum opinion that again denied the appellants motions to stay pending arbitration.specifically,the district court held that the parol evidence rule did not bar consideration of gruttadauria alleged oral promise to glazer that sg cowen would not enforce the arbitration provisions glazer proved the elements of fraud in the inducement by clear and convincing evidence and the account agreement was superseded by gruttaduaria subsequent fraud and,therefore,the arbitration provision therein was not binding upon glazer.at 
in reaching its decision,the district court held that the arbitration provisions must be treated as contracts separate and distinct from the broader account agreements.at yet,in reaching this conclusion,the district court merely adopted glazer position without explaining how or why it reached this conclusion nor did the district court cite any authority for this legal proposition.notably,the district court framed the issue as 
if an issue arises as to whether the parties intended to be bound by an alleged written contract,parol evidence is admissible to show that despite the writing,the parties did not enter any agreement h owever,if the parties generally intended to be bound by a written agreement,parol evidence is inadmissible to directly contradict one of its terms.the parties essentially dispute which situation is present in the current case.
at we find that the district court properly identified the main issue,but,as discussed infra,engaged in an improper application of the appropriate rules.
relying on prima paint flood conklin,d,the district court held that the severability doctrine dictates that the arbitration provisions must be treated as contracts separate and distinct from the broader account agreements.at thus,the district court held that parol evidence was admissible to prove that the parties lacked intent to be bound by the separate arbitration clause notwithstanding the signed account agreements.at based on these legal conclusions,the district court then found that glazer proved each element of fraudulent inducement by clear and convincing evidence.at in addition,the district court also held that the option agreement did not require arbitration because it was superseded by gruttadauria conduct and by the closing of the tissue account.at 
appellants sg cowen filed a timely notice of appeal on october,and appellants lehman brothers timely filed their notice of appeal on october.

overview of the federal arbitration act.
the federal arbitration act faa provides that arbitration clauses in commercial contracts shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.if a plaintiff cause of action is covered by an arbitration clause,the court must stay the proceedings until the arbitration process is complete.in order to compel arbitration,a court must conduct a hearing,and 
upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement if the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure,neglect,or refusal to perform the same be in issue,the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.
under this statutory scheme,the district court must make a number of threshold determinations before compelling arbitration 
w hen considering a motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration under the act,a court has four tasks first,it must determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate second,it must determine the scope of that agreement third,if federal statutory claims are asserted,it must consider whether congress intended those claims to be nonarbitrable and fourth,if the court concludes that some,but not all,of the claims in the action are subject to arbitration,it must determine whether to stay the remainder of the proceedings pending arbitration.

in this case,the crux of the district court decision was its legal conclusion that the arbitration provisions of the account agreements must be viewed as distinct contracts subject to invalidity independent of the broader account agreements.at based on that finding,the district court then decided that parol evidence,therefore,was admissible to show fraudulent inducement to be bound by the arbitration provisions.at then,relying on glazer oral testimony,the court found,by clear and convincing evidence,that glazer proved his fraudulent inducement claim and the arbitration provisions could not be enforced.this appeal followed 
accordingly,the first issue presented is whether an arbitration clause itself constitutes an independent contract isolated from the agreement in which it is contained or whether such clause should be considered a separate contract.no panel of this court has yet addressed this narrow question directly and,thus,the issue is one of first impression.
b.the district court erred by concluding that the arbitration clauses contained in the account agreements are separate and independent contracts.
section of the faa,provides that an arbitration clause shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.id.emphasis added.the question presented in this appeal is whether this mandate,that an arbitration provision can be invalidated on the same grounds as the revocation of a contract,means that the arbitration provision is actually a separate contract or is merely to be examined separate from the overall contract at issue for the limited purpose of determining arbitrability.
the leading supreme court decision on this issue is prima paint flood conklin,d.therein,the supreme court held that a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is a matter to be resolved by the arbitrators,not the federal courts.id.at.however,if there is an alleged fraud that goes to the making of the agreement to arbitrate,as in the instant case,a federal court may adjudicate that issue.id.at.in reaching that decision,the supreme court relied on the explicit statutory language of section of the federal arbitration act 
under section,with respect to a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal courts save for the existence of an arbitration clause,the federal court is instructed to order arbitration to proceed once it is satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply with the arbitration agreement is not in issue.accordingly,if the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause issue which goes to the making of the agreement to federal court may proceed to adjudicate it we hold,therefore,that in passing upon a section application for a stay while the parties arbitrate,a federal court may consider only issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate.

in other words,a district court is instructed to order arbitration to proceed once it is satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply with the arbitration agreement is not in issue.id.at.thus,even if there was fraudulent inducement to sign the contract as a whole,by the terms of sections and of the faa,the arbitration clause is severable and will only be voided for some error in its making.fazio lehman,at.see also ferro garrison,cir.
this circuit has interpreted prima paint to mean that arbitration clauses are separable from the contracts in which they are included when examining whether those provisions were fraudulently induced.see,burden check into cash,at.yet,contrary to the district court conclusion and glazer arguments,the supreme court in prima paint did not hold that arbitration provisions in contracts are severable to such an extent that they should be considered separate and distinct contracts.rather,the supreme court held merely that arbitration clauses should be reviewed to determine whether the dispute should be referred to arbitration primarily because section of the faa explicitly directs the courts to order arbitration once the arbitration clause is no longer at issue.id.at.in other words,arbitration provisions are severable because the faa does not permit the courts to examine the enforceability of contracts containing arbitration provisions.id.at.thus,nothing in prima paint actually states or provides that arbitration provisions are to be considered separate,distinct and independent contracts,as the district court concluded.
for the reasons discussed herein,arbitration provisions,although severable insofar as they are considered in determining whether a contractual dispute should be submitted to arbitration,are not separate,independent and distinct contracts.although prima paint clearly requires courts to separately examine arbitration clauses,those clauses should not be considered as separate contracts outside of the underlying agreement.
to begin,various courts have routinely discussed why arbitration provisions are not subject to scrutiny as independent contracts in other contexts.for example,in wilson electrical contractors,minnotte contracting,cir,the only decision from this circuit touching on the issue,the plaintiff argued that prima paint should be interpreted as implying that an arbitration clause is an independent contract that is separable from the main contract in which it is found and therefore must have all essential elements of a contract,including consideration.id.at.yet,the panel rejected this position and stated that s uch an interpretation of prima paint would,however,clearly be inappropriate given the supreme court recent decision in several arbitration cases.id.in fact,the court noted in footnote of its decision that the supreme court characterization of arbitration clauses as independent,separable contracts in prima paint,which was decided in,may be regarded less than persuasive in light of the holdings of the court in its more recent faa cases.id.at.the wilson electrical court then pointed out that recent decisions of the supreme court following prima paint have consistently emphasized that the faa is grounded on a strong federal policy favoring arbitration.id.at.based on this analysis,the court then rejected the claim that an arbitration clause requires separate consideration to be enforceable,thereby implying that such provisions are not independent contracts either.id.
similarly,other circuits have held that mutuality is not a requirement of a valid arbitration clause.see,harris green tree financial,cir.in doctor associates,distajo,cir,the court examined prima paint and its reliance on a prior second circuit case and held that one might argue,prima paint indicates that an arbitration clause must be treated as a contract supported by independent consideration.for the following reasons,however,we reject this characterization.id.at.in reaching its decision in distajo,the court clarified that prima paint merely 
indicated only that arbitration clauses are separable from void or voidable provisions of a that they are independent contracts.although we consider an arbitration clause separately for the limited purpose of evaluating a claim of fraudulent inducement,we do not do so for all purposes.
id.emphasis added.thus,the court ultimately decided that mutuality of obligation was not required to enforce an arbitration agreement if the underlying contract is supported by consideration.id.at.
similar decisions implying that arbitration provisions are not separate,independent contracts were reached in barker golf,cir concluding that,under oklahoma law,mutuality of obligation is not required for arbitration clauses so long as the contract as a whole is supported by consideration dorsey sales,d,holding that an arbitration clause is not unenforceable for lack of identical obligations randolph green tree fin,rejecting claim that arbitration clause that required one party to arbitrate all claims,while giving the second party the option not to arbitrate anything,was invalid pate melvin williams manufactured homes,rejecting argument that arbitration agreement lacked mutuality because defendant company could sue over certain issues,while consumer had to arbitrate all claims,great earth,simons,wl march,opinion withdrawn in part on reconsideration,wl may,withdrawing part of opinion wherein the district court initially found that it would have found no meeting of the minds existed as to the arbitration clause or arbitration forum clause.accordingly,other courts addressing related issues have rejected similar legal arguments made by glazer and adopted by the district court in this case,and these decisions thus give additional persuasive authority against the position that arbitration clauses should be construed as separate,independent contracts.
if arbitration clauses can not be considered independent contracts when examining contractual formation issues,like mutuality or consideration,how much more so should such provisions not be considered separate contracts when examining other enforceability issues,such as when examining whether an arbitration clause was fraudulently induced.in other words,based on the foregoing,it is clear to us that arbitration clauses should not be considered separate contracts at all.rather,in accordance with prima paint,arbitration agreements contained in larger contracts should be considered separate from the contract only insofar as a federal court as opposed to the arbitrator can examine whether the arbitration clause was fraudulently induced or is otherwise unenforceable.
c.the district court erred in deciding that the parol evidence rule did not bar glazer testimony.
during the evidentiary hearing before the district court,glazer testified that gruttadauria promised or represented to him that the arbitration provisions contained in the account agreements would not be enforced against him,as the account agreements were mere formalities to the creation of the accounts with the appellants.based on this extrinsic evidence,glazer now asserts that the arbitration provisions in the account agreements are not enforceable because they were fraudulently induced.
conversely,the appellants argue that allegations of fraudulent inducement of a specific provision in an agreement,such as those made by glazer herein,can not be used to contradict the terms and provisions of a signed,written contract.they further argue that the parol evidence rule bars glazer evidence of fraudulent inducement as a matter of law.specifically,they contend that testimony and extrinsic evidence regarding gruttadauria alleged oral assurances that sg cowen would not enforce the arbitration clauses,which directly contradicts the written terms of the executed account agreements,are not admissible to prove any agreement that contradicts the written terms of the account agreements.
w hen two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a writing to which they have both assented as the complete and accurate integration of that contract,evidence,whether parol or otherwise,of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing.
corbin,contracts at.the parol evidence rule,as construed by ohio courts,states absent fraud,mistake or other invalidating cause,the parties final written integration of their agreement may not be varied,contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements,or prior written agreements.galmish cicchini,ohio,citing williston on contracts,ed.thus,absent fraud,mistake or some other invalidating cause,prior or contemporaneous oral agreements may not be used to alter,contradict,contest,or vary an integrated written agreement.galmish,at.contrary to its name,this rule is one of substantive contractual,not evidentiary,law.id.
in galmish,the most recent ohio opinion discussing the parol evidence rule at length,the ohio supreme court considered whether the plaintiff claims were barred by that rule.specifically,the issue in galmish was whether parol evidence was admissible to prove a breach of contract claim when the written contract at issue imposed no affirmative duties to engage in certain performance.the court ultimately found that the parol evidence rule did not bar evidence of the breach of contract claim because the extrinsic evidence went to the making of the contract,not to a provision of that contract.explaining the nature,history and application of this rule,the court stated 
the parol evidence rule,as is now universally recognized,is not a rule of evidence but is one of substantive law.it does not exclude evidence for any of the reasons ordinarily requiring exclusion,based on the probative value of such evidence or the policy of its admission.the rule as applied to contracts is simply that as a matter of substantive law,a certain act,the act of embodying the complete terms of an agreement in a writing the integration,becomes the contract of the parties.the point then is,not how the agreement is to be proved,because as a matter of law the writing is the agreement.extrinsic evidence is excluded because it can not serve to prove what the agreement was,this being determined as a matter of law to be the writing itself.the rule comes into operation when there is a single and final memorial of the understanding of the parties.when that takes place,prior and contemporaneous negotiations,oral or written,are excluded or,as it is sometimes said,the written memorial supersedes these prior or contemporaneous negotiations.
id.at citation omitted accord watkins son pet supplies iams,cir citing galmish and stating the parol evidence rule does not operate to prohibit proof of terms of the agreement instead,it provides that parol terms are not terms of the agreement at all.the principle policy behind the rule is to protect the integrity and purpose of written agreements.galmish,at citation omitted.
however,under ohio law,the parol evidence rule does not prohibit a party from introducing parol or extrinsic evidence for the purpose of proving fraudulent inducement.id.but coal resources,gulf western,cir indicating that defendant alleged promise was one of future performance rather than a representation of past or present material fact,and because the purpose of an integration clause is to preclude reliance upon promises of future performance that have not been included in the contract,that case did not involve a claim of fraud in the inducement.yet,
t he principle which prohibits the application of the rule in cases of fraud inducing the execution of a written contract has been regarded as being as important and as resting on as sound a policy as the rule itself.it has been said that if the courts were to hold,in an action on a written contract,that parol evidence should not be received as to false representations of fact made by the plaintiff,which induced the defendant to execute the contract,they would in effect hold that the maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction is no longer the rule and such a principle would in a short time break down every barrier which the law has erected against fraudulent dealing.
fraud can not be merged hence the doctrine,which is merely only another form of expression of the rule,that prior negotiations and conversations leading up to the formation of a written contract are merged therein,is not applicable to preclude the admission of parol or extrinsic evidence to prove that a written contract was induced by fraud.
id.at citation omitted emphasis added.in other words 
it was never intended that the parol evidence rule could be used as a shield to prevent the proof of fraud,or that a person could arrange to have an agreement which was obtained by him through fraud exercised upon the other contracting party reduced to writing and formally executed,and thereby deprive the courts of the power to prevent him from reaping the benefits of his deception or chicanery.
id.citation omitted.see also dodge fultz,app it is nevertheless clear that the parol evidence rule does not preclude a party from s h owing that a writing which apparently constitutes a contract,was not intended or understood by either party to be binding upon them.
yet,notwithstanding the foregoing principles,this rule may not be by 
a fraudulent inducement claim which alleges that the inducement to sign the writing was a promise,the terms of which are directly contradicted by the signed writing.accordingly,an oral agreement can not be enforced in preference to a signed writing which pertains to exactly the same subject matter,yet has different terms.
galmish,at citation omitted emphasis added.stated differently,under ohio law,
t he parol evidence rule will not exclude evidence of fraud which induced the written contract.but,a fraudulent inducement case is not made out simply by alleging that a statement or agreement made prior to the contract is different from that which now appears in the written contract.quite to the contrary,attempts to prove such contradictory assertions is exactly what the parol evidence rule was designed to prohibit.
id.citation omitted.accordingly,the parol evidence rule does apply to such promissory fraud if the evidence in question is offered to show a promise which contradicts an integrated written agreement.unless the false promise is either independent of or consistent with the written instrument,evidence thereof is inadmissible.id.at citation omitted emphasis added.see watkins son pet supplies iams,cir citing galmish,at stating fraud in the inducement,in the sense intended in coal resources and galmish,is a fraudulent misstatement of fact as opposed to promissory fraud that induces a party to enter a contract,not a fraudulent promise of future performance that is within the scope of the subject matter of the written contract but that was not included in it.
as in watkins,glazer claim is not one alleging a fraudulent misstatement of fact,but one alleging a fraudulent promise of future performance that is within the scope of the subject matter of the written contract but that was not included in it.watkins,at.the fraudulent promise that glazer is alleging is not only within the scope of the subject matter of the written contract and not included therein,but directly contradictory to the terms of the signed written agreements 
in watkins,this court examined a promissory fraud claim in which the plaintiff alleged that it was fraudulently induced into signing an agreement based on a promise of future performance by the defendant which was not included in the contract and which the defendant failed to fulfill.id.relying on galmish,the court held that parol evidence was not admissible to show a promise which contradicts an integrated written agreement.id.quoting galmish,at.the court held that the promise was neither independent of n or consistent with the written instrument,and as such parol evidence was inadmissible.id.quoting galmish,at.see also national city bank,akron donaldson,ohio app d.
similarly,in coal resources,this court held that parol evidence was admissible to show that the promisor had no intention of performing the promises that were included in the agreement,but was not admissible to show that the promisor had no intention of performing the promise that was not included in the agreement.id.at.finally,the parol evidence admitted in galmish,at,itself did not seek to contradict or vary the terms of the written agreement.id.instead,the fraud alleged was that the promisor,at the time of entering into the agreement,had no intention of performing a condition precedent to the promisee ability to benefit from the contract as written.id.
in reaching its decision in this case,the district court relied on dodge fultz,and national city bank,akron donaldson,ohio app d.however,these cases are distinguishable and were erroneously relied upon.in fultz,the court held that the parol evidence rule did not prohibit a party from proving that a written agreement as opposed to a provision in that agreement was not intended or understood by either party to be binding upon them.fultz,at.in fact,the court permitted the defendant fultz to introduce testimony as to certain oral conversations and oral promises that the plaintiff corporate representative and sales person had made that the company would not enforce the subscription agreement at issue.thus,unlike the instant action,which involves the enforceability of a pr
