in this appeal,we evaluate the legal sufficiency of a complaint,applying the standard articulated in bell atlantic twombly,d,and ashcroft iqbal,d,whether the complaint on its face states plausible claims upon which relief can be granted.
following highly public exchanges between baltimore city mayor martin and baltimore city police commissioner kevin clark about clark performance as commissioner,mayor terminated commissioner clark employment,as well as the employment of two of his top deputies,joel francis and anthony romano.mayor explained in a press conference that the eroding perception of commissioner clark leadership had made it impossible for clark to remain commissioner.implementing the termination,the mayor and baltimore city solicitor ralph tyler dispatched members of the baltimore police department to the commissioner offices to retrieve from the commissioner and his deputies their badges,police identifications,firearms,computers,and other official property,and to escort them from the building.
commissioner clark promptly filed suit against mayor and the city council of baltimore in state court,seeking reinstatement and damages,based on an alleged violation of e of the code of public local laws of baltimore city governing the removal of police commissioners and breach of contract.the maryland court of appeals ultimately concluded that,despite commissioner clark contract with the mayor and city council of baltimore,which authorized the mayor to discharge the commissioner without cause,clark had not been discharged in accordance with baltimore city public local law,which required cause.see mayor city council of baltimore clark.
in addition to his state suit,commissioner clark and his deputies commenced this action,alleging that the mayor,the city solicitor,and several members of the baltimore city police department violated their constitutional rights by seizing property from the commissioner and his deputies and by seizing them and removing them from police department offices.commissioner clark and his deputies alleged that the defendants conduct amounted to unreasonable searches and seizures and to a deprivation of due process because they were not given notice and an opportunity to be heard before being removed from their positions.finally,commissioner clark and francis,who are,alleged that their firings were racially motivated,in violation of.
by order dated july,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,ruling that the complaint did not state plausible claims for relief and that,with respect to commissioner clark allegations that mayor denied clark due process,the mayor was entitled to qualified immunity.
reviewing the district court ruling de novo,we conclude that based on the facts alleged in the in con text and as complaint fails to articulate any claim for relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal.at quoting twombly,at.we also conclude that mayor,against whom the allegations of violations were directed,is entitled to qualified immunity.accordingly,we affirm.
the facts in this case are stated in two pages of the complaint,but additional background facts and context are provided by further allegations sprinkled throughout the complaint,as well as by allegations of the same events made in the state court complaint.while we evaluate only the allegations of the complaint in this federal case when considering the district court ruling dismissing it,we nonetheless understand them in the context of the facts alleged in the state court complaint and restated by the maryland court of appeals in clark,which the plaintiffs concede is the proper context in which to consider plaintiffs allegations in this case.when questioned by the court during oral argument,plaintiffs counsel agreed that the events described in the complaint were the same events underlying the state court litigation.
as background,commissioner clark alleged in state court that he was induced to leave his and prestigious position as a commander in the new york city police department to become the baltimore city police commissioner.clark entered into a contract with baltimore city,entitled police commissioner memorandum of understanding,which provided that he would hold his appointment for a term expiring june.he was thereafter confirmed as police commissioner by the baltimore city council.the memorandum of understanding between commissioner clark and baltimore city provided 
either party may terminate this contract at any time,by giving days prior written notice to the other.notwithstanding the above sentence the provisions of section relating to additional pay remain in force.
after commissioner clark took office,he and mayor exchanged letters and accusations relating to a domestic relations problem involving commissioner clark and clark internal investigation into baltimore city police department activities,and the exchanges became public.mayor thereupon terminated commissioner clark employment,and city solicitor tyler provided clark with a letter of termination,dated november,which stated 
this notice is sent on behalf of the mayor and city council of baltimore the city pursuant to sections and of the memorandum of understanding mou between you and the city dated february.this notice shall serve as the city notice of termination of your employment.thus,your employment shall terminate days from today.however,as the mayor announced this morning,you have been relieved of all official duties as of,november,and therefore,your further access,if any,to police department facilities,equipment,or documents will be subject to the specific,prior authorization of acting or interim police commissioner hamm.
the complaint in this case focuses on the facts relating to how mayor effected commissioner clark discharge.it alleges that members of the baltimore city police department,with the assistance of over additional and heavily armed members of the baltimore city police department including all team members,broke into and entered,and directed other members of the baltimore city police department to break into and enter,the executive offices of clark,francis and romano on the premises of the baltimore city police department.they ransacked desks,credenzas and file cabinets.they seized and removed files,papers,documents,computers and other personal property in the lawful possession and custody of plaintiffs.the complaint also alleges that members of the baltimore city police department seized the plaintiffs themselves,ordering them to remove or surrender their weapons,badges,identification cards and other items of personal property lawfully in the possession of plaintiffs during the periods of detention.finally,the complaint alleges that these acts were committed either on the instructions of defendants and tyler,or with the knowledge and consent of defendants and tyler,or were thereafter approved and ratified by defendants and tyler.
resting on these factual allegations,the complaint purports to state four claims in four counts.count i alleges that the plaintiffs fourth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated insofar as the searches of the plaintiffs offices and the seizures of the plaintiffs and their personal property were not justified by any criminal charges or any warrant and were,therefore,unreasonable.in count ii,clark and francis,who are,claim conclusorily that they were removed from their offices and terminated from their positions because of their race,in violation of.romano,who is white,is not a party to this count.in count iii,the plaintiffs complain that they were denied due process insofar as their employment was terminated without prior notice and a prior hearing.only commissioner clark appeals the dismissal of this claim.finally,in count iv,the plaintiffs allege conclusorily that the defendants conspired to violate their civil rights based on the acts otherwise alleged,in violation of.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,and this appeal followed.
commissioner clark and his deputies contend on appeal that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that such a motion must be denied unless it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations in the complaint,quoting from swierkiewicz sorema,d they assert further that it was error to dismiss a complaint alleging civil rights violations unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff s would not be entitled to relief under any legal theory which might plausibly be suggested by the facts alleged,quoting from veney wyche,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants contend that b ecause the complaint in this case is short on facts and long on legal conclusions,the district court correctly granted appellees motion to dismiss under rule b,citing twombly,d.
a motion filed under rule b challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint,jordan alternative resources,cir,considered with the assumption that the facts alleged are true,eastern shore mkts,assocs,cir.and the legal sufficiency of a complaint is measured by whether it meets the standards for a pleading stated in rule providing general rules of pleading,rule providing rules for pleading special matters,rule specifying pleading form,rule requiring the signing of a pleading and stating its significance,and rule b requiring that a complaint state a claim upon which relief can be granted.this appeal reduces to the single question of whether the complaint in this case meets these standards.
even though the requirements for pleading a proper complaint are substantially aimed at assuring that the defendant be given adequate notice of the nature of a claim being made against him,they also provide criteria for defining issues for trial and for early disposition of inappropriate complaints.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.overlooking the broad range of criteria stated in the federal rules for a proper complaint,some have suggested that the federal rules,when adopted in,simply created a notice pleading scheme,pointing for support to rule a,which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and rule d,which provides that n o technical form for stating allegations is required.but the notice pleading characterization may itself be too simplistic,failing to recognize the many other provisions imposing requirements that permit courts to evaluate a complaint for sufficiency early in the process.rule itself requires a showing of entitlement to relief.rule requires that allegations of fraud,mistake,time,place,and special damages be specific.rule requires that the pleading be signed and provides that the signature certifies that the claims in the complaint are not asserted for collateral purposes that the claims asserted are warranted and that the factual contentions have evidentiary support.and rule b authorizes a court to dismiss any complaint that does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the aggregation of these specific requirements reveals the countervailing policy that plaintiffs may proceed into the litigation process only when their complaints are justified by both law and fact.
in recent years,with the recognized problems created by strike suits,see wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at and the high costs of frivolous litigation,the supreme court has brought to the forefront the federal rules requirements that permit courts to evaluate complaints early in the process.thus,in iqbal,the court stated that t o survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.at emphasis added quoting twombly,at.the plausibility standard requires a plaintiff to demonstrate more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.id.it requires the plaintiff to articulate facts,when accepted as true,that show that the plaintiff has stated a claim entitling him to relief,the plausibility of entitlement to relief.id.quoting twombly,at.
to emphasize the federal rules requirements for stating claims that are warranted and therefore form a plausible basis for relief,the supreme court has held that a complaint must contain more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.twombly,at.to discount such unadorned conclusory allegations,a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.iqbal.at.this approach recognizes that naked assertions of wrongdoing necessitate some factual enhancement within the complaint to cross the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.twombly,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
at bottom,determining whether a complaint states on its face a plausible claim for relief and therefore can survive a rule b motion will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.but where the facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,the complaint has it has not show n that the pleader is entitled to relief,as required by rule.iqbal.at alteration in original citation omitted quoting.a.the court noted that even though rule marks a notable and generous departure from the,codepleading regime of a prior era,it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.id.
with these principles in hand,we now turn to the complaint in this case to determine whether,on its face,it states a plausible claim for relief.
count i of the complaint,where the plaintiffs most fully articulate a claim,alleges that members of the baltimore city police department,under the direction of mayor and city solicitor tyler,broke into and entered the police commissioner offices,seized personal property,and detained,held in custody and seized the police commissioner and his deputies while ordering them to surrender their weapons,badges,identification cards and similar without the benefit of criminal charges or a warrant.the complaint concludes that this conduct violated the plaintiffs fourth and fourteenth amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.
considered in their context,these allegations describe the conduct of mayor taken in furtherance of his decision to terminate the plaintiffs employment,directing members of the baltimore city police department to seize police department property and escort the plaintiffs from the police building.the plaintiffs complaint filed in state court somewhat fleshes this out,asserting that members of the baltimore city police department ordered the plaintiffs to surrender their firearms and to clean out their desks of personal belongings and escorted them out of the building in relieving them of their commands.and after they were physically removed,the mayor announced to the public 
for the good of this department and for crime reduction,i have relieved commissioner clark of his command effective as of this morning leadership involves the important element of perception and when that perception of leadership is eroded it makes it impossible for that leader to continue on.
the mayor also announced that he had appointed leonard hamm as acting police commissioner.
taking the facts in the complaint as true,we agree with the district court that count i nonetheless fails to set forth a plausible claim for relief.while the commissioner and his deputies conclusorily alleged that the searches and seizures violated their constitutional rights because no charges had been filed against them,nor had any warrant issued,their complaint did not allege that the defendants were engaged in a effort.indeed,the facts show to the contrary,that the defendants actions against the plaintiffs were employment actions based on the mayor perceived right to fire the police commissioner without cause,as stated in the memorandum of understanding between commissioner clark and baltimore city.
in ortega,d,the supreme court held that special
