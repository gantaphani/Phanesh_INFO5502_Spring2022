standard of review 
we review a district court ruling on a motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo.evans ford motor,cir.on review of the district court denial of such a motion,the appellate court uses the same standard to review the verdict that the district court used in first passing on the motion.hiltgen sumrall,cir.in an action tried by jury,a motion for judgment as a matter of law is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.harrington harris,cir.the jury verdict must be upheld unless a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.we have held that motions for judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if 
the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict on the other hand,if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions,that is,evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions,the motions should be denied

a jury may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,and those inferences may constitute sufficient proof to support a verdict.on appeal we are bound to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the jury determination.even though we might have reached a different conclusion if we had been the trier of fact,we are not free to reweigh the evidence or to credibility of witnesses.we must not substitute for the jury reasonable factual inferences other inferences that we may regard as more reasonable.

plaintiffs failed to show damages with reasonable certainty.as the district court pointed out,the later transaction which proved profitable was markedly different from that entered into by mcbeth and reynolds.this second contract was based on different terms,included more acreage,more capital infusion,and less leverage than the original sales provisions.the jury heard no evidence t
