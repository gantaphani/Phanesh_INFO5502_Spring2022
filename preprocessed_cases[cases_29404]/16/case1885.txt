in this diversity case arising out of its attempt to obtain oil exploration and production rights in nigeria,perenco nigeria limited perenco appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to and collectively,ashland on breach of contract and fraud claims.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
perenco is the wholly owned subsidiary of a french energy company perenco which conducts oil exploration and production operations in west africa.in,perenco sought to extend its presence to nigeria and consequently entered into negotiations with ashland to purchase its nigerian oil interests.
the subject of the negotiations was the stock of two ashland subsidiaries,ashland oil nigeria company,aonc and ashland nigeria exploration unlimited aneu,which were signatories to production sharing contracts pscs granted by the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc.the pscs gave aonc and aneu the right to produce oil in nigeria as contractors for the nnpc in return for a share of the profits.the transaction between ashland and perenco was structured as a sale of stock in aonc and aneu rather than as a sale or assignment of the pscs themselves to avoid the requirement under the pscs that formal consent to any sale or assignment of the pscs be obtained from the nnpc prior to the sale.
during negotiations of the stock purchase agreement spa between perenco and ashland,perenco suggested including a provision that would condition the closing on the relevant nigerian authorities making no objection to the stock sale.ashland representatives objected to this provision,however,expressing three grounds the transaction,as a sale of stock rather than the underlying assets,did not require the approval of the nigerian authorities other than the pro forma approval of the nigerian securities and exchange commission,it would be unwise to include language in the spa that implied that the nigerian minister of petroleum,chief etete the minister,had approval power with which he was not legally vested,and the minister in fact had no objection to the sale in reliance on these representations,perenco contends,it withdrew its request to include the proposed condition in the spa.
unbeknownst to perenco,however,roger benedict,the managing director of ashland operations in nigeria,had already informed his superiors that he was very concerned that if the stock sale goes through,the minister will attempt to stop it.he likely has heard that we for sale from various sources and the message he was sending me yesterday was clear we going to need the government approval.he may be wrong from a legal standpoint but from a practical standpoint he correct.furthermore,after reporting that the minister had threatened to revoke ashland pscs,benedict advised his superiors that the best approach is to avoid giving the minister any indication of our position and what the outcome will be,and the next time i see him it is very likely he will be given a fait accompli.none of this information was shared with perenco.
even though the spa does not include perenco suggested condition,it does contain a clause providing for termination of the agreement,inter alia,at any time by the mutual written agreement of buyer and sellers.the spa also provides that if the agreement were terminated 
by sellers for any reason except pursuant to an express right to do so set forth herein,buyer shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available at law or in equity as a result of such wrongful termination provided in no event shall buyer ever be entitled to any consequential or speculative damages including,without limitation,lost profits 
furthermore,the spa states that each party to the agreement will pay all legal and other costs and expenses incurred by such party or any of its affiliates in connection with this agreement.finally,the spa contains a standard merger clause whereby ashland expressly disclaims all liability or responsibility for any other representation,warranty,statement or information made or communicated orally or in writing to buyer except of course to the extent expressly set forth in the spa 
the spa was executed by the parties in houston on june.in it,perenco contracted to purchase the stock of aonc and aneu for million subject to adjustments.pursuant to the spa,perenco tendered a deposit of million.perenco now asserts that,among the representations and warranties made by ashland in the spa,the following were known by ashland to be false when it executed the spa,in light of ashland knowledge of the minister position on any such sale 
the shares are free and clear of all encumbrances of any kind and are not subject to any agreements or understandings with respect to the voting or transfer thereof.
neither the execution and delivery of this agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will conflict with or result in a breach,default or violation of,any material agreement,document,instrument,judgment,decree,order,governmental permit,certificate or license to which sellers or any international company is a party or is a subject which would have a material adverse effect.
to the knowledge of the sellers no consents are required to be obtained by sellers or any international company for the transfer of the shares to buyer.
the spa specified a closing date of july.
soon after the execution of the spa,two perenco representatives,spink and denis bizeau,traveled to nigeria to inspect the ashland properties.article of the spa provides that 
a s soon as practical following the execution of this agreement,sellers and buyer will advise the appropriate governmental authorities in nigeria of the change in control of aonc and aneu.sellers,at buyer request,will arrange meetings with the nigerian authorities and will accompany and introduce buyer.
accordingly,roger benedict set up a meeting with the minister that was to take place on june.when benedict and the perenco representatives arrived,however,the minister did not meet with them,and the meeting was rescheduled for the next day.
around that evening,though,at the urging of their nigerian consultant,major general bajowa,the perenco representatives without benedict knowledge met with the minister at his home.at that meeting,when the perenco representatives announced that they had bought ashland crude reserves,the minister announced that ashland was doing what i have told them not to do and threatened to detain benedict.on june,the minister issued a statement that purported to terminate ashland pscs.
according to perenco,it did not become aware of the problems that ashland was having with the minister until june,when perenco for the first time came to understand that the minister had told ashland that his consent was necessary.perenco also received a copy of a letter to ashland from the office of the minister on or about july,detailing matters that perenco now characterizes as fraud,such as statements that the minister had twice invited ashland to his office,and twice ashland had undertaken some action that the minister characterized as dishonest.likewise,roland fox,the president of perenco,testified in his deposition that perenco had knowledge of ashland alleged deception of the minister during the period that followed,during which unsuccessful efforts were made by perenco,ashland,the united states department of state,the white house,and members of the united states congress to reverse the minister position on ashland pscs 
in light of these events,on july,representatives of ashland and perenco discussed the spa and agreed that it should be terminated.on july,ashland wrote a letter to roland fox stating that 
the minister of petroleum has informed ashland that the termination of the pscs,which constitute owned assets of the international companies is final and irrevocable.as a result,ashland will be unable to complete the transaction contemplated in the spa and the principals have agreed on the terms and conditions of such termination.
within three business days after receipt of an executed copy of this letter of termination,ashland will refund the deposit in immediately available funds.this termin
