this case involves a failed transaction,the defendants refusal to return a deposit given by the plaintiffs for an option to buy a valuable puerto rico property owned by the defendants,and the plaintiffs lawsuit for breach of contract.on summary judgment,the district court awarded the deposit to the defendants.the plaintiffs appealed.we reverse and remand for a trial because of the ambiguity of the agreement between the parties.
plaintiffs adria international group,and criswell associates,are developers who hoped to build a luxury hotel,condominium units,and golf course on a piece of land on puerto rico north coast known as the mar chiquita property.mar chiquita was owned by the defendants,ferré development,angola investment,and mar chiquita development.on june,the parties signed a deed of option to purchase the property.
the deed established a purchase price of million for mar chiquita.the plaintiffs agreed to pay this amount if they were successful in obtaining bond financing from the puerto rican government during the time periods specified in the deed.the deed provided for three separate option periods.the first period,described in article third b of the deed as the initial option period,gave the plaintiffs a right to purchase in exchange for a deposit to be held in escrow.this period could be extended for an additional days at no additional cost to the plaintiffs.
article third c of the deed provided for a second option period.it stated that for an additional,the plaintiffs shall have the right,at any time prior to the expiration of the initial option period,to extend the option for an additional term of ninety days to commence on the day after the termination of the initial option period hereinafter referred to as the second option period.in parallel terms,article third d of the deed provided for a third option period in exchange for an additional deposit.
after signing this agreement on june,the plaintiffs engaged smith barney to help them raise the equity they needed to qualify for government bond financing.they also met with representatives of puerto rico tourism department seeking a needed endorsement from the tourism development fund for issuance of the bonds.on september,the initial option period provided for in article third b of the deed expired.adria international and criswell associates extended their option to buy for more days until november at no additional cost,as article third b allowed,because the defendants had not resolved a lawsuit that was clouding mar chiquita title.the litigation soon ended,and plaintiffs received notice of the relevant judgment on september.
over the course of the fall,it became clear that adria international and criswell associates were million short of the equity they needed to secure the bond financing.the tourism development fund said it would not guarantee the shortfall without the backup guarantee of another funding source.without the help of smith barney,the plaintiffs contacted various parties,including professional golfer chi chí rodriguez,in hopes of finding such a guarantor.according to the plaintiffs,rodriguez committed to send them,half of which would replace the plaintiffs deposit for the initial option period and half of which would serve as consideration for the second option period.
the plaintiffs hoped to receive the money from rodriguez by november,the day on which the initial option period expired,but the money did not arrive in time.instead,maría luisa fuster zalduondo of the plaintiffs law firm,mcconnell valdés,wrote a letter on november to the defendants lawyer,josé fuentes agostini,confirming that the plaintiffs would deliver the deposit for the second option period the following day.the defendants orally agreed to meet on november to receive delivery of the second.because november was election day,the parties then agreed to meet on november.
the november meeting was held at the offices of mcconnell valdés.in attendance were ricardo,the general manager of defendant ferré development josé fuentes,the defendants lawyer william criswell,iv,representing plaintiffs adria international and criswell associates and harry cook and samuel céspedes,the plaintiffs lawyers.at the meeting,criswell told hernández that the money from rodriguez still had not arrived,but that he hoped to receive it within the next ten days.hernández expressed his disappointment.the parties then negotiated over the terms of a extension of the plaintiffs option.in lieu of the missing deposit from rodriguez,criswell offered the approximately million fee that his principals would have owed smith barney if they had succeeded in securing financing for the deal 
the parties new agreement was set forth in a letter drafted quickly by céspedes,one of the plaintiffs lawyers,so that criswell could catch a flight to europe.the letter was headed re deed of option to purchase mar chiquita properties.it said in full 
dear hernández 
in connection with the aforementioned deed the deed,we hereby request an extension of the initial option period,as such term is defined in article third a of the deed,through midnight of november.if you agree with this option period extension,please signify so by signing in the space provided below.your acceptance of this extension does not modify any future option periods contemplated in the deed.
in consideration for the aforesaid extension,purchaser shall pay to sellers by certified or bank manager check a sum equal to the fee that would otherwise have been paid to smith barney for the sale of limited partnership interests.
cordially yours,
s william criswell 
after reviewing the letter with fuentes in private for a few minutes,hernández signed it.the meeting quickly adjourned.
over the next two weeks,the plaintiffs continued to seek funding from rodriguez.that money did not materialize.on november,cook sent a letter to hernández terminating the plaintiffs option to buy because the government bonds had not been approved.the plaintiffs asked hernández to direct the escrow agent to return the they had deposited in june for the initial option period.on december,fuentes replied to cook in a letter that accused adria international and criswell associates of acting in bad faith,thus waiv ing any possible right under the deed to request a return of the initial deposit.
on february,the plaintiffs sued for return of the deposit.the defendants for the million fee.on july,the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment,arguing that the november letter extended the initial option period and was supported by adequate consideration.the plaintiffs contended that because the parties agreed in the letter to extend the initial option period until november,that period had not expired before the plaintiffs terminated their option,entitling them to reclaim their deposit.on july,the defendants moved for summary judgment on their,making two alternative arguments.first,the defendants argued that the november agreement to extend the initial option period was invalid because it was not supported by consideration.second,they argued that if the agreement was supported by consideration,the plaintiffs breached it by refusing to pay the million fee,which was not contingent on completion of the land purchase,contrary to the plaintiffs assertion.
on november,the district court found for the defendants on the claim.the court found that the november,letter was clear on its face,and that the letter demonstrated the parties intent to extend the initial option period until november.the court found,however,that this extension was not supported by consideration,and as a result the november letter was not a valid contract.thus the parties had failed to extend the initial option period,entitling the defendants to retain the deposit that the plaintiffs did not reclaim before that period expired.
the court also granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the defendant million for the fee that would otherwise have been paid to smith barney.the defendants argued that payment of the fee was not contingent on completion of the land transaction.the court found that payment of the fee was contingent.the defendants did not appeal this ruling.
we review an award of summary judgment de novo.wightman springfield terminal ry,cir.summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.for summary judgment do not alter the basic rule standard,but rather simply require us to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.see wightman,at.
the parties do not dispute that the deed of option to purchase was a valid agreement supported by consideration.their arguments instead concern the november agreement and its relationship to the deed.the plaintiffs argue that the november agreement was supported by consideration because it required them to relinquish control of the deposit for two more weeks,and to pay the million fee described in the agreement if the deal closed.in addition,the plaintiffs contend that a duty to act in good faith tempered their right to terminate the option to buy.the defendants argue that the letter was not supported by consideration and that the promises made by the plaintiffs were illusory.the district court agreed with the defendants.
we begin with some general principles about consideration drawn from the laws of puerto rico.puerto rican law provides that a bilateral obligation assumed by each one of the parties to the contract,has,as its consideration,the promise offered in exchange.united states perez,citing del toro blasini.both parties must be bound based on mutual consideration that yields either a benefit or a detriment to each party.id.in defining legally sufficient consideration,the puerto rican civil code states in contracts involving a valuable consideration,the presentation or promise of a thing or services by the other party is understood as a consideration for each contracting party.laws ann.in construing this provision,the puerto rico supreme court has said 
by consideration is understood,for the purpose of determining the existence of a contract,the benefit or benefits which one party receives from the other,or the latter obligates himself to confer upon the former,and to which he had previously no right or also,the damages which one party suffers because of the other,and which he was not obliged to suffer,the existence of the said benefits or damages being the reason which caused the other party to obligate himself.

here,because they did not have in hand the deposit required by the deed to purchase a second option period,the plaintiffs made an alternate offer the possibility of a million payment in exchange for a extension of their option.the plaintiffs promise in the november agreement to pay the million fee conferred two benefits on the defendants.first,they gained the possibility of winning a million fee.second,the defendants gained an increased likelihood that the land transaction would be completed,the plaintiffs having informed them that otherwise they would abandon their efforts to secure financing.these benefits constitute adequate consideration under puerto rican law.
there was also detriment to the plaintiffs in the november agreement.the plaintiffs did not have the use of the deposit for the initial option period for two more weeks.more significantly,they put themselves at risk of paying the million fee.any detriment to the opposite party is a valuable consideration.in re las colinas,vacated and remanded on other grounds,cir bennett boschetti.
the district court misunderstood the nature of the consideration that supported the november agreement.the court said that the plaintiffs promise to the defendants was illusory because payment of the million fee was conditioned on some future event which the plaintiffs controlled,in other words,completion of the land deal the court continued 
plaintiffs had the right to cancel at any time within the iop initial option period if they,at their sole discretion,considered that they were unable to obtain the required approval for the issuance of guaranteed bonds for the financing of the hotel and golf course.plaintiffs rights were subjective in nature.plaintiffs were not required to give any prior notice,nor was the termination reliant on an extrinsic event out of the plaintiffs control.
the court reasoning was erroneous even though it is true that,when the promised act is conditional on the occurrence of a future event within the control of the promisor,the promise is illusory.crellin technologies,equipmentlease,cir citing vickers antone vickers,see also laws ann.a contract is void if it includes a conditional obligation that depends on the exclusive will of one party the validity and fulfilment of contracts can not be left to the will of one of the contracting parties.in this case,the future event at issue was not wholly within the control of the plaintiffs.
in contrast to crellin,where the parties had not signed a binding contract,the plaintiffs obligation to seek financing for the land deal was subject to the duty of performance.good faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party.restatement second of contracts.puerto rican law imposes the duty of good faith performance on contracting parties.see,mbr industries,the requirement of good faith between the parties in a contract must guide all contacts between the contracting parties during the existence of the relationship.ameco jaress,contracting parties have obligations by law that extend to cover not only what has been expressly stipulated,but also the consequences which,according to their nature,are in accordance with good faith see also laws ann.
to fulfill their duty of performance,the plaintiffs had to seek financing for the land deal by negotiating with third parties.thus their efforts to perform can be measured against the objective standard of whether they sought the support that was central to the transaction.see laws ann.if the obligation should depend upon the will of a third person,the obligation shall produce all its effects hernández cadilla,fulfillment of condition that does not depend exclusively upon will of obligor,but also upon that of third person over whom he has no control,is fulfilled and the obligation is demandable if the obligor does all he was required to do resource management weston ranch and livestock,utah t he reservation by a promisor of a power to cancel upon the occurrence of some event not wholly controlled by the promisor himself does not render this promise illusory or the contract invalid.even if the promisor is himself to be the judge of the cause or condition,he must use good faith and an honest obligation.quoting corbin on contracts at.the plaintiffs negotiations with the puerto rican tourism department and chi chí rodriguez reflect the kind of performance required by the contract there was nothing illusory about the promise of the plaintiffs to pay a million fee if the land transaction closed.
as an alternative ground for affirming the district court judgment awarding them the deposit,the defendants argue that the november agreement was ambiguous and should be interpreted in their favor.the defendants note that puerto rican law provides that t he interpretation of obscure stipulations of a contract must not favor the party occasioning the obscurity,laws ann,and that the plaintiffs through their lawyers drafted the agreement.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,argue that the november letter was clear on its face in extending the initial option period.the district court agreed that the contract was clear on its face,but found that it was not supported by adequate consideration.
we look to puerto rican law for the standard for determining whether a contract is ambiguous.puerto rico civil code provides 
if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties,the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.
if the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties,the intention shall prevail.
