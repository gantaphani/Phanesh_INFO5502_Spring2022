opinion of the court 
in this insurance dispute,defendant appellant james sweeney appeals from the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff appellant liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual.liberty mutual from the portion of the district court order rejecting two alternative and independent bases for denying sweeney coverage under his insurance policy.for the following reasons,we will reverse the judgment of the district court,and remand with instructions for the district court to enter judgment in favor of sweeney.liberty mutual is dismissed.
at all relevant times,sweeney owned and operated a transmission repair shop in chalfont,pennsylvania.during the course of managing his repair shop,sweeney developed an informal business relationship with george tradewell,who owned a car rental business in nearby montgomeryville,pennsylvania.as part of this business relationship,sweeney would refer his customers to tradewell if they needed to rent a vehicle while their own vehicles were in sweeney shop for repair.in his deposition,tradewell estimated that he would rent vehicles to one or two of sweeney customers per month.
the manner in which the rental cars would be delivered to sweeney customers varied.on some occasions,sweeney would simply refer his customers to tradewell shop or drive them to tradewell business.if any of tradewell employees were available,tradewell would have them drop off a rental car at sweeney shop.as another option,sweeney would pick up a rental car from tradewell business and deliver it to the customer either that day or the following morning.on those instances where sweeney came into possession of a rental car for the purpose of delivering it to one of his customers,sweeney would occasionally use the car to run personal errands.this was encouraged by tradewell,who asked sweeney to use those occasions as opportunities to make sure the cars were running properly.
on february,at,sweeney was injured in a car accident while driving a ford taurus owned by tradewell business.tradewell had no firsthand knowledge of how and when sweeney came into possession of the car,and was out of the state on the day of the accident.at his deposition,sweeney also could not recall when he came into possession of the vehicle,but testified that he intended to deliver it to a customer the following morning.that evening,sweeney wife asked him to go to a local grocery store to pick up taco shells for their dinner.sweeney opted to use tradewell ford taurus to run this errand because it was the outermost car in his driveway.he was involved in the accident on his way back from the grocery store.following the accident,sweeney filed an application for underinsured motorist uim pursuant to his insurance policy with liberty mutual,which claim liberty mutual denied,relying upon three policy provisions

on may,liberty mutual filed an action for declaratory relief in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.liberty mutual sought a declaration providing that sweeney was not entitled to coverage on the basis of the three provisions cited above.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of sweeney on the basis that the second exclusion did not bar coverage,and denied liberty mutual for summary judgment.liberty mutual appealed,and on march,this court summarily remanded the case to the district court as a result of the district court failure to address all three policy exclusions relied upon by liberty mutual.liberty mut.ins.sweeney,app x cir.this court explained that the district court ruling was improper because liberty mutual need only prove that one of its asserted policy exclusions applies.id.
on remand,the district court granted liberty mutual motion for summary judgment and denied sweeney motion for summary judgment,finding that while the intended use and regular use provisions did not bar coverage,liberty mutual could nevertheless deny coverage on the basis of the auto business provision.sweeney timely appealed the order of the district court.liberty mutual filed a challenging the district court determinations concerning the intended use and regular use provisions.

on appeal,sweeney argues that the district court erred in holding that liberty mutual could deny coverage on the basis of the policy auto business exception.sweeney argues that this provision does not bar coverage because,at the time of the accident,he was running a personal errand and was not engaged in any type of auto business as defined by the policy.as an initial matter,sweeney notes that the district court considered the wrong policy language in interpreting the auto business exception.the language considered by the district court provided,in pertinent part,that liberty mutual will not pay for bodily injury caused by anyone using a motor vehicle in any kind of auto business.app however,prior to sweeney accident,certain provisions in his insurance policy had been amended,including the auto business provision.the amended provision provided that liberty mutual will not pay for bodily injury sustained while using a motor vehicle in any kind of auto business.examples of auto business are selling,repairing,servicing,storing or parking motor vehicles.app.emphasis added.
interpreting the original policy language,the district court held that the relevant issue is not one of timing as defendant contends,but whether the language in any kind of auto business pertains to defendant use of the vehicle.app the district court further emphasized that but for defendant desire to provide his customers with an alternative means of transportation while he serviced the customers transmissions,defendant would never have come into possession of the non owned vehicle.the specific reason for defendant use at the time of the accident is not enough to change the general purpose for which he possessed the vehicle.app liberty mutual concedes that the district court did not consider the correct language,but argues that the result would nevertheless be the same under the amended policy language we disagree.
in this case,it is undisputed that,at the time of the accident,sweeney was engaged in a personal errand,he was returning home from a trip to the grocery store,and that he used a vehicle which was to be delivered to a customer the following morning.the dispositive question before the court is whether his injuries were sustained while using a motor vehicle in any kind of auto business,notwithstanding the fact that at the time of the accident he was using tradewell vehicle for a personal endeavor.
