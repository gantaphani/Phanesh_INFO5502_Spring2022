appellee,taita chemical,taita,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellant,westlake styrene corporation westlake.westlake,protesting the district court grant of a partial summary judgment in favor of taita and the dismissal of its counterclaim.for the following reasons we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
in,four companies,including taita,entered into a joint venture to form westlake.the joint venture shareholders owned westlake in the following percentages btr nylex,btr the chao and the sumitomo corporation and sumitomo corporation of westlake produces and sells styrene monomer.
on january,taita and westlake entered into a contract known as the agreement.this agreement was a contract,under which taita agreed to purchase of westlake styrene monomer production capacity each month for the duration of the contract.price was to be determined on a monthly basis in accordance with the contract pricing clause.this clause provided that each month taita was to receive the lowest of three alternative prices 
the contract price per pound of product delivered or ordered for delivery,including deemed delivery,during each month shall be the gulf coast styrene monomer prices,net after all discounts,for contract transactions as last published in each month by dewitt company,incorporated in its benzene derivatives newsletter,or the price for such month charged by wsc westlake styrene to a consumer under a firm contract or the posted contract market price for comparable volumes of product,whichever is lower.should such publication cease to be published,buyer and seller shall mutually select other representative publications.
the meaning of this pricing clause and the parties conduct with respect to its terms lies at the center of this dispute.in essence,taita argues that westlake overcharged it for styrene because westlake did not extend taita a lower price provided by westlake to another customer as required under taita interpretation of the second pricing mechanism.this second provision states that taita shall receive the price for such month charged to a consumer under a firm contract.the parties have referred to this provision as the most favored nations clause,for the obvious reason that it ensures that taita,as westlake largest investor and principal styrene purchaser,will receive the best available price.westlake disputes taita interpretation of the pricing clause,but urges that,in any event,the evidence demonstrates that taita undeniably acquiesced in westlake differing reading of the contract.
a rather substantial factual dissertation is needed in order to lay the groundwork for the court otherwise brief discussion.many of these facts are not overtly disputed.other facts,however,as well as what inferences should be drawn from the undisputed facts,remain in issue.as this case comes before us following a grant of westlake motion for summary judgment,our presentation of the facts is thus intentionally colored,to a degree,by our obligation to view the evidence in the light most favorable to taita.
the harbinger of this dispute could be seen as early as june.at that time ken,then westlake president,queried taita regarding whether taita would permit westlake to enter into a contract to sell styrene to another customer at a lower price without taita asserting its most favored nations rights.taita president graeme bulmer bulmer responded that taita would immediately demand the lower price in accordance with the contract.thus,later that year,when westlake entered into a contract to sell styrene production,the contract included a meet or release clause,which excused performance if market prices for styrene fell below an agreed level.taita and westlake apparently agreed that such a clause prevented the contract from becoming a firm contract as is required to trigger taita most favored nations rights.therefore,despite this foreshadowing,the pricing issue did not ripen until the end of.
then in december,westlake outgoing president,recommended to the westlake board that it approve several contracts to sell styrene,including deals with novacor chemicals,novacor and cook composites polymers company cook composites the novacor agreement involved the sale of roughly of the monthly volume that taita was required to purchase from westlake,while the cook composites arrangement was for less than of taita purchase volume.thus,although novacor and cook composites were both to be purchasing smaller volumes of styrene than was taita,they nonetheless were to receive lower prices than taita was paying.
soon thereafter,taita,through,now its new president,pointed to the agreement most favored nations clause and demanded that westlake honor its right to receive the lower price provided to novacor steve bayless bayless,westlake new president,initially extended the novacor discount to taita.on march,however,bayless changed his stance,basing his reversal upon a legal opinion regarding the meaning of the most favored nations clause.westlake attorney opined that taita was entitled to a discount for a firm contract only if the sale was for a quantity comparable to taita volume.because novacor was only purchasing of taita amount,bayless informed taita that the discount had been granted in error.according to westlake,it only granted taita the novacor price in the first place,because outgoing westlake president informed bayless that taita was entitled to the lower price.after apprising taita of westlake error,bayless demanded that taita remit the amounts it had underpaid for styrene delivered in january and february.at first,taita did not comply.taita internal correspondence indicates that it was contemplating how to best advance its position with regard to the pricing 
while taita dithered and declined to show its hand,bayless,on may,further corresponded with taita,arguing that taita remained in breach of the agreement and,further,threatened to cut off taita styrene supply if taita did not remit the amounts past due.as of may,taita had not yet paid westlake,despite indicating that it would do so,albeit under protest.this prompted another facsimile letter from bayless to taita,and yet another on june,by which time taita had fallen further behind on its payments.at this juncture,taita finally acceded to bayless request,becoming current and paying invoices in full as they came due.taita payments did not,however,specifically indicate that they were being made under protest.taita nevertheless contends that its compliance with bayless request,and its continued payment of invoices as received,did not indicate any agreement on its part with the position urged by westlake.instead,taita alleges that it could not risk losing its source of styrene supply at that time,and,moreover,it felt that the pricing issue might have been about to become moot,at least prospectively,in light of a contemplated arrangement between the several westlake stockholders 
purportedly,taita had also chosen to bide its time on the pricing issue until a firm contract was signed and executed,and westlake in turn refused to supply taita at the lower price.by september,such a situation had clearly presented itself.westlake and cook composites had signed their contract mentioned above in the context of the december board meeting and pricing was made retroactive to the first of the year graeme bulmer,now taita chairman,thus resurrected taita protest.
bulmer wrote westlake bayless to confirm taita understanding that the cook composites contract provided a more favorable price than taita was receiving.bulmer inquiry,in a september,letter regarding westlake proposed budget,questioned whether westlake budget reflected taita right to receive the lower price seen in the now finalized,and thus firm,cook composites agreement.bayless responded that the cook composites price was not for a comparable volume,and that he believed that taita discount argument had already been considered and rejected earlier in.in this regard,bayless pointed to taita alleged acquiescence in westlake position with respect to the previously sought after novacor discount.
several days later,on september,bulmer responded to bayless by contending that taita had only paid the disputed novacor amounts because the novacor contract was not firm,as it had not been formally signed and approved by the westlake board.bayless responded with surprise and reiterated westlake view that taita had waived its right to complain by paying the invoices following the parties prior skirmish over taita claimed most favored nations rights.on october,bulmer sent a final letter to bayless in which he noted taita disagreement with westlake position and indicated that taita would respond further under separate cover.bulmer had in fact drafted a harsh letter,on october,setting forth taita position of objection in detail,but he never sent this letter per the instructions of btr managing director phillip aiken,who apparently wished to deal with the dispute at an upcoming november westlake board meeting.neither taita nor btr raised the pricing issue at this meeting,and taita and btr board members voted to approve the proposed budget,which did not include discounts for taita 
this september and october round of correspondence was the last formal exchange between the parties on this disputed pricing issue.they continued to negotiate,however,on efforts to terminate the agreement,or for btr and taita to divest themselves of their westlake holdings.taita alleges that it did not wish to actively press the most favored nations pricing issue in late,via litigation or otherwise,because of the sensitivity of these ongoing efforts.taita does,however,point to evidence purportedly indicating that it had not agreed to westlake interpretation of the pricing agreement,and that westlake,in fact,knew taita continued to disagree.first,allen grassedonio grassedonio,a btr employee who worked at westlake,had created a spreadsheet at the direction of taita president,that set forth westlake potential favored nations liability to taita.grassedonio testified in his deposition that he placed copies of these spreadsheets in the of westlake president on at least two occasions during and.westlake two presidents during this time frame,bayless and ron gilbert,deny receiving these reports.grassedonio,however,has testified that he confirmed by conversation,at least with bayless,that this report was received.additionally,grassedonio claims to have overheard bayless having a conversation that he believed concerned the spreadsheet content with another westlake executive.taita also points to the march report of the westlake evaluation committee.this report sets forth valuation scenarios in contemplation of the chao group purchase of taita and btr shares in westlake.indisputably this report states that one valuation assumes c ook pricing for taita.finally,taita notes the uncharacteristic lack of a release in the parties ultimate agreement to part ways.
however,despite taita contention that it never agreed with westlake interpretation of the pricing clause,and in stark juxtaposition with its cited evidence of,taita continued to pay westlake invoices as they came due.it is thus undisputed that for the next fourteen months,from november,taita paid each undiscounted invoice it received.
in december,btr finally sold its,and taita,combined interest in westlake to the chao group.as a result of this sale,the agreement was effectively canceled,with btr agreeing to continue purchasing styrene from westlake under a different pricing formula.as mentioned,the termination agreement did not include any type of release of claims as between the parties.
soon thereafter,btr sold taita,and in the summer of,taita new shareholders became aware of the potential claim that taita had against westlake for styrene overcharges.taita then filed suit,on december,alleging million dollars in damages.taita advanced claims for breach of contract,premised on westlake failure to extend taita its most favored nations discount based upon the cook composites contract and payment of a thing not owed in the district court,below,taita moved for partial summary judgment regarding the meaning of the agreement pricing clause.on this issue,the district court agreed with taita and granted a partial summary judgment.westlake this disposition.taita victory,however,was merely pyrrhic,because the district court held that westlake had established several affirmative defenses as a matter of law.westlake successfully argued that taita lost its right to benefit from the most favored nations pricing clause through a modification,by waiver or by estoppel.taita appeals the grant of summary judgment on these affirmative defenses.finally,westlake had asserted a cross claim for breach of fiduciary duty.the district court dismissed this cross claim as mooted by the summary judgment.westlake this ruling.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see geoscan,of texas geotrace,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d.when a motion for summary judgment is made,the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.see anderson liberty lobby,d.issues of material fact are genuine only if they require resolution by a trier of fact.see id.at.at.the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment.only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law will preclude the entry of summary judgment.see id.at.at.if the evidence is such that a reasonable could find in favor of the nonmoving party,summary judgment should not be granted.see see also matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.determining credibility,weighing evidence,and drawing reasonable inferences are left to the trier of fact.see anderson,at.at.
procedurally,the party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion,and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.celotex,at.at see also.c.the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial.see matsushita,at.at wise dupont de nemours,cir.the court must accept the evidence of the nonmoving party and draw all justifiable inferences in favor of that party.see matsushita,at.at.however,to meet its burden,the nonmovant must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,but instead,must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.at.at quoting.e.
ii.the pricing clause 
westlake argues,by way of,that the district court erred in determining that the pricing clause in the agreement is unambiguous.the parties agree that the pricing formula clearly provides for three distinct means of calculating the appropriate price per pound of styrene monomer.moreover,the agreement also indisputably sets forth that taita was to pay only the lowest of these three plausible prices.what is at issue between the parties is whether the phrase for comparable volumes of product was intended to modify each of the three possible pricing mechanisms,or just the third means of price calculation.westlake argues that the comparable volumes language modifies not only the third pricing mechanism which it follows,but also the second pricing calculation for a firm contract.taita argues that the district court properly determined that the language modifies only the third mechanism,which is not a basis for taita overcharge claim.
the parties agree that louisiana law governs our analysis in this diversity of citizenship case.in louisiana,the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is an issue of law for the court.see texas transmission amerada hess,cir.a court interpreting a contract shall determine the common intent of the parties.ann.however,w hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.id.at.therefore,when the contract is not ambiguous,this court lacks the authority to look beyond the four corners of the document.see texas transmission,at.the district court found the language of the pricing clause unequivocal.we agree.the comparable volumes language clearly and unambiguously modifies only the third pricing mechanism,which is not relevant to the present dispute we therefore affirm the ruling of the district court granting partial summary judgment regarding the meaning of the pricing clause.
iii.westlake affirmative defenses 
after granting the partial summary judgment in taita favor regarding the meaning of the pricing clause,the district court turned to westlake various asserted affirmative defenses modification,waiver and estoppel.the district court determined that westlake had proven each of these three defenses as a matter of law,and thus granted summary judgment.
modification 
the district court held below,and westlake now argues on appeal,that taita conduct served to modify the agreement.the louisiana civil code provides that a contract is an agreement by two or more parties whereby obligations are created,modified,or extinguished.ann.in order for a contract to be formed,both parties must consent.see id.at.this consent may be manifested by a writing,or be made orally,or by action or inaction that under the circumstances is clearly indicative of consent.id.it follows that silence may also be a form of inaction indicating consent,provided that the silence leads the offeror to reasonably believe that a contract has been formed.id.at.westlake,as the party asserting modification,must prove the facts or acts giving rise to the nullity,modification,or extinction.id.at see also allan arnold,cir l a contracting,ram indus.coatings,so d,big d dirt,westwood,so d,bank of louisiana in new orleans campbell,so d.moreover,it is well established that even if the written contract contains a provision requiring that all modifications be in writing,as does the agreement,either oral agreement or conduct can nonetheless prove modification.see durham,vanguard bank trust,wisinger casten,so d,campagna smallwood,so d,pelican contractors neumeyer,so d,pamper town of marksville,so d.in all instances,however,the party urging modification must establish that parties mutually consented to the agreement as modified.see.ann.society of the roman catholic church of the diocese of lafayette,interstate fire cas,cir l a contracting,so d at.
the issue therefore becomes whether taita consented either expressly or impliedly to a modification of the pricing clause,because modification requires a meeting of the minds.see.ann.interstate fire cas,at l a contracting,so d at.obviously,the record reflects a great amount of evidence favorable to westlake in this regard.taita paid some fourteen invoices after making its last clear complaint regarding the styrene price.never,in submitting any of its payments for these invoices,did taita overtly and contemporaneously note that it was in any manner paying under protest.taita and btr,through their votes on the westlake board,also voted to approve a budget that they knew did not reflect providing taita with a price discount.however,taita does introduce evidence purporting to show that it had not capitulated to westlake will on this issue,and that westlake moreover knew it had not so agreed.in this regard taita points principally to its prior protestations regarding the novacor contract its last word on the issue,bulmer october,letter the grassedonio spreadsheet and the evaluation committee march pricing scenarios.this evidence,taken as a whole,creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether taita agreed to modify the most favored nations pricing clause see illinois cent.gulf international harvester,so d,holding that in some instances the acceptance of payments without protest for extended periods of time will not always constitute modification.moreover,as taita contends,it seems that even if a modification occurred,taita may nonetheless have been overcharged for styrene up to the time of such modification.the district court did not address this issue below,and we mention it now only to stimulate further consideration of this issue on remand.
waiver is defined as the intentional relinquishment of a known right,power,or privilege.steptore masco constr,so d,see also tate charles aguillard ins.real estate,so d.in order for waiver to occur there must first be an existing right and knowledge of that right existence.see steptore,so d at.a party may then waive that right through either an actual intention to relinquish it,or conduct so inconsistent with the intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that it has been relinquished.id.see also gilbert,so d.the party asserting waiver,here westlake,must bear the burden of proof on the issue.see duffy,cir tate,so d at.
westlake must therefore establish either that taita intended to waive its rights under the contract or acted in a manner so inconsistent with this right as to induce a reasonable belief in westlake that taita did intend to waive its right.any effort by westlake to establish that taita intended to waive its most favored nations rights fails at the summary judgment stage for the same reasons that westlake modification defense fails.taita has introduced enough evidence to create a fact issue on what it intended with respect to the pricing clause.the second means of proving waiver,by conduct inducing a reasonable belief,likewise fails at the summary judgment stage.this is so because taita objective evidence of its own intent is also probative of whether its conduct was so inconsistent with its contractual rights as to induce a belief in westlake of waiver again creating a fact issue.moreover,westlake fails to carry its summary judgment burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of its beliefs.in this regard,we refer back to the untenable pricing clause interpretation advanced by westlake,which underlies this dispute.a reasonable juror could conclude that westlake could not have reasonably believed that taita had waived it right to millions of dollars in overcharges based upon westlake audacious legal opinion.we therefore reverse the district court waiver ruling.
equitable estoppel 
the louisiana supreme court has defined equitable estoppel as the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is precluded from asserting rights against another who has justifiably relied upon such conduct and changed his position so that he will suffer injury if the former is allowed to repudiate the conduct.morris friedman,so d,quoting john bailey contractor state dep t of transp,so d.the doctrine,in proper circumstances,will prevent a party from taking a position contrary to his prior acts,admissions,representations,or silence.john bailey,so d at accord wilkinson wilkinson,so d.equitable estoppel thus has three elements a representation by conduct or work justifiable reliance thereon and a change of position to one detriment because of the reliance.john bailey,so d at.however,equitable estoppel is disfavored and should only be applied as needed to avoid injustice.see morris,so d at john bailey,so d at.accordingly,a party having the means readily and conveniently available to determine the true facts,but who fails to do so,can not claim estoppel.john bailey,so d at.
westlake allegations in support of equitable estoppel are essentially as follows.taita conduct amounted to a representation that it had no right to most favored nations pricing based upon the sale of a volume of styrene monomer.westlake justifiably relied upon this representation to its detriment,in that it permitted taita and btr to sell their interests in westlake to the chao group.this sale terminated the agreement,at a price that did not reflect a possible claim for overcharges by taita.thus,westlake present shareholders were left with full liability for a claim for which taita and btr,as stockholders,would have born of the financial burden.
several items counsel against the district court decision to grant westlake motion for summary judgment on this issue.taita has advanced evidence,as disc
