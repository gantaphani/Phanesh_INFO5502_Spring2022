douglas and tina lindsay brought suit against joann yates,the estate of gene yates,and brent yates collectively,the yateses,as well as sluss realty company and realtor carol eicher,on the grounds that defendants terminated a sales contract with the lindsays one day after learning that the lindsays are black.the district court dismissed the lindsays complaint,concluding that they failed to plead facts establishing each element of a prima facie case as set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and texas department of community affairs burdine,d.although the district court did not address it,the yateses argued below,and now argue before this court,that the lindsays complaint must be dismissed for the further reason that they failed to plead facts showing that the purchase agreement executed by the parties was valid and enforceable.
for the reasons described below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the lindsays are an couple who reside in richland county,ohio.they allege that on or about august,gene and joann yates contracted with sluss realty and sluss realtor,carol eicher,to advertise the yateses home in lexington,ohio,for sale.the yateses home is located at eckert road,and the yateses own several adjacent parcels of property,which were not for sale.in addition,the yateses son,brent,operates a business on one of these adjacent parcels.
gene yates died in january,but the yateses eckert road property remained on the market.the lindsays allege that sluss and eicher told them that brent yates was authorized by his mother to negotiate the sale of the property and execute a purchase agreement.on may,the lindsays signed a purchase agreement to buy the property for an agreed price of.they tendered the signed purchase agreement to brent yates through eicher and deposited in earnest money with him in the form of a promissory note.brent yates signed the purchase agreement as the seller of the property on may.
on may,the lindsays visited their new home to identify the property lines.at that time,they introduced themselves to brent yates.the next day,sluss and eicher informed the lindsays that the yateses intended to terminate the sales contract because joann yates wished to keep the house for sentimental reasons.the lindsays appeared for the june,scheduled closing,but the yateses did not.
procedural history 
the lindsays filed suit on june,asserting that defendants unlawfully refused to sell them the yateses property on account of their race.the lindsays brought claims for violation of federal and state laws,including the fair housing act fha,and ohio revised code h,as well as a claim for breach of contract.
rather than move to dismiss the lindsays complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,defendants answered.the yateses answered on august,and sluss and eicher answered on august.the parties then proceeded to discovery.nearly a year later,on june,the yateses moved for judgment on the pleadings under rule c on the grounds that the lindsays were not entitled to relief on any of their claims because the parties had never entered into a valid sales contract.the yateses argued that the lindsays pleading was deficient because they failed to allege facts showing that the owner of the property,joann yates,had signed the purchase agreement,or that she had authorized her son,brent,to sign on her behalf.
the district court granted the yateses motion on october,but not on the grounds urged by the yateses or otherwise briefed by the parties 
first,the district court dismissed the lindsays claim under.the district court reasoned that does not constitute an independent cause of action under the fha,but simply works in conjunction with the prohibitions set forth in of the act.lindsay yates,wl,slip op.at,dist.op.
second,the district court sua sponte concluded that the lindsays failed to plead a prima facie case of racial discrimination because they did not allege facts establishing that the eckert road property remained on the market after the yateses rejected them.id.at.the district court therefore dismissed all the lindsays federal claims,dismissed the lindsays claims without prejudice,and stated that its order was final and appealable.id.at.the district court never ruled on whether the lindsays adequately pleaded facts regarding the existence of a valid contract,which was the entire premise of the yateses rule c motion.the lindsays timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal of a plaintiff complaint de novo.eeoc routh packing,cir.the same standards apply irrespective of whether the complaint has been dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim or under rule c for judgment on the pleadings.id.we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,accept all of the complaint factual allegations as true,and decide whether the plaintiffs can prove any set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief,miami valley pension,cir.
on appeal,the lindsays do not challenge the district court dismissal of their claim under.instead,the lindsays argue that the court erred in dismissing the remainder of their federal claims which includes their claims asserted under,and on the grounds that they failed to plead all the elements of a mcdonnell douglas burdine prima facie case.the lindsays further argue,contrary to the yateses,that they are not required to plead the existence of a valid sales contract to state a claim for relief.each of these issues will be discussed in turn.
the district court erred by requiring the lindsays to plead facts establishing a prima facie case under the mcdonnell framework 
the familiar mcdonnell douglas burdine analysis applies to federal claims,whether they are brought under the fha or or.mencer princeton square,cir applying the mcdonnell douglas framework to claims brought under the fha and and selden apts.dep t of housing and urban,cir same.first,a plaintiff who alleges discrimination on the basis of race must make out a prima facie case by showing that he or she is a member of a racial minority,that he or she applied for and was qualified to rent or purchase certain property or housing,that he or she was rejected,and that the housing or rental property remained available thereafter.mencer,at.however,the supreme court has instructed that the precise requirements of a prima facie case can vary depending on the context and were never intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.swierkiewicz sorema,d quoting furnco constr.waters,d.
if the plaintiff satisfies the prima facie requirements,the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate,reason for rejecting the plaintiff.mencer,at.finally,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant proffered reason is a pretext.id.although the burden of production shifts between the parties,the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion throughout the process.dixon gonzales,cir.
the question on appeal is whether,at the pleading stage,a plaintiff must establish each of the elements of the prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss the complaint.as described above,the district court held that the lindsays complaint failed to state a claim because they did not plead facts showing that the eckert road property remained available to other potential buyers,and that therefore the lindsays did not satisfy the fourth element of the prima facie case.both the district court and the parties failed to consider controlling supreme court authority that contravenes the district court judgment.
in swierkiewicz,the supreme court unanimously held that a plaintiff who asserted federal claims was not required to plead facts establishing a prima facie case to state a claim for relief.the court stated that t he prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.id.at.thus,the court held that an plaintiff satisfies her pleading burden by drafting a short and plain statement of the claim consistent with federal rule of civil procedure a.id.at.pr
