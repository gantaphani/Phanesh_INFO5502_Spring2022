facts and proceedings 
the facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute.the clinic hired doctor in september as a family practice physician at its quail valley clinic in missouri city,texas.in that month,the parties entered into an agreement which defined the terms and conditions of doctor employment at the clinic.this employment agreement specified several ways that it could be terminated,three of which are at issue in this appeal first,either party could terminate the agreement without cause by providing written notice to the other at least thirty days prior to doctor last day of patient care.second,the clinic could terminate the agreement without cause and without prior notice but with thirty days pay to doctor.third,the agreement would terminate automatically if,inter alia,doctor was unable to work,because of a disability,for a period exceeding three calendar months 
in any event,this agreement is automatically terminated upon your disability lasting longer than three calendar months that prevents you from performing the essential functions of your position with or without accommodation unless the clinic reviews the circumstances and grants written waiver of termination 
doctor began practicing medicine at the clinic quail valley location in october.on november,she was injured in a accident.she returned to the clinic on the day of the accident,but she began to feel disoriented while performing her duties and left shortly thereafter.doctor subsequently sought medical treatment from a fellow clinic physician who diagnosed her with a concussion.
after doctor had been absent from work for almost a month because of her injury,she received a letter dated december,from the clinic director of human resources,susan moore moore,outlining the benefits that doctor was entitled to receive under the clinic family medical leave fml policy.moore letter explained that doctor leave time under the clinic fml had commenced on november,the first day of her absence from work because of disability,and would expire twelve weeks later,on january.moore letter also cautioned that 
d uring the fml,your job as a family practitioner at a clinic site and your right to your current benefits are protected however,at the end of the week period,we can not commit to any position reinstatement.emphasis added 
soon after receiving moore letter,doctor applied for and began receiving benefits under the clinic fml policy.
on february,more than two weeks after the expiration of doctor fml period,moore sent a second letter to doctor.in this letter,moore informed doctor that the clinic had placed her employment in inactive status effective february,which was after the expiration of her fml period.this inactive status period,advised moore,was a benefits continuation period during which doctor could retain her clinic subsidized health insurance options but did not include a commitment to reinstatement emphasis added.moore concluded by stating 
your benefit continuation period inactive status can continue until april.please understand that the clinic can not make a commitment to reinstate you when you are able to return to work.should you still be unable to return to work after april,your employment with the clinic will be terminated emphasis added.
on march,doctor treating physician notified james hoyle hoyle,the clinic medical director of operations,that doctor would be able to resume her responsibilities at the clinic on april.in response,hoyle sent doctor a third and final letter on march.in it,hoyle stated that,although he was pleased to learn of her improved condition,due to patient needs,the clinic had been unable to hold her position beyond the beginning of march and had since filled the position.as there would be no position available for doctor on the day she was scheduled to return to work,wrote hoyle,her employment would be considered terminated as of that date 
under the terms of your employment agreement with the clinic,this letter will serve as day written notice of your termination with the clinic.the effective date of termination will be april,which is consistent with your release to return to work.
on april,hoyle sent a letter to doctor patients notifying them that she had resigned from the clinic,effective april,to pursue other professional interests.this letter identified the clinic physicians who were available to take over their medical care.doctor eventually opened her own family medical practice in august.
on september,doctor filed suit in texas state court alleging,inter alia,that the clinic had breached the employment agreement,defamed her by making false statements,orally and in writing,to her patients regarding the circumstances surrounding her termination,and tortiously interfered with her prospective business relations with patients one year later,doctor amended her complaint to add a claim for retaliatory discharge under the fmla.the clinic then removed the action to federal court.
in the district court,doctor filed separate motions for partial summary judgment on her claims for breach of contract and defamation.the clinic responded to each of her motions and filed its own for summary judgment on all of doctor claims.in february,the district court referred the matter to the magistrate judge.after considering the parties respective motions for summary judgment,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny doctor motions for partial summary judgment and grant the clinic motion as to all of doctor claims other than her state law slander claim.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of that claim without prejudice to doctor reurging it in state court the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation in its entirety and entered an order of dismissal.doctor timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment 
breach of contract 
doctor argues that the clinic breached the employment agreement by failing to provide her either written notice prior to her last day of patient care or pay following her termination.in response,the clinic asserts that neither written notice nor termination pay was required in this instance,as the employment agreement terminated ipso facto on february,by virtue of the automatic termination provision specifically,as a result of doctor disability lasting longer than three calendar months that prevent ed her from performing the essential functions of her position.
although doctor concedes that her extended absence would normally have triggered the employment agreement automatic termination provision,she contends that the clinic waived its right to assert automatic termination of the employment agreement through its own words and specifically,its representations to doctor in its february,and march,letters regarding her termination date.doctor emphasizes the fact that both letters refer to the termination of her employment as occurring sometime in april,well over a month after the automatic termination date of february,in the february,letter,moore cautioned doctor that her employment will be terminated if she is still unable to work after april.emphasis added.likewise,in the march,letter,hoyle advises her that t he effective date of termination will be april,emphasis added these statements,asserts doctor,show that the clinic still considered her an employee of the clinic after the date for automatic termination of the employment agreement had passed,thereby evidencing the clinic intent to waive the automatic termination provision.
doctor is correct that the element of intent is typically the prime factor in determining whether a waiver of a contractual right has occurred it is unnecessary to reach the question of intent in this case,
