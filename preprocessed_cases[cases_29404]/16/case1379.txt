when a party with insurance coverage is sued,the insured notifies the insurance company of the suit.the insurance company,in turn,typically chooses,retains,and pays private counsel to represent the insured as to all claims.if the suit involves some claims that are covered under the insurance policy and some claims that are not covered,the insurance company typically will send a reservation of rights letter to the insured stating what claims the insurance company believes are covered and what claims it believes are not covered.in this case,we examine whether,under south carolina law,such a reservation of rights letter automatically triggers a conflict of interest entitling the insured to reject counsel tendered by the insurance company and instead to choose and retain its own counsel and to have the insurance company pay for that counsel.
south carolina law does not address this issue.the district court predicting south carolina law concluded that a reservation of rights letter contesting coverage of certain claims but not other claims does not automatically trigger a conflict of interest entitling the insured to choose its own counsel and have the insurance company pay counsel fees.twin city fire ins.ben beverage of,d.because we agree with the district court conclusion,we affirm.
in june,joyce anglin sued ben beverage company of south carolina,ben arnold,ben arnold president and chief executive officer ceo william tovell,and ben arnold former president and ceo harvey belson.ben arnold is a wholesale beverage distributor in south carolina.in july,ellen white sued these same parties as well as sunbelt beverage company,sunbelt,ben arnold parent company referred to collectively as appellants or defendants.both cases involved south carolina tort claims based primarily on belson alleged sexual harassment of anglin and white while employed by ben arnold.specifically,anglin asserted claims against belson for intentional infliction of emotional distress,false imprisonment,assault and battery,civil conspiracy,and defamation,tovell for intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy,and ben arnold for intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligence,false imprisonment,defamation,negligent hiring,retention,and supervision,and wrongful discharge.ja.white made similar claims against belson,ben arnold,and sunbelt.ja.
ben arnold purchased general commercial liability policies from twin city fire insurance company twin city and from hartford casualty insurance company hartford casualty collectively insurance companies or appellees.see ja.the policies covered claims for personal injury up to million.ja.under the terms of the policies,personal injury was defined to include claims for defamation and false imprisonment.claims for defamation and false imprisonment were alleged in both the anglin and white actions.the policies,however,did not cover the remaining claims in anglin or white.twin city fire ins,d at.
ben arnold had consulted outside counsel concerning the allegations involving anglin and white fourteen months before anglin and white filed suit.see ja.only after anglin and white filed suit did ben arnold notify the insurance companies of the anglin and white actions.ja.
around october,the insurance companies orally informed ben arnold that they would assume responsibility for defending all defendants and all claims in both actions.ja.on december,the insurance companies confirmed in writing that they would undertake the defense,but added that they were doing so under a reservation of rights,and informed ben arnold that robert mckenzie,an attorney in private practice in columbia,south carolina,had been retained to represent the defendants in these actions.ja.the insurance companies letter included a reservation of rights and explained that the insurance companies believed that the defamation and false imprisonment claims were covered under the policies,but that the other claims were not.id.nevertheless,the insurance companies agreed to pay mckenzie to defend the defendants against all claims alleged in both cases.id.
on january,ben arnold informed the insurance companies that the defendants believed there was a conflict of interest inherent in the reservation of rights and that this conflict entitled the defendants to select their own counsel and to have the insurance companies pay the legal bills.ja.the defendants proceeded with counsel whom they had previously hired.on february,the insurance companies sent a proposal to the defendants that mckenzie and counsel selected by ben arnold share control of the litigation.ja.on may,the defendants rejected this proposal.ja.thus,mckenzie never represented any of the defendants,and the defendants excluded the insurance companies and mckenzie from the white and anglin litigation.
the white action settled in june for ja,and the anglin action settled in september for ja.according to the insurance companies,the defendants also incurred legal fees of million.appellees br.
in december,the insurance companies filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that they had no duty to indemnify the defendants in either action for various reasons,including that they were absolved of any duty to defend or indemnify because the defendants breached their contractual duty to cooperate and because the insurance companies suffered material prejudice from that breach.defendants counterclaimed and sought a declaratory judgment that the insurance companies had a duty to defend and to indemnify in both cases.essentially,the defendants contended that the insurance companies had to pay the legal bills and the cost of the settlement.each side moved for summary judgment.
on may,the district court granted the insurance companies motion for summary judgment concerning the claims for defense costs and indemnification by defendants ben arnold,sunbelt,and tovell.twin city fire ins,d at.as to belson claims for defense costs and indemnification,the court rejected belson indemnification claim.however,the court concluded that belson was entitled to have the insurance companies pay for a separate defense attorney and that a trial was necessary to determine the reasonableness of belson attorney fees.id.thereafter,the parties settled the dispute about the amount of belson attorney fees.ja.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see private mortgage inv,hotel club,cir.we have jurisdiction based on diversity,and south carolina law governs.accordingly,as to the disputed legal issue,we must determine how the supreme court of south carolina would rule.id.if the supreme court of south carolina has spoken neither directly nor indirectly on the particular issue before us,we are called upon to predict how that court would rule if presented with the issue.id.in making that prediction,we may consider lower court opinions in south carolina,the teachings of treatises,and the practices of other states.wade danek,cir.
the district court declared that the principal question in this case is whether the supreme court of south carolina would adopt a per se disqualification rule that would entitle an insured to select independent counsel at its insurer expense any time the insurer attempts to defend a lawsuit under a reservation of rights.twin city fire ins,d at.the district court concluded that south carolina would reject a per se disqualification rule because it rests upon the presumption that whenever a lawyer is confronted with a potential conflict of interest,the lawyer will always compromise the interests of the client.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court noted that the supreme court of south carolina had not directly addressed the principal legal question in this case.id.at.
on appeal,the appellants contend that hegler gulf insurance,controls this case.in hegler,the court stated there is no material difference in legal effect between an outright refusal to defend and in undertaking the defense under a reservation of rights hegler,at.in hegler,the insurance company defended the insured in the underlying suit with a reservation of rights and simultaneously filed suit against the insured and sought declaratory judgment on whether coverage existed.id.at.the insurance company did not pay the insured legal fees in the declaratory judgment action,and the insured prevailed in that litigation and sought attorney fees.the court analyzed whether the insured who prevailed in the declaratory judgment could recoup from the insurance company the attorney fees that the insured expended in successfully litigating the coverage question.id.in the sentence cited by ben arnold,the court was explaining that forcing the insured to hire counsel to litigate against the insurance company in the declaratory judgment action concerning coverage was functionally equivalent to refusing to pay for the insured defense in the underlying action.id.hence,the insured was entitled to the attorney fees arising from the insured successful defense in the declaratory judgment action.id.because in hegler the insurer did defend the insured in the underlying action,hegler is not helpful much less controlling on the issue presented in this case.
appellants also cite ollie seafood grille bar,llc selective insurance of south carolina,jud.cir,as evidence that the supreme court of south carolina would hold that when an insurance company issues a reservation of rights letter,a per se disqualification rule applies,and the insured may hire counsel of its own choosing and require the insurance company to pay the legal bills.in ollie seafood,a south carolina state trial court confronted whether the is entitled to conduct its own defense in the underlying personal injury action through counsel it selects and controls at the expense of the insurance company.ollie seafood,order at ja.the trial court expressly adopted san diego navy federal credit union cumis insurance society,d,in which the california court of appeals held that where multiple theories of recovery are alleged and some theories involve uncovered conduct under the policy,a conflict of interest exists.cumis ins.soc y.at.when such a conflict exists,the insurer must pay for such defense conducted by independent counsel.id.at.
ollie seafood is not helpful because the parties in ollie seafood did not contest that the issuance of the reservation of rights gave rise to a conflict of interest between the insured and the insurance company,and the defense counsel appointed by the insurance company expressly acknowledged the conflict.ollie seafood,order at ja at.in contrast,the insurance companies in this case vigorously dispute that a conflict of interest existed precluding mckenzie from representing the defendants.because the conflict was simply assumed in ollie seafood,the case provides no guidance as to how the supreme court of south carolina would rule on the issue presented here.
moreover,a federal court sitting in diversity is not bound by a state trial court decision on matters of state law.in king order of united commercial travelers of america,the supreme court upheld the fourth circuit refusal to follow an opinion issued by a state trial court in a south carolina insurance case.the court concluded,a court of common pleas does not appear to have such importance and competence within south carolina own judicial system that its decisions should be taken as authoritative expositions of that state law.id.at.accordingly,we reject appellants reliance on ollie seafood.
because south carolina law does not address whether an insured is entitled to select its own counsel at its insurance company expense any time that the insurance company issues a reservation of rights letter concerning coverage,we look to other sources,including decisions in other states,for guidance as to how the supreme court of south carolina would rule on this issue.wade,at.not surprisingly,the parties cite competing lines of authority in support of their respective positions.
several courts have adopted a per se rule that where an insurance company reserves the right to deny coverage for a particular claim,then a conflict of interest between the insurance company and insured exists.these cases include chi of alaska,employers reins,alaska union ins.knife,predicting arkansas law kroll tract paris paris,th,d,citing cal.nandorf,cna ins,d,finding conflict when punitive damages not covered by policy herbert sullivan,utica mut.ins,howard russell stover candies,cir predicting missouri law moeller am.guar.liab.ins,so d,rhodes chicago ins,cir applying texas law.
these courts conclude that where an insurance company defends its insured under a reservation of rights concerning coverage,a conflict exists.these courts have identified the following conflicts if an insurance company contends that a particular loss will not be covered under the policy,the lawyer hired by the insurance company may offer only a token defense of the potentially claim or conduct the defense in such a manner as to make the likelihood of the plaintiff verdict greater on the claim.additionally,the lawyer hired by the insurance company might gain access to confidential information during the defense that the lawyer might provide to the insurance company to contest coverage.further,the lawyer retained to defend the insured might tend to favor the insurance company over the insured due to a desire to receive future legal work from the insurance company.
in contrast,many other courts have held that defending an insured with a reservation of rights concerning coverage does not create a per se conflict.the following cases reject a per se rule l s roofing supply paul fire marine ins,so d,travelers indem.of royal oak,d,predicting florida law armstrong cleaners,erie ins,d,applying indiana law trinity universal ins.stevens forestry,cir applying louisiana law finley home ins,haw cent.bd.of trs.employers reins,d,applying michigan law fed.ins,same driggs.mfrs.ass ins,d,applying maryland law nisson am.home assur,hk,admiral ins,c,wl,at.june,applying wisconsin law tank state farm fire cas,holding that potential conflict created by reservation of rights mandates enhanced obligations of good faith for attorneys whose fees are covered by insurer.in rejecting a per se rule,these courts hold that not every reservation of rights creates a conflict.instead a assessment must be made.
regardless of whether a court applies a per se conflict rule,once a court does find that a conflict of interest exists,it must determine how to remedy the conflict.courts universally require that the insured receive counsel,but are divided into three camps over who should control the selection of counsel.some courts hold that if a conflict exists,the insured has the right to select its own counsel to be paid for by the insurance company.see,chi of alaska,at knife.at kroll,d at am.family life assur.of columbus,fire,cir applying georgia law and holding that insurer must pay for selected by insured nandorf,at armstrong cleaners,d at herbert sullivan,at moeller,so d at rhodes,at.

after reviewing these cases,we agree with the district court and reject the notion that the reservation of rights letter issued in this case creates a per se conflict that must be remedied through the insured selecting counsel and having the insurance companies pay the legal fees.more importantly,we agree with the district court conclusion that the supreme court of south carolina would so hold.see twin city fire ins,d at.specifically,we find the analysis and holding of particularly persuasive and the facts remarkably similar
