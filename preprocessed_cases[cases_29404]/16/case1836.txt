a confirmed plan of reorganization provided that certain claims against the chapter debtor and its affiliates would be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction and determined by settlement or final judgment.the debtor,its affiliates,and the claimants later requested the bankruptcy court approval of a proposed agreement to liquidate the claims through binding arbitration.the bankruptcy court denied the request,and the district court affirmed that judgment.this appeal presents a subject matter jurisdiction challenge and the substantive issue of whether the proposed agreement constitutes an impermissible attempt to modify a substantially consummated plan of reorganization.we find that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over this matter and agree with its determination that the proposed agreement would modify the plan in violation of the bankruptcy code.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
between and,united states brass corporation manufactured and marketed a polybutylene plumbing system for residential and commercial construction,repair,and remodeling.brass produced the pipe and fittings used in the plumbing system from raw materials supplied by shell oil company and cna holdings,formerly hoechst celanese corporation.the system turned out to be defective,and,as a consequence,numerous homeowners,homeowners associations,developers,builders,and plumbing contractors sued brass,brass parent corporations shell,and cna collectively the appellants.according to brass,its insurers unwillingness to defend or provide coverage for the lawsuits caused the company to file for bankruptcy protection in the eastern district of texas on may.
shell and cna filed a joint claim in the brass chapter case for,representing the companies actual and estimated expenditures in connection with the defective plumbing system and the resulting litigation.shell also filed a separate proof of claim in the amount of for funds it expended in settlement of homeowners claims involving brass products.
resolving the plumbing claims was a principal object in drafting a plan of reorganization for brass.and it became clear early in the drafting process that the debtor and its affiliates were relying heavily on insurance proceeds to satisfy those claims.consequently,the appellees insurers,who issued insurance policies to brass and eljer covering the period of the plumbing system manufacture and installation in buildings throughout the country,were active in the reorganization.in particular,the insurers objected to the september,version of the reorganization plan because they feared it would invite collusive behavior among the debtor,eljer,shell,and cna in the liquidation of the claims.the insurers were also concerned that the proposed plan would prevent them from asserting coverage defenses arising from violations of the cooperation and no action provisions of their policies.according to the insurers,those provisions require brass and eljer to cooperate with them in defending plumbing claims and relieve the insurers of their indemnity obligations unless the claims are fully and fairly adjudicated or settled with the insurers approval.
the insurers eventually withdrew their objections to confirmation,but only after the plan was amended to preserve their coverage defenses for later adjudication in ongoing coverage litigation through the amendment,the parties also formalized a method for resolving the claims by adding plan sections b and.section b requires that the claims be asserted by institution of litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction,with recovery to be determined by settlement or final judgment section sets forth a time limit for such litigation to be commenced or continued 
even before the amendment,however,the parties understood that the claims would be litigated.both the september and final versions of the plan included section e i,which mandates an alternative dispute resolution procedure for the liquidation of other outstanding plumbing claims,primarily those of homeowners.that procedure permits binding arbitration proceedings if agreed to by the parties.but section e iv exempts the claims from the adr mechanism thus,the adr provisions do not conflict with or undermine the litigation requirement for the claims.
the bankruptcy court confirmed the amended plan on february,and incorporated into its confirmation order the stipulation between the debtor and certain named insurers.the stipulation provided that brass and eljer would defend the claims in good faith and not seek to end that litigation through collusive trial or settlement with the claimants.
on march,the plan became effective,and,as prescribed by its initial funding provisions,brass and eljer made a cash payment to the brass trust,the entity created to receive and distribute funds to plumbing claimants and other creditors.pursuant to a settlement agreement included in the plan,shell and cna received on their claims.the plan provides that the remainder of the claims,still exceeding one billion dollars in the companies estimate,could be recovered only from insurance proceeds.furthermore,the plan requires any proceeds recovered on the claims to be paid over to the brass trust.eighty percent of those proceeds would then be distributed to the claimants in the cox class action thereby reducing shell and cna payment obligations to the class the remaining twenty percent would be available for other plumbing claimants.
in accordance with the plan,shell and cna instituted litigation against eljer in the courts of new jersey and filed suit against brass in collin county,texas.on march,this court dismissed as moot an appeal from the bankruptcy court confirmation order we found that the transactions that have taken place to date,the exchange of mutual releases,the disbursements already made,and the general implementation of the plan by all the involved parties evidence substantial consummation of the plan.
on october,the appellants filed a motion for order in aid of consummation of plan and for approval of settlement of plumbing claims of shell oil company and hoechst celanese corporation with the bankruptcy court.the motion requested the court approval of a proposed settlement agreement among brass,eljer,shell,and cna.under the agreement,the claims would be liquidated by submission to final and binding arbitration.in addition,the pending lawsuits in new jersey and texas would be dismissed,but the limitations period of plan section would be tolled so that those suits could be reinstituted if necessary.
the insurers filed objections to the motion,contending that arbitration of the claims without their consent would alter their rights under the plan and constitute a breach of the cooperation and no action clauses of the polices.after a full evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court denied the motion on two bases.first,the court found that the proposed agreement fails to settle any matter before the courts 
t he testimony offered at the hearing on the motion made it abundantly clear to this court that the proposed agreement will not end,expedite or curtail litigation of the shell cna claims.it is no settlement at all.no arms length bargaining has occurred.no value has changed hands.no claims have been released or reduced.the motion simply seeks to substitute an arbitration process for the resolution of those claims which the confirmed plan required to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and determined by settlement or final judgment 
second,the court recognized that b prohibits modification of a substantially consummated plan of reorganization and concluded that approving the appellants motion would violate this prohibition 
the proposed settlement agreement alters by extension the provisions of the plan respecting time limitations with respect to bringing actions if the arbitration results in giving the carriers a defense to coverage.plan at.moreover,arbitration as to the claims which are the subject matter of the proposed settlement was not an option specifically contemplated and negotiated by the parties at confirmation.the court will not and may not allow such a modification of a confirmed and substantially consummated plan of reorganization in contravention of b regardless of movants attempts to clothe it as a settlement or clarification of an order.
brass,eljer,shell,and cna appealed the bankruptcy court order denying the motion to the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.the district court affirmed,finding that the appellants proposed substitution of arbitration for litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction should not be interpreted as a settlement because the carefully crafted claims resolution scheme set forth in the plan does not contemplate arbitration.if the parties had intended to resolve the claims through arbitration,they would have specifically provided for arbitration in the plan language.thus,the district court agreed that the motion is appropriately viewed as an attempt to modify the plan in violation of b.
the appellants now seek review in this court.
ii.jurisdiction 
citing the limited nature of jurisdiction,the insurers contend that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to entertain the appellants motion.both the bankruptcy and district courts finding that they had subject matter jurisdiction is a legal determination that we review de novo.in asserting jurisdiction,the bankruptcy court relied on both a broad provision in the confirmed plan and its authority under the bankruptcy code to clarify and enforce its own orders however,the source of the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction is neither the bankruptcy code nor the express terms of the plan.the source of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction is and 
section grants the federal district courts jurisdiction over four types of bankruptcy matters cases under title,proceedings arising under title,proceedings arising in a case under title,and proceedings related to a case under title the first category refers to the bankruptcy petition itself the second,third,and fourth categories,all listed in b,operate conjunctively to define the scope of jurisdiction.therefore,it is necessary only to determine whether a matter is at least related to the bankruptcy.a proceeding is related to a bankruptcy if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.
by way of referral,the bankruptcy court may hear and determine certain matters falling within the jurisdictional grant of specifically,b gives bankruptcy courts full judicial power over all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,referred under this section proceedings that are otherwise related to a case under title may be heard by a bankruptcy judge,but any final order or judgment must be entered by the district court thus,if a matter within the broad scope of b satisfies the more precise notion of a core proceeding,authorizes the bankruptcy court to decide the matter and enter a final judgment.although the statute does not define core proceedings,subsection b does provide a nonexclusive list of examples moreover,we have held that equates core proceedings with the categories of arising under and arising in proceedings therefore,a proceeding is core under section if it invokes a substantive right provided by title or if it is a proceeding that,by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.
with this general framework in mind,we acknowledge that the posture of this case complicates our analysis somewhat.section does not expressly limit bankruptcy jurisdiction upon plan confirmation.consequently,several courts have adapted the broad related to test for application in disputes those courts find that a proceeding falls within the jurisdictional grant if it has a conceivable effect on the debtor ability to consummate the confirmed plan in the recent case of in re craig stores of texas,however,we rejected this expansive view in favor of a more exacting theory after a debtor reorganization plan has been confirmed,the debtor estate,and thus bankruptcy jurisdiction,ceases to exist,other than for matters pertaining to the implementation or execution of the plan.although we can imagine cases where the two approaches would produce different results,bankruptcy jurisdiction existed over the appellants motion in this case,even under the narrower test.
the brass reorganization plan has been substantially consummated,but it has not been fully consummated.the appellants still have an obligation to resolve the claims,and that obligation is at the heart of this dispute.although section b of the plan provides that shell and cna are entitled to assert their claims by institution of litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction,they now intend to submit the claims to binding arbitration.thus,in opposition to the motion,the insurers rely on the bankruptcy code prohibition on modification of a substantially consummated plan of reorganization the appellants contend,on the other hand,that their proposed the arbitration fully consistent with the plan.bankruptcy law will ultimately determine this dispute,and the outcome could affect the parties rights and responsibilities.furthermore,this proceeding will certainly impact compliance with or completion of the reorganization plan.consequently,the appellants motion pertains to the plan implementation or execution and therefore satisfies the craig stores test for jurisdiction.
having found that subject matter jurisdiction exists over the parties dispute,we must now decide whether the bankruptcy court could hear and determine this matter as a core proceeding to this end,we have noted already that a proceeding is core if it arises under title or arises in a case under title.in their motion,the appellants invoke b,which authorizes bankruptcy orders necessary for the consummation of the plan.some courts hold that when a movant seeks an order pursuant to b,the proceeding arises under title we find,however,that b does not confer substantive rights so much as it empowers the bankruptcy court to enforce the unperformed terms of a confirmed plan thus,proceedings within the contemplation of b are more appropriately viewed as arising in a case under title.
a rising in proceedings are those that are not based on any right expressly created by title,but nevertheless,would have no existence outside of the bankruptcy.proceedings invoking the bankruptcy court statutory authority to enter orders necessary for the consummation of a confirmed plan meet this criteria because the authority can be exercised only in the context of a bankruptcy case.in other words,such proceedings arise only in bankruptcy.here,the appellants sought an order pursuant to b,and,although the insurers opposed the requested relief,each side argued that a ruling in its favor was necessary to the implementation or execution of the brass plan.this dispute would not exist outside of this bankruptcy case.as a result,the proceeding on the appellants motion constitutes a core proceeding 
in sum,the present matter falls within the jurisdictional grant of and qualifies as a core proceeding over which the bankruptcy court had full judicial power.furthermore,under,the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court order denying the motion and we now have jurisdiction over this appeal 
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court,acting as a second review court,reviews the bankruptcy court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard,and the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo.and we review a bankruptcy court decision to approve or disapprove a settlement under an abuse of discretion standard in the present case,the bankruptcy court determined that the proposed agreement was not a settlement,but rather an attempt to modify a substantially consummated plan of reorganization in contravention of b.this determination presents a mixed question of law and fact that is subject to de novo review 
b.the appellants motion 
a rbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties it is a way to resolve those only those the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.but the appellants contractual freedom is not unlimited.because the brass reorganization plan functi
