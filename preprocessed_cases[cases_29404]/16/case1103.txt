opinion of the court 
hovensa,llc appeals from the decision of the district court of the virgin islands denying hovensa motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the relevant arbitration agreement is unconscionable under virgin islands law.because the district court opinion relied on its view that it was not bound by contrary decisions of the virgin islands superior court,it is incumbent upon us to examine the restructured judicial system for the virgin islands following the revised organic act and the amendment by the virgin islands legislature to a.
leland edwards entered into a dispute resolution agreement dra with wyatt,wyatt,his prospective employer,before he began to work at the hovensa factory in croix.the dra provided,in relevant part 
regardless of whether wyatt offers me employment,both wyatt and i agree to resolve any and all claims,disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to any claims for personal injury or property damage arising in any way from my presence at the hovensa refinery that are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement exclusively and by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the american arbitration association aaa national rules for the resolution of employment disputes national rules,a copy of which is available at www.adr.org or from wyatt.this agreement extends to such disputes with or claims against wyatt,hovensa,llc,other contractors or subcontractors employed at the hovensa refinery,and any of their related or affiliated companies,entities,employees or individuals as intended third party beneficiaries to this agreement.
app.at emphasis added.wyatt,which became edwards employer,is a contractor for hovensa.
edwards was injured in january due to what he alleged was hovensa negligence.he filed a complaint against hovensa in the district court for the district of the virgin islands,croix division,asserting negligence and personal injury claims against hovensa arising out of the injury allegedly suffered during his employment.hovensa thereafter sought to enforce the terms of the dra and filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings pending arbitration pursuant to and.the district court denied hovensa motion,and it filed a timely notice of appeal.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and a.the parties are diverse.edwards is a citizen of massachusetts.hovensa is a limited liability corporation,incorporated in the virgin islands with its principal place of business in croix.the amount in controversy exceeds.
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a which provides that an appeal may be taken from an order denying an application to compel arbitration.we exercise plenary review over questions regarding the validity and enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate.lloyd hovensa,llc,cir.t o the extent that the district court predicated its decision on findings of fact,our standard of review is whether those findings were clearly erroneous.id.quoting medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir.
in denying hovensa motion to compel arbitration,the district court concluded that t he manner in which edwards entered into the dispute resolution agreement is procedurally unconscionable and that the agreement to arbitrate personal injury claims against intended beneficiaries is substantively unconscionable.app.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court rejected hovensa contention that it must follow superior court decisions that have upheld similar agreements to arbitrate personal injury claims against tortfeasors.see,moore hovensa,llc,wl.june,rose hovensa,wl.
in this appeal,hovensa argues that the district court improperly concluded that it was not bound by prior decisions of the superior court of the virgin islands that,as a matter of local contract law,agreements to arbitrate personal injury claims are not unconscionable and must be enforced and the district court improperly refused to compel arbitration,pursuant to the federal arbitration act,by concluding that edwards arbitration agreement with his employer,as applied to personal injury claims against the third party upon whose premises he worked,was not supported by adequate consideration and therefore was unconscionable.
a brief analysis of the jurisdiction of the district court of the virgin islands is necessary to put the issue before us in perspective.in our opinion in carty beech aircraft,cir,where we considered in some detail the basis on which the district court of the virgin islands had jurisdiction over the matter at issue there,we analyzed that court jurisdiction in light of historical perspective and the applicable authorities.id.at.after reviewing the origin of the united states dominion over the virgin islands and the establishment of its courts,in particular the organic act of the virgin islands,we concluded that when congress acted to establish the district court of the virgin islands,it established it as a court of original and general jurisdiction.id.at.
thereafter,congress amended the revised organic act in,et,and established the framework for a dual system of local and federal judicial review in the virgin islands.parrott gov t of the,cir.under the revised organic act,the district court of the virgin islands had jurisdiction over federal questions,regardless of the amount in controversy,and general original jurisdiction over questions of local law,subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the local courts over civil actions where the amount in controversy was less than.moravian sch.advisory bd.rawlins,cir.as we explained in parrott,b y virtue of the amendments,the district court now possesses the jurisdiction of a district court of the united states.a.at.
significantly,in parrott we noted that under the statute,
the virgin islands legislature was now able,however,to divest the district court of original jurisdiction for local matters by vesting that jurisdiction in territorial courts established by local law for all causes for which any court established by the constitution and laws of the united states does not have exclusive jurisdiction.
id.we made explicit that t o the extent that that divestiture power is exercised by the legislature,the district court loses jurisdiction to the territorial court over local matters.see b.id 
the virgin islands statute enacted september,provided that 
effective october,the superior court shall have original jurisdiction in all civil actions regardless of the amount in controversy to supervise and administer estates and fiduciary relations to appoint and supervise guardians and trustees to hear and determine juvenile,divorce,annulment and separation proceedings to grant adoptions and changes of name to establish paternity to legitimize children and to make orders and decrees pertaining to the support of relations.
as we stated in parrott,of the revised organic act acts in combination with a of the to effectively repeal any grant of concurrent jurisdiction to the district court over local actions once the virgin islands legislature has vested jurisdiction over local civil actions in the territorial court.at citing brow farrelly,cir recognizing implicit repeal in.
it follows that edwards errs when he argues that the district court of the virgin islands still remains vested with the judicial power of the territory.he cites a case of this court for the proposition that the district court of the virgin islands sits essentially as a local court,not a federal court interpreting local law,dep t of conservation cultural affairs paving,cir,but that opinion preceded the restructure of the courts of the virgin islands.thus,we reiterate that which we previously made clear in parrott the virgin islands statute divested the district court of original jurisdiction over purely local civil matters.parrott,at.in addition,the district court has been divested of its appellate jurisdiction 
we recognize that it is not easy for the district court,which has contributed generously and productively to the local law of the virgin islands,to accept its divestiture but that follows inexorably from the statutes and is confirmed by the legislative history.in,the virgin islands legislature exercised the authority granted it under b to divest the district court of original jurisdiction over any cause over which local law has vested jurisdiction in the local courts.see cong.rec,statement of weicker at any time,by vesting jurisdiction in the local courts,the local law will have the effect of divesting the district court of jurisdiction.we therefore take this opportunity to reject any statements to the contrary in district court opinions.see,spink accident ins.of puerto rico,d,this court need not predict local law because it is vested with the authority to decide novel questions as a local trial court.
this does not mean that the doctrine established in erie tompkins,does not apply or that the district court is bound to follow the law as expressed in decisions of the superior court.we turn to that issue.
although the revised organic act provided the path that ultimately led to the district court being divested of its jurisdiction over local law,it also expanded the jurisdiction of the district court by investing it with diversity jurisdiction and thereby extended the principles of federalism to the judicial system of the virgin islands.specifically,states 
the relations between the courts established by the constitution or laws of the united states and the courts established by local law with respect to appeals,certiorari,removal of causes,the issuance of writs of habeas corpus,and other matters or proceedings shall be governed by the laws of the united states pertaining to the relations between the courts of the united states,including the supreme court of the united states,and the courts of the several states in such matters and proceedings 
in walker gov t of the,cir,our court held that congress intended that all of the provisions of title apply to the district court where appropriate.the rules of decision act,which sets forth how federal courts are to interpret prior state court judgments,states,the laws of the several states shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the united states.
it is likely that prior to,the rules of decision act did not apply to the district court of the virgin islands.the virgin islands,of course,is a territory,not a state and the district court is not a court of the united states.waialua agric.christian.rules of decision act not applicable to territories.now that mandates that the relations between courts established by laws of the united states,the revised organic act,and courts established by local law should mirror the relations between state and federal courts,we conclude that makes the erie doctrine and the rules of decision act applicable to the district court of the virgin islands.
the fact that the district court of the virgin islands is an article iv court rather than an article iii court does not preclude the application of erie.for example,the erie doctrine is applied by bankruptcy courts.see generally thomas plank,the erie doctrine and bankruptcy,notre dame.in maternally yours your maternity shop,cir,the court stated that the erie doctrine applies,whatever the ground for federal jurisdiction,to any issue or claim which has its source in state law.although this court stated in parrott that f ederalism concerns are not implicated in matters where the district court,in the past,reviewed questions of local law sitting as a territorial court and exercising its general jurisdiction,parrott,at emphasis added,that is no longer the case.in more recent cases,this court has referred to the district court of the virgin islands as a federal court.see moravian,at because and clearly demonstrate that congress intended to limit the authority of the federal courts to transfer cases only to other federal courts,we have held that provides no authority for a federal court to transfer a case over which it lacks jurisdiction to a state court.
we see no reason not to incorporate the federalism principles applicable throughout the circuit into our relationship with the virgin islands courts.indeed,concluding otherwise would result in two court systems engag ing independently in the process of formulating the local law of the territory,thereby subvert ing the dual aims of erie discouraging forum shopping and promoting uniformity within any given jurisdiction on matters of local substantive law.lee flintkote.
a federal court under erie is bound to follow state law as announced by the highest state court.if the highest court has not spoken to the issue,we can garner assistance from the decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts in predicting how the state highest court would rule.mosley wilson,cir.although state intermediate appellate decisions are not automatically controlling,see paoletto beech aircraft,cir,the supreme court in commissioner of internal revenue estate of bosch,d,summarized current practice as follows even in diversity cases this court has further held that while the decrees of lower state courts should be attributed some weight the decision is not controlling where the highest court of the state has not spoken on the point.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in west,the supreme court further held that an intermediate appellate state court is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.
the superior court of the virgin islands formerly the territorial court is not the highest court of the territory.it is not even an intermediate appellate court,but rather a trial court.therefore,although we believe that the district court could have looked to the decisions of the superior court as a datum for ascertaining state law,we can not conclude that it erred in holding that it was not bound by the decisions of the superior court because the virgin islands supreme court has made no pronouncement on the arbitration issue presented in this case,we will turn our attention to the arbitrability of employee claims for personal injury.
in declining to compel arbitration notwithstanding the dra,the district court held that edwards agreement to arbitrate personal injury claims is procedurally and substantively unconscionable in support of its holding,the district court concluded that the consideration was grossly inadequate and that edwards did not benefit from any efficiency or economy in the arbitration process.the court stated that there is a gross disparity in the values exchanged,in that edwards has given up the right to a judicial forum against a tortfeasor for his personal injury claims,solely for the sake of employment.the court stated that the economic benefit of arbitration for employees with personal injury claims is not as significant as it is with respect to an employee contractual or statutory employment claims.we suggest that the district court opinion reflects the judicial hostility to arbitration that the supreme court of the united states has sought to alter.
before directing parties to proceed to arbitration,the court must ascertain whether the parties entered a valid agreement to arbitrate by looking to the relevant state law of contracts.alexander anthony int l,cir.pursuant to,t he rules of common law,as expressed in the restatements of law approved by the american law institute,and to the extent not so expressed,as generally understood and applied in the united states,shall be the rules of decision in the courts of the virgin islands in cases to which they apply,in the absence of local laws to the contrary.
restatement second of contracts provides that a court may refuse to enforce a contract or term of a contract that is unconscionable at the time the contract is made.the doctrine of unconscionability involves both procedural and substantive elements.see alexander,at explaining that the procedural element of a claim of unconscionability is generally satisfied if the agreement constitutes a contract of adhesion.however,a contract term is not unconscionable merely because the parties to it are unequal in bargaining position.restatement at cm
