this case presents two questions of first impression for this circuit.first,does the family and medical leave act fmla,et.west supp,provide a covered employee with an absolute right to be restored to his previous job after taking approved leave and second,is a private employer that contracts with an indian tribe subject to suit for race discrimination under west when it enforces a contractual tribal preference policy for the reasons that follow,we believe we must answer both questions in the negative and so affirm the judgment of the district court.
in june,the eastern band of cherokee indians tribe entered into a management agreement with harrah north carolina casino company harrah concerning the operations of the tribe gaming enterprise.under the terms of the agreement,the tribe granted harrah the exclusive right and obligation to develop,manage,operate and maintain the enterprise and any expansion thereof.the tribe delegated its own obligations and rights under this agreement to the tribal casino gaming enterprise tcge,an instrumentality of the tribe with authority to conduct the business of the casino on behalf of the tribe.the agreement thus functioned as an employment contract under which harrah worked as the manager for the tribe delegate,the tcge.through this arrangement,harrah provided its experience and expertise in managing the gaming operation and training the tribal members.
as part of this management agreement,harrah received the exclusive responsibility and authority to direct the selection,hiring,training,control and discharge of all employees performing regular services for the enterprise in connection with the maintenance,operation,and management of the enterprise and the facility and any activity upon the property.the agreement provided that harrah would give preference in recruiting,training and employment to qualified members of the tribe and their spouses and adult children in all job categories of the enterprise.accordingly,harrah assented to the following order of preference a enrolled tribal members b spouse,parent or children of tribal members c other native americans d others from the cherokee community e others from the region and f others from the state of north carolina.
all employees hired by harrah to staff the casino pursuant to this agreement were considered employees of the tcge,although harrah maintained supervisory authority over them.harrah and tcge classified many of these employees as leased employees leased employees worked at the casino,harrah paid their salaries and benefits,and tcge reimbursed harrah for these expenses.in the years after the agreement went into effect,there was a gradual shift in positions from harrah to the tcge.by,all employees that harrah hired were tcge,rather than harrah,employees.
in,harrah hired edward yashenko to work for the parent company in louisiana in,he transferred to the north carolina casino,where he became a leased employee.in,yashenko received a promotion to the position of relations,a job he held until his discharge in july.during his tenure at the north carolina casino,yashenko requested and was granted several medical leaves of absence,all of which were approved and most of which were taken under the fmla.specifically,yashenko received approximately ten weeks leave from december,until february,approximately fifteen weeks leave from may until august,six weeks leave from march until april,and fourteen weeks leave from may until august.after each leave of absence,yashenko returned to the same job,with no reduction in pay or benefits.
in early may,yashenko requested another medical leave of absence for a serious health problem related to heart surgery.harrah approved the leave as fmla leave,and yashenko remained on leave for eleven more weeks,until july.while yashenko was out,harrah informed him that the company was reorganizing in a way that eliminated his position a harrah position,as well as the position of employment manager a tcge position.in their stead,harrah created two new tcge positions that consolidated the responsibilities of the eliminated jobs.the company goal was to form a synergy by having one manager responsible for the life of the employee from hiring to termination.tom fagg,the human resources director at harrah,invited yashenko to apply for the new positions,as well as other available tcge jobs.there were no available jobs at harrah because the agreement prevented harrah from hiring new employees to work for harrah.despite the invitation and the many descriptions of job openings fagg sent him,yashenko decided not to apply for any position because,he explained,he was taking medication,and did not feel up to it,and because his doctors assertedly recommended that he not do so.upon his return from fmla leave on july,harrah discharged him.
yashenko then filed suit in state court against harrah alleging violations of his rights under the fmla because harrah did not restore him to his job at the end of his leave.harrah removed the case to federal court.after both parties moved for summary judgment,the district court granted yashenko permission to file an amended complaint in which he added claims of race discrimination under and of wrongful discharge in violation of north carolina public policy.the parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment on these additional claims.on january,the district court granted summary judgment to harrah on both the fmla and claims,and dismissed the wrongful discharge claim without prejudice.yashenko noted a timely appeal.
in recognition of the growth of households and households in which the single parent or both parents work,the importance of parental participation in early childrearing and care of family members who have serious health conditions,the inadequacy of employment policies to accommodate working parents,and the lack of job security for employees who have serious health conditions,a,congress enacted the family and medical leave act in.in this legislation,congress sought to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families,to promote the stability and economic security of families,to promote national interests in preserving family integrity,and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,for the birth or adoption of a child,and for the care of a child,spouse,or parent who has a serious health condition.id.b.the legislature sought to accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.id.b.
the fmla provides covered employees with two types of rights and protections.first,covered employees who take a leave of absence for family or medical reasons qualify for numerous substantive entitlements.specifically,these employees are entitled to a total of workweeks of leave during any period for family and matters,id.a,and have a right to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment.id.a a b.leave taken under the fmla shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.id.a.however,a restored employee is not entitled to any right,benefit,or position of employment other than any right,benefit,or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.id.a b.
these substantive rights,and their accompanying protections,see id.a,are prescriptive,set ting substantive floors for conduct by employers,and creating entitlements for employees.hodgens dynamics,cir quoting diaz fort wayne foundry,cir internal quotation marks omitted amendment in original.see also rice sunrise express,cir explaining that in,the act contains prescriptive protections for employees that are expressed as substantive statutory rights.claims of alleged violations of these prescriptive as interference or entitlement under a,which states that i t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter.
in addition to these prescriptive rights and protections,the act also contains proscriptive provisions that protect employees from discrimination or retaliation for exercising their substantive rights under the fmla.see hodgens,at rice,at.known as retaliation or discrimination claims,causes of action alleging violations of these proscriptive rights arise under a,which states that i t shall be unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.
yashenko asserts that harrah violated both his prescriptive and proscriptive fmla rights.we address each claim in turn.
yashenko principally contends that harrah interfered with the exercise of his fmla rights when,after he took his most recent leave,it refused to restore him to his previous employment position.he offers a legal and a factual argument in support of this contention.
first,yashenko maintains that a creates an absolute entitlement to restoration.this section provides that any person who takes fmla leave 
shall be entitled,on return from such leave a to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or b to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment.
a.however,a b contains limitations providing that nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to any right,benefit,or position of employment other than any right,benefit,or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.
every other circuit to consider an argument like yashenko has concluded that a of the fmla provides an employee only a limited right to restoration to his previous employment position.in particular,an employer can avoid liability under the fmla if it can prove that it would not have retained an employee had the employee not been on fmla leave.throneberry mcgehee desha county,cir.see also hoge honda of am,cir conoshenti pub.serv.gas,cir mcbride citgo petroleum,cir rice,at pca family health plan,cir.
we join our sister circuits in concluding that the fmla does not require an employee to be restored to his prior job after fmla leave if he would have been discharged had he not taken leave.although the statutory language is ambiguous on this point,the secretary of labor has promulgated a clearly resolving the question.
yashenko argues that this regulation is contrary to the plain language of the statute,which he maintains unambiguously entitles every employee returning from fmla leave to restoration to his prior job.emphasizing the phrase restored employee in a,yashenko contends that this limitation on fmla rights applies only after an employee who has been on leave has been restored to his previous employment position according to yashenko,the statutory limitation in a b does not provide a basis for refusing to restore an employee in the first place.thus,yashenko argues that the fmla provides in a an absolute right to restoration,with limitations in a only on a restored employee entitlement to seniority and other benefits accruing during the leave.brief of appellant at.
we do not find yashenko plain language argument persuasive.yashenko reading of a b confining its limitation to employees who have been restored to their previous position of the broad statutory command that n othing in entitles a restored employee to any position of employment to which he would not have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.a b.yashenko failure to consider this statutory command is particularly significant because the plain language of this command clearly contradicts the meaning he ascribes to the phrase restored employee.for example,under yashenko reading,when a poorly performing employee takes fmla leave before his employer can discharge him,the employer must restore this employee to his prior position upon completion of the leave.however,that very restoration gives the violation of a b a benefit the position of employment to which he would not have been entitled absent the leave.
furthermore,yashenko interpretation could lead to anomalous results that we find it unlikely congress would have intended.for instance,an employer who eliminated an entire branch of the business while a covered employee was on leave would,according to yashenko,be required to retain that employee and restore him to a position when he returned to work.such an unqualified entitlement to restoration would give employees on fmla leave greater rights than those provided to employees not on leave,upsetting the careful balance that congress has created between employees need for protected family and medical leave and employers need to protect their legitimate business outcome wholly inconsistent with the purposes and goals of the fmla.
accordingly,yashenko plain language argument fails it does,however,suggest an ambiguity in the fmla that precludes reliance on the language of the statute to resolve the question before us.when a statute is ambiguous,we do not simply impose our own construction on the statute,but rather look to the regulations promulgated pursuant to the legislation to see whether they provide a permissible construction of the statute.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.see also ragsdale wolverine world wide,d.
in this case,the secretary of labor has promulgated a regulation,that addresses the precise question at issue whether there are limitations on an employer obligation to reinstate an employee.the regulation answers this question in the affirmative,explaining that 
a n employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the fmla leave period.an employer must be able to show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment.
id.a.thus,under the secretary construction of the fmla,the act does not create an absolute right to restoration to a previous employment position rather,an employer may deny restoration when it can show that it would have discharged the employee in any event regardless of the leave.
we must defer to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer we may not substitute our own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.chevron,at.considering a in conjunction with the entire statutory scheme congress has enacted,clearly the construction adopted by the secretary of labor reflects a reasonable interpretation of a b.construing a b as qualifying the right to restoration for all employees taking fmla leave,the secretary avoids the anomalous results that would arise under an absolute entitlement scheme.and the secretary construction,unlike yashenko,is entirely compatible with congress efforts to pursue the goals of the fmla in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.b.for these reasons,we find to be a reasonable construction of the fmla,and we defer to the secretary of labor interpretation of a we therefore hold that the fmla provides no absolute right to restoration to a prior employment position.
yashenko alternatively maintains that,even if there is no absolute right to restoration,harrah interfered with his fmla rights because its purported reasons for eliminating his position lacked legitimacy.in response,harrah contends that it eliminated yashenko position for legitimate reasons unrelated to his request for leave,and that it therefore had no obligation to restore yashenko because he would have lost his job even if he had not taken leave.
to avoid liability on an interference claim,an employer that denies restoration to an employee returning from fmla leave must be able to show that the employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested.a.although this regulation clearly places a burden on the employer to come forward with evidence that it would have discharge
