opinion of the court 
this case comes to us under the collateral order doctrine on appeal from the district court order denying the european space agency esa motion to dismiss the claims of oss nokalva,ossn.esa had asserted absolute immunity from suit based on its status as an international organization.the district court held that esa is generally entitled to absolute immunity,but that here it waived such immunity.esa appeals the conclusion that it waived immunity.ossn the finding that esa is entitled to absolute immunity in the first place.ossn br.at.we agree with the district court that esa is not entitled to immunity in this case,but our conclusion is based on reasons other than those relied on by the district court.
a.the parties 
ossn is a new jersey corporation which provides software and services to its customers.esa,a designated international organization with headquarters in germany,is comprised of eighteen member states and was founded to provide for and to promote,for exclusively peaceful purposes,cooperation among european states in space research and technology.esa convention,art.ii a quotation and citation omitted.
a federal statute enacted in,the international organizations immunities act,et ioia,applies to those international organizations which the president designates as entitled to the benefits of the act.see.the ioia provides that designated international organizations,to the extent consistent with the instruments creating them,have the capacity to enter into contracts.id.a i.the ioia also provides that designated organizations enjoy the same immunity from suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign governments,except to the extent that such organizations may expressly waive their immunity for the purpose of any proceedings or by the terms of any contract.id.b.esa predecessor was designated as an international organization by president johnson in.see exec.order,as amended by exec.order.may,superceded by exec.order,as amended by exec.order.june.
the esa convention convention governs esa policies,procedures,and internal rules.a council of representatives council from esa member states oversees its governance.the convention provides that esa is immune from jurisdiction and execution,except 
to the extent that it shall,by decision of the council,have expressly waived such immunity in a particular case the council has the duty to waive this immunity in all cases where reliance upon it would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudicing the interests of the agency.
convention,annex i,art.iv a.
b.the agreements 
esa contracted with ossn to provide it with,among other things,software tools and related proprietary software and information to assist esa in developing its own software.between and,the parties executed four sets of license agreements and corresponding software maintenance agreements agreements 
the first set of agreements,license,dated february,provided that a ny dispute which can not be settled amicably shall be submitted to arbitration.the arbitration proceedings shall take place in princeton new jersey in accordance with the rules of the international chamber of commerce.app.at.a provision consenting to the jurisdiction of the new jersey courts was struck out.the subsequent agreements,though,contained a different forum selection setting forth that each 
agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of new jersey and that esa expressly submits to jurisdiction therein and agrees that any dispute arising out of this agreement shall be subject exclusively to the jurisdiction of new jersey courts or the federal court for the district of new jersey.
app.at.of significance to the underlying dispute between the parties is the provision of the license agreements that stated n either the program s nor this agreement may be assigned,sublicensed or otherwise transferred by esa without prior written consent from oss n app.at see also app.at.
c.the underlying dispute 
based on its contention that esa breached the agreements,ossn filed suit against esa in the superior court of new jersey,somerset county.esa removed ossn action to the united states district court for the district of new jersey under a.the district court had diversity jurisdiction under a.
in its complaint,ossn asserts that esa breached the agreements by distributing ossn software to third parties and failed to compensate ossn for certain software,as well as for the distribution of ossn software to third parties.as a result,ossn filed contract claims as well as claims for unjust enrichment,conversion,negligence,collection of debt payable,and a claim asserting that esa tortiously and unlawfully interfered with ossn customer relationships and prospective economic advantage app.at.
esa moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the ioia grants it absolute immunity.ossn countered first that esa immunity is not absolute and does not bar suit in this case,and alternatively,that even if esa immunity is absolute,it waived such immunity both by the convention and by esa execution of the agreements with the aforementioned forum selection clauses.
d.the district court decision 
the district court denied esa motion to dismiss.the court relied primarily on a decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia,atkinson development bank,which held that the development bank,a financial institution designated as an international organization under the ioia,was entitled to virtually absolute immunity,contingent only upon the state department making an immunity request to the court,quoting verlinden cent.bank of nigeria.following that reasoning,the district court found that esa,like the development bank,is entitled to absolute immunity pursuant to the.at.
nevertheless,the district court continued,a n international organization absolute immunity is subject to limitation by express waiver by the international organization app.at citing mendaro world bank.focusing on the language in the convention stating that the council has the duty to waive immunity in all cases where reliance upon it would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudicing the interests of the agency,app.at quoting convention,annex i,art.iv a,the district court denied esa motion to dismiss on the ground that esa waived its immunity for both the contract and tort claims brought by ossn,app.at.the district court reasoned that although such waivers are disfavored,a waiver of immunity here would provide esa with a corresponding benefit.app.at.such benefit,decided the district court,is the ability to participate in the international commercial marketplace.app.at.esa appeals that decision.ossn cross appeals the finding that esa is entitled to absolute immunity.
although the parties do not raise it,we must address whether we have appellate jurisdiction over the district court denial of esa motion to dismiss.ordinarily,a denial of a motion to dismiss would not be a final decision subject to appeal.see.however,final decisions of the district courts under also include a small set of prejudgment orders that are collateral to the merits of an action and too important to be denied immediate review.mohawk,carpenter,quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.
esa,citing,among other precedents,mitchell forsyth,asserts that a denial of absolute immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.esa br.at.ossn does not dispute our appellate jurisdiction.rather,it and adopts the jurisdictional statement proffered by esa ossn br.at.
in mitchell,the supreme court stated that the denial of a substantial claim of absolute immunity is an order appealable before final judgment,for the essence of absolute immunity is its possessor entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.at citations omitted.the district court held that esa was ordinarily entitled to absolute immunity under the ioia,but decided that in this case esa was subject to the exception to absolute immunity for its express waiver.app.at citing.although this situation does not fall precisely within the holding of mitchell,we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.
to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine a district court order must conclusively determine the disputed question resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.forsyth kleindienst,cir.all three criteria are met here.the district court dual determinations that esa was entitled to absolute immunity under the ioia,and that it waived such immunity in this case,are each important,disputed,and separate from the underlying contract and tort claims.finally,inasmuch as absolute immunity is the right not to be subjected to trial,the determination that esa waived its immunity under the ioia resolved a right that is effectively unreviewable on direct appeal because even were esa to prevail after a trial,it still would have been subject to the process.see id.at.having satisfied ourselves that we have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine and,we note that our review is and turn to discuss the parties disputes over waiver and the scope of immunity under the ioia.
it is an accepted tenet of appellate jurisdiction that we may affirm a judgment on any ground apparent from the record,even if the district court did not reach it.see kabakjian united states,cir citing resolution trust fidelity and deposit of maryland,cir.we can not accept the district court decision that esa is entitled to absolute immunity and therefore need not address whether esa waived its immunity.we believe there is a more generally applicable basis on which to decide the relevant issue,and proceed therefore to discuss ossn 
we begin with an analysis of the ioia.that act provides that international organizations such as esa shall enjoy the same immunity from suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign governments b emphases added.as the text makes clear,congress was legislating in shorthand,referring to another body of law governing the immunity of foreign define the scope of the new immunity for international organizations.atkinson,at.the effect of legislating in shorthand was to link the immunity of international organizations to that of foreign governments.as a reference statute,it raised whether the ioia should be understood to codify for international organizations the extent of immunity that foreign governments enjoyed in when the ioia was enacted,or whether it should be understood to require incorporation of subsequent changes in the law of foreign sovereign immunity.see id.the circuit in atkinson,and the district court in reliance thereon,took the former view,determining that the ioia provided that international organizations were to have indefinitely the same level of virtually absolute immunity as foreign sovereigns enjoyed in changes to foreign sovereign immunity notwithstanding.id.at quoting verlinden,at.
even if the atkinson court were correct that foreign sovereigns always enjoyed absolute immunity in,and we recognize that there may be some question about that proposition it does not follow that subsequent changes to the extent of immunity accorded to foreign sovereigns should not be reflected in the immunity to which international organizations are entitled under the ioia.the language of the ioia suggests the contrary.
the most important change to the immunity of foreign sovereigns occurring since was the enactment of the foreign sovereign immunity act of fsia.see,et.that act affords foreign governments immunity from the jurisdiction of united states courts,see id,except in specific circumstances,including those 
in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication and in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
id.a emphasis added.
in its cross appeal,ossn asserts that the ioia confers the same immunity on international organizations as foreign governments receive under law,which is the restrictive immunity now codified in the fsia.ossn br.at.rules of statutory interpretation demonstrate why we are persuaded that this is so.
as a general rule,courts look to the language of the text to determine statutory meaning.assuming without deciding that the meaning of of the ioia is unclear,we look to certain interpretative rules that function as helpful guides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions.ali fed.bureau of prisons,kennedy,dissenting.
acknowledging that the ioia is a reference statute,the atkinson court noted the potential relevance of the canon of statutory interpretation that a statute which refers to a subject generally adopts the law on the subject as of the time the law is enacted.this will include all the amendments and modifications of the law subsequent to the time the reference statute was enacted.at quoting sutherland statutory construction,at norman singer,ed inserted text omitted.we refer to this as the reference canon.
the atkinson court declined to apply the reference canon,believing that the ioia subject matter and the terms of the enactment in its total environment took precedence.at quoting united states united mine workers of,u,frankfurter,concurring.specifically,the atkinson court put great weight on one provision in the ioia granting the president authority to modify,condition,limit,and even revoke the immunity of a designated organization,calling it the explicit mechanism for monitoring the immunities of designated international organizations id.citing.
that court reasoned that because the president is empowered by the ioia to amend the immunity of international organizations,congress intended that to be the sole manner by which a designated international organization immunity could be altered after.id.it was thus unpersuaded that congress intended the ioia to incorporate subsequent changes to the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments.see id.finding support for its conclusion in a senate report describing president authority as permitting the adjustment or limitation of the privileges in the event that any international organization should engage,for example,in activities of a commercial nature,at internal alterations omitted.
esa points to nothing in the statutory language or legislative history that suggests that the ioia provision delegating authority to the president to alter the immunity of international organizations precludes incorporation of any subsequent change to the immunity of foreign sovereigns indeed,esa acknowledged at oral argument that the state department has expressed support for ossn contention that the same restrictive immunity conferred on foreign governments in the fsia should be applied to esa.the state department view was reflected in a letter,where a state department legal adviser wrote the fsia amended law by codifying a more restrictive theory of immunity subjecting foreign states to suit in courts by virtue of the fsia,international organizations are now subject to the jurisdiction of our courts in respect of their commercial activities letter from roberts owen,legal adviser,state department,to leroy clark,general counsel,equal employment opportunity commission june,emphasis added,reprinted in marian nash,contemporary practice of the united states relating to international law,am.int l.the state department direct pronouncement of ioia immunity is persuasive,particularly because the state department played an important role in drafting the ioia.see ossn br.at citing letter from harold smith,director,bureau of the budget,to james francis byrnes,secretary of state.at 
the position of the united states is certainly worth careful consideration,if not deference.it is of significance that nearly half of the i
