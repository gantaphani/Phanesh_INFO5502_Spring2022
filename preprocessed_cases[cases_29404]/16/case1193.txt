opinion of the court 
this appeal presents us with an issue of first impression involving elections under n.cellnet data systems,sold its intellectual property to schlumberger resource management services,which specifically excluded the assets and liabilities of certain licensing agreements under the terms of the sale.after cellnet rejected those licensing agreements under a of the bankruptcy code,the licensee exercised its rights under n to continue to use the intellectual property,subject to the royalty payments due under the original license.both cellnet,as party to the contract,and schlumberger,as holder of the intellectual property,claim the right to receive the royalty payments.the district court determined that schlumberger had expressly severed the royalties from the intellectual property by the terms of the purchase agreement and that the royalties remained in cellnet estate.although cellnet then rejected the license,the licensee,by operation of n,elected to enforce the license and thus the district court concluded that the royalties due under the revived contract belonged to cellnet.we will affirm.

ii.background 
the essential facts are not in dispute,rather how those facts operate is at issue.in,cellnet,a developer of a wireless data network for meter reading,now in bankruptcy,entered into a joint venture with bechtel enterprises,forming a company called bcn data systems llc.as part of the joint venture,cellnet entered into several licensing agreements with bcn,that provided bcn with an exclusive license to use cellnet intellectual property outside the united states.in return,cellnet received a royalty payment equal to three percent of bcn gross revenues.the license agreements also contained a covenant that cellnet would provide technological support to bcn during the lifetime of the agreements.
three years later,with cellnet on the verge of bankruptcy,appellant,schlumberger,proposed the sale of cellnet assets.schlumberger and cellnet entered into a proposal letter under which schlumberger would purchase all or substantially all of the assets and business operations of cellnet and its subsidiaries.the january,proposal letter also provided that schlumberger would acquire all assets of cellnet free and clear of all liens other than certain liens to be agreed the assets,other than the excluded assets as defined below,used in,held for use in,or related to the business and operations of cellnet.thus,the proposal contemplated that certain assets of cellnet would not be subject to the ultimate purchase agreement.however,the term excluded assets was left open for future agreement by the parties.
cellnet filed for bankruptcy on february.on march,schlumberger and cellnet entered into an asset purchase agreement that mirrored the intent of the proposal letter,in that schlumberger would purchase all of cellnet assets,subject only to certain excluded assets.this time,however,the agreement included language that explained 
at any time prior to march,schlumberger shall be entitled unilaterally to amend this agreement,including without limitation schedules a i stock acquired,b excluded contracts and e excluded assets attached hereto,solely for the purpose of excluding any or all of the stock,assets,liabilities and agreements of cellnet pertaining to cellnet joint venture with bechtel enterprises,or its affiliates,collectively,the bcn assets and liabilities from the stock,assets,liabilities and agreements being acquired or assumed by schlumberger hereunder.
thus,the purchase agreement provided that schlumberger would purchase all of cellnet intellectual property,but would be able to specifically exclude all stocks,assets,liabilities,and agreements pertaining to cellnet venture with bcn pursuant to a letter by counsel on march,schlumberger elected to exercise its right to exclude the bcn assets and liabilities.the letter went on to specifically designate the license agreements between cellnet and bcn as assets and liabilities excluded from the purchase under the heading excluded contracts.
despite excluding the license agreements,schlumberger asserted a right to the royalties under the agreements prior to the approval of the asset purchase agreement by the bankruptcy court.this was based on the belief that cellnet would have to reject the agreements under a as executory contracts that it could not fulfill and that schlumberger would then be entitled to the royalties as owner of the underlying intellectual property.cellnet believed otherwise,but in an effort to complete the sale of its assets,agreed to reject the license agreements and preserve the right of the parties to contest ownership of the royalties.the parties memorialized the decision to reject the license agreements under a in an additional section of the asset purchase agreement.the new section read 
schlumberger has elected not to assume the license and consulting services agreement between cellnet and bcn data systems,bcn,dated january,the ocdb license agreement between cellnet and bcn dated january,collectively,the bcn license agreements.cellnet shall obtain an order from the bankruptcy court pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code rejecting the bcn license agreements.the parties hereto acknowledge that if bcn elects to retain its rights under the bcn license agreements in accordance with section n b of the bankruptcy code,then the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the license agreements,including without limitation any royalty rights thereunder,are disputed by the parties.each party reserves all rights under this agreement with respect to the bcn license agreements,and neither this amendment nor any action taken in connection herewith,including the filing of any modified sale order,shall be deemed to be a waiver or admission of any matter related to the dispute between cellnet and schlumberger regarding the bcn license agreements.
under this agreement,cellnet agreed to reject the license agreements pursuant to a,but both parties acknowledged that a dispute over royalties would remain if bcn elected to retain its rights under n.on may,the bankruptcy court approved the asset purchase agreement with both the addition,as well as additional language that further expressed that the sale did not alter the rights of cellnet,schlumberger,or bcn regarding the license agreements and the royalties due thereunder.
following approval of the sale,cellnet moved to reject the license agreements under a.section a provides that the trustee,subject to the court approval,may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.a.cellnet was permitted to act as the trustee because it was a pursuant to a.the bankruptcy court approved the motion and cellnet informed bcn of its election.bcn,in turn,chose to retain its rights under n.section n provides that i f a trustee rejects an executory contract under which the debtor is a licensor of a right to intellectual property,the licensee under such contract may elect to either terminate the contract or retain certain rights under the license.specifically,the licensee may elect 
to retain its rights including a right to enforce any exclusivity provision of such contract,but excluding any other right under applicable law to specific performance of such contract under such contract and under any agreement supplementary to such contract,to such intellectual property as such rights existed immediately before the case commenced 
n b.if a licensee elects to retain its rights,section n b of the code requires it to make all royalty payments due under such contract for the duration of such contract by its election,and operation of n,bcn was permitted to continue to use the intellectual property originally licensed from cellnet,but was required to pay the royalties due under that license.
rather than remain in a joint venture,cellnet and bechtel agreed that bechtel would acquire all of the assets and liabilities of bcn and make one lump sum payment to cellnet that would encompass the future royalty payments due under the license agreements.the bankruptcy court approved the sale to bechtel,and the negotiated amount of for the future royalties was placed in escrow pending resolution of who was entitled to the royalties.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court found that cellnet was entitled to the royalties.in its opinion,the district court addressed the same arguments now raised before us.schlumberger argued that the asset purchase agreement and its later rejection of the license agreement did not operate to separate the right to the royalties from the underlying ownership of the intellectual property.alternatively,schlumberger asked the district court to look past the original exclusion and find that because it owns the intellectual property and cellnet subsequently rejected the license under a,it has superior rights to the royalties.
in affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court in favor of cellnet,the district court thoroughly analyzed the asset purchase agreement and subsequent exclusion of license agreements.after finding that the purchase agreement was not ambiguous,the district court looked at the express reservation requirement necessary for the separation of royalties from intellectual property and decided that the purchase agreement could only be interpreted to separate the royalties due under the license from the intellectual property.the district court also addressed schlumberger contention that it had superior rights under because it owned the intellectual property and cellnet had rejected the license pursuant to a.the district court agreed with cellnet that the election of bcn pursuant to n renewed certain obligations related to the license.the district court found that under the license agreements,the royalty payments were due to cellnet and that because schlumberger had excluded those license agreements from its purchase,cellnet remains entitled to receive the bcn royalties pursuant to statutory authority even if it rejected the license agreements and is not technically a party to them.in re cellnet data systems.
iii.discussion 
a.the effects of the asset purchase agreement 
schlumberger first argument is that the purchase agreement and letter of march did not operate to sever the royalties from ownership of the intellectual property.both the bankruptcy court and district court disagreed and found that schlumberger had separated ownership from its rights by the plain language of the purchase agreement and march letter amendment.these findings are clearly correct.
on appeal,schlumberger points to two cases from the bankruptcy court that would require an express reservation to separate the components.in chemical foundation,du pont de nemours,the court discussed the effects of assigning a patent on the right to receive royalties for that patent 
yet,as an assignment of a patent,without more,does not transfer to the assignee the right to recover damages or profits for prior infringements,although royalties to accrue and damages and profits for future infringements are incident to and accompany the patent unless separated by express reservation,and as a patentee may after assigning the patents sue and recover for past infringements,it would seem obvious that an assignor of a patent would have like rights with respect to royalties accrued at the time of the assignment.but the right to recover accrued royalties or damages and profits for past infringements may likewise be assigned.
id.at citations omitted.chemical espouses the proposition that royalties were inherent in ownership of a patent and flowed accordingly,although they could be divorced by an express reservation.this idea was expanded in crom cement gun,where the court discussed the ownership of a patent.after quoting much of the above language in chemical,the court found that 
where an assignment conveys all the assignor right,title and interest,if the right to receive royalties is to be severed from the beneficial ownership of the patent and remain in the assignor,there must be an express reservation or some agreement to that effect.i do not think that the mere retention of the license is sufficient to make the severance,particularly where,as in the present case,it is merely for the purpose of protecting a supposed but nonexistent shop right and is in contravention of the understanding of the parties.
id.at emphasis added.
unlike the cases schlumberger cites,the unambiguous purchase agreement and march letter amendment present here did expressly sever the royalties.this conclusion has support in a straightforward reading of the documents.the purchase agreement permitted schlumberger unilaterally to amend this agreement solely for the purpose of excluding any or all of the stock,assets,liabilities and agreements of cellnet pertaining to cellnet joint venture with bechtel enterprises,beyond this language,the purchase agreement also explained that n otwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,the purchaser shall not purchase or acquire,and shall have no rights or liabilities with respect to,any excluded asset.the purchase agreement further defined excluded assets to include all rights of the sellers under any excluded asset and all proceeds from any excluded asset.
these sections must be read in concert with the march,letter,which sought to specify those items excluded from the purchase agreement.in that letter,schlumberger elect ed to amend the asset purchase agreement to exclude the bcn assets and liabilities from the stock,assets,liabilities and agreements of the sellers being acquired or assumed under the asset purchase agreement.the letter went on to specifically enumerate the various license agreements between cellnet and bcn as excluded assets.thus,schlumberger expressly sought to exclude all rights and liabilities under the license agreements,including its rights to all proceeds under those agreements.
schlumberger now attempts to argue that the purchase agreement and march letter both of which it drafted are ambiguous and that extrinsic evidence is necessary to decide whether the purchase agreement contemplated severance of the royalties.this argument is unpersuasive.as the district court correctly noted 
the asset purchase agreement and march letter contain no ambiguities and,by those documents,schlumberger excluded the license agreements from the assets it was acquiring.while schlumberger has argued that,under this pattern of events,it is entitled to receive the royalties from bcn,either as a matter of contract law or under the bankruptcy code,both parties agree the asset purchase agreement and march letter accurately represent the parties intentions.thus,it is only the legal effect of the transaction that schlumberger challenges.
in re cellnet,at.under new york law,ambiguity does not exist simply because the parties urge different interpretations.hugo boss fashions federal insurance,cir.when schlumberger elected to exclude all the proceeds from the bcn license agreements it expressly excluded the royalties from these agreements from the intellectual property it was purchasing.the effect of this exclusion is that the license agreements remain in cellnet estate.
schlumberger also finds fault with the district court holding that b e
