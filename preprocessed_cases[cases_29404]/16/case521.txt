the primary issue raised in this appeal is whether the terms capital reorganization reclassification of stock,as used in a stock warrant,encompass a stock split.asserting the affirmative of this proposition,a warrantholder,paul lohnes,claims that a stock split effectuated by level communications,level triggered an antidilution provision in the warrant that automatically increased the number of shares of stock to which he was entitled.level resists this claim.the district court concluded that the language of the warrant could not reasonably be construed to encompass a stock split and,accordingly,granted level motion for summary judgment.lohnes level communications,d.we affirm.
background 
consistent with the conventional summary judgment praxis,our account of the relevant facts construes the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party here,the appellant.mccarthy airlines,cir.
the appellant is both a trustee and a beneficiary of realty trust the trust.in february of,the trust leased square feet of commercial space to xcom technologies,xcom.the details of the lease transaction need not concern us,save for the fact that,as part of the consideration,xcom issued a stock warrant to the appellant.the parties negotiated the principal terms of the number of shares,the exercise price,and the expiration xcom lawyer then drafted the document.the warrant specified that its exercise would be governed by massachusetts law.it empowered the holder to purchase,at his discretion but within a fixed period,shares of xcom common stock at per share.
unbeknownst to the appellant,xcom days as an independent entity were numbered.shortly after the appellant executed the lease and accepted the warrant,level acquired xcom in a transaction and converted xcom into a subsidiary.as part of this transaction,level agreed to assume xcom warrant obligations and satisfy them with shares of level common stock using a designated share exchange formula.following this paradigm,the appellant unexercised warrant for xcom shares was duly converted into a warrant to purchase shares of level common stock.the appellant does not challenge this conversion which took effect in april of.
the next significant development occurred on july.on that date,level board of directors authorized a stock split,to be effectuated in the form of a stock dividend granting common shareholders one new share of stock for each share held the board set the record date as july.on july,level issued a press release announcing the stock split,but it did not provide the appellant with personalized notice.
the split occurred as scheduled.adhering to generally accepted accounting practices,level adjusted its balance sheet to account for the split by increasing its common stock account in the amount of and reducing by a like amount.these accounting entries had no net effect on either the retained earnings or the net equity of the company.
despite the sharp reduction in the share price that accompanied the stock split,the appellant paid no heed until approximately three months after the record date.when his belated inquiry revealed what had transpired,the appellant contacted level to confirm that the stock split had triggered a share adjustment provision,thus entitling him to shares twice the number of shares specified in the warrant.level demurred on the ground that the warrant did not provide for any share adjustment based upon the occurrence of a stock split effected as a stock dividend.
dissatisfied by level response,the appellant exercised the warrant and received shares of level common stock.he then sued level in a massachusetts state court alleging breach of both the warrant and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.citing diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,level removed the action to the federal district court.see a.the parties then engaged in a protracted period of pretrial discovery.
discovery closed on october.thereafter,level moved for summary judgment.see.the appellant opposition to the motion included,inter alia,the affidavit of jonathan guest,whom the appellant held out to be a securities expert.level moved to strike the guest affidavit.
in due course,the district court ruled that,as a matter of law,a stock split,effected as a stock dividend,did not constitute a capital reorganization as that term was used in the warrant and,accordingly,granted the motion for summary judgment.lohnes,d at.in its rescript,the court neither referred to the guest affidavit nor ruled explicitly on level motion to strike that affidavit.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.methodology of review 
we begin our analysis by outlining the legal framework that governs our review.next,we apply principles of contract interpretation to resolve the appellant contention that the terms capital reorganization and reclassification of stock encompass a stock split implemented as a stock dividend.in this endeavor,our principal task is to determine the ambiguity vel non of the disputed terms.thus,we investigate whether either term is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the appellant.as part of this exercise,we consider and reject the appellant belated attempt to introduce expert testimony bearing on this question.we conclude by addressing the appellant claim that level breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the warrant.
we set out upon this odyssey mindful that the entry of summary judgment is justified only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.once a defendant moves for summary judgment and places in issue the question of whether the plaintiff case is supported by sufficient evidence,the plaintiff must establish the existence of a factual controversy that is both genuine and material.garside osco drug,cir.to carry this burden,the plaintiff must affirmatively point to specific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic dispute.mccarthy,at.
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo.suarez pueblo int l,cir.thus,we are not wed to the district court reasoning but may affirm its order on any independently sufficient ground.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir polyplastics,transconex,cir.in conducting our analysis,this the district scrutinize the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment and indulge all reasonable inferences in that party favor.garside,at.
these principles have a nuanced application when a motion for summary judgment hinges upon an issue of contract interpretation.in that type of situation,we have counseled that 
while an argument between parties about the meaning of a contract is typically an argument about a material fact,summary judgment is not necessarily foreclosed.even if there is ambiguity in the language the evidence presented about the parties intended meaning may be so that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.
allen adage,cir citations omitted.accordingly,summary judgment may lie against a party who fails adequately to support its proposed interpretation of a purportedly ambiguous contract term.see,in re newport plaza,cir fdic singh,cir see also edmonds united states,cir holding that there must be more than one plausible definition of contractual language to create a fact question.
iii.the contract interpretation claims 
a stock warrant is an instrument that grants the warrantholder an option to purchase shares of stock at a fixed price.see black law dict.ed ii james cox et,corporations supp.william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corps.perm.ed see also tribble greer,holding,under massachusetts law,that a stock warrant is a contract by which the corporation gives an irrevocable option to the holder to purchase authorized corporate stock within a period of time at a price and upon terms specified in the contract.against the backdrop of this definition,we turn to the appellant contract interpretation claims.we divide our discussion into seven segments.
applicable legal principles.
principles of contract law govern our analysis.we begin with bedrock the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law within the province of the judge.fashion house,k mart,cir rci servs.div.boston edison,cir.contract language ordinarily is considered ambiguous where an agreement terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.fashion house,at.
a court determination that a contract is or is not ambiguous has important implications.if a court holds that a contract is unambiguously worded,it typically will construe the document based upon the plain and natural meaning of the language contained therein.smart gillette.disability plan,cir hiller submarine signal.for the most part,a court interpreting an unambiguous agreement need not consult extrinsic evidence to impart meaning to its terms.smart,at.a court may,however,consider extrinsic evidence for the limited purpose of evaluating whether a term is ambiguous in the first place,but only if the extrinsic evidence suggests a meaning to which the challenged language is reasonably susceptible.id.at.
if,however,ambiguity is,if the plain meaning of a contract phrase does not spring unambiguously from the page or from the context then the interpretive function involves a question of fact.rci,at.in such cases,a court may consider extrinsic evidence insofar as it sheds light on what the parties intended.robert,spence.
parsing the warrant.
the warrant at issue here contained a antidilution provision which,upon the occurrence of certain described events,automatically adjusted the number of shares to which the warrantholder would be entitled upon exercise of the warrant.in all,share adjustments were engendered by five separate contingencies capital reorganization,reclassification of common stock,merger,consolidation,and sale of all or substantially all the capital stock or assets.however,the warrant did not explicitly provide for an adjustment of shares in the event of a stock split.the appellant attempts to plug this lacuna by equating a stock split with a capital reorganization a reclassification of stock.this argument brings the following paragraph of the antidilution provision into play 
reorganizations and reclassifications.if there shall occur any capital reorganization or reclassification of the common stock,then,as part of any such reorganization or reclassification,lawful provision shall be made so that the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive upon the exercise hereof the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property which such holder would have been entitled to receive if,immediately prior to any such reorganization or reclassification,such holder had held the number of shares of common stock which were then purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant.
building upon the premise that either capital reorganization or reclassification of stock encompasses a stock split,the appellant concludes that level stock split activated the share adjustment mechanism set forth in the quoted paragraph.
as said,the appellant bears the burden of establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.given the circumstances of this case,the only way for him to succeed in this endeavor is by showing that one of the disputed terms capital reorganization or reclassification of stock is shrouded in ambiguity,that is,that reasonable minds plausibly could reach opposite conclusions as to whether either term extended to stock splits.to appraise the success of the appellant efforts,we ponder each term separately.
capital reorganization.
since the warrant does not elaborate upon the meaning of capital reorganization,we turn to other sources.massachusetts law offers no discernible guidance.outside of massachusetts,the closest case is prescott,ball turben ltv.there,the plaintiffs owned debentures,issued pursuant to a trust indenture,which were convertible into common stock of ltv ltv.ltv board ratified a proposal calling for the distribution of all the shares of a ltv subsidiary to ltv common stockholders on a pro rata basis.the distribution stood to reduce ltv stated capital and retained earnings by million and million,respectively.id.at.the plaintiffs argued that the proposed distribution of the subsidiary stock entailed a capital reorganization that triggered an antidilution provision contained in the trust indenture the defendants countered that the was merely a dividend,and,therefore,did not trigger the share adjustment machinery established in the antidilution provision.
the prescott court sided with the defendants.it noted that the only way the defendants could prevail was if the terms of the trust indenture made it unambiguously clear that the parties did not intend to treat the as a capital reorganization.id.at.finding the terms of the trust indenture to be unambiguous,the court ruled that 
the plain language of the trust indenture contemplates an exchange or alteration in the existing ownership form of the interest held by ltv common shareholders before a particular transaction can be classified as a capital reorganization for purposes of the trust indenture.no such exchange or alteration is involved in the proposed distribution of the ltv subsidiary stock.the proposed distribution therefore does not activate the antidilution adjustment provision in the trust indenture.
the district court deemed prescott dispositive,see lohnes,d at,and indeed,prescott bears several similarities to the case at bar.in neither instance was the term capital reorganization defined in the controlling document or in the applicable state law.moreover,the prescott court was required to apply principles of contract law to construe the letter of the controlling document and determine whether a share adjustment provision designed to prevent dilution was triggered by a stock dividend.finally,neither case involved an exchange of existing shares rather,the stock split orchestrated by level was effected by distributing additional shares to its existing shareholders in much the same manner that shares in the subsidiary were distributed to ltv stockholders.
despite these similarities,we stop short of endorsing the district court declaration that prescott should be given controlling effect.the prescott court,finding cases from other jurisdictions and general financial terminology to be of little help,ultimately restricted its analysis to the four corners of the trust indenture there at issue.at.in contrast,we consider ourselves bound to grapple with the intricacies of massachusetts law and,in performing that task,to search for guidance in case law from other courts,the statutes of foreign jurisdictions,and common financial of which are appropriate benchmarks for gauging the reasonableness vel non of the appellant sweeping definition of capital reorganization.thus,we treat prescott as suggestive evidence that stock splits do not constitute capital reorganizations,but refrain from according it decretory significance.
also of interest is wood coastal states gas.there,a corporation preferred shareholders challenged a settlement that required the parent corporation,inter alia,to spin off a subsidiary and distribute a portion of the subsidiary stock to the parent company common shareholders.id.at.the preferred shareholders argued that the constituted a recapitalization,thereby triggering an antidilution adjustment in their stock certificates.the court rejected this argument,holding that the settlement plan did not constitute a recapitalization.id.at.like prescott,this case suggests that the term capital reorganization is not so elastic as the appellant claims,but it does not fully answer the question that we must decide.
moving beyond the case law the meaning of the term capital reorganization in common legal parlance seemingly belies the appellant ambitious definition.the preeminent legal lexicon defines reorganization,in pertinent part,as a g eneral term describing corporate amalgamations or readjustments occurring,for example,when one corporation acquires another in a merger or acquisition,a single corporation divides into two or more entities,or a corporation makes a substantial change in its capital structure.black law dict.ed.the first two prongs of this definition are clearly inapposite here.that leaves only the question of whether a stock split entails a substantial change in a corporation capital structure.we think not.
first and foremost,the accounting mechanics that accompany a stock split are mere window dressing.see generally robert anthony james reece,accounting principles ed.to be sure,a stock split effected through the distribution of shares in the form of a stock dividend results in an increase in the common stock at par account and an offsetting decrease in additional capital,but this subtle set of entries has no effect on total shareholder equity or on any other substantive aspect of the balance sheet.see fasb,accounting research bulletin see also iii cox,supra a share does not,however,make any representations as to any accumulation of earnings or surplus or involve any increase of the legal capital.because a stock split does not entail a substantial change in a corporation capital structure,the unelaborated term capital reorganization can not plausibly include a stock split effected as a stock dividend.
reclassification of stock.
we turn next to the phrase reclassification of stock.two massachusetts cases seem worthy of mention.in the first,a corporation took advantage of a new statute authorizing the issuance of preferred stock and amended its charter to divide its previously undifferentiated stock into common and preferred shares.page whittenton.the massachusetts supreme judicial court approved the corporation actions.it held that a corporation could classify stock into common and preferred shares providing preferred shareholders with cumulative dividends and a liquidation preference so long as that classification was effected through a charter amendment.id.at.although page uses the verb classify,we view what transpired as a reclassification.see xiii oxford english dict.ed defining reclassify as t o classify again to alter the classification of.
in boston safe deposit trust state tax comm n,the court considered the tax implications of a reclassification of stock.the reclassification in question involved the partial substitution of redeemable,convertible,cumulative,nonvoting shares for nonredeemable,nonconvertible,noncumulative,voting shares.id.at.the court held that the reclassification constituted a taxable event under massachusetts law.id.at.
our reading of the massachusetts cases leads us to conclude that the sine qua non of a reclassification of stock is the modification of existing shares into something fundamentally different.at the end of the day,the stockholders in page held a different class of shares,while the stockholders in boston safe gained some privileges while losing the right to vote.thus,page and boston safe,respectively,illustrate two ways in which a security can be altered fundamentally a by changing the class of stock,or b by modifying important rights or preferences linked to stock.
stock splits effected as stock dividends do not entail any such fundamental alteration of the character of an existing security.for example,level stock split in no way altered its shareholders proportionate ownership interests,varied the class of securities held,or revised any of the attributes associated with the stock.what is more,the stock split did not have a meaningful impact on either the corporation balance sheet or capital structure.for those reasons,we perceive no principled basis on which to stretch the definition of reclassification of stock to encompass a stock split.
a rule promulgated by the securities and exchange commission confirms our intuition.this rule extends the protections of the securities act of to shareholders who are offered securities in a business combination and are required to decide whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security.sec rule,preliminary note.while the rule extends to reclassifications of stock,it explicitly exempts stock splits from the reclassification rubric.see sec rule.the upshot of this is unmistakable the sec does not consider shares received in conjunction with a stock split to constitute a new or different security.
to cinch matters,while no massachusetts statute defines the term reclassification of stock,two states have enacted pertinent statutes.under louisiana law,a reclassification of stock is defined as 
amendment of the articles to change the authorized number of shares of an existing class or series to authorize shares of a new class or series to change the designation,par value including change of shares to shares without par value or vice versa,preferences,limitations or relative rights,including cancellation or modification of the right to receive accumulated dividends which have not been declared,or variations in relative rights,of the issued,and authorized but unissued,shares of any existing class or series or to change the issued shares of any existing class or series into a greater or smaller number of shares of the same class or series subject to such changes as the reclassification may make in the designation,par value,preferences,limitations or relative rights or variations in relative rights,thereof or of another class or series,and to cancel any issued shares in connection with a reduction in the number thereof.
ann.west.the stock split effected by level implicates none of the categories established by the louisiana legislature 
pennsylvania statutory definition goes one step further it expressly provides that the term reclassification excludes a stock dividend or split effected by distribution of the company own previously authorized shares pro rata to the holders of shares of the same or any other class or series pursuant to action solely of the board of directors.con.stat.ann.west.
although this case must be decided under massachusetts law,we regard these statutes and rules as relevant and informative.ambrose new engl.ass of schs,cir noting that,in exercising diversity jurisdiction,a federal court should consult case law from other jurisdictions when the forum state highest court has not yet spoken.moreover,they afford enlightenment as to common usage and as to what a reasonable person would or would not consider to be encompassed within the ambit of a particular term.so viewed,these statutes and rules reinforce our intuition that the term reclassification of stock does not encompass a stock split 
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.since level declaration of a stock split did not authorize a new class of stock,change the shareholders proportionate ownership,alter the par value of the shares,or otherwise modify shareholders voting rights or preferences,that action did not constitute a reclassification of stock.
e.the overall plan of reorganization.
the appellant also makes a conclusory claim that the july stock split was part and parcel of a comprehensive corporate reorganization and,thus,animated the warrant antidilution provision.he did very little to develop this claim below,and he has not remedied that shortfall on appeal.for that reason,we deem the claim abandoned.see united states zannino,cir explaining that,to preserve a point for appellate review,i t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work.
in any event,the claim lacks merit.as best we can understand it,the appellant hypothesizes that the stock split was an offshoot of a corporate reorganization launched by level in.in that year,level shifted direction away from construction and mining activities in order to pursue its interests in communications and business services.between august and may,the company dramatically modified its capital structure by splitting off its construction business and eliminating two series of stock.although none of these transactions involved xcom or otherwise impacted the appellant,he implies that the july
