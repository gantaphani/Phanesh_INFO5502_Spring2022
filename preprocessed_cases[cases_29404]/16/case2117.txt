this is an appeal from a decision of the united states tax court holding that certain sums received by the,vision information services,vision or the taxpayer,during tax years and were license fees and therefore taxable as ordinary income under the internal revenue code.the legal issue presented in this case is whether the agreement between the taxpayer and twentieth century fox home entertainment foxvideo was a sale of intellectual property and thus a capital transaction,or rather a license permitting foxvideo to use vision software solution.upon review,we conclude that the agreement was an outsourcing arrangement and software license and therefore the tax court did not err in finding the payments to vision were taxable as ordinary income.accordingly,we affirm the tax court judgment.
