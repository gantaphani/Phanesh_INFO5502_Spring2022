appellant versai management corporation versai appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees clarendon america insurance company clarendon and employers fire insurance efic on versai contract claims for unpaid insurance proceeds for property damage,business interruption,replacement costs,and code compliance upgrades and versai claims that efic and clarendon violated louisiana law by failing to promptly settle claims and by misrepresenting the terms of their policies.versai also asks this court to find that the district court abused its discretion by denying versai motion to extend the deadline for filing expert reports.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
versai manages the versailles arms apartments in new orleans.versailles arms apartments are federally subsidized through the department of housing and urban development.the apartments consist of fifty residential buildings,each consisting of four apartments and four apartments.of the buildings suffered extensive damage during hurricane katrina during august of and were rendered uninhabitable until the property was repaired.the fiftieth building was destroyed in a natural gas explosion during the storm.following the disaster,versai notified its insurers of the hurricane damage to the property and submitted claims with the assistance of its retained private adjusters and contractors.
in february of,versai retained scc ventures,to conduct repairs on the property.that month,scc ventures estimated that the repairs would cost.lloyds of london,which provided million in all risk property insurance,paid its policy limits in full in april of.versai flood insurance provider,the standard fire insurance company,was originally party to this suit but settled its claims with versai for approximately million.the remaining defendants,clarendon and efic,together provided insurance on the apartments in excess of the million provided by lloyds,and this coverage was limited to a maximum recovery of.the clarendon and efic policies follow the same terms of the underlying lloyds policy,but provided excess coverage once the lloyds insurance limits were met.
versai promptly notified all of its insurers about the losses and damage sustained to the versailles arms apartments after hurricane katrina.agents and adjusters for the insurers inspected the property throughout and.clarendon and efic joint adjuster,bill adams of mclarens young international,submitted a number of reports to efic and clarendon throughout early.on may,adams submitted a report stating that the companies owed versai an undisputed sum of each,and an proof of loss for this amount was then submitted.clarendon issued its check for on july,and efic issued its check for the same amount on august.on august,versai presented efic and claredon with a sworn statement in proof of loss,which was not prepared by the insurance companies,for the amount of each.the companies did not submit additional payment.
in september of,the original estimate of the cost to repair the premises increased by approximately ten million dollars to include the costs of compliance with updated building codes,which would require additional repairs.no payments for code compliance were rendered.in december of,clarendon and efic each issued checks to mark carrier,versai public adjuster,for for additional items of physical damage and business interruption.these checks were made payable to versai,versai mortgage holder,and recov.recovery management the adjusting business carrier owned.versai contends that carrier forged the requisite endorsements and stole the money.by the end of,the only completed repairs to the versailles arms apartments consisted of demolishing portions of the property,gutting certain areas,parts of the structure,and repairing some of the roofing.versai entered into a contract to sell the apartments to peltier gardens,but the deal ultimately fell through.versai has since retained ownership of the apartments.
on august,versai filed suit against clarendon and efic,alleging that clarendon and efic had not paid the full amount due under the excess policies for property damage,business interruption loss,replacement costs,and code compliance upgrades.versai claimed that these failures amounted to breaches of contract,breaches of the duties of good faith and fair dealing,and violations of louisiana

versai contends it produced evidence showing a genuine issue of material fact on its claims against the insurers for property loss,business interruption loss,housing code compliance costs,and replacement costs.we review these claims individually.
versai challenges the district court grant of summary judgment for efic and clarendon with respect to its property loss claims.according to versai,efic and clarendon owe a total of approximately million for property amount set out in versai august,proofs of loss sent to efic and clarendon.the district court found that versai had presented no evidence to show that it was entitled to additional compensation beyond the approximately million it had already received from efic and clarendon because versai failed to support its august proofs of loss with documentation versai failed to submit timely expert reports to support its claims and versai argument was estopped because a deposition from its company president,melanie meyer,contradicted its claim for relief.
versai argues that the district court was not at liberty to grant summary judgment based on its failure to support its august proofs of loss with additional documentation where the insurance policy created no such obligation.we agree.versai insurance policies with clarendon and efic contained a requirement for submitting a proof of loss to obtain insurance payments.the section of the excess property conditions policy,entitled proof of loss,is as follows 
the insured shall file with this company,or its agent,within ninety days from the date of discovery of the loss occurrence,a proof of loss signed and sworn to by the insured,stating to the best knowledge and belief of the insured 
a the interest of the insured and of all the others in the property affected 
b the value of each item thereof and the amount of loss or damage thereto 
c all encumbrances thereon 
d all other contracts of insurance,whether valid or not,covering any of the property affected,and shall furnish a copy of all the descriptions and schedules in all such insurance policies,if required.
the plain reading of this section reveals no requirement for additional documentation to support a proof of loss.despite their failure at oral argument to cite any language from the policy imposing such a requirement,efic and clarendon urge us to read this requirement into the policy because all similar insurance policies require documentation.if this is so,their policy breaks the mold.we will not read in such a requirement where none exists.
as the policy language does not preclude recovery,we must determine whether versai submitted evidence demonstrating its entitlement to additional payment for property damage which could permit a reasonable jury to find in versai favor.see anderson liberty lobby.we find that the affidavits from meyer and mark mueller,the ceo of scc ventures,were sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.our circuit has held that expert testimony is essential for proving the costs of reconstruction,betzel state farm lloyds,cir,but lay witnesses may properly testify to the work that has been performed on the property thus far and which projects have been funded by the proceeds versai has already received.likewise,versai claim is not foreclosed by meyer deposition testimony,in which she indicated versai had no further claims against efic and clarendon.versai contends that the deposition testimony was based on information she received from carrier,and it was taken before meyer discovered that carrier stole two checks from the insurers,which were to be paid to versai.this situation suggests the presence of arguable factual contradictions that must be resolved by a fact finder,an exercise proscribed at the summary judgment stage of the case.carroll metro.ins.annuity,cir.therefore,summary judgment was unwarranted.
versai also disputes the district court grant of summary judgment on its claim for additional payment for business interruption losses.versai argues that it never received any portion of the alleged suffered in business interruption losses following the destruction of the versailles arms apartments in hurricane katrina the district court granted summary judgment for efic and clarendon on the basis that versai had already been compensated for business interruption losses by the two checks,in the amount of each,which were given to carrier.because the propriety of the court grant of summary judgment can be resolved on the basis of the additional losses to the apartments,we need not address the question of whether versai may recoup from efic and clarendon the amount of the checks paid to carrier.
versai argues that its affidavits,particularly that of company president melanie meyer,are sufficient to support its claims for business interruption losses.this court has held that meyer,as the owner of a business,may properly testify to the value of that business.lacombe,cir see united states acres of land,cir.the federal rules of evidence,which typically apply in diversity jurisdiction cases,confirm that meyer position as company president permits her a broader range of testimony than a traditional lay witness would possess when testifying to matters concerning versai business.see.a m research found.magna,cir dijo,hilton hotels,cir accord.advisory committee note on the amendments.meyer testified that versai has been unoccupied since the hurricane and the losses in income as a result of the wind damage to the property easily exceed million dollars,an amount greater than the amount paid to carrier.meyer affidavit also distinguishes between the business losses sustained on the second floor,at least a portion of which was paid to carrier,and the alleged losses on the first floor,which have not been paid.these statements are sufficient to raise an issue of material fact suggesting that versai was entitled to compensation for losses on the apartments,even if meyer affidavit is insufficient to support the full million versai seeks.see celotex corp,at see also.e.
versai contests the district court grant of summary judgment on its claim for payment for the costs of bringing the versailles arms apartments into compliance with current building codes.the district court granted summary judgment for efic and clarendon because versai had not produced any evidence showing it had incurred such prerequisite to payment under the terms of the insurance contract.
versai insurance policy includes a municipal ordinance extension covering regulatory compliance costs incurred because of property damage from an event such as hurricane katrina.when certain preconditions are met,the policy then insures costs actually and necessarily incurred in a the demolition and clearing of the site of the undamaged portion of the insured building,and b reconstructing the building to conform with the law or ordinance.emphasis added.versai concedes that the repairs to the versailles arms apartments have not been completed,and it fails to identify any costs which have already been incurred.although versai may be able to show anticipated costs of complying with current building codes,versai insurance policy is explicit versai is not entitled to costs of compliance until after it has incurred the expenses of code compliance.where the language of an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous,courts must enforce it as it is written.reynolds select props,so d.thus,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for efic and clarendon on this claim.
versai claim for replacement costs likewise was properly dismissed because versai has not completed repairs on its property as required by the insurance policy.the lloyds insurance policy insured the versailles arms apartments property against risks of direct physical loss or damage,and the policy basis of valuation hinges on versai replacement efforts.the replacement cost endorsement provision of the insurance policy states,in subparagraph d,that u ntil replacement has been effected the amount of liability under this policy in respect of loss shall be limited to actual cash value at the time of loss.subparagraph c requires versai to execute this replacement with due diligence and dispatch.the district court interpreted these provisions to mean that t he insured can not recover replacement costs until such time as repairs are actually made.
versai asks the court to find that the insurers duties to pay replacement costs is triggered when versai demonstrates readiness to enact replacements on the property.the language of the contract does not support this interpretation.versai also argues that the district court improperly concluded that versai had sold its property to another entity,and was not going to repair the property.versai is correct that the proposed sale of the property to peltier gardens fell through.nevertheless,versai is not entitled to payment because it has not made the requisite replacements to be entitled to reimbursement.
the district court also granted summary judgment to efic and clarendon on versai claims for relief under louisiana revised statutes sections and these statutes vest the insurer with an affirmative duty to adjust claims fairly and promptly and to make a reasonable effort to settle claims with the insured.ann.a accord.ann.sections b and b penalize insurers for failing to pay claims within thirty and sixty days,respectively,after receiving satisfactory proof of loss,but only if such failure is arbitrary,capricious,or without probable cause.an insurer also bears an affirmative duty to disclose coverages to insured parties,and section b defines an insurer m isrepresent ation of pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to any coverages at issue as a breach of the insurer duty of good faith and fair dealing.ann.b.
versai argues that it has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether efic and clarendon acted in bad faith in failing to pay claims by the deadlines set out in sections b b after receiving satisfactory proofs of loss and violated section b when their independent adjuster,bill adams,made misrepresentations to versai concerning the availability of code upgrade coverage.we address these claims in turn.
failure to pay within the statutorily prescribed time period 
to prove that efic and clarendon breached their insurers duties to timely pay versai claims,versai must show that the insurer has received satisfactory proof of loss,the insurer fails to tender payment within thirty days of receipt thereof,and the insurer failure to pay is arbitrary,capricious,or without probable cause.bag
