this complicated case involves a merger agreement in which fifth third guaranteed that the participants in suburban bancorporation employee benefit plan would receive funds from fifth third general assets if certain conditions were met.joseph hutchison,suing on behalf of a class of former suburban employees,claims that fifth third promised to abide by the terms of the merger agreement,induced class members to vote their shares in favor of the merger,and then breached its contract by refusing to allocate general funds to class members.fifth third argues that the employee retirement income security act,et,preempts hutchison state law breach of contract claim because the claim relates to the administration of the erisa benefit plan,and,in the alternative,that fifth third did not breach its contract.the district court properly held that erisa preempts the breach of contract claim and dismissed the claim.we therefore affirm.
in,suburban federal savings bank and fifth third negotiated a merger affiliation agreement between the two companies.the affiliation agreement contained language covering suburban employee stock ownership plan esop because the esop held shares of suburban.see generally b iv.hutchison and other members of the proposed class were participants in the esop.after reading the representations contained in of the affiliation agreement,class members voted the esop suburban shares in favor of the merger.the two companies merged in.
section of the affiliation agreement began by discussing how class members could obtain funds from the esop.the,section required suburban to develop a written description and timetable discussing funding,amending,and terminating the esop before class members could obtain the plan funds.because suburban and fifth third were concerned about the tax implications associated with distributing esop funds prematurely,the affiliation agreement also required suburban to obtain from the irs a determination that the esop,as amended,satisfied relevant tai provisions class members could not receive any funds until the irs made such a determination finally,the section provided that i n connection with the resolution of the esop,the parties agree they intend that,to the extent not prohibited by applicable law,the esop shall be maintained through the date of its final termination for the exclusive benefit of individuals who had become esop participants on or before the effective time,namely the class members.
section then included a contingency plan,the meaning of which is in dispute.it stated that,if the parties agreed in good faith that allocating the esop shares would violate certain irs provisions,suburban would apply to the irs for approval allowing esop funds to either revert to fifth third or be transferred to an employee benefit plan of fifth third.the next sentence reads,if and only if the irs approves such a transaction for reverting or transferring the funds,or fifth third otherwise proceeds with the transaction without irs approval,fifth third will pay class members out of its corporate assets and not plan assets the amount of money in the esop at the time of the merger,minus administrative costs 
suburban began,but did not complete,the steps outlined in section to distribute esop funds to class members.first,it adopted a plan amendment that limited participation in the esop to members of the current class.second,suburban proposed,and fifth third approved,a schedule to accelerate termination of the esop.suburban,however,never obtained the necessary irs determination letter,and class members,as a result,did not receive esop funds.
after the merger,fifth third became the successor esop sponsor and trustee and took actions to ensure that class members could no longer recover funds from the esop.in two separate plan amendments,fifth third included fifth third employees in the esop and then retroactively excluded class members from the esop.in the second plan amendment,fifth third distributed the esop funds to fifth third employees,thereby terminating the esop.thus,esop funds did not go to class members,whom fifth third excluded from the esop instead,the funds went to fifth third employees who were not members of the suburban esop.
hutchison brought a civil action in the ohio court of common pleas on october,raising three types of claims.the first group of claims related to fifth third alleged misrepresentations to class members before they voted in favor of the merger,claims of breach of contract,intentional misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.the second group of claims related to fifth third alleged taking of class members assets from the esop,conversion,unjust enrichment,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.finally,hutchison included an erisa claim against fifth third.
on november,fifth third removed the case to the district court for the southern district of ohio,pursuant to,because the complaint contained an erisa claim.hutchison sought to dismiss the erisa claim,and moved to remand the case to state court.on august,the district court denied the remand request,finding that erisa preempted hutchison state law claims.the district court then dismissed the state law claims on march,because of erisa preemption,a decision that it reaffirmed on october.on april,hutchison filed an amended complaint,alleging only an erisa violation.on october,the district court dismissed hutchison remaining erisa claim,finding that fifth third did not breach any fiduciary duties owed to class members.
in its august,order,the district court held that erisa preempted hutchison claim because hutchison sought plan benefits and it will be necessary to consult the plan document in order to make an appropriate distribution of any recovery.citing cromwell hca,cir,the district court also noted that,as a legal matter,t he scope of erisa preemption is broad and subsumes virtually any state law claim which relates to an employee benefit plan,including those raised by hutchison.in its october,order,the district court focused on the relationship between the parties.it noted that p laintiffs are beneficiaries of the esop plan and their breach of contract claim is against the traditional plan entities.finally,the district court concluded that this court holding in poni required erisa preemption only in cases of claims against a third party.see,miami valley pension,cir poni.the district court held that erisa preempted because fifth third,unlike the third party in poni,was a fiduciary 
on october,hutchison filed his notice of appeal,challenging all four district court orders on appeal,the parties fundamentally disagree over the nature of the affiliation agreement.hutchison argues that fifth third obligations arose before class members and fifth third had a relationship and that fifth third actions induced class members to vote in favor of the merger.as a result,hutchison argues,erisa does not preempt the breach of contract claim.fifth third,on the other hand,describes the nature of the affiliation agreement differently.fifth third argues that class members could have challenged fifth third plan amendment under erisa and that its legal duty arose under the esop.as a result,fifth third argues that erisa preempts hutchison claims.
affirmance is required because plaintiffs seek damages for the actions of an erisa fiduciary,based on an alleged contract that the fiduciary entered into before it became a fiduciary with respect to plaintiffs.erisa preempts in that situation because the contract claim would bind fiduciaries to particular choices,thereby functioning as a regulation of the erisa plan.as discussed in further detail below,this conclusion is supported by the supreme court decision in aetna health,davila,d,and is consistent with case law from this circuit.see poni,at briscoe fine,cir.
as in davila,erisa limits plaintiffs ability to challenge a plan administrator decision regarding benefits.in davila,plaintiffs relied on a texas statute that held managed care entities liable for damages proximately caused by an entity failure to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions.at.quoting.civ.prac.
