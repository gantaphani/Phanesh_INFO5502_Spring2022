the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissed the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.wise am.life ins,wl,at.the district court found that,taking all the facts alleged in the complaint as true and making all inferences in favor of plaintiff,there was no contract formed for insurance because there is no indication in any of the documents of american general intent to be bound prior to delivery of the policy,and no consideration was offered by wise from which liability might be inferred up to that point.id.at.the district court determined that the life insurance policy unambiguously required the payment of the premium before any insurance coverage was to take effect,and that this provision was not waived by american general.id.at.the district court reasoned that,because wise never accepted the offer of the policy by paying consideration in the form of the premium,there was no insurance in effect at the time of his death.id.based on this finding,the district court dismissed all of plaintiff claims.id.at.plaintiff now appeals.
ii.analysis 
a.there was no contractual obligation to provide coverage under the american general policy 
we must first determine whether american general was contractually obligated to provide life insurance coverage for wise on the date of his death under pennsylvania law,the creation of an insurance contract requires an offer,an acceptance,and a meeting of the minds.see moser donegal conoy mut.fire ins.plaintiff argues that wise insurance application constituted an offer,which american general accepted as of march,by issuing the policy.plaintiff argues that american general was therefore contractually obligated to provide insurance coverage to wise as of the march,date of issue.
the application for insurance and the documents accompanying the policy explicitly stated that no coverage would be in effect until and unless wise paid the premium while he remained in good health under pennsylvania law,this constitutes a valid requirement that must be fulfilled before coverage begins see landy philadelphia life ins,see also brodsky equitable life assurance soc y of the,wl,at,vacated on other grounds,wl,corpus juris secundum insurance a stipulation or agreement by the company and applicant that a policy of life insurance shall not take effect or be binding on the company unless the first premium is paid while the applicant is alive or in good or sound health is valid and will be given effect according to its terms it is a condition precedent to liability on the part of the company.neither party was bound by the insurance contract until wise tendered the premium payment while in good health wise was free
