in this diversity action,dell computer corporation dell sued sixto rodriguez,the former managing director and chief executive officer of dell operations in spain,asserting various causes of action based on several contracts between the parties.rodriguez,also seeking damages for breach of the agreements.after a jury returned a verdict in favor of dell for approximately million,the district court entered judgment for dell in that amount.rodriguez timely appealed,asserting several points of error.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and reverse and remand in part.
facts proceedings 
the relationship and the underlying contracts 
in,dell hired rodriguez as the managing director and chief executive officer of dell operations in spain.the parties executed an employment contract that entitled rodriguez to severance benefits if dell should terminate his employment without cause during the course of rodriguez employment,dell issued stock options to him under various stock option agreements soas.
in,dell granted rodriguez a special restricted soa,called the penny share agreement psa.unlike other traditional soas that dell granted to rodriguez,the psa entitled rodriguez to purchase dell stock for cents per share,regardless of the market price of the stock at the time he exercised the option.the psa specified that after rodriguez options vested and he exercised them,dell would withhold of the exercised shares for a period of two years only at the end of this two year period would rodriguez receive the stock certificates for those shares.further,a termination provision required rodriguez to return any profits realized from the psa if he breached his employment agreement or violated specified provisions of the psa 
on february,rodriguez and dell executed a separation agreement that specified the terms and conditions of rodriguez termination and severance from employment by dell.part a of the separation agreement,titled stock option agreements,set out rodriguez amended rights regarding the penny share agreement,a june soa,and his deferred bonus stock.in part b of the separation agreement,titled transition arrangements,dell agreed to retain rodriguez as an unpaid honorary consultant through june.although the separation agreement immediately relieved rodriguez of his management duties,his formal resignation was not to become effective until june,at which time his role as honorary consultant would commence.this time frame was adopted to allow additional stock options to vest under the psa and under one of rodriguez other soas.
as honorary consultant,rodriguez was to promote and develop dell positive image in the spanish market in particular,and as reasonably requested by dell from time to time,rodriguez would help enhance specific customer relationships.under the sole discretion clause,however,dell retained the discretion to terminate rodriguez under particular circumstances 
dell may terminate these transition agreements with immediate effect 
i if you are in breach of any of your obligations hereunder or 
ii if dell has determined,in dell sole discretion,that your conduct is creating,or has created,a negative impact on dell or on dell reputation in the spanish market and dell has provided you with written notice of such negative impact.
if dell should terminate the transition agreements,it could withhold stock to which rodriguez would otherwise have been entitled 
dell has the right to withhold any stock which would otherwise be released to you as set out in a above,in the event of termination pursuant to above.
at the time that the parties executed the separation agreement,rodriguez was unaware that dell had commenced an internal investigation into the operations in spain.
dell investigates suspicious deals involving rodriguez and terminates him 
on may,three months after the parties signed the separation agreement but almost two months before its effective date,dell wrote to rodriguez informing him that dell had been conducting a examination of dell spain,and that it revealed specific irregularities which appear to have been within rodriguez responsibility.the may letter identified eight separate irregularities under investigation.
dell uncovered these improprieties when it began negotiating the severance of bienvenido valero,the finance manager for dell operation in spain.in the course of those negotiations,valero produced an employment contract dated the valero contract,purportedly signed by rodriguez,granting valero a million golden parachute in the event he was terminated.dell had not previously seen the valero contract.before valero produced a copy of that agreement,dell was aware of only a standard employment agreement of indefinite duration dated june,which entitled valero to only a limited severance as required under spanish law when dell became suspicious of the authenticity of the valero contract and asked rodriguez to authenticate his signature on it,rodriguez responded by stating only,i do know.it a photocopy.dell commissioned two handwriting experts to analyze the signatures on the valero contract they concluded that the document was signed in,not as indicated by its date.
dell then initiated a thorough audit of rodriguez activities and learned that he had engaged in several questionable financial transactions with friends and family members in contravention of dell policies and practices.included in these suspect transactions were payments of some to an employment agency called powerline.after further investigation,dell learned that these payments were supposedly made for the services of rodriguez.dell also discovered that rodriguez had authorized payments of approximately per month to a company called poas for salary and office rent in the canary islands,where dell did not maintain an office.it turned out that the managing director of poas was rodriguez brother.similarly,dell determined that rodriguez had authorized installation and maintenance payments of about to y asociados.when dell questioned rodriguez about the y asociados payments,however,he explained that they were for consultancy and lobbying commissions.
in light of these and other dubious transactions,dell informed rodriguez in the may letter that all of his legal entitlements from dell were being suspended pending an evidentiary hearing and review by dell ethics committee.rodriguez disputed all of dell allegations and met with its representative to explain how the transactions were legitimate and justified.
in june,after reviewing rodriguez conduct,dell ethics committee concluded that he had breached his obligations to dell.in a letter dated june,dell informed rodriguez that the ethics committee had found unanimously that the evidence presented justified the termination of all legal relationships between the parties and further recommended the termination of the contractual relationship between rodriguez and dell espana 
rodriguez exercises his stock options,and dell initiates criminal and civil proceedings in spain 
two days after receiving dell june letter,rodriguez exercised numerous stock options under various soas,with the aggregate value of approximately million.on july,july,and july,rodriguez called his broker and exercised additional options worth some,and,respectively.in all,rodriguez realized profits of on the exercise of these stock options.
in the fall of,dell initiated criminal proceedings against rodriguez in spain but the spanish court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the criminal charge under spanish law.dell twice appealed that adverse decision in the spanish courts without success.next,dell brought a civil suit against rodriguez in spain to recover the losses that dell sustained as a result of rodriguez allegedly improper exercise of the stock options.in december,though,dell voluntarily dismissed this spanish civil suit on march,dell filed the instant action.
proceedings 
after failing in the spanish courts,dell sued rodriguez in texas state court.rodriguez removed the action to district court on grounds of diversity of citizenship.dell complaint asserted various causes of action,including fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of the separation agreement,and breach of the penny share agreement.rodriguez,also alleging breach of the separation agreement by virtue of dell refusal to release particular soas,as well as claims grounded in replevin,defamation,abuse of process,and malicious prosecution.
in february,dell filed a motion for summary judgment on rodriguez counterclaims.the district court granted summary judgment against rodriguez on all his counterclaims except those for breach of contract.dell also filed a motion in limine to preclude rodriguez and his counsel from making any reference at trial to parol evidence to interpret the february,separation agreement,which motion the district court granted.
in march,the parties remaining claims were tried to a jury.during the trial,the district court granted rodriguez motion for judgment as a matter of law on dell fraud claim but denied all his and dell other motions for judgment as a matter of law.the jury returned a verdict in dell favor on each of dell contract claims and against rodriguez on his breach of contract counterclaim.dell was awarded approximately million for breach of the separation agreement and almost for breach of the penny share agreement.the following month,the district court entered judgment on the verdict in favor of dell for,plus interest and costs.rodriguez filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial,which was denied.
dell next filed a motion for attorney fees under of the texas civil practice and remedies code the district court initially denied this motion,finding inadequate documentary support.dell then filed a motion for reconsideration together with additional documentation supporting its attorney fees request,which the district court granted.rodriguez timely filed his notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
rodriguez advances several claims on appeal we must determine whether the sole discretion clause in the separation agreement was ambiguous and whether dell claims for breach of the penny share and separation agreements were.
standard of review 
the interpretation of a contract and the determination of ambiguity are questions of law,which we review de novo this broad standard of review includes the initial determination of whether the contract is ambiguous.we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion we will reverse a judgment for an erroneous evidentiary ruling only when the challenged ruling affects a party substantial rights we review de novo a district court determination of the applicable limitations period 
b.the district court exclusion of parol evidence 
in determining whether the district court committed reversible error by prohibiting rodriguez from introducing parol evidence to explain the meaning of the sole discretion clause of the separation agreement,we encounter two separate standards.on the one hand,interpretations of a contract and determinations of ambiguity are questions of law,which we review de novo.this includes a review of the district court determination whether the contract is ambiguous on the other hand,a district court evidentiary ruling is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,and we reverse only when the evidentiary ruling affects a party substantial rights as we here conclude that the district court evidentiary ruling was predicated on,and a corollary of,its construction of the contract as unambiguous,we review this decision de novo.if we conclude de novo that the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the sole discretion clause is not ambiguous,it will follow that the district court subsequent grant of dell motion in limine must necessarily be an abuse of discretion 
sole discretion clause unambiguous introduction of parol evidence denied 
section b ii of the separation agreement,called the sole discretion clause by the parties,allows dell to terminate these transition agreements with immediate effect if dell has determined,in dell sole discretion,that rodriguez conduct is creating,or has created,a negative impact on dell or on dell reputation in the spanish market and dell has provided rodriguez with written notice of such negative impact emphasis added.in ruling on dell motion for partial summary judgment,the district court stated 
rodriguez argues that the separation agreement sole discretion clause only applies to his performance as a consultant and not his previous conduct as a dell employee.unfortunately for rodriguez,this theory contradicts the plain language of the agreement.the separation agreement covers past behavior when it states that if rodriguez conduct is creating,or has created,a negative impact on dell,dell may terminate the agreement and withhold any stock that was going to be released pursuant to the agreement.rodriguez attempts to overcome the plain language of the separation agreement by offering parol evidence including deposition testimony and email correspondence.the court,however,can not look to parol evidence for the purpose of creating ambiguity the court,therefore,finds that the plain language of the contract allowed dell to look to rodriguez past conduct as a dell employee in determining whether he had created a negative impact on dell.
emphasis added.the district court subsequently granted dell motion in limine,prohibiting rodriguez from introducing any parol evidence to interpret the separation agreement.
on appeal,rodriguez first contention is that the district court erred in ruling that the separation agreement sole discretion clause unambiguously permitted dell to terminate rodriguez severance rights based on conduct that occurred either before execution of the separation agreement while rodriguez was employed as dell managing director or after its execution while rodriguez would be serving as a consultant to dell.it is evident from the ruling that the district court placed dispositive importance on the presence of the words has created in the sole discretion clause.
rodriguez maintains that the sole discretion clause only refers to dell right to terminate these transition arrangements,which addresses his future role as consultant.rodriguez further contends that the separation agreement provides for the structured,periodic release of stock options,with the release of the shares corresponding to rodriguez two different roles.he insists that this further supports his interpretation of the sole discretion clause as applicable only to his conduct as consultant on a basis.
rodriguez thus argues that the district court the sole discretion clause was unambiguous as a matter of error.he charges that the term has created covers only those circumstances in which dell learns of prior actionable conduct taken after rodriguez signed the separation agreement.rodriguez insists that,as the subject clause is susceptible to two reasonable but different one ascribed to it by the district court and the one he clause is ambiguous,entitling him to introduce parol evidence to support his interpretation.in addition to his own testimony,the key parol evidence that rodriguez claims was improperly excluded includes deposition testimony of eric meurice,the dell employee who negotiated the separation agreement,indicating that the sole discretion clause was only,and an written by nicholas taylor the taylor memo,the lawyer for dell who drafted the separation agreement,noting only some penny stock as held back on good conduct conditions.
preservation of error 
despite the district court clear ruling on dell summary judgment motion and its grant of dell motion in limine,dell asserts that n o ruling by the trial court prevented rodriguez from offering evidence regarding the interpretation and termination provision of the separation agreement.dell contention is constructed on four elements.
first,dell argues that because the ruling that the plain language of the contract allowed dell to look to rodriguez past conduct as a dell employee in determining whether he had created a negative impact on dell was in the context of a denial of dell motion for partial summary judgment,that ruling was merely dicta and therefore had no effect on the district court decision,which was based on other grounds.thus,argues dell,the summary judgment ruling did not preclude rodriguez from introducing parol evidence at trial to explain the separation agreement.
this contention is incorrect.the district court granted dell motion in limine,which was expressly predicated on the court earlier determination that the sole discretion clause was unambiguous and clearly prevented rodriguez from introducing the parol evidence in question at trial.
second,dell continues to urge that the district court grant of dell motion in limine did not prevent rodriguez from introducing parol evidence at trial,citing several examples of rodriguez purported introduction of extrinsic evidence regarding the interpretation of the separation agreement.but these cited instances do not address evidence concerning the sole discretion clause.in fact,a discussion between the court and counsel confirms that both the court and rodriguez counsel understood that parol evidence concerning whether the separation agreement was exclusively could not be presented at trial 
hantzes rodriguez counsel we put before the court the proposition that the agreement was exclusively and the court rejected that after announcement sic of the contract and found that it was unambiguous in that regard there will be other issues in that document that we intend to raise at some point that are ambiguous,so understand that the court does not want parole evidence on the issue of whether it versus.but there are other issues in that document,your honor,which are ambiguous in my analysis of the document.
the court who do you propose to ask about that 
hantzes taylor 
the court well,i suppose that the attorneys that represent the plaintiff and have sufficient experience that they know how to jump up and say,i object if you start asking a question that they think is not calling for admissible testimony.
rodriguez absolutely was prevented from introducing parol evidence during trial regarding whether the contract was exclusively.he was not permitted to introduce the taylor memo when rodriguez tried to do so,the district court sustained dell objection.
the third element that dell advances is that rodriguez made no offer of proof at trial regarding the parol evidence that he sought to introduce.it is true that rodriguez did not make an offer of proof for meurice deposition testimony rodriguez is relying on evidence he put forth in opposing dell summary judgment motion.insofar as the taylor memo is concerned,though,rodriguez unmistakably made an offer of proof at trial when he tried unsuccessfully to introduce the memo to impeach taylor on the stand.
as explained in mathis exxon,a objection is sufficient to preserve the error for appellate review.a renewed objection at trial is no longer required to preserve error furthermore,we have recognized that excluded evidence is sufficiently preserved for review when the trial court has been informed as to what counsel intends to show by the evidence and why it should be admitted,and this court has a record upon which we may adequately examine the propriety and harmfulness of the ruling.rodriguez explained his argument concerning the clause in the separation agreement in his opposition to summary judgment,and he attached excerpts of the testimonial evidence that he proposed to introduce.his actions were sufficient to inform the trial court of the substance of his evidence and to create an adequate record for our review.
dell last element in support of its contention is that rodriguez failed to preserve error because he failed to seek a jury instruction regarding the district court interpretation of the termination provision.dell contends that if rodriguez believed that the sole discretion clause was ambiguous,he should have objected and requested a jury instruction asking the jury to interpret the clause.but the question w hether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the courts to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present at the time the contract was executed.only when a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties interpretation and admit extrinsic evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.as the district court ruled that the sole discretion clause was unambiguous as a matter of law,dell appellate contention that rodriguez was required to seek a jury instruction on this issue to preserve error is feckless.it was the district court ruling on dell motion in limine that kept the jury from hearing rodriguez evidence on this issue.the question whether the separation agreement was ambiguous is properly before us on appeal.
the district court ruling was reversible error.
standard of review 
as stated above,if the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the sole discretion clause is unambiguous,a ruling that we review de novo,then of necessity that court subsequent grant of dell motion in limine constitutes an abuse of discretion 
b.the sole discretion clause is susceptible to two different but reasonable interpretations 
texas law on contract construction and the admission of parol evidence is 
the primary concern of a court in construing a written contract is to ascertain the true intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.if a written contract is so worded that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning,then it is not ambiguous.parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity.
if,however,the language of a policy or contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations,it is ambiguous.whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.only where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties interpretation,and admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.
an ambiguity in a contract may be said to be patent or latent.a patent ambiguity is evident on the face of the contract.a latent ambiguity arises when a contract which is unambiguous on its face is applied to the subject matter with which it deals and an ambiguity appears by reason of some collateral matter 
applying these principles to the separation agreement and the facts of this case,rodriguez makes a compelling argument that the sole discretion clause contains a latent ambiguity it is anything but pellucid whether the or has created language in the permits dell to terminate rodriguez if he is creating,or has created,a negative impact on dell or on dell reputation in the spanish market is only prospective or is both retrospective and prospective.it is susceptible of either reading,both of which are reasonable.as this is the very definition of ambiguity,the district court grant of summary judgment in dell favor on this point was reversible error.rodriguez should have been allowed to submit parol evidence to the jury in an effort to convince it that his interpretation of this ambiguous clause of the contract was correct we therefore reverse the district court ruling that the sole discretion clause was unambiguous and remand for further proceedings on this issue.
statute of limitations 
rodriguez second appellate point is that dell claims for breach of contract under the penny share and the separation agreements were by texas statute of limitations for contract claims dell claims,rodriguez contends,accrued when he allegedly the valero contract and engaged in other questioned behavior dell concedes to having received the obviously false valero contract on march.in its texas action,which was not filed until march,dell asserted claims for two distinct of the separation agreement and the other of the penny share agreement.under texas law,g enerally,a cause of action accrues,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when facts come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy.a breach of contract claim accrues when the contract is breached.the time at which a cause of action for breach of contract accrues is a question of law 
separation agreement 
rodriguez argues that the trial court erred in not dismissing dell separation agreement claim because it was filed more than four years after dell learned of his dubious conduct.assuming that rodriguez preserved this claim for appeal,however,dell claim for breach of the separation agreement was clearly not barred by the relevant statute of limitations 
rodriguez conduct,which underlies dell other claims,does not form the basis of dell claim for breach of the separation agreement rather,this claim is grounded in rodriguez exercise of stock options after dell terminated that contract.as dell counsel pointed out at oral argument,rodriguez improper conduct underlies his counterclaim against dell,not dell claim against him.whether dell had sole discretion to terminate rodriguez for his behavior the separation agreement is ambiguous and a matter for the court to decide on remand as we have stated above.assuming,however,that dell decision was proper,there was no breach of the separation agreement until rodriguez refused to accept his termination and proceeded to exercise stock options.as it is clear that dell separation agreement claim is based on rodriguez exercise of stock options after dell terminated that agreement on june,and dell brought its claim on march,than four years after such trial court did not err in holding that dell claim under the separation agreement is not.
penny share agreement 
rodriguez likewise contends that,under dell theory of the case,he breached the psa when the valero contract was backdated in and when the irregularities with the vendor transactions occurred.thus,argues rodriguez,the claim for breach of the psa,which was asserted in the suit filed by dell on march,had prescribed as a result,he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on dell penny share claims dell counters that the terms of the psa require rodriguez to return any gains that he recognized on the penny stocks if he violates or breaches any provision of his employment agreement with dell.rodriguez did not violate the psa,argues dell,until he refused to return past penny share profits following dell determination that he had breached his employment agreement and demanded that he disgorge those profits.this disagreement thus turns on whether the psa was breached by rodriguez misconduct or by his refusal to return his penny share profits after dell demanded the return of those profits.
rodriguez duty to reimburse dell for his penny stock gains is triggered by a breach of any provision of his employment agreement.unlike dell claim under the separation agreement,its psa cause of action does not arise from injury to dell resulting from rodriguez conduct he merely became liable for the return of his profits when he breached his employment agreement.we hold as a matter of law that it was rodriguez breach of the employment agreement itself that violated the psa,so the statute of limitations began to run on this earlier date dell advances two arguments in its defense which we now address.
continuing contract 
as noted,the general rule in texas is that contracts are breached,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when facts come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy.a cause of action arising out of contractual relations between the parties accrues as soon as the contract or agreement is breached.a continuing contract is an agreement where the contemplated performance and payment are divided into several parts or,where the work is continuous and indivisible,the payment for work is made in installments as the work is completed.on a continuing contract,however,the statute of limitations does not commence to run until the contract is terminated or fully performed dell urges that the psa was a continuing contract for which limitations could not begin to run until dell made the determination that rodriguez conduct was in breach of his obligations and elected to terminate his continuing relationship with dell,thereby triggering the clawback provision.
in texas,parties typically enter into continuing contracts for projects such as construction,during which performance is made in measurable increments and compensated based on the value of work completed in each period,and for which there is a clear to be sure,not every contract that texas courts have declared to be a continuing contract fits this definition still,dell has referred us to no we have found none on our the proposition that an employment compensation agreement,payable at fixed intervals,should be treated as a continuing contract.indeed,rodriguez points to at least one texas court of appeals case holding that t he cause of action for the breach of an employment contract arises immediately upon the breach of the contract and limitations run from that time.
dell insists that its claim against rodriguez is for breach of the psa,not breach of his employment contract.by its terms,however,the psa specified the regular issuance of shares to rodriguez,contingent on his continued employment with dell.we decline the invitation to be the first court to expand the definition of continuing contract to include such an employment agreement.
discovery rule 
dell also contends that the discovery rule defeats any limitations defense that might bar its psa claim against rodriguez.although limitations usually begin to run when facts have come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy,t he discovery rule,when applicable,provides that limitations run from the date the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered,in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence,the nature of the injury.we have ruled that under texas law,t he discovery rule affords protection in only limited instances,applying in cases of fraudulent concealment and when the nature of the injury is inherently undiscoverable and the injury itself is objectively verifiable.
even assuming,arguendo,that the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations until dell learned of rodriguez breach,that occurred no later than march,when nicholas taylor dell attorney who drafted the separation agreement received the valero contract.taylor testified that,as soon as he read the valero contract,he knew that it was a false contract because its contents were preposterous and outrageous and so totally unusual as to beg disbelief.thus,even under the discovery rule,the statute of limitations would have started to run on march,making dell suit,filed on march,more than four years later.
iii.conclusion 
although we conclude that dell claim under the separation agreement is not,its claim under the penny share agreement is accordingly,we reverse the portion of the judgment implementing the jury verdict in favor of dell on the penny share agreement,and we remand this action to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of rodriguez on dell breach of the penny share agreement claim.
we also hold that the trial court ruled incorrectly that the separation agreement was unambiguous,and rodriguez properly preserved this claim for appeal.we further conclude that the trial court erroneous ruling on the question of ambiguity resulted in the improper exclusion of parol evidence favorable to rodriguez proffered interpretation of the separation agreement for this reason we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.in light of this disposition,the district court order awarding dell attorney fees must be vacated as well,albeit without prejudice.
affirmed in part vacated in part reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings.
if rodriguez was terminated with cause,though,he would not be entitled to receive any severance benefits.the employment agreement specifically permitted dell to terminate rodriguez for lack of honesty,neglect of the business,or conviction of a criminal offense that would damage dell image.the employment agreement further stated that if the basis for rodriguez disciplinary termination was prove d unlawful or invalid,he would be entitled to his severance.
in contrast,the traditional fair market value soas specified that on termination of his employment,rodriguez
