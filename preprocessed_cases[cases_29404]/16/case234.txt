facts and procedural history 
osl,a rhode island corporation,is a medical practice specialized in ophthalmology.william andreoni has worked at osl as a physician and surgeon for years.he has been part owner of osl since and became the sole owner of the practice in.during the,osl began to grow.therefore,the company sought to find a better way to administer its payroll.to this end,in,osl entered into an oral contract with for payroll processing services the agreement 
in,osl and paychex entered into a written contract pursuant to which paychex was to provide direct deposit payroll services the agreement.the contract is governed by new york law.the relevant parts of the agreement state the following

emphasis added in.the contract also contains a merger clause stating that t he client acknowledges that there have been no other representations or warranties made by paychex to the client which are not set forth in this agreement.
paychex rhode island office handles approximately clients.paychex alleges that it performs its payroll processing services based on the information its clients provide.each new client,through its designated payroll contact,provides paychex with the relevant employee information including names,addresses,social security numbers and salary information.paychex employees load this information onto a computer and use this information to process the client payroll.paychex submits reports and other documents to its clients on a regular basis.these reports include payroll journals and checks which are sent to the client prior to the date the checks will be paid to the employees.because paychex charges its clients per check processed,invoices to clients indicate how many paychecks were issued per pay period.finally,paychex provides quarterly reports,yearly reports and earnings statements to all clients.
in,carleen connor began working for osl as a technician who earned per hour.she later became a licensed optician and the office manager,at which point she earned per hour.it is undisputed that,from the until her termination in,connor handled payroll for osl and was its office manager and designated payroll contact.
paychex contacted connor regularly to inquire about osl payroll.as andreoni was aware,connor would often call in more than one week worth of payroll at a time.osl alleges that during the years that connor requested unearned paychecks,to,its employees were paid on a weekly basis in,connor began requesting that paychex direct deposit into her bank account more money than required to pay her annual salary.during the pay periods when connor requested more than her base pay,she requested that paychex split her pay into two direct deposit payments.at some point,a paychex representative told connor that issuing her more than one payment for a given pay period was more expensive for osl.connor stated that she wanted to split her checks because a single larger check would result in a larger tax withholding.paychex did not contact anyone at osl to verify connor request.
it is undisputed that between and,connor directed paychex to pay her,and paychex did in fact pay her,a total of more than her authorized annual salary.it is also undisputed that paychex sent to osl reports confirming all payments made.these reports were sent to connor attention and andreoni alleges that he saw none of these reports because they were not sent directly to his attention.osl discovered the unauthorized payments when another employee took over connor duties.

new york law governing contract interpretation 
when considering a motion for summary judgment in a contract interpretation case,new york law requires the court to determine whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the disputed question.law debenture trust of maverick tube,cir.the determination of whether a contract provision is ambiguous is an issue of law.id.
to determine whether a contract is ambiguous,the court must look within the four corners of the document,not to outside sources.ja apparel abboud,cir quoting kass kass.courts must review the entire contract and p articular words should be considered,not as if isolated from the context,but in the light of the obligation as a whole and the intention of the parties as manifested thereby.riverside planning riverside,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
contract terms are ambiguous if the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.fabozzi lexington ins,cir quoting lightfoot union carbide,cir applying new york law.
c.the direct deposit agreement 
the relevant language of the agreement is paychex is authorized to draw from client bank account as specified by client,such amounts as are necessary to pay its employees.osl posits that the district court erred by finding that this sentence was clear and unambiguous and by failing to give meaning to the second operative clause such amounts as are necessary to pay its employees.specifically,osl states that the second operative clause is ambiguous because it can be interpreted as either creating a duty for paychex to oversee whether the withdrawals are necessary to pay osl employees or allowing paychex to withdraw from the client account blindly as long as the designated payroll contact so ordered.paychex,on the other hand,states that osl interpretation of the contract language would completely negate the specific authorization to withdraw funds as specified by client by requiring paychex to question whether the requested payroll payments are necessary even when the client authorized them.according to paychex,the simplest reading of the agreement is that paychex is authorized to withdraw from osl account only what osl specifies is necessary to make the payroll payments that osl requested and no more.
we find that the relevant contract language clearly and unambiguously establishes that it is the client who has to specify the amounts that paychex is authorized to withdraw from the client bank account.we read the second operative clause such amounts as are necessary to pay its employees to modify the first and to create a limitation on the amount of money that paychex is authorized to withdraw from the client account and not as creating an affirmative responsibility for paychex to verify the amounts the client specifies.
we need not consider osl extrinsic evidence regarding the conversation andreoni allegedly had with a paychex representative in because we find that the provisions of the agreement are clear and unambiguous.law debenture trust,at.new york law provides that extrinsic and parol evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity in a written agreement which is complete and clear and unambiguous upon its face,llc int l bus.machs,citation omitted.
we must,however,examine the entire contract and view the relevant language in the light of the obligation as a whole and the intention of the parties as manifested thereby.riverside planning,at.osl argues that the relevant contract language describes one of paychex duties under the contract because it appears in the paragraph entitled services to be performed.specifically,osl alleges that the language such amounts as are necessary to pay its employees creates an obligation for paychex to verify that the amounts that it withdraws each pay period match the employees salaries.osl also asserts that paychex was responsible for verifying the amounts that connor specified because paragraph three client responsibility does not list verifying such amounts as one of osl responsibilities.
although the agreement is not a model of a comprehensive contract,we do not view the fact that the section titled client responsibility does not list verifying the amounts that paychex is authorized to withdraw as indicating that this task is paychex responsibility.if we examine the whole agreement,other sections of the contract create obligations with which osl must comply.for example,in paragraph four,client default,the parties create a duty for osl to reimburse paychex for all fees that it incurs as a result of osl failure to have sufficient funds in its accounts.also,osl payment obligations are addressed in a separate paragraph.the fact that the client responsibility paragraph does not list every one of osl obligations is not dispositive here.
after examining the contract as a whole,we conclude that the writing evidences the intent to agree that it was osl responsibility to specify the amounts that paychex was authorized to withdraw from the accounts.
connor authority 
although we have found that the contract creates no obligation for paychex to verify the information that the payroll contact provides,we must now examine whether agency law creates such an obligation.osl argues that the district court erred by ignoring a disputed issue of material fact regarding connor lack of apparent authority to specify the withdrawal of payments adding up to more than her authorized weekly salary.we find that osl argument is without merit 
a corporation must,by necessity,act through its agents.kirschner kpmg llp,discussing general principles of agency and corporations.it is undisputed that connor was in fact authorized to handle payroll and was the designated payroll contact assigned to communicate with paychex.connor actual authority,however,did not extend to embezzling funds by authorizing the issuance of paychecks in amounts in excess of her salary as this is not what osl,the principal,instructed her to do.the question remains,however,as to whether connor was cloaked with apparent such that paychex could have reasonably relied upon her authority to issue additional paychecks in her name.restatement third of agency cmt.a apparent authority may survive the termination of actual authority or of an agency relationship.osl argues that connor had no apparent authority where osl,as principal,did not act in a way that gave the appearance that connor had the authority to order the paychecks at issue here and that paychex is therefore liable for making the unauthorized payments.
we recognize that t he mere creation of an agency for some purpose does not automatically invest the agent with apparent authority to bind the principal without limitation.ford unity.under new york law,apparent authority can only be created through words or conduct of the principal,communicated to a third party such that a third party can reasonably rely on the appearance and belief that the agent possesses authority to enter into a transaction.standard funding lewitt,quoting hallock state,emphasis added.
we find that paychex reliance was reasonable and that connor had apparent authority because osl put connor in a position where it appeared that she had the power to authorize additional paychecks.telenor mobile commc ns as storm llc,cir under new york law,an agent has apparent authority if a principal places the agent in a position where it appears that the agent has certain powers which he may or may not possess.citation omitted.in her position as the designated payroll contact,connor often called in more than one week worth of payroll at a time without objection from osl.further,andreoni admits that,after,he had no further contact with paychex.even if we assume that,in,the purported conversation between andreoni,as agent of osl,and a representative of paychex and that during that conversation,andreoni informed paychex that he wanted osl employees to be paid weekly for weeks each year,osl argument fails this conversation does not expressly convey a limitation on connor authority,especially where the conversation did not occur in connection with the formation of the agreement.further,it was reasonable for paychex to assume its clients needs might change and that the payroll contact would be authorized to convey such a change.
paychex reliance was also reasonable because of osl failure to object to the transactions that connor authorized.
a principal inaction creates apparent authority when it provides a basis for a third party reasonably to believe the principal intentionally acquiesces in the agent representations or actions if the third party has observed prior interactions between the agent and the principal,the third party may reasonably believe that a subsequent act or representation by the agent is authorized because it conforms to the prior pattern observed by the third party.the belief is thus traceable to the principal participation in the pattern and failure to inform the third party that no inferences about the agent authority should be based upon it.
