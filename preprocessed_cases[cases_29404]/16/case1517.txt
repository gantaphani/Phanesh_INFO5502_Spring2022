this is at least the sixth case,the fourth before the fifth circuit,arising out of a series of loans made by appellee rabo agrifinance,to a collection of partnerships and corporations the veigel entities following defaults on these loans,appellees sought to foreclose on their security interests in the collateral.the district court allowed the foreclosure,and the property was sold at auction.the veigel entities appeal,arguing the statute of limitations barred collection of the underlying debt and thus,under law,barred the foreclosure,even if the foreclosure was appropriate,one of the entities,terra partners,should be subrogated to a superior lien position in some of the equipment,and the district court erred by awarding attorneys fees.we reject the appellants challenges to collection of the debt and affirm the award of attorneys fees.
background 
rabo agrifinance loaned veigel farm partners and terra xxi approximately million between and for conducting farming operations in deaf smith county,texas the secured farming loans.this debt was secured by a second lien on roughly acres of real property,a second lien on irrigation equipment,and a first lien on other farming equipment.the real property was already encumbered by a first lien for more than million held by first ag credit corporation,and the irrigation system was subject to a purchase money security interest for roughly.various veigel entities guaranteed all of these debts.
in,veigel farm partners defaulted on the irrigation system debt.diversified financial services,which had acquired the debt,sued the debtors and guarantors in state court and obtained a roughly judgment against various veigel entities,including robert veigel.in november,ag acceptance acquired the judgment and first lien rights in the irrigation system from diversified.
veigel farm partners and terra xxi both filed for bankruptcy protection in late.the reorganization plans ultimately allowed and provided for all of the debts,together with the security interests.as part of the bankruptcy proceedings,veigel farm partners and terra xxi sued the appellees.the parties settled this suit in october and agreed to reduce the secured farming loans by this point,paid down to roughly million to million,without disturbing the liens securing them.
in september,terra xxi and veigel farm partners defaulted on the secured farming loans and ag acceptance foreclosed its second lien position in the acres.because the property was encumbered by superior liens for more than million,ag acceptance purchased the property for at the foreclosure sale,which it credited against the amount owed.
the limited return from the foreclosure sale left a large deficiency on the secured farming loans.rabo agrifinance sued to collect the deficiency on september,near the expiration of the statute of limitations.rabo agrifinance,veigel farm partners,wl,deficiency suit.
with the deficiency suit pending,rabo agrifinance filed the instant suit for a temporary restraining order in texas state court on june,seeking to prohibit the veigels,or any of their employees or agents,from injuring,destroying,damaging,or wasting the collateral in any manner and to prohibit the veigels,or any of their employees or agents,from removing any of the collateral.because the acres had already been foreclosed upon,the remaining collateral comprised farming equipment on which the appellees held the first lien pursuant to the secured farming loans and the irrigation system on which the appellees,having bought out diversified interest,now also held the first as well as second lien positions.the appellants removed this case to federal court based on diversity.on june,robert veigel,as guarantor,paid to satisfy the judgment for the debt secured by the first lien in the irrigation equipment.he then filed a notice that he claimed a right of contribution from the other defendants and later assigned his rights to terra partners 
in february,the appellees amended their pleading in this case to seek a declaratory judgment of their interest and judicial foreclosure on the farm equipment,including the irrigation system.the veigel entities responded that collection of the debt was barred by limitations terra partners owned some portion of the equipment some items on the land were not equipment but were personal property and because of the assignment of rights from robert veigel,terra partners was subrogated to the first lien interest in the irrigation equipment.
separately,the veigel entities also defaulted on the million debt to first ag credit,which was secured by the first lien in the acres.first ag credit accelerated the amounts due,and in rabo agrifinance acquired the debt and senior lien from first ag credit.rabo agrifinance,terra xxi,wl,at,affirmed by rabo agrifinance terra xxi.cir per curiam unpublished.rabo agrifinance sued the veigel entities that were liable for these notes and received a million judgment.id.at.in an attempt to collect on this judgment,rabo agrifinance attempted to foreclose on acres owned by various veigel entities and sued to quiet title,challenging certain transfers of the real property as fraudulent.ag acceptance veigel,cir transfer suit.
the district court held bench trials in this case and the transfer suit.ag acceptance veigel,wl,dist.lexis,rabo agrifinance,terra xxi,wl.the parties stipulated that the court,in deciding each case,might consider evidence from either.the district court released opinions in both cases on the same day,finding that the creditors validly foreclosed on the real property in the transfer suit,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,and in this case,that aside from some minor items found to be personal property,the appellees could foreclose on the equipment and terra partners does not have a subrogated interest in the irrigation system.wl,at.the district court later awarded attorneys fees to the plaintiffs in both cases 
to complete this recitation,the district court entered judgment in the deficiency suit for rabo agrifinance,yielding a net judgment exceeding million after a credit for the foreclosure sale proceeds on the equipment and irrigation system the foreclosure auction occurred in april.
appellants pursue this appeal of the equipment foreclosure judgment.following a bench trial,this court reviews the district court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error.flint hills resources lp jag energy,cir.
ii.statute of limitations 
appellants argue that the statute of limitations bars this suit.neither party disputes that under texas law,an action to foreclose on a debt security is barred where the statute of limitations has run on the collection of a debt.mcbryde curry,writ denied.
when ag acceptance foreclosed on the real property on september,a statute of limitations commenced.a.the deficiency suit was filed on september,and could toll the statute of limitations to permit the equipment foreclosure at issue in this case.see in re herman,collecting texas cases.appellants contend,however,that the statute of limitations barred the deficiency suit because rabo agrifinance did not actually own the debt at the time it filed the deficiency suit,and in any event,it failed to exercise diligence in effecting service of process.
we need not discuss the ownership of the debt in detail because collateral estoppel bars this attack on the validity of the deficiency suit judgment.when a federal court sitting in diversity is considering the collateral estoppel effect of a prior federal judgment,this circuit applies federal common law.reimer smith,cir.to establish collateral estoppel under federal law,one must show 
that the issue at stake be identical to the one involved in the prior litigation 
that the issue has been actually litigated in the prior litigation and 
that the determination of the issue in the prior litigation has been a critical and necessary part of the judgment in that earlier action.
wehling cbs,cir.the parties to the suits need not be completely identical,so long as the party against whom estoppel applies had the full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous lawsuit.id.
