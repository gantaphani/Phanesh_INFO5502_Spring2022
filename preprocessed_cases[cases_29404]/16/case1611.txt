the issue of first impression before us is whether a federally prescribed form endorsement covers a bus accident occurring in mexico.the district court held that it does not and granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
on april,a tour bus owned by maria de la luz garcia,doing business as garcia tours collectively,garcia tours,and operated by jesus escoto escoto,a garcia tours employee,was involved in an accident with a vehicle carrying eight members of the morquecho family collectively,the morquechos or the morquecho family in monterrey,mexico.the accident occurred on garcia tours bus route between houston,texas,and celaya,mexico.two members of the morquecho family were killed,and six others were injured.
at the time of the accident,garcia tours held an insurance policy issued by lincoln general insurance company lincoln general.the policy provides that lincoln general will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.the policy,however,contains several conditions,including a territorial restriction.that specific condition provides that lincoln general will cover accidents and losses occurring only within the coverage territory,which is defined as the united states,the territories and possessions of the united states,puerto rico,and canada,or loss es to,or accidents involving,a covered auto while being transported between any of these places.
the policy also contains the federally mandated endorsement for motor carrier policies of insurance for public liability under section of the regulatory reform act of,referred to as the endorsement because it is issued on federal form.lincoln general issued the endorsement to garcia tours in compliance with federal law,which requires that motor carriers of passengers carry minimum levels of financial responsibility the policy and the endorsement were in effect on the date of the accident.
procedural history 
on july,the morquechos filed suit against garcia tours and escoto the bus driver in texas state court.the morquechos asserted claims of negligence,negligent hiring,negligent entrustment,and negligent retention,and sought damages for the injuries sustained in the accident.lincoln general denied coverage and refused to defend or indemnify garcia tours in the state court action.the texas state court ultimately found garcia tours liable on all counts and awarded the morquecho family over million in damages.
while the state court suit was pending,lincoln general filed this declaratory judgment action against garcia tours in federal district court.lincoln general sought a declaration that the policy did not provide coverage for any damages arising out of the accident involving the morquechos and,consequently,that it had no duty to defend or indemnify garcia tours under the terms of the policy.because of their interest in this suit,the morquecho family intervened.in their complaint,the morquechos requested a declaration that the policy provided coverage for the accident and that the endorsement applied to any judgment rendered against garcia tours in the underlying state court suit.
lincoln general and the morquechos subsequently filed for summary judgment in its summary judgment motion,lincoln general argued that it did not owe a duty to defend or indemnify the underlying state court action because the accident occurred in mexico,outside of the policy coverage territory,and because the endorsement did not expand coverage to mexico under its plain terms.although the morquechos conceded that the body of the policy contained a territorial restriction that did not include mexico,the morquechos contended that the terms of the endorsement trumped the territorial limitation in the policy and mandated coverage for the accident.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lincoln general.the district court reasoned that because t he application of the endorsement derives its authority from the substantive provisions of and the jurisdictional limitations of the regulations governing the applicability of the form endorsement are also limited to the transportation of passengers between a place in the united states and a place in a foreign country to the extent the transportation is in the united states.dist.order at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court held that the application of form only applies to transportation that occurs within the united states,and does not apply to transportation occurring outside of the united states.id.based on its analysis,the district court concluded that the endorsement can not apply to the accident in this case,and that plaintiff lincoln general is not obligated to pay any final judgment recovered against garcia tours as a result of the accident occurring in mexico.id.at.
on july,the district court entered a final judgment dismissing the case.on august,the morquechos filed a motion for reconsideration,in which they argued,for the first time,that the endorsement covers garcia tours liability for negligent hiring,retention,and entrustment because those acts occurred in the united states and not in mexico.on september,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration without commenting on the morquechos new argument.
the morquechos now appeal,arguing that the district court erred in determining that the endorsement did not cover their accident in mexico.according to the morquechos,the endorsement reads out any language in the policy that would limit the right of injured third parties to recover,including the territorial restriction in the policy.in the alternative,the morquechos raise the argument that they made in their motion for reconsideration,asserting that the endorsement covers the accident,even though it occurred in mexico,because garcia tours negligent hiring,retention,and entrustment occurred in the united states.this court has jurisdiction over the morquechos appeal pursuant to
