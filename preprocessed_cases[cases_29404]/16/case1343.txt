verdelle blackshear appeals a decision of the district court awarding summary judgment to reliance standard life insurance company reliance standard and refusing to disturb the denial of blackshear claim for benefits under a group life insurance policy.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
reliance standard issued a group life insurance policy to duplin general hospital that became effective on january.the group policy,which was part of duplin general employee welfare benefit plan,covered both present and future hospital employees.the policy set forth the following benefits schedule 
schedule of benefits 
names of subsidiaries,divisions or affiliates to be covered none 
eligible classes each active,employee,except any person employed on a temporary or seasonal basis.
waiting period 
present none none 
future days none 
as defined by the fair labor standards act,as amended 
individual effective date the first of the policy month coinciding with or next following completion of the waiting period,if applicable.
the statutorily required summary plan description spd issued to the employees included an identical schedule of benefits.see west,b west supp.
on june,verdie blackshear verdie began working at duplin general as a nurse and received a copy of the spd for duplin general employee welfare benefit plan.verdie died six months later on december.blackshear,verdie named beneficiary under the policy,filed a claim on january,with reliance standard for the life insurance proceeds of.according to the language of both the spd and the policy itself,employees such as verdie hired after the issuance of the policy were not subject to a service waiting period,meaning that the coverage provided by the policy took effect immediately upon verdie employment.
upon receiving the claim,reliance standard contacted the human resources department for duplin general to verify verdie status and the effective date of her coverage.in a letter dated january,susan hayes,duplin general vice president for human resources,wrote that,contrary to the actual language of the policy and the spd,the policy should cover all employees for life insurance after six months of employment and that t here should be no discrimination between exempt and employees.on january,reliance standard duplin general group policy.the amended policy,which had the same january,effective date,eliminated the distinction between exempt and employees and instead imposed a service waiting period for all employees before coverage would take effect.the individual effective date remained the same the first of the policy month coinciding with or next following completion of the waiting period.emphasis added.
reliance then denied blackshear claim on the grounds that verdie was not insured under duplin general group policy on december,the date of her death,for failure to satisfy the waiting period as defined in the amended policy 
verdie blackshear was employed june,t he applicable month waiting period of employment would have been satisfied on december.the scheduled effective date of insurance for blackshear was january,
as verdie blackshear died prior to the scheduled effective date of her coverage,january,she did not satisfy the eligibility requirements and the life insurance coverage did not go into effect in accordance with the terms of the policy 
we are aware that due to a clerical error,booklets were printed that did not correctly state the applicable month waiting period of employment.duplin general confirmed in a telephone conversation on march,and in earlier conversations with our staff that all eligible employees of duplin general hospital are subject to the month waiting period of employment and that the original booklets contained an error regarding application of the waiting period for employees.this error has now been corrected and new booklets have been forwarded to duplin general for distribution to eligible employees.
blackshear sought review of the denial of her claim for benefits under reliance standard appeal review procedure.reliance standard concluded that its original determination to deny benefits was proper and denied blackshear appeal.in affirming its denial of benefits,reliance standard acknowledged that an error had occurred in the initial policy and booklet printing with regard to the applicable waiting period,and classified the omission of the waiting period for employees in the original policy and spd as a clerical error that was inconsistent with the original intention of the policy.in addition to its conclusion that original intention prevails over unambiguous language in the policy and the spd,reliance standard also relied upon the general provisions section of the policy that provides c lerical errors in connection with the policy or delays in keeping records for the policy,whether by you,us,or the plan administrator will not terminate insurance that would otherwise have been effective and will not continue insurance that would otherwise have ceased or should not have been in effect.
ultimately,blackshear filed this action against reliance standard under erisa,seeking review of the denial of benefits.see a b west.the parties filed for summary judgment.applying a modified abuse of discretion standard of review,see bynum cigna healthcare of north carolina,cir,the district court determined that reliance standard did not abuse its discretion in applying the clerical errors provision of the policy and that substantial evidence supported its conclusion that,but for the clerical error,verdie blackshear coverage under the life insurance policy could not have gone into effect until january.accordingly,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of reliance standard.
on appeal,blackshear argues that the clear and unambiguous language originally set forth in the spd and the policy controls and afforded verdie insurance coverage immediately upon employment without a waiting period.reliance standard disregard of this unambiguous language,contends blackshear,amounted to an abuse of discretion.
in reviewing the denial of benefits under an erisa plan,a court first task is to consider de novo whether the relevant plan documents confer discretionary authority on the plan administrator to make a determination.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d johannssen district coast,meba pen.plan,cir.when a plan by its terms confers discretion on the plan administrator to interpret its provisions and the administrator acts reasonably within the scope of that discretion,courts defer to the administrator interpretation.colucci agfa.severance pay plan,cir,cert.denied,d.in this case,the policy provided as follows reliance standard life insurance company shall serve as the claims review fiduciary with respect to the insurance policy and the plan.the claims review fiduciary has the discretionary authority to interpret the plan and the insurance policy and to determine eligibility for benefits.the parties agree that the plan confers discretionary authority upon reliance standard,as the plan administrator,to make benefit decisions according to the terms of the plan.stup unum life ins.of,cir applying abuse of discretion review where erisa plan afforded the administrator the discretionary authority both to determine an employee eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of this policy internal quotation marks omitted.under the abuse of discretion standard,the reviewing court will not disturb the plan administrator decision as long as it was reasonable.see firestone,at.booth stores,cir.
typically,once it has determined that the abuse of discretion standard applies,the reviewing court turns to the question of whether the administrator exercise of discretion was reasonable as determined by the application of a number of factors.see booth,at colucci,at.however,when the plan administrator own business interests will be affected directly by its decision on the claim for benefits,a conflict of interest arises that may operate to reduce the deference given to a discretionary decision of that fiduciary to the extent necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from that conflict.booth,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in effect,we use a standard of review when a genuine conflict exists t he more incentive for the administrator to benefit itself by a certain interpretation of benefit eligibility,the more objectively reasonable the administrator decision must be and the more substantial the evidence must be to support it.stup,at quoting ellis metro.life ins,cir.
because reliance standard insures the very plan it administers,the district court concluded that it was operating under a conflict of interest.reliance standard does not challenge the district court application of the modified abuse of discretion standard under the circumstances,and we agree that this standard of review was appropriate for judicial review of decisions in which reliance standard was actually exercising its discretionary authority under the plan.see bynum,at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the substantive issues.
broadly speaking,erisa plans are contractual documents which,while regulated,are governed by established principles of contract and trust law.haley paul revere life ins,cir.accordingly,courts must enforce and follow the plan plain language in its ordinary sense.bynum,at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,even as an erisa plan confers discretion on its administrator to interpret the plan,the administrator is not free to alter the terms of the plan or to construe unambiguous terms other than as written.colucci,at.to the extent the administrator enjoys discretion to interpret the terms of a plan in the course of making a determination,such interpretive discretion applies only to ambiguities in the plan.see id.interpretive discretion only allows an administrator to resolve ambiguity.kress food employers labor relations ass n,cir explaining that discretionary authority is not implicated where the terms of the plan itself are clear.an administrator discretion never includes the authority to read out unambiguous provisions contained in an erisa plan,and to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.colucci,at see id.f or instance,if a plan unambiguously provides weeks of compensation as a severance benefit for an employee who has worked for the company for years,the administrator abuses its discretion by reading the plan to provide weeks of compensation.
it is undisputed that,at the time of verdie death,the plan documents relevant to duplin general group life insurance clearly and unequivocally afforded coverage for verdie and other employees without a waiting period.thus,in concluding that,contrary to the written instruments,verdie was in fact subject to a waiting period,reliance standard was not resolving an ambiguity in the policy language but reading a clear and unambiguous provision out of the written plan documents.
nevertheless,reliance standard contends that we should not disturb its decision to deny benefits for two reasons.first,reliance standard asserts that the failure to include a service waiting period in the original policy was a clerical error and that the policy permitted it unilaterally to amend or correct clerical errors in the terms of the policy.second,reliance standard argues that the omission of a waiting period was the result of a scrivener error and that the doctrine of equitable reformation permits the policy to be corrected retroactively to reflect the actual intent of the contracting parties.we conclude that the denial of benefits can not stand under either theory.
according to reliance standard,the clerical errors provision set forth in the group policy permitted it to make its determination based on extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties original intent instead of the written terms of the policy.after receiving blackshear claim and reviewing correspondence between duplin general and reliance standard before the original policy was issued,reliance standard amended the policy to include a service waiting period for all employees and then relied upon the amended version of the policy to deny blackshear claim for benefits.thus,we must decide whether it was permissible for reliance standard to deny blackshear claim based on a retroactive amendment to the policy.
the group policy is part of an employee welfare benefit plan,see west,which is exempt from the statutory vesting requirements that erisa imposes on pension benefits.wheeler dynamic eng g,cir.generally speaking,a plan participant interest in welfare benefits is not automatically vested,and an employer sponsoring the plan may therefore unilaterally terminat e or modify previously offered benefits that are not vested.gable sweetheart cup,cir see wheeler,at a n employer may amend the terms of a welfare benefit plan or terminate it entirely.
nevertheless,the terms of a plan may create vested rights in welfare benefits even though the employer is under no obligation to do so.see wheeler,at.an employer or plan sponsor may unilaterally modify or terminate welfare benefits,unless it contractually agrees to grant vested benefits.chiles ceridian,cir.once an employer or plan sponsor grants vested rights under a welfare benefit plan,however,it may not retroactively amend the plan to deprive a beneficiary of a vested benefit.see wheeler,at.in wheeler,this court rejected an attempt to amend a group medical insurance policy to eliminate coverage retroactively for a specific course of treatment that the beneficiary had already begun.see id.at.we concluded that the beneficiary rights under a welfare benefit plan providing medical insurance vested at the moment the triggering event under the policy occurred and that the plan could not be amended to deny coverage after that point.see id.at.numerous courts have taken,in a wide array of circumstances,a similarly dim view of any amendment that attempts to retroactively eliminate vested welfare benefit rights.see member servs.life ins.american bank trust of sapulpa,cir filipowicz american stores benefit plans,cir bartlett martin marietta operations support.life ins.plan,cir wulf quantum chem,cir confer custom eng g,cir per curiam.
accordingly,we must determine whether blackshear right to life insurance proceeds vested before reliance standard issued the amended policy.in wheeler,we referred to general state insurance law in concluding that under a group medical insurance policy,benefits vest at the time that the covered loss occurs.see at u nder a medical insurance policy or plan insur ing against illness,coverage for all medical costs arising from a particular illness vests when the illness occurs.under general principles of insurance contract law such benefits do vest when performance is due under the contract.at that point,the contract is no longer executory and must be performed in accordance with the terms then in existence.member,at.in the case of a group life insurance policy,the right to benefits,performance becomes the time of the plan participant death.see filipowicz,at adams life ins,see generally lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.t he rights of the named beneficiary vest at the instant of the insured death,and can not be affected by any subsequent act of the insurer.here,blackshear rights under the plan vested at the moment verdie died,which was prior to the issuance of the amended policy containing a service waiting period.the insertion of a waiting period had the effect of dispossessing blackshear of rights that were already vested and was therefore impermissible.
in rejecting the denial of benefits based on a amendment to a group life insurance policy,the seventh circuit explained that the employer could not 
retroactively modify a life insurance policy after the insured death so as to take away the life insurance proceeds due a beneficiary at the date of the insured death a t the insured death the beneficiary became entitled to the insurance proceeds,not based on erisa vesting principles,but based on general insurance law which provides that a beneficiary right to insurance proceeds vests on the date of the insured death a later modification,even one which is retroactive,can have no effect on a beneficiary claim to benefits.
filipowicz,at.we agree with this reasoning and conclude that reliance
