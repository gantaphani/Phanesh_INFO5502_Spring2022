in this appeal,we evaluate the legal sufficiency of a complaint filed by painter mill grille,llc,the owner and operator of a restaurant in owings mills,maryland,and its principals against the restaurant landlord,painters mill,llc,and its agents.the complaint alleges that the landlord and its agents,motivated by racial animus,interfered with painter mill grille business and its opportunity to sell the restaurant,including its leasehold interest,in violation of,and,as well as state tort principles.
the district court dismissed the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,finding generally that painter mill grille principals did not have standing to be plaintiffs and that painter mill grille did not set forth sufficient facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.we agree and accordingly affirm.
painter mill grille operated a restaurant known as cibo bar grill,leasing the premises from painters mill.the lease,which commenced in,provided that painter mill grille could not assign its leasehold rights without painters mill consent.
the relationship between landlord and tenant was a rocky one.painter mill grille repeatedly failed to pay rent as due,leading painters mill to obtain multiple judgments against it for unpaid rent.in october,painter mill grille entered into an asset purchase agreement with earnest and betty hines,who agreed to purchase painter mill grille interest in the restaurant through their company cibogrille,llc,but the deal fell through sometime after april.in january,painter mill grille filed for bankruptcy protection,but the proceeding was later dismissed.
painter mill grille and its principals commenced this action against painters mill,as well as painters mill parent company,david brown enterprises,and three employees of both companies,howard brown,lee sachs,and carmella bell,seeking damages for what they allege was the defendants racially motivated interference with the restaurant business and with the contract between painter mill grille and the hineses company.
in the complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that during the course of the lease with painters mill,painter mill grille clientele began to change until it became predominantly african american.as the racial mix of the clientele changed,all of the defendants became progressively more hostile to the plaintiffs.without reciting when,where,and under what circumstances,the plaintiffs alleged that brown,sachs,and bell would refer to the restaurant africanamerican clientele as the element,the undesirable element,or niggers.they alleged that painters mill arbitrarily charged rent,common area maintenance fees,and attorneys fees and that it unreasonably refused to allow the restaurant to use the patio and to install proper signage to advertise the business.they claimed that the defendants repeatedly turned off lights in the common area,which was used to access the restaurant,or locked the doors to the common area,barring access of patrons.they alleged that the defendants had refused to accept money tendered for rent and that the rent court prosecutions were based in part on unsubstantiated amounts and were intended to drive painter mill grille out of their building and out of business.they also alleged that brown,sachs,and bell instructed fellow employees not to patronize the restaurant.
as a result of the defendants constant harassment,the plaintiffs alleged that painter mill grille decided to sell its business and,pursuant to that decision,entered into the asset purchase agreement with the hineses.after the appropriate approval was received from baltimore county to assign the liquor license,the parties met in april to discuss the transaction.painters mill was represented at the meeting by its attorneys sachs and bell.during the course of that meeting,the plaintiffs alleged that sachs asked the hineses,who are african american,if they were going to open another chicken and waffle shack,and both sachs and bell made unfounded derogatory comments and accusations about the restaurant,the plaintiffs,and the plaintiffs african american clientele.the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unreasonably withheld consent from painter mill grille to assign its lease interest to the hineses company.they claimed that the derogatory comments and the withheld consent were designed to and,in fact,did cause the hineses company to breach its contract with painter mill grille.
based on these allegations,the plaintiffs asserted multiple claims,including seven counts alleging violations of,and state law prohibitions against interference with contracts and economic relationships 
the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b and,alternatively,for summary judgment under rule.by order dated february,the district court granted the motions to dismiss.in its memorandum opinion,the court first addressed the ability of painter mill grille principals alessandro vitale,sergio vitale,and rinaldo vitale to be plaintiffs in the action,concluding that the vitales,as members of painter mill grille,llc,can not bring individual claims against defendants for injuries to their business and that,consequently,painters mill grille,llc is the only plaintiff with standing to bring this action.
the court also dismissed with prejudice all claims against sachs and bell,holding that,as lawyers acting within the scope of their legal representation of brown enterprises and painters mill,llc,they are not individually liable.
the court then dismissed without prejudice the plaintiffs claims of racial discrimination under and counts i,ii,and iii,concluding that,especially in light of the multiple judgments against painter mill grille for unpaid rent,it had failed plausibly to allege sufficient facts to show that the defendants were liable under those statutes.
as for the plaintiffs conspiracy claim count iv,the court dismissed the claim with prejudice,relying on the proposition that agents of a corporation who are acting in that capacity generally can not conspire with each other or with their corporate principal the plaintiffs therefore can not allege that two or more persons conspired against them.
and finally with respect to the state law claims,the court decided to retain supplemental jurisdiction in the interests of judicial economy,fairness,and convenience.it dismissed counts v and vi with prejudice,holding that the plaintiffs could not state claims for tortious interference with contract based on allegations that the defendants induced the hineses and an unidentified third party to breach contracts to buy plaintiffs business,reasoning that because painter mill grille could not contract to assign the lease to a third party without the landlord consent,the defendants could not be liable for interfering with a contract to which they have a relationship.finally,the court dismissed without prejudice the claim of tortious interference with economic relationships count vii on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to allege specific,actionable wrongful acts committed by the defendants.
when the plaintiffs filed an appeal from the district court february,order,the defendants moved to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory because the district court had dismissed several of the plaintiffs claims without prejudice.in opposing that motion,the plaintiffs argued that w here,as here,a plaintiff elects to stand on the complaint rather than amend it,the order dismissing the action without prejudice becomes appealable.based on this election by the plaintiffs,we denied the defendants motion to dismiss the appeal by order dated june.
alessandro,sergio,and rinaldo vitale contend that the district court erred in dismissing them as plaintiffs and holding that painter mill grille was the only proper plaintiff.they contend that they were proper plaintiffs because they suffered personal losses as a result of the defendants discrimination against the restaurant africanamerican clientele and its prospective purchasers.they claim that they had an independent claim for emotional distress and the financial losses personal to them,including the loss of net profits that would have flowed to them from the sale of the restaurant to the hineses,the money they borrowed to refinance the restaurant startup expenses,and the money they owe d to the state of maryland for back taxes.
the vitales recognize that their claims are related to and flow from the contractual relationships between their company,painter mill grille,and others,such as its landlord and its clientele.but they argue that they should be able to bring this action because they suffered personal damages flowing from the defendants interference with these contractual relationships.
in advancing their arguments,however,the vitales have failed to account for the fact that they elected to conduct their business through a limited liability company llc and that,just as they received protection of their personal assets from liability in doing so,they also assumed a role as agents for the company.at bottom,they gave up standing to claim damages to the llc,even if they also suffered personal damages as a consequence.the supreme court decision in domino pizza,mcdonald,forecloses just such claims.
in domino pizza,john mcdonald,the president and sole shareholder of a corporation that had contracted with domino pizza,contended that domino pizza breached its contract with mcdonald corporation because of its racial animus toward mcdonald,in violation of.he alleged that domino pizza breach injured him personally by causing him to suffer monetary damages and damages for pain and suffering,emotional distress,and humiliation.domino pizza,at internal quotation marks omitted.while the ninth circuit recognized mcdonald claim on the ground that mcdonald injuries were distinct from that of the corporation,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the supreme court rejected that proposition,stating 
i t is fundamental corporation and agency law indeed,it can be said to be the whole purpose of corporation and agency law that the shareholder and contracting officer of a corporation has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation contracts.
id.at.to circumvent this principle,mcdonald argued that it was he who was the actual target of discrimination and that he personally lost some benefit that would otherwise have inured to him had the contract not been impaired by domino pizza.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also rejected that argument,however,stating 
w e hold that a plaintiff can not state a claim under unless he has or would have rights under the existing or proposed contract that he wishes to make and enforce.section plaintiffs must identify injuries flowing from a racially motivated breach of their own contractual relationship,not of someone else.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
domino pizza directly forecloses the vitales claims asserted in counts i and ii of the complaint.count i alleges that the defendants interfered with the restaurant ability to contract with its african american clientele,and count ii alleges that the defendants interfered with the restaurant ability to contract with the hineses.because the vitales have no rights under any of these contracts,they can not bring claims with respect to them,even though they may have personally suffered injury as a consequence.
the same principles apply to count iii,where the plaintiffs allege that the defendants impaired plaintiffs rights to lease convey real and personal property in violation of.as in counts i and ii,the vitales did not themselves hold the leasehold interest rather,it was held by their company,painter mill grille.following domino pizza,we likewise hold that protects only the right to inherit,purchase,lease,sell,hold,and convey real and personal property on one own behalf.see also cbocs west,humphries,o ur precedents have long construed and similarly.and the result is not different even when we recognize that the vitales personally guaranteed their company lease obligations.see guides,yarmouth group prop,cir holding that an individual who was the sole shareholder of a tenant company could not state a claim against the landlord and management company and that plaintiff status as guarantor of the previous lease is of no significance to her claim that the defendants refused to lease to her corporation.
in count iv,the vitales purport to state a conspiracy claim pursuant to.again,they can not do so.the conspiracy count is premised on the alleged violations of and.because they have no claims under those provisions,they also failed to state a conspiracy claim.
finally,for similar reasons,the vitales do not have claims under state law for tortious interference with contract and with economic relationships counts v,vi,and vii when they were not parties to either the contracts or the economic relationships upon which those claims are based and when the injuries they allegedly suffered derived entirely from the injury their company allegedly sustained.see fraidin weitzman,identifying the existence of a contract between plaintiff and a third party as one of the elements of tortious interference with contract emphasis added waller waller,t he cause of action for injury to the property of a corporation or for impairment or destruction of its business is in the corporation,and such an injury,although it may diminish the value of the capital stock,is not primarily or necessarily a damage to the stockholder,and hence the stockholder derivative right can be asserted only through the corporation.
accordingly,we affirm the district court order dismissing the vitales as plaintiffs in this case this leaves us with the claims of painter mill grille.
in counts i and ii of its complaint,painter mill grille alleges that the defendants interfered with its ability to make contracts through conduct motivated by racial animus,in violation of providing in pertinent part that a ll persons have the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.as painter mill grille explains,count i addresses its contracts with its african american clientele to purchase food and beverages,and count ii addresses its contract with the africanamerican couple the hineses who sought to purchase the business.
count i,alleging that the defendants conduct interfered with potential contracts with african american clientele,contains only conclusory and speculative allegations,setting forth no facts to support a plausible claim.see ashcroft iqbal.the complaint does allege facts giving rise to tension between painter mill grille and the defendants,asserting that the defendants unreasonably refused to allow painter mill grille to use the patio and to install proper signage to advertise the business that the defendants repeatedly turned off the lights in the common area necessary for access to the restaurant and or locked the doors to the common area barring access of patrons to the restaurant during its normal operating hours that the defendants improperly charged rent and pursued rent court prosecutions and that the defendants instructed their employees not to patronize the restaurant.based on this conduct,the complaint concludes in count i 
because of the repeated acts of the defendants intended to injure,damage or destroy painter mill grille business and drive plaintiffs from the leased premises,because of the race of its clientele,the individual defendants impaired plaintiffs rights to make and enforce contracts in violation of.
there are no facts,however,about who in particular was denied business,when,and the circumstances.there is not even an allegation that this conduct actually caused any patron the inability to purchase goods and services from the restaurant.painter mill grille asks the court to assume that it was defendants conduct that ultimately caused the restaurant to go out of business,as opposed to one of the many reasons that can cause restaurants to fail.but this type of allegation claiming damage to a business based on generally alleged conduct is conclusory and speculative and,as such,is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of demonstrating that the conduct interfered with painter mill grille ability to enter into contracts with any of its patrons,in violation of.see phelps wichita eagle beacon,cir plaintiff has alleged that defendants actions have interfered with his prospective business opportunities,but we find that vague and conclusory allegation insufficient to state a deprivation of the right to make and enforce contracts that is protected by section citation omitted.
it is now well established that mere conclusory and speculative allegations are not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.as the supreme court has stated,to withstand a motion to dismiss,a complaint must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,see also iqbal,at threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice to plead a claim.yet painter mill grille allegations with respect to its loss of clientele suffer from just these deficiencies.while the district court gave painter mill grille an opportunity to amend its complaint to cure the problem by dismissing the claim without prejudice,painter mill grille elected to stand on its complaint as written.accordingly,because we conclude that count i allegations are insufficient,we affirm the district court dismissal of that claim.
count ii,alleging that defendants conduct interfered with painter mill grille contractual right to sell its business and assign its leasehold to the hineses company,sets forth facts of interference committed in two ways painters mill unreasonably withheld consent from painter mill grille to assign its leasehold to the hineses and painters mill lawyers,sachs and bell,stated to the hineses at an april meeting that they did not want another chicken and waffle shack at the site and made derogatory comments about the restaurant and its customers.
the first allegation that the defendants withheld consent would probably state a claim,as it would involve painters mill discriminatory use of its contractual power to deny assignment.see sullivan little hunting park.as the tenth circuit has noted,r elief is available under where a party discriminatorily uses its authority to preclude an individual from securing a contract with a third party,emphasizing that a plaintiff seeking to establish a claim by this route must show that the defendant both possessed sufficient authority to significantly interfere with the individual ability to obtain contracts with third parties,and that the defendant actually exercised that authority to the plaintiff detriment.harris allstate ins,cir emphasis added see also shaikh city of chicago,cir plaintiff and claims fail for a fundamental reason because the city had no power directly to affect a third party proposed sale of the property to plaintiff,it did not unlawfully or unconstitutionally impede upon his ability to purchase the building.
the complaint does indeed allege,as required,that the defendants,with racial animus,interfered with painter mill grille contract to sell the restaurant to the hineses by unreasonably withholding consent to an assignment that painters mill had the legal authority to withhold or give.but painter mill grille has affirmatively abandoned this basis for its claim,repeatedly representing to us both in its brief and at oral argument that the landlord,painters mill,actually gave its consent for the lease assignment prior to the april meeting.accordingly,this alleged method of interference is no longer a basis for painter mill grille claim.
this leaves painter mill grille with only its allegations that derogatory comments and accusations were made by sachs and bell at the april meeting,caus ing the prospective buyers to breach their written contract for the purchase of the business.but especially given the fact that the landlord had already consented to the leasehold assignment,the complaint does not allege that sachs and bell possessed sufficient authority to significantly interfere with painter mill grille contract to sell its business.harris,at.in addition,no allegations are made that sachs and bell were exercising that authority when making those remarks.id.the statements in no way were directed at precluding painter mill grille from selling the restaurant to the hineses.nor were they the kind of threats that might legitimately and reasonably impair an individual freedom to contract or purchase property.shaikh,at.
accordingly,we conclude that sachs and bell derogatory comments did not constitute the kind of interference with a contractual interest that gives rise to a claim.for this reason,we also affirm the district court dismissal of count ii.
in count iii,painter mill grille alleged that the defendants interfered with its ability to lease and convey real property,in violation of providing that a ll citizens of the united states shall have the same right as is enjoyed by white citizens to inherit,purchase,lease,sell,hold,and convey real and personal property.relying on the same conduct alleged to support count i,painter mill grille alleged that the defendants drove plaintiffs from the leased premises and otherwise injur ed,damag ed and destroy ed painter mill grille business.
we conclude that this count fails to state a claim for the same reasons that we gave for concluding that count i failed to do so.indeed,both counts rely on the same factual allegations and reach similar conclusions that were designed to satisfy the requirements of either or.but no facts are alleged as to how painter mill grille was driven out of business.to the contrary,the restaurant was an ongoing concern that the hineses agreed to purchase.and there are no allegations that the clientele decreased,failed to come,or were diverted.indeed,there is not even an allegation that the defendants had any direct contact with painter mill grille clientele so as to interfere with their relationship with the restaurant.to be sure,painters mill allegedly instructed its employees not to frequent the restaurant,but there is no allegation that they otherwise would have been customers or that the number of employees involved was large enough to have any impact on painter mill grille operations.
in addition to the allegations that related to interference with painter mill grille clientele,there are additional allegations that relate to driving the restaurant out of business that have to do with the defendants repeated effort to collect rent through the judicial process.but again,no allegations are made that these judicial rent collection procedures actually resulted in dispossessing painter mill grille of the premises.they did result in judgments,but surely these prior judgments can not be relitigated here.
as we observed with respect to count i,painter mill grille allegations are conclusory and speculative and therefore insufficient to support a plausible claim for relief.see iqbal,at twombly,at,a complaint must contain more than labels and conclusions it must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.
we note,again,that painter mill grille was given the opportunity to amplify its allegations in an effort to state a plausible claim for relief,but it elected to stand on its complaint.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of count iii.
in count iv of the complaint,painter mill grille alleges a conspiracy to deprive it of equal protection of the laws,in violation of making it unlawful to conspire for the purpose of depriving any person equal protection of the laws,or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.it alleges that the defendants brown,sachs,and bell conspired to deprive plaintiffs of equal enjoyment of their rights to lease property,and make and enforce contracts with painter mill grille clientele and prospective purchasers of painter mill grille.it also alleges that brown enterprises and painters mill are directly and vicariously liable for all of the wrongful acts of their employees,brown,sachs,and bell.
as alleged in the complaint,painters mill was the landlord of painter mill grille,and brown enterprises was painters mill parent.brown,sachs,and bell are alleged to have been employees of both companies.
the district court concluded th
