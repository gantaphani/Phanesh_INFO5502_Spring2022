five current or former temporary employees the temporary employees of the board of education of prince george county,maryland school board filed a class action complaint in the circuit court for prince george county,asserting claims against the school board,its chair,and the association of classified federation of state,county and municipal employees,afl cio,local the union.they alleged that even though the collective bargaining agreement cba excluded temporary employees from the bargaining unit,they were entitled to the benefits of an arbitration award entered as the result of an arbitration between the school board and the union,as well as benefits from the underlying cba.
the school board and its chair filed a notice of removal to federal court,which included a statement that the union also agreed to the removal,and all defendants thereafter filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the temporary employees not only opposed the motions to dismiss but also filed a motion to remand,arguing that the removal was invalid because the union did not timely file its own notice of removal or other paper giving its consent in writing.the district court denied the temporary employees motion to remand and entered an order under federal rule of civil procedure b,dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.after filing a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal,the temporary employees also filed a motion in the district court for reconsideration of its dismissal order.the district court granted the defendants motion to strike the motion for reconsideration.the temporary employees then filed a second notice of appeal from that order.
we affirm on both appeals,concluding that the union adequately consented to the notice of removal that the temporary employees complaint failed to state a claim for relief and that the district court did not err in striking the temporary employees motion for reconsideration.
the school board and the union were parties to a cba that covered all employees of the board who are contained within the bargaining unit represented by the union for the period july,through june.article,of the cba defined the bargaining unit to include all classified employees of prince george county public schools with the exception of certain employees,including t emporary employees.and to protect the work positions for members of the bargaining unit,article,of the cba provided 
a substitute or temporary employee will not be used to fill an authorized position in excess of sixty working days except when a qualified individual is not available to fill a position on a permanent basis or where necessary to hold a position for a person on an approved leave of absence or to preserve a vacancy for an employee currently assigned to a position scheduled to be eliminated,school closings,budget reductions,reorganization.
during negotiations in july,the school board provided the union,at the union request,with a list identifying the substitute and temporary employees in the school board employ and giving information about them.the list included such employees,many of whom had been employed by the school board in the same position for more than days and were performing the same duties as permanent classified employees who,as members of the bargaining unit,received higher pay and benefits.after receiving this information,the union filed a grievance against the school board,contending that the school board practice of hiring substitute and temporary employees violated article,of the cba.the grievance thereafter proceeded to arbitration.
in a decision dated july,the arbitrator concluded that the school board had indeed violated the cba by employ ing substitute and temporary employees to fill what would be permanent positions but for the failure of the board to establish those positions pursuant to the terms of the agreement,and to seek their funding as equivalent employees through the budgeting process.the arbitrator found that article,specifically was negotiated as a limitation on the ability of the board to employ substitute and temporary employees to perform bargaining unit work and that the issue is the preservation of bargaining unit work for bargaining unit personnel,not the identity of the specific substitute or temporary employee who may be filling a position at any particular time.although the arbitrator concluded that the board had violated article,he acknowledged that the scope of the violation was unclear.accordingly,he instructed the parties to identify t hose positions filled for in excess of days by substitute and temporary employees that comprise duties covered by existing bargaining unit classifications,clarifying that those that amount to bargaining unit positions are covered by this award,and those that do not,are not.
the arbitrator tailored relief to three relevant periods of time.he determined that n o remedy was warranted for the period of the violation occurring prior to the filing of the grievance,because the union long silence would make any remedy grossly unfair and inequitable.for the period going forward,however,the arbitrator directed that the school board cease its practice of circumvent ing the terms of the agreement by using substitute or temporary employees to do work that should have been performed by classified position s,emphasizing that this ruling is tied not to the individual being employed on a substitute or temporary basis,but rather is tied to the position that is being filled by a substitute or temporary employee,whomever the individual happens to be.finally,for the period between the union filing of the grievance and the school board compliance with the award,the arbitrator concluded that it would be inappropriate to order the conversion to permanent status of those substitute and temporary employees who ultimately are found to have filled what should have been permanent classified positions.the arbitrator explained that there was no evidence that the school board and the union had discussed the automatic conversion of substitute and temporary employees under such circumstances and that,in the absence of such evidence,ordering such a conversion would be inappropriate given the numerous important questions,unanswered on this record,that normally are addressed upon the hiring of an individual into a permanent position.subject to the proviso that retroactive conversion of the incumbents is not warranted,the arbitrator return ed to the parties for settlement in the first instance,along with several other unresolved remedial questions,the question of appropriate remedy for the period of time between the filing of the grievance and the board compliance with this award.
as directed by the arbitrator,the union and the school board reached a settlement regarding the issues committed to them and reduced the settlement to a memorandum of understanding dated may.under the settlement,the school board agreed to pay the union just over million as backpay amounts.the school board also agreed to hire a minimum number of additional bargaining unit employees by specified targeted dates.
on march,five current or former temporary employees of the school board larry mayo,leslie carroll wicks,mary mays carroll,sandra ponoski,and avery milligan filed a class action complaint in the circuit court for prince george county,maryland,naming as defendants the school board,verjeana jacobs in her capacity as chair of the school board,and the union.they purported to represent a class defined as a ll present and former temporary employees of the board and its chair performing duties covered by a cba bargaining unit classification for in excess of days.in count i,the temporary employees sought a declaratory judgment that the arbitration award is valid and enforceable by members of the class that they had become permanent employees after days of employment and that they were therefore entitled to damages.in count ii,they alleged that the union had breached its duty of fair representation by fraudulently misleading the plaintiffs and the temporary employees about the july,arbitration decision and award in their favor and instead accepting a payoff from the board to resolve the plaintiffs and temporary employees rights.in count iii,they alleged a breach of contract by the school board,claiming that plaintiffs are beneficiaries under the cba and were not paid the compensation and benefits of full time employees that the cba mandates.and finally,in count iv,they alleged a takings clause violation against the school board and its chair,under.
the school board and its chair filed a notice of removal,pursuant to,in which they stated that the union had been consulted and had agree d with the removal of this action to federal court.three days later,counsel for the union entered his appearance in the district court,and yet another three days later,on april,the union filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.in its accompanying memorandum of law,the union noted that it had been served with process o n or about march,and that it had consented to the notice of removal.the school board and its chair also filed a motion to dismiss.the temporary employees opposed the motions to dismiss and also filed a motion to remand the case on the ground that the union had not timely filed its own notice of removal or other writing reflecting its consent to the removal.
in an order dated july,the district court denied the temporary employees motion to remand and granted the defendants motions to dismiss the complaint.on the remand motion,the court said that it had determined that removal was effective because of fourth circuit precedent its assumption that generally attorneys will act professionally and rule,which,the court noted,provides a fully satisfactory deterrent to an attorney making a misrepresentation to the court as to whether a has consented to removal.on the motions to dismiss,the court concluded that count i appeared to be requesting an advisory opinion and that,in any event,the requested declaratory judgment was absolutely inconsistent with the arbitration decision.as to count ii,the court concluded that the union did not owe the temporary employees a duty of fair representation that the claim was in any event untimely and that the plaintiffs did not exhaust their state administrative remedies.with respect to count iii,the court again concluded that,to the extent that the temporary employees could claim to be beneficiaries of the cba,their remedy was to seek state administrative relief.finally,as to count iv,the court concluded that state agencies,such as the school board,are not persons within the meaning of and that the eleventh amendment bars damage claims against state agencies and officials.
the temporary employees promptly filed a notice of appeal from the district court july,order.and several weeks later,on august,the temporary employees filed a motion in the district court,requesting reconsideration of the order dismissing their complaint.the school board and its chair filed a motion to strike the temporary employees motion for reconsideration,arguing that the motion was untimely and that,in any event,the court had been divested of jurisdiction by the temporary employees earlier appeal.by order dated september,the district court granted the motion to strike,and the temporary employees filed a second notice of appeal from that order.
on appeal,the temporary employees contend that the union consent to removal was inadequate to effect a removal on its behalf that the district court erred in concluding that the union did not owe the temporary employees a duty of fair representation and that they were not entitled to the benefits of the arbitration award that the district court erred in dismissing their claim for breach of the cba based on a beneficiary theory and that the district court abused its discretion in striking their motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order.
in removing this case from state court to federal court under a,the school board and its chair stated in the notice of removal that they had consulted with the union and that the union had consented to the removal.the union,however,did not sign the notice of removal,nor did it timely file its own notice or a written consent to the school board notice.the temporary employees contend that the removal was defective and that the district court erred in refusing to remand this case to state court.they argue that all defendants must join in the notice of removal and that joining means to support it in writing.because the union did not sign the notice of removal or timely sign a paper giving its own notice of removal or consent,they contend that the case was not properly removed.
the text of provides that to remove a case to federal court,a defendant or defendants must file a notice of removal that includes a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,together with a copy of all previously served process,pleadings,and orders must sign the removal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,which in turn provides that the notice must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney name or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented and must file the notice within days after receipt of the complaint through service of process.the applicable version of the statute does not address how a case involving multiple defendants is to be removed or how the defendants must coordinate removal,if coordination is required nonetheless,the supreme court has construed the statute to include a unanimity requirement,such that all defendants must consent to removal.see lapides bd.of regents of.of,d citing chicago,martin,for the proposition that removal requires the consent of all defendants.dep t of corrections schacht,d kennedy,concurring removal requires the consent of all of the defendants.but neither the statute nor the supreme court decisions have specified how defendants are to give their consent to removal.
adopting a formal approach,the seventh circuit has stated that a petition for removal is deficient if not all defendants join in it and that,to do so,all served defendants have to support the petition in writing,sign it.gossmeyer mcdonald,cir.approving a less formal process the procedure used by the defendants in this case the sixth circuit has held that a notice of removal filed by three defendants which stated that the fourth defendant concurred in the removal satisfied the rule of unanimity.see harper autoalliance int l,cir.the ninth circuit has adopted the sixth circuit rule.see proctor vishay intertechnology,cir concluding that o ne defendant timely removal notice containing an averment of the other defendants consent and signed by an attorney of record is sufficient.and other courts of appeals have taken hybrid positions.see getty oil ins.of,cir concluding that while each defendant need not sign the notice of removal,there must be at least some timely filed written indication from each served defendant that it has actually consented to such action pritchett cottrell,cir applying the fifth circuit rule in getty oil.
we have not addressed this precise question.in darcangelo verizon communications,cir,we noted that a defendant notice of removal was filed with the other defendant consent,but we did not state how the other defendant expressed its consent.
the relevant procedure for removal,set forth in,requires rather simply that a defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action shall file a notice of removal signed pursuant to rule.a.and rule in turn provides,every paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record these texts do not make clear how a case involving multiple defendants is to be removed in light of the requirement that all defendants must consent to the removal.while does include the plural defendants in the subject,it requires only a notice of removal.the plural use of defendants is apparently included to accommodate the situation where more than one defendant desire to remove,without recognizing the required interplay among defendants in light of the originally rule that all defendants must consent to removal.
to be sure,requires at least one notice of removal signed by at least one attorney,in accordance with rule,thus man
