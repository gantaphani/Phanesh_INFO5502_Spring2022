these appeals pose a question of first impression can the plaintiffs,skycaps affiliated with two major airlines,maintain actions for unjust enrichment and tortious interference based on the airlines imposition and retention of fees for curbside service concluding,as we do,that the plaintiffs actions intrude into a zone demarcated by the preemption provision of the airline deregulation act ada,b,we affirm the district court orders of dismissal.
background 
these consolidated cases have a convoluted history.for present purposes,however,a simplified account will do.
the cases comprise two putative class actions brought by skycaps a term of art used to describe porters who provide curbside service at airports.difiore am.airlines,cir,cert.denied.at the times relevant hereto,the skycaps toiled on behalf of air carriers either defendant airways,or defendant united airlines.
by tradition,skycaps remuneration depended largely on tips.in the middle of the last decade,however,the defendants,acting independently and at different times,each introduced a per bag fee for curbside service for departing passengers at airports.these fees did not inure to the benefit of the skycaps.
invoking diversity jurisdiction,see d,the plaintiffs brought suit in the federal district court.they asserted that their compensation decreased dramatically after the fees were established,as some passengers thought the charge was a mandatory gratuity,and others declined voluntarily to tip in addition to paying the charge.mitchell airways,d.relatedly,the plaintiffs faulted the airlines for not adequately notify ing passengers that this charge was not a gratuity.id.
the plaintiffs made a number of state law claims premised on these averments.we rehearse here only the claims that have continuing relevance unjust enrichment and tortious interference with advantageous relations 
in the early going,this litigation encountered strong headwinds,fueled by a byzantine series of procedural twists and turns.this history need not concern us,so we to the point at which the ada preemption issue came to the fore.the district court heard oral argument and dismissed the unjust enrichment and tortious interference claims as preempted.see id.at.these timely appeals ensued.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiffs appeals hinge on the proposition that the ada does not preempt claims,regardless of the relationship between those claims and an air carrier prices,routes,or services.the district court rejected this proposition as a matter of statutory construction,and we review its decision de novo.see difiore,at buck am.airlines,cir.
the supremacy clause sits at the epicenter of every preemption question.see gibbons ogden,wheat.the clause instructs that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.a state law that offends the supremacy clause is a nullity.ass of health maint.orgs.ruthardt,cir.
federal preemption of state law may occur either expressly or by implication.grant dairy,llc comm r of me.dep t of,food rural,cir.the fact that the statute at issue here contains a specific preemption clause,b,streamlines our inquiry.the issue at hand is one of express preemption.but even express preemption is not it nonetheless falls to the courts to identify which state laws are preempted.see medtronic,lohr,ruthardt,at.
congressional intent is the principal resource to be used in defining the scope and extent of an express preemption clause.see grant dairy,at ruthardt,at.in this endeavor,we look to both the text and context of the particular clause.see ruthardt,at.we also may consider the clause purpose and history,as well as the structure of the statutory scheme in which it is housed.see lohr,at ups,flores galarza,cir.
our starting point is textual.see csx,easterwood.the ada preemption provision reads in pertinent part a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier b.we must effectuate the plain meaning of this language unless there is good reason to believe congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning.cipollone liggett group,plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted see morales trans world airlines,u.
reduced to bare essence,the question before us is whether the quoted language preempts the plaintiffs claims.given the wording of the ada preemption provision,this question breaks down into two.the first asks whether the arguably preempted claim is based on a state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law.the second asks whether the claim is sufficiently related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.put in shorthand,the first focuses on the mechanism through which the claim is preferred the second focuses on the linkage between the claim and the core activities of the regulated industry.we address these two separately,but in reverse order.
linkage is an matter here.for ada preemption to thrive,the state law,regulation,or other provision sought to be enforced must relate to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.b.our decision in difiore a case that arose out of a remarkably similar set of facts conclusively resolves this point.
in difiore,skycap plaintiffs alleged that after the defendant airline began charging passengers a fee of for each bag checked with skycaps,passengers mistook the fee for a mandatory gratuity for the skycaps and stopped tipping.at.we held preempted the plaintiffs claims under the massachusetts tips act.laws ch.see difiore,at.as part of this holding,we concluded that an airline conduct in arranging for transportation of bags at curbside into the airline terminal en route to the loading facilities is itself a part of the service referred to in the ada preemption provision,and the airline price includes charges for such ancillary services as well as the flight itself.id.at.thus,a state law that penalizes the imposition of fees at airports directly regulates how an airline service is performed and how its price is displayed to customers.id.at.
difiore answers the linkage for us.our holding there signifies that the enforcement of a state law,regulation,or other provision in a way that materially affects an air carrier imposition of fees relates to both an air carrier prices and services.that holding,unimpeached by any supervening authority,is binding in this litigation.see,united states wogan,cir explaining that in a circuit,prior panel decisions are binding upon newly constituted panels in the absence of supervening authority sufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent.
the reason why difiore does not end our journey is because the decision there turned entirely on the linkage.see at.the mechanism was not in issue because the plaintiffs claims depended on positive law in the form of a state statute the tips act here,however,the claims pressed by the plaintiffs on appeal do not depend on a state statute rather,they are founded on the common law.building on this distinction,the plaintiffs contend that common law is not a mechanism that can be preempted under the ada preemption clause that is,that common law is not a state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law within the purview of the ada preemption clause.difiore did not address this issue.accordingly,this case requires us to delve into that portion of the ada preemption clause declaring that no state may enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law.b.
in an effort to score an early knockout,the plaintiffs point to the supreme court statement that the use of law regulation in a preemption provision,preceded by an indefinite article,refers only to state positive law.see sprietsma mercury marine.but this is not a knockout blow the ada preemption provision unlike the provision at issue in sprietsma,see goes beyond a bare reference to state laws and regulations.the ada also refers to other provision s having the force and effect of law.thus,our inquiry reduces to whether this additional language encompasses state common law.
seen in this light,we think that a more helpful precedent is the supreme court opinion in american airlines,wolens.there,the supreme court stated,albeit in dictum,that the words having the force and effect of law are most naturally read to refer to binding standards of conduct that operate irrespective of any private agreement.id.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.it can not be gainsaid that common law functions as a set of binding standards of conduct.
wolens is not a waif in the wilderness.in a recent case interpreting the preemption provision of the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa,c a provision that stands in pari materia with the preemption provision of the ada,see difiore,at the court took an expansive approach to the meaning of such language.see am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,wl.there,the court held that the faaaa preempted certain contractual requirements,enforced by way of criminal penalties,that were imposed on trucking companies by a municipal port authority.see id.at.in so holding,the court looked to the practical effect of the requirements rather than their form they forced businesses to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition.id.at.
this pragmatic emphasis on function over form offers guidance here.even though a suit at common law is most often brought by one private party against another,that suit is backed by the weight of the state judiciary enforcing state law common law,like positive law,can effectively regulated entities to alter their business practices.we think it clear,therefore,that common law no less than positive law has the force and effect of law.
the plaintiffs persist.they say that,whatever the import of the phrase having the force and effect of law,the term other provision,as used in the phrase law,regulation,or other provision,does not include common law.we do not agree.
a statute need not use the words common law in order to preempt claims.see,riegel medtronic,csx,at cipollone,at plurality opinion.preemption of common law need not be in haec verba.
both the supreme court and this court have consistently given a wide interpretive sweep to ada preemption.see,wolens,at morales,at difiore,f d at buck,at.in buck,we faced a variation of the mechanism that confronts us today.there,the plaintiffs complaint asserted a gallimaufry of claims,including breach of contract,unjust enrichment,breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,and civil conspiracy.see buck,at.although we made no particular distinction between claims rooted in positive law and claims rooted in common law,we found that ada preemption foreclosed these claims.see id.at.
our intuition that the other provision language encompasses common law is bolstered by the purpose and history of the ada preemption clause and the structure of the statutory scheme.the evolution of the preemption provision informs its purpose.see lorillard tobacco reilly,we are aided in our interpretation by considering the predecessor provision and the circumstances in which the current language was adopted.
prior to its revision in,the preemption provision read n o state or political subdivision thereof shall enact or enforce any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier,a,stat.we think it telling that congress used words such as rule and standard to describe the state law that could be preempted.those words typically include common law.see,csx,at finding the phrase law,rule,regulation,order,or standard to include common law drake lab.of am.holdings,cir finding the words rule and standard to include common law.it is,therefore,conspicuously clear that the pre version of the preemption provision included common law as a mechanism eligible for preemption.
this is a highly significant datum.congress amended the ada in and,as a part of this recodification,reworded the preemption provision.though reworded,the purpose of the new preemption provision remained to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation of the airline industry with regulation of their own.morales,at.while the rewording did not repeat the words rule and standard,the revised language was not meant to effect any substantive change.see wolens,at flores galarza,at see also conf,at,reprinted in,confirming that congress intend ed no substantive change to the previously enacted preemption provision and d id not intend to alter the broad preemption interpretation adopted by the united states supreme court in morales.silhouetted against this backdrop,the only plausible reading of the ada preemption provision is that it continues to preempt rules and standards and,thus,continues to preempt common law.we hold that,to the extent that a state claim relates to a price,route,or service of an air carrier,it is preempted by the ada.
common sense supports this holding.after all,courts adjudicating claims can create just as much uncertainty and inconsistency in a carefully calibrated federal regulatory framework as can state legislatures enacting statutes or state agencies promulgating regulations.see,geier am.honda motor,difiore,at.it defies logic to think that congress would disregard consequences and give dispositive effect to the form of a clear intrusion into a federally regulated industry see am.trucking.at wl,at finding preemption despite form of requirement imposed when municipality exercise s classic regulatory authority.
the case law in other circuits,while not precisely on point,is compatible with our holding.a number of courts have found claims preempted by the ada,albeit without explicitly ruling on the scope of the phrase other provision.see,onoh nw.airlines,cir weiss el al israel airlines,app x,cir per curiam koutsouradis delta air lines,f d,cir per curiam weber usairways,app x,cir per curiam anderson usair.the cases that have held claims not preempted appear to have been decided on the linkage that is,the litigated claims did not relate to prices,routes,or services of an air carrier.see,wellons nw.airlines,cir taj mahal travel,delta airlines,cir charas trans world airlines,cir en banc,amended by cir en banc.
the only reported circuit court decision that squarely addresses the question of whether the other provision language extends to state common law answers that question in the affirmative.in united airlines,mesa airlines,cir,the seventh circuit concluded that s tate common law counts as an other provision having the force and effect of law for purposes of the ada preemption clause.id.at.we see no valid reason to depart from this view and in doing so create a circuit split.
in their search for a friendly face in the crowd,the plaintiffs place heavy reliance on the decision in spinrad comair,d.this reliance is mislaid spinrad turned on the district court conclusion that the plaintiff claim was not preempted because of lack of linkage.in other words,it was insufficiently related to prices,routes,or services.see id.at.the court speculation about whether or not ada preemption reaches state claims is unhelpful dictum.
the plaintiffs create no fewer than six pockets of turbulence in an effort to steer us in a different direction.this turbulence is mostly hot air,and none of it disrupts our flight path.
as a threshold matter,the plaintiffs argue that the plain meaning of the word provision does not encompass common law and,by like token,that courts do not enforce common law.the first part of this premise is simply wrong.the word provision,though inexact,is elastic enough to encompass common law.see,e,veiga mcgee,cir noting that t here are specific common law provisions that regulate breaches of the peace smith pasqualetto,cir discussing common law provision.everything depends on context,and when read in context,the word provision in the ada preemption clause can most appropriately be construed to include common law.
the second part of the plaintiffs premise is errant nonsense,which we reject without ex
