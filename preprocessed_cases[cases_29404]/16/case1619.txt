gwtp investments gwtp brought this suit against ses americom ses for breach of contract,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty.it claims that ses agreed to purchase teleports on its behalf at a bankruptcy auction,but after ses won the auction and attained the rights to the teleports,it refused to transfer them to gwtp.finding that there was no binding contract and that the fraud claim was just a repackaged contract claim,the district court dismissed the contract and fraud claims.it subsequently granted summary judgment on the fiduciary duty claim.
we reverse the district court judgment concerning the fraud claim and remand for further proceedings.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
on march,verastar,assets were sold in a bankruptcy auction.verastar was in the business of operating teleports,which provide access to communications satellites and other media.in total,eight teleports were up for bid at the auction.there were two potential phases of the auction first,a select few corporations would be allowed to bid on all eight teleports combined asset pool,and second,bids for each of the eight teleports would be accepted individually asset pools,presumably to gauge which method of sale would yield the greatest profit from the most viable bidders.the auction ended after the first phase of bidding and the second phase never took place.
ses was one of three companies allowed to bid during the first phase on asset pool,but gwtp was not.gwtp learned that ses only wanted six of the eight teleports,while gwtp was primarily interested in the remaining two,located in cedar hill,texas and brewster,washington.on march,the day before the auction,gwtp and ses discussed a strategy whereby they would coordinate their bids to increase the likelihood that each would get its desired teleports.to that end,they drafted a memorandum of understanding mou,stating that they agree to discuss bidding strategy and tactics in order to present the most attractive offer to the verestar auctioneers.slightly different versions of the mou were signed by each party,but each version stated that under no circumstances would this mou be legally binding on or enforceable against either party.
when phase of the bidding started,ses and gwtp devised a formula to determine what percentage of ses overall bid gwtp would contribute for the cedar hill and brewster teleports.as the auction progressed,ses representatives repeatedly collaborated with gwtp representative,jeffery wateska,in determining their bid.when the total bid on asset pool reached million,and gwtp expected contribution under the devised formula was million,wateska informed ses representatives that gwtp would have to cap its potential contribution at million regardless of what the ses bid was ultimately going to be.
ses won the auction.brent bruun,ses primary representative at the auction,quickly sent messages bruun to ses parent company and its cfo announcing that it won the auction.the then listed the significant terms of the deal,which included that ses signed an mou with gwtp in which gwtp agreed to acquire the cedar hill and brewster teleports for million at closing.bruun also called wateska and a gwtp executive,stating that we won the auction and thanking gwtp for its cooperation.there were further communications between ses and gwtp,but all involved rather vague assurances of moving forward.
it quickly became apparent that ses was interested in retaining the brewster teleport.two days after the auction ended,an ses executive sent the following to bruun 
can we talk about gwtp they are not warming to the idea of taking only cedar hill.i have removed their suspicion that we were cutting another deal on the side for brewster,but they make the following point 
they entered into an agreement with us because we stated during the auction or before that the two assets we did not want were the exact two assets that gwtp did and cedar hill 
ses continued to review and consider the profitability of the cedar hill and brewster teleports in the following weeks,and eventually decided to retain them.it informed gwtp that it viewed their previous discussions as providing for only an understanding rather than a legal obligation.gwtp expressed its disagreement and this lawsuit followed.
gwtp asserted three claims against ses in its complaint breach of contract,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty as its agent.the district court summarily dismissed the first two claims on a b motion,finding that the statute of frauds barred the contract claim and the fraud claim,as it was merely a repackaged version of the contract claim.more than seven months after the deadline to amend pleadings passed,gwtp moved to amend its pleadings on the contract and fraud claims to include an argument that the bruun satisfied the statute of frauds.the district court denied gwtp motion.subsequently,the district court granted ses motion for summary judgment on the remaining agency claim.
ii.discussion 
in turn,we consider the dismissal of the contract claim,the dismissal of the fraud claim,and the summary judgment on the agency claim.these are all claims based on state law and it is uncontested that texas law is applicable.we review dispositive motions such as dismissals and summary judgments de novo.kennedy tangipahoa parish library bd.of control,cir.
a.the breach of contract claim and the statute of frauds 
in texas,a contract for the sale of real estate is not enforceable unless the promise or agreement,or a memorandum of it,is in writing and signed by the person to be charged with the promise or agreement or by someone lawfully authorized to sign for him.bus.a,b.the cedar hill and brewster teleports are completely terrestrial and are built along acres of real estate.the district court dismissed gwtp contract claim,finding it was barred by the texas statute of frauds because the sale of the teleports necessarily involves the sale of real estate.
gwtp does not suggest that there is any writing that sufficiently memorialized its agreement with ses,because the mou was explicitly in all of its versions instead,they argue that the primary purpose exception to the statute of frauds applies,making the alleged oral contract enforceable.the primary purpose or main purpose exception to the statute of frauds usually arises when either a promise to pay the debt of a third party is made for the primary benefit of the promisor,see cooper petroleum lagloria oil gas,or a contract involving the sale of goods is predominantly for the sale of services.see propulsion,attwood,cir.
gwtp argues that the dominant purpose of this contract was to convey customer networks,service areas,and other intangibles that flow with the purchase of teleports.gwtp basically attempts to expand the primary purpose test to apply to real estate transactions when the real estate commercial viability forms the basis of the underlying transaction.this is a novel argument and there are no texas cases directly rejecting it,but the caselaw strongly weighs against it in these circumstances.
gwtp relies predominantly on hydrocarbon horizons,pecos dev,christi,writ denied.in that case,the plaintiff agreed to show two oil and gas prospects,which it did not own,to the defendant.the parties agreed that the plaintiff would receive a finder fee if defendant chose to purchase the prospects from a third party within two years.in finding that this contract was outside the statute of frauds,the court found that t he contract alleged by hydrocarbon was not one for the sale of real estate rather the main purpose of the contract is for the sale of geological information,and the statute of frauds is not implicated merely because a real estate transaction may be incidentally involved.id.at.
gwtp reliance on hydrocarbon is misplaced.in hydrocarbon,as opposed to this case,the alleged contract was not for the sale of real estate at all.it was a finder fee contract containing an obligation triggered by a completely independent real estate transaction.the contract was for a finder fee,but it was only due if the defendant purchased the acreage from a third party.it was not a real estate transaction,even if it was triggered
