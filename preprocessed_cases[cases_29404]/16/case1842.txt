this is a breach of contract suit brought by gasoline station franchisees against exxon corporation exxon for violating the texas analogue of the uniform commercial code open price provision.we affirm.
exxon markets its commercial gas bound for retailers primarily through three arrangements franchisee contracts,jobber contracts,and company operated retail stores cors.a franchisee rents gas stations and enters into a sales contract for the purchase of gas.the contract sets the monthly quantity of gas the franchisee must purchase and allows exxon to set the price he must pay.the franchisee pays the dealer tank wagon price dtw and takes delivery of the gas at his station.
a jobber contract requires the purchaser to pay the rack price,which usually is lower than the price charged to franchisees.there is no sale of gas to cors by exxon,because the stores are owned by exxon and staffed by its employees.instead,an accounting is recorded that is equivalent to the price charged franchisees in the same price zone.
all the plaintiff franchisees operate stations in the greater houston,texas,and corpus christi,texas,areas.the genesis of the dispute is the allegation that exxon has violated the law and its contracts with these franchisees for the purpose of converting their stores to cors by driving the franchisees out of business.
since,franchisees have been barred from purchasing their gas from jobbers,so all their purchases have been governed by the terms of the retail motor fuel store sales agreement,under which the dealer agrees to buy and receive directly from exxon all of the gasoline bought by dealer,and at least percent of the volume shown in a specified schedule dealer will pay exxon for delivered products at exxon price in effect at the time of the loading of the delivery vehicle.
this price in effect,also know as the dealer tank wagon price dtw,forms the heart of the present dispute.exxon claims this arrangement is the industry standard and that almost all sales of gasoline are governed by a similar price term.plaintiffs respond that the dtw price charged under this clause is consistently higher than the rack price paid by jobbers plus transportation costs 
the franchisees originally filed sherman act,clayton,act,and petroleum marketing practices act pmpa claims against exxon in addition to the breach of contract claim.the antitrust claims were abandoned,and the district court granted exxon a judgment as a matter of law on the pmpa claims.the court retained jurisdiction over the purely state law causes of action that had been supplemental to the federal claims 
trial proceeded solely on the texas breach of contract action,with only six plaintiffs testifying.the thrust of their testimony was that exxon had set the dtw price at an uncompetitive level to drive them out of business so as to replace their stores with cors.some of the plaintiffs testified that their franchises were unprofitable they presented documents and witnesses to show that exxon intended that result to drive them out of business.
the franchisees also submitted a market study showing that of the franchisees in corpus christi were selling gas below the dtw price.the franchisees supported their theory of the case by calling barry pulliam as an expert witness on the economics of the gasoline market in houston and corpus christi.pulliam concluded that exxon dtw price was not commercially reasonable from an economic perspective because it was a price that,over time,put the purchaser at a competitive disadvantage.pulliam noted that commercial reasonableness is a legal term,and he was not there to define it for the jury.
pulliam conclusion rested on two main facts.first,he showed that of the franchisee competitors were able to purchase gasoline at a lower price.second,he calculated a commercially reasonable dtw price by adding normal distribution charges to the average rack price of gasoline charged by exxon and its competitors.he concluded that exxon dtw price exceeded the sum of these other prices by four or more cents per gallon.
exxon countered with michael keeley,who testified that exxon dtw price was commercially reasonable because it reflected the company investment in land,the store,transportation,and managers.keeley explained that exxon recovers these costs through rent and the sale of gas.
the jury awarded of the overcharge calculated by pulliam.plaintiffs moved for attorney fees,as authorized by.civ.prac.ann.vernon,supported by a affidavit of lead counsel and an expert affidavit opining that the fees were reasonable.the court granted fees of of the damages.exxon raises three issues on appeal the court should have granted exxon motion for on the contract claim the court erred in permitting pulliam to testify and the fee award was erroneous.
exxon contends that because it charged its franchisees a dtw price comparable to that charged by its competitors,the breach of contract claim is precluded as a matter of law.we review the denial of using the same standards employed by the district court.coffel stryker,cir.although this is a issue,the standard for granting is a question of federal law.ellis weasler eng g,cir.

finally,we uphold a jury verdict if it is supported by evidence of the type and quality that fairly supports the verdict,even if the evidence would support other outcomes.gann fruehauf,cir.the question is whether there was evidence permitting the jury to conclude that exxon breached a term of the franchise agreement.
texas law,which tracks the uniform commercial code,implies a good faith component in any contract with an open price term.specifically,
t he parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled.in such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time of delivery a price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.
com.ann.vernon.the parties agree that the franchise agreement term governing the purchase of gasoline is an open price term.
the meaning of good faith is further defined in several other sections of the code.the definitions section explains good faith as honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.com.ann.vernon.wherever the term good faith is used throughout the code,it means as least what is here stated.com.ann.cmt.vernon.
additional meaning to the term may be added within a given article.id.section,regarding merchants,further explains the term good faith in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.com.ann.vernon finally,g ood faith includes the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade if the party is a merchant.section.but,in the normal case a posted price,price in effect,market price,or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.com.ann.cmt.vernon.
the key disagreement is over what constitutes a breach of the duty of good faith.exxon contends it has satisfied that duty because it has charged the plaintiffs a dtw price within the range of its competitors dtw prices,thereby satisfying the commercial reasonableness meaning of good faith.plaintiffs respond that good faith encompasses both objective and subjective duties.even if exxon is right,and its prices are within the range of its competitors,the argument runs,a subjective intent to drive the franchisees out of business would abridge the good faith duty of the open price term.
the pivotal provision is comment to.some of the language of comment and leaves the meaning of good faith for open price terms in doubt.comment mentions that good faith includes commercial reasonableness,but notes that certain established prices satisfy the good faith requirement.section defines good faith with the subjective honesty in fact test.thus,plaintiffs argue that an open price set according to a fixed schedule is set in good faith only if there is no improper motive animating the.exxon replies that comment speaks directly to prices set by a fixed schedule and consecrates them as in good faith per se.
in the absence of comment,there is no doubt exxon would be subject to both the subjective honesty in fact good faith of and the objective commercial reasonableness good faith of the difficult question is whether comment creates an exception to the normal principles of good faith governing the sale of goods.
no court in this circuit,and no texas state court,has squarely addressed this question fortunately,because the texas open price provision replicates that of the ucc,we can seek guidance from other courts 
to decide whether comment creates an exception,we turn first to the text of the comment and the related sections of the texas version of the ucc in full,comment reads,
subsection,dealing with the situation where the price is to be fixed by one party rejects the uncommercial idea that an agreement that the seller may fix the price means that he may fix any price he may wish by the express qualification that the price so fixed must be fixed in good faith.good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade if the party is a merchant.section.but in the normal case a posted price or a future seller or buyer given price,price in effect,market price,or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.
com.ann.cmt.vernon.
the bare text offers little to resolve the question.first,the comment notes that good faith includes reasonable commercial standards.this implies that the good faith required of a merchant setting an open price term encompasses both objective and subjective elements.the comment also creates a good faith safe harbor for such merchants when they use various sorts of fixed prices.but this safe harbor is applicable only in the normal case.this suggests the safe harbor is not absolute,but it does nothing to define what takes a case out of the safe harbor.
as we will explain,we conclude that the normal case of comment is coextensive with a merchant residual honesty in fact duty embodied in and.thus,the comment embraces both the objective commercial reasonableness and subjective honesty in fact senses of good faith objective good faith is satisfied by a price in effect as long as there is honesty in fact a normal case.this conclusion finds support in three sources the structure of the ucc,its legislative history,and the caselaw.
reading comment to embody two different meanings of good faith tracks the general structure of the ucc.courts and commentators have recognized that the meaning of good faith is not uniform throughout the code the cases and commentary treat the good faith found in article as subjective and the good faith found only in article as objective thus,there is nothing inconsistent in comment using good faith in both the objective and the subjective senses.
the history of comment bolsters this conclusion some drafters of the ucc worried that for the great many industries where sales are not made at fixed prices,such as the steel industry,where practically every contract is made at the seller price in effect,if is to apply it means that in every case the seller is going to be in a lawsuit or he could be,because there is any outside standard at all.proceedings of enlarged editorial bd.of am.law inst.sunday morning session,statement of bernard broeker.the drafters considered wholly exempting such contracts from,or stating that for a price in effect,the only test is whether the merchant engaged in price discrimination.one drafter explained that the steel industry wanted to make clear that we do not have to establish that we are fixing reasonable prices,because that gets you into the rate of return of profit,whether you are using borrowed money,and all those questions.id.
the committee responded to these worries with the current comment i n the normal case a posted price or a future seller or buyer given price,price in effect,market price,or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.the drafter solution was to avoid objective good faith challenges to prices set by reference to some price in effect,while preserving challenges to discriminatory pricing.see hearing before the enlarged editorial board january,vi business lawyer,explaining this intent.nothing in the proceedings leading to the addition of comment suggests that the overall subjective good faith duty of and was to be supplanted the evidence is quite to the contrary.
the drafters ultimately rejected two suggested addendums to 
an agreement to the effect that the price shall be or be adjusted to,or be based upon,or determined by reference to the seller going price,price in effect,regular price,market price,established price,or the like,at the time of the agreement or at any earlier or later time,is not an agreement to which this subsection is applicable.
an agreement such as this is an agreement under which the seller or the buyer does not have any burden of showing anything other than that he has not singled out the particular other party for discrimination.
proceedings of enlarged editorial bd.statement of bernard broeker.both of these recommendations are more sweeping than is the language ultimately adopted.the first would have omitted any mention of the good faith duty for open price provisions the second would have limited the duty of the to that of avoiding discrimination.
the existing comment,however,avoids challenges to prices set according to an open price term unless that challenge is outside the normal type of case.although price discrimination was the type of aberrant case on the minds of the drafters,price discrimination is merely a subset of what constitutes such an aberrant case.any lack of subjective,good faith is abnormal price discrimination is only the most obvious way a acts in bad treating buyers differently.
the caselaw supports this interpretation of comment.courts that have addressed the normalcy question have consistently held that a lack of subjective good faith takes a challenge outside the bounds of what is normal 
like the plaintiffs in nanakuli,allapattah,and wayman,the franchisees here are alleging a breach of good faith grounded not in exxon failure to price in accord with an established schedule,but in its failure to set the price in good faith.suits recognizing such a cause of action are rare,and with good reason we would be to consider a case to be outside the norm based only on an allegation of improper motive by the party setting the price 
plaintiffs produced enough evidence to escape comment normal case limitation.they showed,for example,that exxon planned to replace a number of its franchises with cors,that the dtw price was higher than the sum of the rack price and transportation,that exxon prevented the franchisees from purchasing gas from jobbers after,and that a number of franchisees were unprofitable or 
for example,one exxon document stated that the company marketing strategy for is to reduce dealer stores.another document set forth exxon plans to reduce dealer stations in houston from to,and to increase cors from to,between and.james carter,the regional director of the fuels marketing company,testified that exxon made more of a profit from a cors than from an independent lessee store.these plans and observations were validated by the fact that the number of dealer stations steadily declined.
an exhibit called the houston screening study evaluated the strategy of surplusing,eliminating of locations inside the highway loop.of the stations,would be done away with,but of the cors would be kept.
further indication of plans to shift from to cors is shown by exxon dissatisfaction with outlets featuring service bays.exxon documents showed that service associated with becoming less profitable,while stations with convenience associated with the wave of the future.a document entitled retail store chain outlook revealed exxon plan to reduce stations with service bays from to from to.that document included a plan to e xpand cors to improve profitability and to compete efficiently with private and e mphasize cors operations in markets with high level of rack to retail competition.
exxon answer on appeal is that these documents say nothing about using pricing to accomplish a plan to eliminate dealers.although that is so,there was sufficient evidence on this issue to go to the jury,which was free to,and apparently did,draw the inference connecting pricing to the elimination of.the consequence of the jury decision is that this case exceeds the normal case limit of comment.
we still,however,must examine the content of the duty of subjective good faith.although no texas or fifth circuit case has squarely addressed the meaning of the good faith clause of,texas courts repeatedly have held that the honesty in fact definition of good faith found in is tied to the actual belief of the participant in the transaction thus,the same version of the facts accepted by the exxon intended to drive the franchisees out of takes this case out of the normal set of cases for purposes of comment also satisfies the criteria for bad faith 
exxon bad faith,in this regard,is shown by the record.facing the competition of stations that were either selling food and other goods or had bare pumps with no overhead costs incurred in servicing vehicles,exxon decided years ago that retail marketing through franchise dealers was becoming economically unsound.although exxon decided to move to cors in houston and jobbers in corpus christi,this decision was not communicated to its franchisees.because of profit from their other sales,cors could,and did,sell gas for less than the franchise dealers paid to exxon for their gas.and the jobbers delivered exxon gas to their dealers for less than exxon franchisees were required to pay for their delivered gas,but exxon prohibited its franchisees from buying at this lower price from the jobbers.
the loss of competitive position and profit to plaintiff franchisees was inevitable and foreseeable to exxon.although exxon witnesses denied receiving complaints,its dealers testified that they had complained often and for years,without success,until the very eve of trial.
accordingly,the jury finding that exxon breached its duty of good faith in setting the dtw price it charged the plaintiffs is not without foundation in the law or the evidence.as we have recounted,plaintiffs offered ample evidence tending to prove their version of.accordingly,there is no error in the refusal to grant exxon on the breach of contract claim.
exxon challenges the admission of the testimony of plaintiffs expert,barry pulliam.although exxon filed a motion in limine opposing pulliam testimony,it did not object at trial.the objection is sufficient to preserve the error for appellate review.a.our review is thus for abuse of discretion.joiner,d moore ashland chem,cir en banc 
although the substantive aspects of this case are governed by texas law,the federal rules of evidence control the admission of expert testimony.doddy oxy usa,cir.all expert testimony is filtered through.and a.advisory committee note amendments kumho tire carmichael,d.
pulliam testimony,as an economist,satisfies the definition of expert testimony.marcel placid oil,cir.whether he is qualified to testify as an expert is a question of law.a.the party offering the expert must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered testimony satisfies the rule test.bourjaily united states,d.
the district court did not offer any reasons in support of admitting pulliam testimony.although a court must articulate its basis for admitting expert testimony,rodriguez riddell sports,cir,we will not invariably require remand for this reason alone.because admissibility is a legal to remand and further explication by the district will decide the question in this case without remanding.
rule lays out the test for admissibility of expert testimony 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
the requirement that the testimony assist the trier of fact means the evidence must be relevant.daubert merrell dow,d.rule defines relevant evidence as that which has any tendency to make any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
pulliam testimony centered on his calculation that exxon dtw price was at least four cents higher per gallon than what could be considered commercially reasonable by adding the rack price to transportation costs.this fact obviously makes more plausible plaintiffs theory that exxon set the dtw price with an intent to drive them out of business.there is no real contention regarding pulliam qualifications,as he has a master degree in economics.
the final rule hurdle is reliability,which is not a question that can be answered by some generic test.the variability of type and purpose of the particular testimony at issue requires flexibility in answering the reliability inquiry daubert,of course,provides an illustrative list of factors that may aid a court in evaluating reliability whether the expert theory can be or has been tested whether the theory has been subject to peer review and publication the known or potential rate of error of a technique or theory when applied the existence and maintenance of standards and controls and the degree to which the technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific community.moore ashland chem,cir en banc.
pulliam testimony primarily drew on general business and economic principles that satisfy the daubert factors.exxon argues,however,that pulliam should have conducted a competitive impact analysis for each station to show that exxon price caused it to lose business.this,exxon argues,would separate other factors from exxon pricing decision that may have depressed plaintiffs business.
although pulliam may not have isolated the precise effect exxon pricing had on each station,that was not the purpose of his testimony.the subject of his testimony,as listed by plaintiffs,was whether exxon had set a commercially reasonable price in an economic sense.this,the plaintiffs thought,would lend credibility to their theory that exxon had set the dtw price with the intent to drive them out of business.thus,to be both reliable and relevant for the purpose it was presented to serve,pulliam testimony need not isolate the precise impact exxon pricing had on each station.
exxon also attacks pulliam method of defining the relevant geographic market for each station.as exxon rightly points out,pulliam method of drawing a radius around each station is not especially sophisticated and may ignore local traffic patterns although pulliam method may be,it no doubt captures many of a station competitors.at worst,it is marginally under or.
again,we must bear in mind the purpose of pulliam testimony when addressing its reliability.pulliam main the price exxon charged its franchisees exceeded the rack price plus unaffected by any error in defining the competitive market for each station.also,the part of pulliam testimony as to which this objection may carry some percent of plaintiff competitors enjoyed a lower purchase price for not completely undercut by an under or definition of the relevant competitive market.finally,this certain proximate stations do not really compete with each precisely the type of objection a juror can evaluate.
the daubert analysis should not supplant trial on the merits.pipitone biomatrix,cir.v igorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.id.quoting daubert at.we find no abuse of discretion in the decision to admit pulliam
