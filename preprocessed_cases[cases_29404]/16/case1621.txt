this appeal involves a contractual dispute between cambridge toxicology group,cambridge toxicology and a group of attorneys.the parties litigated this case before a jury,and now,both cambridge toxicology and the defendant attorneys appeal several rulings of the district court on multiple grounds.we affirm the district court judgments.
factual and procedural background 
this lawsuit stems from a chemical release at the gaylord chemical plant in bogalusa,louisiana.a team of attorneys,informally known as the mississippi litigation group litigation group,represented the victims of the chemical exposure.the litigation group retained cambridge toxicology to provide expert services in the mississippi personal injury litigation.in,cambridge toxicology and the litigation group entered into three contracts a contract to perform a control study a contract for schrager to testify at a trial in mississippi and a contract to evaluate the individual plaintiffs.eventually,the litigation group withheld payment on the control study agreement,and the parties dispute whether cambridge toxicology completed the control study.
cambridge toxicology filed suit in massachusetts,but the federal district court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.shortly thereafter,in may,cambridge toxicology sued the defense attorneys in the eastern district of louisiana,alleging three counts of breach of contract,quantum meruit,promissory estoppel,violation of the massachusetts unfair business practice statute,and failure to pay a past due account.cambridge toxicology first amended complaint added a cause of action under the louisiana open account statute.in june,cambridge toxicology filed a second amended complaint.
the district court set a trial date for october,and a deadline to amend pleadings for october.cambridge toxicology moved for leave to file a third amended complaint in august,ten months after the deadline for amendments.the amendment sought to add the litigation group as a defendant and to add several causes of action.the magistrate judge denied this motion due to the expired deadline,lack of good cause,the pending trial date,and the fact that cambridge toxicology filed pleadings referring to the litigation group as early as november.the district court denied cambridge toxicology appeal and continued the trial date to allow settlement discussions.
on october,the district court granted motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants,holding that louisiana law governed the contracts dismissing the claim under the massachusetts unfair trade practices statute and holding that the control study and trial testimony agreements were not open accounts under the louisiana open account statute.on november,the district court continued the trial without setting a new date but later ordered that all current deadlines would remain in place.cambridge toxicology moved once again for leave to file its third amended complaint.the magistrate judge again denied the motion and the district court denied cambridge toxicology appeal of the magistrate judge order.the court reiterated that the trial date continuances were not meant to allow for further discovery or amended pleadings.
despite these denials and warnings,on july,cambridge toxicology filed another lawsuit against the same defendant attorneys,including the litigation group as a defendant.the causes of action were the same or substantially similar to those brought in the original action.on october,the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss cambridge toxicology second action as duplicative of the original action.the court also warned cambridge toxicology counsel that sanctions would be imposed for any additional frivolous or harassing tactics.following a status conference on november,the court entered an order prohibiting further motions for reconsideration absent clear error or an abuse of discretion and issued a sanctions warning.undeterred by the district court order,cambridge toxicology filed a reply to counterclaim,counterclaim,and demand on december,reasserting various claims against the defendants and the litigation group.the court granted the defendants motion to strike this pleading as duplicative.
in january,the district court commenced a jury trial on the merits.the jury found that the defendants did not owe cambridge toxicology any amounts under the control study agreement cambridge toxicology did not fail to perform its obligation under the control study agreement the claims for payment under the control study agreement were premature and the claims for payment under the individual evaluation agreements were not premature.the jury awarded cambridge toxicology over in damages.
the district court granted defendants motions in part,holding that cambridge toxicology was not entitled to attorney fees for the evaluation contract under the louisiana open account statute because the amounts claimed and the amounts actually awarded by the jury were inconsistent.the court also amended the wording of the judgment but rejected the defendants arguments that the evidence showed breach of the control study agreement and that the findings of prematurity were inconsistent with the verdicts.both parties appealed the district court judgment in case number.
meanwhile,the defendants moved for costs,expenses,and attorney fees in the district court.the court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation and awarded the defendants over in attorney fees and costs pursuant to against cambridge counsel,paul miniclier,for filing duplicative harassing pleadings.both parties,including cambridge toxicology legal representative,miniclier,now appeal the district court judgment in case number.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see gold,weems,bruser,sues rundell metal sales,cir.the district court held that the louisiana open account statute.ann,did not apply to the control study and trial testimony agreements.cambridge toxicology argues that the district court erred in concluding that its rendition of professional services did not establish an ongoing relationship between the parties.to the contrary,defendants argue that the contracts did not create a line of credit subject to future adjustment because the parties did not share an ongoing relationship.
an open account includes any account for which a part or all of the balance is past due,whether or not the account reflects one or more transactions and whether or not at the time of contracting the parties expected future transaction.d.this includes debts incurred for professional services beyond legal or medical services.id.louisiana courts,based on black law dictionary,define an open account as a n account which has not been finally settled or closed,but is still running or open to future adjustment or liquidation.open account,in legal as well as in ordinary language,means an indebtedness subject to future adjustment,and which may be reduced or modified by proof.black law dictionary ed see,dixie mach.welding metal works,gulf states marine,so d.the louisiana open account statute also provides for reasonable attorney fees incurred in the prosecution and collection of an open account.see a.the open account law is penal in nature and must be strictly construed.frank beier radio,black gold marine,so d.
a claim for breach of contract and a claim under the open account statute are considered distinct causes of action.see operational tech.envtl.contractors,so d.an open account is similar to a line of credit,hayes taylor,so d,and requires an ongoing relationship with an extension of credit to the debtor,salley colonial marine,so d.louisiana courts use four factors to determine whether a course of dealing qualifies as an open account whether there were other business transactions between the parties whether a line of credit was extended by one party to the other whether there are running or current dealings and whether there are expectations of other dealings.paz bg real estate,so d.
the control study agreement represents a contract,not an open account.cambridge toxicology and the defendant attorneys entered into a contractual agreement.the contract required cambridge toxicology to perform the study in exchange for an sum certain.although the statute permits recovery based on a single transaction,this feature alone does not subject the agreement to the open account statute.cambridge toxicology argues that a later compromise to defer payment until after the trial established a line of credit.in this instance,however,the deferred payment merely modified the originally agreed upon payment due date without establishing a line of credit.see,hayes,so d at.moreover,the parties memorialized their other dealings in two separate contracts,establishing that each transaction had definitive terms as opposed to the one contract encompassing the cost of all services provided via this business relationship.see,tyler haynes,so d.
similarly,the trial testimony agreement is a contract as opposed to an agreement subject to the open account statute.cambridge toxicology asserts the same argument regarding this agreement as asserted for the study,contending that the parties shared an ongoing relationship and that a line of credit existed because cambridge toxicology invoiced the defendant attorneys at regular intervals.cambridge toxicology never extended a line of credit,however,as contemplated under the open account statute,and more importantly,the contract involved testimony for a single trial.the district court made a factual finding that the parties expected schrager to testify at only one trial as reflected in the contract for schrager services.cambridge toxicology provides no evidence that this finding constitutes clear error.more importantly,based on our review of the record,we find nothing to contradict the notion that cambridge toxicology and the defendants entered into an agreement for schrager to prepare and present expert testimony at only one trial.the record does not support cambridge toxicology contention that schrager was to testify at any future proceedings.see haynes,so d at open accounts are open to future modification because of expectations of prospective business dealings.services are recurrently granted over a period of time.accordingly,we conclude that the control study and trial testimony agreements are not subject to the open account statute.
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law.fiber.int l,roehrs,cir.the district court denied attorney fees to cambridge toxicology on the individual evaluations contract,which is subject to the open account statute,because it did not demand the correct amounts.cambridge toxicology demanded over,but the jury awarded,a discrepancy of nearly.
to receive attorney fees,the louisiana open account statute requires the claimant to send a written demand therefore correctly setting forth the amount owed.a.this court noted in haynes that louisiana courts interpret the correct amount requirement with great stringency,requiring that if a claimant bill is adjusted by the court to any degree whatsoever,that claimant is held to have failed to meet the statutory requirement of giving notice as to the correct amount owed.at citing cases see also hub detectives,martinez,so d.on the other hand,louisiana cases also provide that t he amount stated in the demand letter and the amount recovered in the judgment do not have to be the same for a party to recover attorney fees.sears,roebuck larose,so d.louisiana courts have followed this rule in cases wherein the discrepancy arises from accrued interest,see,or from credits allowed for additional payments,see guidry seafood,farmers seafood,so d.
here,the jury awarded almost less than cambridge toxicology demanded in its complaint.the district court correctly concluded that such a significant discrepancy precludes a finding that cambridge toxicology attempted to set forth the accurate amount owed on the account.see haynes,at affirming denial of attorney fees where discrepancy between amount demanded and amount awarded was.a contrary holding would conflict with louisiana correct amount requirement for this reason,cambridge toxicology is not entitled to attorney fees.
the district court concluded that louisiana law governed the contract and granted summary judgment to the defendants on cambridge toxicology claim brought under the massachusetts unfair trade practices law.we conduct a de novo review of issues such as those raised in this appeal.mgmt.cfs.midstream,cir.cambridge toxicology contends that the court should have applied the rule for delictual obligations because its massachusetts claim sounds in tort,not contract.cambridge toxicology also argues that the district court erred by failing to perform a separate analysis for each cause of action,a concept known as depecage,because the case involves three contracts.
a federal court sitting in diversity applies the rules of the forum state.erie tompkins.mgmt,at.the district court applied the louisiana rule for conventional obligations.article of the louisiana civil code,provides that 
except as otherwise provided in this title,an issue of conventional obligations is governed by the law of the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law were not applied to that case.
the state is determined by evaluating the strength and pertinence of the relevant policies of the involved states in the light of the pertinent contacts of each state to the parties and the transaction,including the place of negotiation,formation,and performance of the contract,the location of the object of the contract,and the place of domicile,habitual residence,or business of the parties the nature,type,and purpose of the contract and the policies referred to in article,as well as the policies of facilitating the orderly planning of transactions,of promoting multistate commercial intercourse,and of protecting one party from undue imposition by the other.
as to whether the district court applied the proper provision.reads in pertinent part that 
except as otherwise provided in this title,an issue of delictual or obligations is governed by the law of the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law were not applied to that issue.
the substance of both articles,respectively governing torts and contracts,require substantially the same determination by the district court.both articles require the courts assess which state policies would be most seriously impaired if its laws were not applied to that issue and both articles direct the court to evaluate the strength and pertinence of the relevant state policies in light of the pertinent contacts of each state to the parties.robinson am.marine holdings,wl.thus,even assuming the district court erred in applying,we review the substance of the district analysis to determine whether the court properly applied louisiana law.
the following factors weigh in favor of applying massachusetts law cambridge toxicology is domiciled in massachusetts the control study was to be completed in massachusetts and the defendants contacted cambridge toxicology in massachusetts by telephone.on the other hand,several factors weigh in favor of louisiana interest.first,the defendant attorneys primarily lived in louisiana.second,the victims of the chemical exposure also lived in louisiana,where cambridge toxicology was to evaluate the victims.third,the chemical exposure giving rise to the underlying litigation occurred in louisiana.in sum,as recognized by the district court,the parties entered into the three contracts for the sole purpose of cambridge performing work for a group of mostly louisiana attorneys representing louisiana residents for alleged injuries arising out of a chemical release that occurred in louisiana.moreover,despite cambridge toxicology domicile,the contract required cambridge toxicology to spend extended periods of time in louisiana for the individual evaluations,and the conduct causing cambridge toxicology alleged injury occurred in louisiana.for these reasons,we affirm the district court application of louisiana law.
to briefly address cambridge toxicology final argument,even recognizing that louisiana analyzes each claim separately,the defendants requested that the district court grant summary judgment on two issues count six of cambridge toxicology complaint regarding whether massachusetts law applied to the subject contracts and whether cambridge toxicology claim is a suit on an open account.the trial court then conducted a proper choice of law analysis for count six,the unfair trade practices claim,and determined that the substantive law of louisiana applied.
in this appeal,cambridge toxicology now argues that the district court improperly analyzed the three separate contracts by lumping them together.the trial court needed not conduct the analysis for each individual contract because cambridge toxicology pleaded this count in general language stating that defendants engaged in unfair business practices by,among other things,failing to pay the plaintiff for the amounts due and owing and by using false and deceptive means in an effort to avoid paying legitimate debts.just as cambridge toxicology presented this claim in a single count,not distinguishing the defendants alleged tortious behavior as related to each contract,the district court appropriately disposed of the issue in a single analysis.the remaining issues decided by the october,order and reasons involved whether the contested contracts qualify as open accounts under the louisiana open account statute thus,the terms of the second issue inherently vitiate any need for a analysis.
although cambridge toxicology previously amended its complaint on two occasions,it sought to amend a third time in november,over one year after the expiration of the deadline for amendments.the district court affirmed the magistrate judge denial of cambridge toxicology last request because cambridge toxicology knew in october of sufficient facts to assert its newer claims and any delay would cause prejudice to the defendants.cambridge toxicology contends that the district court erred in not allowing it to file a third amended complaint after the court continued the trial without date.we review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion,llc southtrust bank of,cir.
federal rules of civil procedure rule b governs amendment of pleadings after the expiration of a scheduling order deadline and requires a showing of good cause to amend the order.cambridge toxicology acknowledges this standard but rests its argument on the more liberal rule.cambridge toxicology contends that it lacked sufficient information to plead fraud with particularity any earlier than november because the defendants engaged in discovery abuses,which prevented it from uncovering pertinent facts.the district court and magistrate judge properly rejected this argument.see hawthorne land occidental chem,cir.for this reason,there was no abuse of discretion in denying cambridge toxicology motion for leave to amend.
cambridge toxicology appeals the district court dismissal of its second complaint and grant of the defendants motion to strike cambridge toxicology reply to counterclaim,counterclaim,and demand.relying on save power syntek fin,cir,the court dismissed cambridge toxicology second complaint as duplicative litigation.see id.at holding that substantial overlap between two cases required for consolidation or dismissal,but suits and parties need not be identical.the standard of review in this court for the dismissal of duplicative litigation is not a settled matter,but other courts review for abuse of discretion.see curtis citibank,cir.because the two cases were already consolidated,the court found that cambridge toxicology second complaint substantially overlapped with the original action but preserved cambridge toxicology claims that arose after the filing of the original complaint.see curtis,at.
cambridge toxicology argues that this court should review the ruling de novo because the district court dismissed the second complaint based on the doctrine of res judicata.cambridge toxicology argument overlooks that duplicative litigation is a separate and distinct basis for dismissal.the district court further explained why cambridge toxicology conduct was duplicative in this action 
the court finds it must reiterate that point for what it fervently hopes is the last time cambridge toxicology was not allowed to add the litigation group as a party to the first lawsuit because its undue delay in seeking to amend prejudiced the defendants.cambridge toxicology was not allowed to add the litigation group to the second lawsuit for the same reason.cambridge toxicology will not be allowed to assert a third party demand against the litigation group,nor to use this third party demand to escape the doctrine of res judicata.if cambridge toxicology had wished to sue the litigation group,it had an opportunity to do so in.it missed that opportunity.
based on our review of the record,cambridge toxicology second suit attempts to circumvent the district court previous adverse rulings.
this court reviews a motion to strike for abuse of discretion.mccorstin dep t of labor,cir see also bjc health columbia cas,cir.for the same reasons stated above with respect to the duplicative litigation issue,the district court decision to strike cambridge toxicology reply to counterclaim,counterclaim,and demand,was also not an abuse of discretion.this pleading also essentially attempts to circumvent the court multiple denials.the court granted the defendants motion to strike because cambridge toxicology pleadings constitute more of the patently duplicative litigation that has run rampant throughout this litigation cambridge toxicology does not have the right to use its reply and counterclaim to circumvent or blatantly ignore the court prior rulings.
federal rules of civil procedure rule f allows the court to strike from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant,immaterial,impertinent,or scandalous matter.the district court judgment constitutes an appropriate use of the court discretion to strike redundant,immaterial,and impertinent pleadings under rule f.based on the record,these issues had been repeatedly decided by the court,and it properly refused to entertain the same issues again cloaked as newly raised claims.
cambridge toxicology contends that the district court erred by failing to either order defendants reich and fleming to appear at trial or default them.defendants argue that the court correctly concluded that it could not order the defendants to appear because they were not within the court subpoena power.thus,the court lacked a basis upon which to default the defendants because they appeared at trial through counsel.this court reviews a district court decision on entry of a default judgment for abuse of discretion.see smith smith,cir.
the parties dispute the implications of gfi computer,fry,cir,in which the court held that entry of default was not warranted where the court had no power to force a defendant outside its subpoena jurisdiction to personally appear at trial.id.at.gfi controls this issue.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order the defendants to appear at trial or enter a default judgment.
this court reviews de novo the district court denial of a motion for jmol,applying the same standards as the district court.see adams groesbeck indep.sch,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.the jury found that cambridge toxicology performed its obligations under the control study agreement,and the district court denied the defendants motions because the jury was entitled to credit portions of schrager testimony in which he stated that he had completed a publishable study and a report.defendants contend that cambridge toxicology never produced the control study.they cite schrager trial testimony in which he admits that the study was complete when he stopped working on it and later admitted that he never gave the study to the defendants.
in response,cambridge toxicology points to several portions of schrager testimony upon which the jury could have based its verdict.schrager testified that the study was completed and that the data was of pub
