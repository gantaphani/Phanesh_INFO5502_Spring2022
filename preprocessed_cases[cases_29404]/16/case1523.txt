this case began as a suit for contract damages initiated by northrop grumman ship systems northrop,a shipbuilder based in mississippi,against the ministry of defense of the republic of venezuela the republic.several years into the litigation,one of the republic attorneys,richard scruggs scruggs of mississippi,purported to agree to a settlement by which the republic would pay northrop million to resolve all claims.the district court entered judgment based on the alleged settlement.the republic subsequently moved to vacate this judgment,arguing that it had not approved the settlement and scruggs did not have authority to enter a binding agreement absent such approval.the district court denied the motion to vacate and ordered enforcement of the settlement.venezuela now appeals.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand.
in,northrop entered into a contract with the republic the agreement to overhaul and retrofit two frigates of the republic navy.the work was to be performed in pascagoula,mississippi.the agreement provided that any disputes in connection with the contract would be submitted to arbitration in caracas,venezuela the clause and that unresolved disputes thereafter would be resolved by the competent courts of venezuela the clause.
as work on the ships proceeded between and,disputes arose over cost overruns and other issues.in october,northrop filed a complaint against the republic in federal district court in mississippi.northrop asserted claims for injunctive relief and at least million in damages based on the republic failure to pay for extra work,and alleged jurisdiction pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia the republic failed to appear or respond to the complaint and a default was entered.
in november,northrop moved to compel the republic to arbitrate pursuant to the agreement,but requested that the district court order arbitration in mississippi instead of caracas as required by the clause.northrop submitted evidence that arbitration in venezuela would be unreasonable due to that nation political unrest.in april,the district court ordered arbitration in the united states,concluding that the agreement clause should not be enforced because the violently unstable political situation in venezuela has rendered that country an unsuitable forum at this time.when the republic failed to respond to the order,the court appointed an arbitrator on the republic behalf.an arbitration site was eventually selected in mexico city,and preliminary proceedings were held in august and september without the republic participation.
in november,the republic retained florida attorney steven marks marks of the law firm podhurst orseck,the podhurst firm,mississippi attorney scruggs,and venezuelan attorney aquiles mendez mendez.the attorney general of venezuela executed a written authorizing marks and scruggs to carry out any and all legal actions necessary for the best defense of the rights and interests of the republic in the mississippi litigation.in january,the republic appeared in the district court through scruggs.the republic moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and to vacate the order compelling arbitration outside of venezuela because it conflicted with the agreement clause.in march,the district entered an order staying the ongoing mexico city arbitration and the parties voluntarily agreed to a mediation before a magistrate judge in the interim.the mediation concluded without an agreement,but the parties continued to attempt to negotiate a settlement over the subsequent months.
on september,scruggs telephoned northrop representatives and stated that the republic was willing to pay million to settle all monetary claims.northrop accepted scruggs offer on september.scruggs circulated a letter confirming the agreement to his marks and mendez the following day however,there is no indication that any venezuelan official was informed of the settlement.northrop relayed the news of the parties agreement to the magistrate judge,who,after confirming the settlement with scruggs,entered an order dismissing the case on october.
five days later,the attorney general of venezuela sent a letter of protest objecting to the settlement.the letter stated that scruggs is not authorized and has never been authorized to compromise the republic trial against northrop and that the republic expressly rejected any purported settlement.the republic subsequently moved to vacate the district court order of dismissal,arguing inter alia that scruggs,as an agent of the republic,did not have actual authority to bind the republic to a settlement.the republic maintained that scruggs was only given authority to negotiate,not to enter a specific settlement without the republic approval.northrop responded with an affidavit from scruggs stating that he had received express authority to settle during a telephone conference significantly,both parties initially briefed the issue of scruggs authority pursuant to the agency law of mississippi.
throughout much of,resolution of the republic motion to vacate was delayed as scruggs moved to withdraw as counsel and filed a against the republic for attorney fees.the republic retained new counsel in december.in april,the republic filed notice pursuant to fed.civ.rule that it intended to rely on venezuelan law with regard to the issue of scruggs authority to settle.see fed.civ.a party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country law must give notice by a pleading or other writing.the republic submitted english translations of several venezuelan statutes which,according to the republic,collectively require an attorney representing the venezuelan government to have written authorization prior to settling a dispute.in response,northrop argued that the notice of foreign law was untimely.
on september,the district court ruled on the motion to vacate.the court first declined the republic request to rely on the venezuelan statutes.the court reasoned that the republic rule notice was untimely and that,regardless of any delay,mississippi substantive law controlled under applicable principles.the district court then applied mississippi agency law and determined that scruggs possessed actual authority to bind the republic to the settlement accordingly,the court denied the republic motion to vacate and ordered the enforcement of the settlement.
the republic now appeals the enforcement of the settlement.the republic also appeals the district court refusal to enforce the clause and requests this court to dismiss this case outright pursuant to the agreement separate clause.northrop,arguing that the district court erred in refusing to award prejudgment interest from the time of the initial settlement agreement.
the republic primarily challenges the district court determination that the settlement was enforceable because scruggs had actual to bind the republic to the agreement.under this general heading,the republic contends that the district court erred by refusing to consider the proffered venezuelan statutes because the republic failed to give reasonable notice pursuant to rule concluding that the restatement second of conflict of laws mandated the application of mississippi agency law instead of venezuelan law and finding that scruggs possessed actual authority under an application of mississippi agency law.we consider each alleged error in turn.
the republic first appeals the determination that it failed to provide timely notice of its intent to rely on foreign law as required by rule.as the second and ninth circuits have explained,b ecause rule grants the district court discretion in determining reasonable notice,we review the district court application of this standard for abuse of discretion.dp aviation smiths indus.aerospace defense,cir accord rationis enterprises of panama hyundai mipo dockyard,cir.

here,the republic filed its rule notice in april months after the republic initially moved to set aside the settlement in september.the district court concluded that this was unreasonable because the length of time which has passed since the case was filed and the progress made to date in the case militates against the use of venezuelan law in this case.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion.while eighteen months is an extended delay,rule is intended to prevent unfair surprise,not to impose any specific time limit.advisory notes emphasis added see also thyssen steel.at accepting notice of foreign law that was first provided on remand,nearly four years after the suit was filed.here,northrop does not allege that it was prevented from responding or otherwise prejudiced by the delayed notice nor could it make such an argument first,the republic referenced the applicability of venezuelan law as early as december second,while the republic did not expressly state its intent to rely on venezuelan law or file a formal rule motion until,the district court did not subsequently rule on the underlying motion until september.thus,northrop had at least five months to respond or to note any discrepancies in the republic recitation of venezuelan law.see thyssen steel.at n otice is sufficient if it gives the opposing party time to research the foreign rules.
moreover,the extended delay in this case is partly explained by the withdrawal of scruggs as the republic counsel over the course of.from the time that the republic retained its current counsel in december,only three months elapsed before the republic expressly indicated its intent to rely on venezuelan law in march.finally,we note that the issue of foreign law sought to be raised here is crucial to the case as a whole.see advisory notes.as explained in more detail below,the applicability of the venezuelan statutes to the issue of scruggs authority directly affects the enforceability of the settlement.
accordingly,the district court abused its discretion by relying solely on the length of delay.given the lack of prejudice to the opposing party and the importance of the issue to the case,the republic rule notice should have been accepted 
next,the republic contends that the district court erred in determining that mississippi substantive law,not venezuelan law,governed the issue of scruggs authority.we review a district court determination de novo.cates creamer,cir.
because this case arises under the fsia,we apply the rules of the forum state.see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir i n fsia cases,we use the forum state choice of law rules to resolve all issues,except jurisdictional ones.accord holy see,cir.the state of mississippi looks to the restatement second of conflict of laws on questions.see zurich am.ins.goodwin,so d.
in applying the restatement second,courts should look to the section that is most relevant to the particular issue at hand.see restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.d see also mcdaniel ritter,so d,t he law of a single state does not necessarily control every issue in a given case.here,the particular issue is an agent ability to bind a principal,which is directly addressed by section of the restatement second.section provides 
contractual liability of principal to third person 
whether a principal is bound by action taken on his behalf by an agent in dealing with a third person is determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to the particular issue,has the most significant relationship to the parties and the transaction under the principles stated in.
the principal will be held bound by the agent action if he would so be held bound under the local law of the state where the agent dealt with the third person,provided at least that the principal had authorized the agent to act on his behalf in that state or had led the third person reasonably to believe that the agent had such authority.
restatement second of conflict of laws.northrop contends that subsection authorizes the application of mississippi agency law in this case.under the terms of subsection,the republic is bound by scruggs actions if the republic would so be held bound under the local law of the state where scruggs dealt with northrop,provided at least that the republic had authorized scruggs to act on its behalf in that state.see id.it is undisputed that scruggs dealt with northrop in mississippi,as northrop is based in mississippi and scruggs was hired due to his residency in the state.it is also undisputed that the republic authorized scruggs to represent,sustain,and defend its rights and patrimonial interests in mississippi.moreover,the fact that the settlement may have exceeded the scope of scruggs authority does not negate the applicability of subsection.see restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.d a principal who authorizes an agent to act on his behalf in a state assumes the risk that he will be held bound under the local law of that state by action,whether authorized or unauthorized,that is taken there by the agent on his behalf.accord fasa playmates toys.thus,northrop is entitled to the application of mississippi agency law under the plain terms of subsection 
accordingly,the district court correctly selected mississippi agency law as controlling in the instant dispute.
finally,the republic contends that the district court erred in finding that scruggs had actual authority to enter the settlement under mississippi agency law.we review a district court legal conclusions as to the content of state law de novo.see in re liljeberg enterprises,cir.however,we review factual determinations such as the boundaries of an agent authority for clear error.see hudak econ.research analysts,cir applying florida law.
under mississippi law,the burden of showing that an attorney does not have the authority to enter a settlement is on the party denying such authority.see terrain enterprises,western cas.and sur,cir applying mississippi law.here,the district court held that the republic failed to meet this burden.the court reasoned that scruggs had actual authority to enter the settlement under either venezuelan or mississippi law because the republic granted scruggs a to represent its interests in the mississippi litigation.
on appeal,the parties initially dispute the applicable rules for conveying actual authority to an agent under mississippi law.northrop argues that a principal may confer the authority to enter a contract orally or by implication.the republic concedes that this is true as a general rule,but contends that due to the republic status as a sovereign,mississippi courts would give effect to the venezuelan statutes requiring settlement authority to be specifically conveyed in writing.the supreme court of mississippi has never addressed whether courts should give effect to a foreign sovereign own regulations for conveying actual authority to its agents.accordingly,as an erie court,we must forecast how the mississippi supreme court would rule on this issue based on mississippi case law,dicta,general rules on the issue,decisions of other states,and secondary sources.paz brush engineered materials,cir.
we begin with general principles under mississippi law,an agent a ctual authority may be express or implied.migerobe,certina usa,cir applying mississippi law.it is deemed express if granted in either written or oral specific terms.id.emphasis added.it is deemed implied if the authority is a necessary or incidental part of the express authority.id.mississippi courts also look to the restatement third of agency.general am.life ins.mccraw,so d.according to the restatement third,a ctual authority is created by a principal manifestation to an agent that,as reasonably understood by the agent,expresses the principal assent that the agent take action on the principal behalf.restatement third of agency.
it is clear from the foregoing that the authority to enter a contract may be conveyed orally and that no formal writing is required as a general rule of mississippi law.however,we conclude that this case presents an exception to that general rule,based on its connection to a related mississippi doctrine mississippi courts have long adhered to the doctrine,which provides that i n respect to public contracts where a particular manner of contracting is prescribed,the manner is the measure of power and must be followed to create a valid contract.bruner of southern,so d,internal quotation marks omitted.in a series of cases,mississippi courts have applied this doctrine to deny the authority of government agents who are alleged to have bound government entities to contracts.for example,in bd.of trs.of state insts.of higher learning peoples bank of,the supreme court of mississippi considered whether a employee could bind a state university to a lease contract.so d.applying the doctrine,the court reasoned that the employee lacked authority because a state statute required the university purchasing department to approve all lease contracts.see also bruner,so d at finding that a state university football coach lacked the authority to bind the university because a state statute required the approval of the board of trustees for all employment contracts.
the crux of these cases is clear whatever the form in which the government functions,anyone entering into an arrangement with the government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the government stays within the bounds of his authority.the scope of this authority may be explicitly defined by congress or be limited by delegated legislation smith federal crop.ins,so d,quoting federal crop ins.merrill.in other words,a government entity has the power to define how and when it enters a contract,and,by extension,how and when its agents have authority to create contracts on its behalf see id.
exercising our duty under erie,we predict that the supreme court of mississippi would afford this same privilege to foreign sovereigns.the same concerns that animate the doctrine in the context of state and federal as protection of the public treasury and the inherent difficulty of monitoring a multitude of agents in a with equal force to foreign sovereigns.see generally restatement third of agency,cmt.g a sovereign has the exclusive ability to prescribe what its creations and its agents may do third parties who deal with national governments,entities,states,counties,and municipalities take the risk of error regarding the agent authority to a greater degree than do third parties dealing through agents with nongovernmental principals.northrop has not advanced any legitimate reason for mississippi courts to discriminate against foreign sovereigns in particular.accordingly,we conclude that the supreme court of mississippi would give effect to venezuelan statutes that define procedures for conveying settlement authority.
however,our inquiry is not yet finished,as the parties dispute the effect of the venezuelan statutes on the facts at hand.the republic provided translations of two relevant venezuelan authorities 
special decree with force of organic law of the attorney general,art.article the lawyers who exercise in trials the representation of the republic can not settle or use any other alternative means for the solution of the conflict,without the express authorization of the attorney general of the republic,with previous written instructions from the maximum authority of the respective office.emphasis added.
civil procedure code,art.article the power of attorney authorizes the empowered to carry on all the acts of the process that are not reserved exclusively by law to the party himself but in order to agree to the demand,withdraw,compromise,or to receive sums of money and dispose of litigation rights,express authority is required.
northrop contends that scruggs had actual authority to bind the republic even if these statutes are given effect.northrop argues and the district court implicitly held that the written and the initial engagement letter provided to scruggs satisfy the writing requirement of article we disagree.
under the terms of article,an attorney must have written instructions from the maximum authority of the relevant government office.read in context of both statutes,this clause requires a written document that specifically authorizes the attorney to enter a settlement.documents that merely evidence the relationship,such as a written,do not implicitly convey the authority to settle a dispute,as such authority must be express ly granted see article.here,neither the initial engagement letter nor the written mention the power to conclude a settlement.accordingly,northrop has not identified any document that satisfies the writing requirement of article.
in sum,the district court clearly erred in determining that scruggs had actual authority to bind the republic to the settlement.even if this court were to accept scruggs uncorroborated testimony that he received oral authorization over the phone from his fellow,such authorization would be contrary to the particular manner of contracting prescribed for government settlements under venezuelan law.see bruner,so d at.under mississippi agency law,the settlement is not enforceable accordingly,the district court erred in denying the republic motion to vacate the settlement.
the republic also appeals the district court order compelling the parties to arbitrate in the united states instead of caracas,venezuela as required under the agreement clause.in,when the republic had yet to appear in the mississippi litigation,northrop moved for an order compelling arbitration in mississippi instead of venezuela.in april,the court granted northrop request,concluding that the agreement clause should not be enforced because the violently unstable political situation in venezuela has rendered that country an unsuitable forum at this time.the district court did not provide any analysis of the conditions in venezuela or make any specific findings to facilitate our review of this decision.see generally in re air crash disaster near new orleans,cir instructing the lower court to set out its findings and conclusions to facilitate the review of forum non conveniens orders,aff in relevant part,cir en banc.however,we need not reach the merits of the district court ruling as noted previously,the mexico city arbitration that resulted from the order was terminated without decision during the pendency of this appeal.accordingly,the district court refusal to enforce the refusal that was presumably based on the conditions in venezuela in and is now moot.
the republic requests that this court take a further step and order arbitration in caracas in compliance with the agreement.in response,northrop contends that venezuela remains an unsuitable forum.northrop also suggests that the republic has permanently waived its right to enforce the clause by failing to appear in the litigation.we have found no authority suggesting that a party previous failure to appear constitutes absolute waiver of contractual rights.moreover,in disputes involving foreign sovereigns,this court has long favored the resolution of legal issues on the merits where possible.see mci telecomms.alhadhood,cir w hen a defendant foreign state has appeared and asserts legal defenses,albeit after a default judgment has been entered,it is important that those defenses be considered carefully and,if possible,that the dispute be resolved on the basis of all relevant legal argument.quoting practical concepts,republic of
