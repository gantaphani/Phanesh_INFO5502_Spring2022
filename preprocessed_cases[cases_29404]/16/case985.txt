sloviter,circuit judge.
this appeal concerns a contract dispute over the distribution of profits from medical patents.in particular,it involves patent the patent,awarded to appellant david jang for coronary stent technology.jang,a doctor and inventor,sued boston scientific corporation bsc,the company to which jang assigned his coronary stent patents,for breach of the patent assignment agreement agreement.the agreement requires bsc to share profits from the patents with jang,including any damages it recovers from infringers.in,bsc settled a claim against the cordis corporation cordis for infringement of the patent in combination with a claim that cordis had against bsc.the net result was that bsc made a payment to cordis,and the parties exchanged several patent licenses.bsc then denied that it had recovered any damages that it was obligated to share with jang,and jang sued.
the central question in the case is whether the agreement provision that requires bsc to share any recovery of damages from infringers c extends to the benefits that bsc received in the cordis settlement.according to jang allegations,bsc infringement claim won it a significant return a offset in its damages payment to cordis,as well as valuable patent licenses.bsc contends that neither of these qualify as damages under the plain meaning of c.jang argues that they do qualify as damages,or in the alternative,that bsc violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by structuring a settlement to thwart the purpose of c.in addition,jang argues that bsc violated the agreement provision,by licensing his patents to cordis.
the district court granted judgment on the pleadings for bsc,and denied his motion for reconsideration and leave to amend his complaint to add the claim.we must decide whether it did so in error.
background 
a.the assignment agreement 
in,jang assigned a series of his coronary stent patents to bsc through its wholly owned subsidiary,boston scientific scimed,scimed.bsc and scimed develop,manufacture and market medical devices.the assignment agreement granted bsc the exclusive rights to develop and sell stents using jang patents,and to prosecute suits against third parties.in return,bsc paid jang approximately million up front.it also agreed to pay him ten percent of future profits from his patents in the agreement terminology,ten percent of net sales of contingent payment products with the payments capped at million finally,bsc agreed that if its profits from the jang patents reached billion within five years,it would pay jang an additional million.
the agreement defined net sales to include revenue from bsc own sales as well as any damages obtained from infringers.section c,the key provision in this case,directed that any recovery of damages from an infringement suit or settlement should first be used to pay bsc legal expenses the balance is deemed part of bsc net sales,such that bsc must pay jang ten percent,and also count the recovery toward the billion threshold.app.at.section c does not extend to special or punitive damages.id 
the agreement also included an provision,which prohibited either party from assign ing its rights or obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of the other party,and required any assignee to agree in writing to assume all of the obligations of the assignor under the agreement.app.at 
b.the cordis litigation and settlement 
in,cordis,another manufacturer of coronary stents,sued bsc in the district of delaware for infringement of two patents.bsc filed a counterclaim against cordis for infringement of jang patent.the claims were severed in,separate juries returned verdicts finding that cordis had infringed the jang patent,and that bsc had infringed the cordis patents.the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed both verdicts.
bsc was therefore entitled to damages from cordis for infringement of the jang patent,and cordis was entitled to damages from bsc for infringement of cordis patents.jang complaint alleges that each company owed the other several billion dollars.a damages trial was scheduled for february.
on the eve of the damages trial,bsc and cordis settled.the settlement agreement provided for only one cash payment approximately billion from bsc to cordis.jang alleges,and bsc appears to admit,that this represented the net difference between the companies claims cordis damages minus bsc damages.as bsc wrote in its brief,the damages to which it was entitled for the infringement translated into a settlement offset against the damages it owed cordis.appellees br.at.jang alleges that bsc payment to cordis was offset by several billion dollars.
the settlement also entailed an exchange of licenses.bsc granted cordis,perpetual,irrevocable,fully and retroactive licenses on eleven jang patents,including the patent.cordis granted bsc,perpetual,irrevocable,fully and retroactive licenses on ten cordis patents.each company released its infringement claims against the other.
jang contract suit against bsc 
following the settlement,bsc denied that it had recovered any damages that it was obligated under the agreement to share with jang.jang filed suit.he brought the case in the central district of california on diversity grounds it was transferred to the district of delaware to follow the litigation between bsc and cordis.
jang complaint presented five claims that bsc breached the agreement by refusing to pay jang his share of the infringement recovery that bsc breached the agreement by refusing to pay jang his share of the value from the licensing of his patents breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach of fiduciary duty and a demand for the enforcement of an equitable lien that jang had claimed on bsc right to recover from cordis.
each party moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.jang,in subsequent briefing,alleged that bsc had also breached the agreement provision,by licensing his patents without his permission.he noted that he would be prepared to amend the complaint to add this claim.app.at.he did not,however,amend the complaint.
the district court granted judgment for bsc.of relevance here,it held that the value bsc obtained in the cordis settlement did not constitute a recovery of damages under c of the agreement,and that there could be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing absent a breach of the contract express terms.the court declined to address jang claim on the ground that jang had not pled it,and dismissed jang complaint with prejudice.jang timely moved for reconsideration and for leave to amend the complaint.the district court denied the motion.
jang now appeals.he argues that the district court erred in dismissing his first claim that it erred in dismissing his alternative claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that it erred in refusing to consider his claim and dismissing the complaint with prejudice and that it erred in denying his motion for reconsideration and leave to amend 
ii.jurisdiction and applicable law 
the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
the agreement includes a provision specifying that massachusetts law shall govern its interpretation.if there is no controlling decision from a state highest court,we must predict how that court would decide,giving due regard,but not conclusive effect to decisions from lower courts.nationwide mut.ins.buffetta,cir.
iii.analysis 
breach of contract 
jang claims that bsc breached c of the agreement by refusing to pay him a share of the damages it recovered for cordis infringement of the jang patent.the district court found that bsc had not breached the agreement because it had not recovered any damages.we exercise plenary review of the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings.see knepper rite aid,cir.c.we may affirm only if,viewing all the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,no material issue of fact remains and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
under massachusetts law,the interpretation of a contract is,in the first instance,a matter of law,but the meaning of an ambiguous provision is a question of fact.see seaco ins.barbosa.contract language is ambiguous only if it is susceptible of more than one meaning and reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper one.union dep t of pub,quoting citation ins.gomez.
the district court found that c unambiguously referred to cash received or monetary profits.jang bos.scientific scimed,d.it reasoned that the provision terms damages,the balance,upon receipt,and from such recovery amount plainly allude to monetary gain.see id.at.we do not disagree.see black law dictionary ed defining damages as m oney claimed by,or ordered to be paid to,a person as compensation for loss or injury.
jang argues for a broader reading of damages,but in vain the cases he cites simply address what kinds of loss damages can compensate.see salvas wal mart stores,noting that damages means the equivalent in money for the actual loss sustained by the wrong of another quoting bartlett tree expert hartney,hazen paper fid.guar,finding that damages in an insurance policy covered costs of environmental cleanup berube selectment of edgartown,damages is the word which expresses in dollars and cents the injury sustained by a plaintiff.these cases simply confirm that the ordinary meaning of damages is a sum of money 
the conclusion that c refers only to monetary recoveries does not end the analysis,however,because jang argues that the infringement claim did produce a monetary gain for bsc the cash offset.furthermore,he contends that c uses monetary terms only because the parties did not consider the possibility of a settlement.he argues that the provision is therefore ambiguous with respect to bsc recovery of licenses,and must be construed to require bsc to share the value of the licenses with him.
the offset 
jang argues that an offset is a monetary gain for bsc,and thus a recovery of damages.we agree.a cash offset is the functional equivalent of a cash payment.instead of receiving a direct transfer from cordis,bsc deducted the amount it would have received from the amount it owed cordis for separate acts of infringement.
an illustration may be useful had bsc received a billion check for the infringement,and then paid cordis billion out of its general funds for cordis separate claim,there would be no dispute that the jang claim had produced billion in damages.bsc simply combined the transactions.using the numbers from our illustration,bsc deducted billion from its debt to cordis,thereby receiving the billion in the form of an offset.it is still better off,by billion,than it would have been without the jang infringement claim.this is clearly a monetary gain.
courts have long recognized the equivalence of a debt offset and a cash payment through the right of setoff the right of setoff also called offset allows entities that owe each other money to apply their mutual debts against each other,thereby avoiding the absurdity of making a pay b when b owes citizens bank of strumpf,d quoting studley boylston bank.see also chi.ry.lindell.noting that discharging a debt by setoff is not to be distinguished from payment in money.in this case,bsc made money on the jang patent.it lost money on cordis separate claim.that its gain and loss were consolidated to produce one net payment does not change the fact that the jang patent produced a monetary gain for bsc.
the real question is whether that gain qualifies as a recovery.we see no reason why it should not it makes no difference to bsc bottom line whether it receives a check for the jang infringement claim or reduces its debt by the same amount the fact that bsc obtained a right to damages,and then regained the value of its lost profits through settlement,should be sufficient to demonstrate a recovery.see black law dictionary ed defining recovery as,inter alia,t he regaining or restoration of something lost or taken away or t he obtainment of a right to something by a judgment or decree.
what is arguably ambiguous,however,is whether c applies only when there is a net recovery in the suit or settlement as a whole,or whether it applies to any recovery on the particular claims involving jang patents,even if the suit as a whole produces a loss.the parties do not identify this point of uncertainty,but it may underlie their disagreement.if the provision is ambiguous in this respect,there is a material issue of disputed fact.
in sum viewing the facts in the light most favorable to jang,as we must at this stage,see knepper,at,it is clear that the jang infringement claim entitled bsc to damages,and resulted in a monetary gain through the cash offset of billions of dollars.it is arguably ambiguous whether this gain qualifies as a recovery pursuant to c.because any recovery of damages in c could reasonably be read to include the cash offset,the district court erred in dismissing jang claim as a matter of law.we will therefore vacate the judgment on the pleadings so that the case may proceed to discovery.convention of new jerusalem in the of am,mackenzie,noting that extrinsic evidence may be admitted when a contract is ambiguous to remove or to explain the existing uncertainty or ambiguity.the parties will then be able to present arguments as to whether c applies to the cash offset with the benefit of a fuller record,either in motions for summary judgment or at trial.
the licenses 
jang also argues that he was entitled to share in the value of the licenses that bsc recovered in the cordis settlement.he contends that the parties did not contemplate the possibility of a settlement,and that c is therefore ambiguous with respect to the licenses.construing all the facts in his favor,it is possible that jang and bsc failed to consider a when negotiating the agreement.this does not,however,render c ambiguous with respect to the licenses.
jang relies on cofman acton,cir,in which the first circuit,applying massachusetts law,found an apparently clear contract provision to be ambiguous in context.in that case,acton,the defendant corporation,had agreed to pay the plaintiff companies a sum of money if its stock rose above a certain price.id.at.later,its stock plummeting,acton executed a reverse in which it drastically reduced the number of its shares on the market.id.at.this had the effect of artificially increasing each share par value by a multiple of five,far above the contractual threshold.id.the plaintiffs demanded their money.id.acton refused on the ground that the provision was not meant to be triggered unless its fortunes improved,which they had not the parties had simply not considered the possibility of manipulation.id.
the first circuit sided with acton.id.it found that the parties had not provided for manipulation,and that the payment provision could not be read to apply to manipulated price changes,because that would have allowed acton to avoid reaching the threshold by manipulating par values downward.id.at.the court therefore held that the provision was not triggered by acton reverse.id.at.
jang argues that the application of c to a recovery of licenses is analogous.the agreement does not explicitly speak to this situation.construing the facts in the light most favorable to jang,it is possible that the parties did not consider it.jang contends that the contract is thus ambiguous,and that we can not infer that c was intended to exclude recoveries,because that would allow bsc to evade its obligation at any time simply by arranging to receive its recovery in form.
jang argument is compelling but not,in the end,persuasive.first,jang situation is unlike acton in that,whereas the acton court was willing to read an implied exception into a contract,jang asks us to read an additional obligation into the contract.the acton court construed the parties obligations more narrowly than a literal reading would suggest jang asks us to construe the parties obligations more broadly.more importantly,though,acton stands in tension with the great weight of massachusetts contract law.the central mantra of that law is that contract terms must be interpreted according to
