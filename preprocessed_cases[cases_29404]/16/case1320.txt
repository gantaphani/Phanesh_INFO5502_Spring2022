this case involves an effort by a union of airline pilots to use the railway labor act rla,et,to compel several airlines,the airlines holding company,and another union to establish and arbitrate before a,board of adjustment.we hold,however,that plaintiff claim is foreclosed by the plain language of section of the rla,id,which permits but does not require such a board of adjustment,and that plaintiff alternative state law claim is meritless.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
the plaintiff,the air line pilots association alpa,is a labor organization that represents various pilots in collective bargaining.the defendants in this case are the holding company airways group,group and three of group wholly owned air carrier subsidiaries airways,airways,piedmont airlines,piedmont,and psa airlines,psa.the plaintiff represents the pilots of piedmont and psa.it previously represented the pilots of airways as well,but on april,another union,the airline pilots association usapa,replaced it as their representative.
starting about and ending around,the plaintiff,on behalf of airways,piedmont,and psa pilots,negotiated a number of collective bargaining agreements that form the basis of the instant dispute.no agreement was ever signed by all parties.the plaintiff nonetheless characterizes the set of contracts as complex and interlocking,such that their net effect is to somehow involve all the defendants in a scheme entitling psa and piedmont pilots to preferential rights to job vacancies at airways.these rights are referred to as rights.
in,a dispute erupted over the alleged rights,which plaintiff claims the defendants violated.several rounds of discussions failed to resolve the matter,and the parties were unable to agree on the proper format for arbitration.consequently,in early,the plaintiff brought suit in the eastern district of virginia.
both parties agree that the plaintiff is not seeking a determination on the merits of the dispute.it instead is seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to compel resolution of the dispute through arbitration.the plaintiff contends further that effective resolution of the dispute requires arbitration before a,adjustment,one with jurisdiction over the plaintiff,the defendants,and usapa.the defendants,on the other hand,contend that they have fulfilled their statutory duty by establishing adjustment boards and that the plaintiff must present its grievance to those boards.
the complaint alleges two counts.first,plaintiff argues that two provisions of the railway labor act rla section,codified at,and section,codified at require the defendants to create and participate in a,board.the second count is directed only at group and alleges that group is obligated to arbitrate under state contract law.
the defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit,see.b,and the district court granted the motion,dismissing the plaintiff complaint in its entirety.see air line pilots ass airways group,wl.as to count one,the court held that neither section nor section of the rla provided a basis for relief.under section,the court concluded that,adjustment boards were purely voluntary in the airline industry.the district court further determined that section general duty requiring reasonable effort s to resolve disputes could not take the place of the more specific language of section,allowing but not mandating arbitration.as to count two of the complaint,the court held that group did not have any contractual obligations under state law to arbitrate.
the plaintiff aim in this case is to compel arbitration before a,board of adjustment.it is undisputed that in the airline industry,the rla makes minor disputes,which are disputes over the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements,subject to final and binding arbitration before a board of adjustment.see consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,conrail.the parties dispute,however,whether this requirement is satisfied by a system,adjustment board,as is typical in the airline industry,or whether,at least in this particular case,it necessitates a group,adjustment board.see.in arguing in favor of a group adjustment board,the plaintiff relies primarily on section of the rla,offering several distinct arguments based on that section.
plaintiff contends that construing section to leave group boards to the election of the parties would frustrate two of congress goals in enacting the rla.first,according to the plaintiff,it would undermine the longstanding federal policy that favors arbitration of labor disputes.lynchburg foundry.patternmakers league,cir.this policy has special importance in the rail and air industries,where failure to resolve labor disputes in a prompt and orderly manner may interrupt commerce and thus adversely affect the public interest in traveling and shipping.see union pac.sheehan,per curiam.second,plaintiff insists that interpreting section to require only boards for disputes would effectively deny pilots a remedy for the alleged violation of their rights,thereby contravening the strong congressional interest in seeing that employees are not left remediless and without a forum to present their grievances.capraro united parcel serv,cir.without the participation of group,airways,psa,piedmont,and usapa in a group board,plaintiff argues that this policy would be thwarted because arbitration would be futile.
such general propositions,however,fail to account for the specific instructions of congress in this context.it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that we begin with the text of the statute itself and must assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.am.tobacco patterson,citation and internal quotations omitted.section of the rla states 
the disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers by air growing out of grievances,or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to an appropriate adjustment board,as hereinafter provided 
it shall be the duty of every carrier and of its employees to establish a board of adjustment 
such boards of adjustment may be established by agreement between employees and carriers either on any individual carrier,or system,or group of carriers by air and any class or classes of its or their employees 
the meaning of this statutory language is clear.it states that an air carrier and its employees shall establish a board of adjustment but that such a board of adjustment may by agreement consist of a group of carriers by air.id.emphases added.in other words,an airline and its pilots are required to create a board of adjustment,as indicated by congress use of the obligatory shall.however,the form of that board of adjustment is discretionary,such that airlines and pilots are permitted,but not required,to establish group boards with jurisdiction over multiple entities,as indicated by congress use of the permissive may.
in construing statutory terms in accordance with their ordinary or natural meaning s,as we must,fdic meyer,it is uncontroversial that the term shall customarily connotes a command,whereas the term may typically indicates authorization without obligation.see lopez davis,miller french.as we have previously explained,a party contention that the word may means shall is not a tenable construction of the language involved m ay sometimes means wo.lynchburg foundry patternmakers league,cir citation omitted.that is,under section,air carriers and their employees may to create a group board of adjustment.
that the word may is to be given a meaning distinct from the word shall is further bolstered by congress use of both words in close proximity to one another,signaling that the contrast was not accidental or careless.as the supreme court stated,the permissive nature of the word may is particularly apt where,as here,may is used in contraposition to the word shall.jama immigration customs enforcement.as early as,the court recognized that when the word may is used in special contradistinction to the word shall,there can be no reason for taking such a liberty with the plain words of the statute.united states ex rel.siegel thoman.
this commonsense reading of section conforms with the remaining text,ensuring that the phrase by agreement is not rendered superfluous.see corley united states.congress not only informs us in section that parties may establish a,board but also identifies the precise manner in which they are to arrive at that choice by agreement.in other words,as part of the collective bargaining process,parties are free to negotiate over the desirability of a group board.as the district court pointed out,if a,board of adjustment were required by operation of law rather than by parties contractual consent,there would be little reason to expend the resources necessary to bargain for one.
as the district court further noted,t he import of these statutory phrases is clear air carriers and their employees have a statutory duty to establish boards of adjustment,but if they wish to create and bear the expense of boards of adjustment,they must contract to do so.because the statutory language does not admit of doubt as to congress intended meaning,it must be regarded as conclusive.see nelson piedmont aviation,cir.in short,we assume congress said what it meant and meant what it said.connecticut bank germain.
moreover,contrary to plaintiff suggestion,our holding is in harmony with the aims of the rla.the alternative to arbitration in this case is not an absence of arbitration.rather,it is arbitration before boards of adjustment,which each of the defendant carriers has established in compliance with section.the rla preference for arbitration over litigation is not vitiated because one party believes the format for arbitration is less than ideal.likewise,plaintiff is not rendered remediless because,although it has access to an arbitral forum,it worries that it may not prevail on the merits or fears that the arbitrator will be unable to award the precise relief it seeks.plaintiff prediction that it will be without an adequate remedy is speculation,because plaintiff has not allowed the existing arbitration scheme to operate.although it has filed grievances with defendants system boards,it has not seen those grievances through to a hearing.
congress was plainly within its rights to combine the virtues of arbitration with the virtues of collective bargaining.it determined simply that an arbitral forum was required,with the parameters of that forum being left to voluntary agreement.see.collective bargaining is not restricted to substantive disputes but may encompass the forum in which those disputes are to be resolved.as the supreme court has stated,arbitration of labor disputes under collective bargaining agreements is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process itself.united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation.the plaintiff was permitted by section to bargain for a,board prior to the onset of a,dispute.where numerous collective bargaining agreements with multiple parties,including a parent corporation and its subsidiaries,are involved,it is hardly unforeseeable that a disagreement over the interpretation of those agreements would ensue.but none of this impugns the congressional judgment that voluntary agreements as to fora have a meaningful role to play in the airline industry employment dispute resolution practices 
in making group adjustment boards creatures of contract,congress relieved federal courts of the burden of delineating what a group adjustment board would or should look like how many arbitrators would be on the board how would the arbitrators be chosen what rules or procedures would they follow congress allocated that task to the parties,allowing them to hash out the specifics through negotiation.if experience shows this process to be somehow deficient,the remedy is a legislative one.indeed,plaintiff can point to no case where courts have stepped in to award the type of relief sought here.
plaintiff section claim faces yet another hurdle.plaintiff seeks to use the provision to compel group to participate in arbitration.because group is simply a holding company of three airlines and does not itself perform services in connection with air transportation,it is not a carrier by air under section of the rla,and therefore not subject to the requirements of the rla.the plaintiff admits as much but argues that group is nonetheless subject to the demands of section as the bargaining agent for its air carrier subsidiaries.
but this argument too is overcome by section plain text,which does not,by its terms,impose any duties on agents.see.by not expressly including agents within its scope,section contrasts with other rla provisions that do expressly cover agents,see,id,thus suggesting that the omission was not a congressional oversight.as the district court observed,congress knew how to place agents within a statutory provision when it wanted evidenced by section,thus its decision to exclude agents from section command must be respected.
plaintiff counters the above with a textual point of its own the sentence in section first paragraph,which states that disputes may be referred to an appropriate adjustment board,as hereinafter provided.id.under plaintiff interpretation of this language,air carriers and their employees are required to establish a,board whenever it is appropriate.clearly,in plaintiff view,a,board of adjustment is appropriate when,as here,it is necessary to resolve the entire dispute in a single proceeding.employees union union pac,tceu.
plaintiff position,however,is once again in tension with a fundamental canon of statutory interpretation.i t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.morales trans world airlines.here the term appropriate is a general term lacking content.it therefore can not displace the more specific language directly addressing the creation of a group board,which provides that parties may create a group board by agreement.additionally,the phrase appropriate adjustment board is immediately qualified by the phrase as hereinafter provided,thereby indicating that an appropriate adjustment board is simply one that satisfies the requirements of section as described in the two paragraphs that immediately follow.in other words,a,board is appropriate if the parties voluntarily and contractually decide it is appropriate.
in this regard,plaintiff reliance on tceu is misplaced.that case had nothing to do with whether a section board of adjustment was appropriate.in fact,it had nothing to do with the creation of a board of adjustment at all.the case dealt with arbitration in the rail industry in an forum that indisputably had jurisdiction over a party.tceu,at.it did not purport to create a brand new forum in the air industry that courts would infuse with jurisdiction in disregard of section.
plaintiff claims finally that group boards are mandated in the airline industry under section because they are mandated in the railroad industry under section.that section allows railroads and their employees to request arbitration by the national railroad adjustment board nrab,a,board for the entire rail industry.and plaintiff argues that congress intended the dispute resolution mechanisms for the rail and air industries to be functionally equivalent,quoting the supreme court language in central airlines that congress general aim was to extend to air carriers and their employees the same benefits and obligations available and applicable in the railroad industry.int l ass of machinists central airlines,emphasis added.
this view,however,overlooks the statutory language and,moreover,it overstates central airlines.these sources make abundantly clear that although congress may have intended the dispute resolution machinery to be roughly similar for the air and rail industries,it did not intend for them to be perfectly identical.indeed,quite the opposite.
section of the rla applies only to the railroad industry.as plaintiff correctly points out,it establishes the nrab,a national board of adjustment composed of numerous rail carriers and unions,with such jurisdiction over those parties as is necessary to decide disput
