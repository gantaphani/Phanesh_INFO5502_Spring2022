steven harlamert,administrator of the estate of his deceased father john harlamert the estate,initiated this declaratory judgment action against world finer foods,wff,a closely held corporation.the estate contends that it is permitted to freely transfer the ten shares of wff stock owned by john harlamert prior to his demise.wff contends that the shares are subject to a shareholder agreement that restricts the transfer of that stock to the company.after a bench trial,the district court granted judgment in favor of the estate.wff appeals the district court factual and legal findings and conclusions.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
in,john fressie,a buyer and packager of food seasonings,approached some of his distributors suggesting that they form a company to package and distribute specialty food products,mostly under the company private label,giving deep discounts and annual cash rebates.in august,fressie incorporated that company,now known as wff,under the name foods,vip.in april,vip changed its name to reese finer foods,reese,and,in july,reese changed its name to wff 
at its formation in,there were only five shareholders of vip stock john fressie,the president of vip who managed operations,and distributors gary greenhouse,harry mains,heffner food products and norman wine.each member received a certificate for shares of vip stock,of a total authorized shares.
the first meeting of vip,held on august,was attended by all shareholders except wine.the meeting minutes reflect a buy or sell agreement will be incorporated,which will give the corporation first option on purchasing original stock within days.the value of the stock will be placed at book value.
a second shareholder meeting was held on october.the minutes of that meeting reflect the agreement was reviewed.gary greenhouse move sic the discussion be tabled at the present time.
to add new shareholders without increasing the number of authorized shares,the original five shareholders agreed in early to transfer shares each back to vip.in march,fressie invited six more distributors to become vip shareholders.one of those distributors was john harlamert,who owned a distributorship called arlowe specialty food,
on march,a vip meeting was commenced in louis,missouri,attended by the original five shareholders and the six new shareholders harlamert,the barzizza brothers,sidney knight,art kehe,sam zuckerman,and jones food.all shareholders received a certificate for ten shares of vip stock bearing the following typewritten legend march,these securities may be transferred only through the company and only in compliance with the agreement between this share holder and the company.the meeting minutes reflect that a resolution on the face of the stock eliminates the need for a buy sell agreement.
five days later,on march,four of the eleven shareholders present at the march meeting fressie,kehe,heffner,and the barzizza brothers signed individual shareholder agreements.among other things,the executed agreements required a deceased shareholder personal representative to sell back to vip,and vip to purchase,that shareholder stock for the greater of per share or of book value.the agreements also required vip to redeem those shares within thirty days of the shareholder death.there is no evidence that the shareholder agreements signed on march,actually existed on the date the stock certificates were issued,march.
john harlamert remained a shareholder of wff stock until his death on october.contrary to the redemption provision in the shareholder agreement,wff did not attempt to redeem harlamert shares until january,more than days after harlamert death,by tendering a check in the amount of to james kordik,who had been harlamert attorney.harlamert heirs have refused to tender their father shares of wff stock to the company.steven harlamert has filed this action seeking an order declaring that the estate is not subject to the shareholder agreement and its restriction on transferring a decedent shareholder stock.the estate has received permission from the montgomery county probate court to transfer the stock to steven harlamert.the parties agree that steven,the beneficial owner of all outstanding shares in arlowe,is entitled to all shares of wff stock,subject only to this litigation 
after a bench trial,the district court found,based on a preponderance of the evidence,that harlamert did not enter into a shareholder agreement with vip,reese or wff that he was not aware of the existence of such an agreement when he purchased the ten shares of vip stock and that he did not accept any benefits of such an agreement between vip,reese or wff and their shareholders.the court noted that,if it had found otherwise on this last issue,it would have been necessary to address plaintiff alternative argument that wff waived its rights under the shareholder agreement by failing to redeem harlamert shares within thirty days of his death.
ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review the district court ruling in this declaratory judgment action under.
iii.standard of review 
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,findings of fact by a district court shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.id.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.the team bnfl,cir citing anderson city of bessemer city,d,in turn quoting united states united states gypsum.this standard does not entitle the reviewing court to reverse a factual finding simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.anderson,at.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record,this court may not reverse that accounting,even if convinced that,had it been sitting as trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.id.at.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be deemed clearly erroneous.id.at.this is so even when the district court findings do not rest on credibility determinations,but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.id.
iv.law and analysis 
generally speaking,the securities of a corporation are freely transferable.pursuant to delaware statute,however,a written restriction on the transfer of a security of a corporation,noted conspicuously on the certificate,may be enforced against the holder of the restricted security or any successor or transferee of the holder including an estate administrator.ann.a.unless noted conspicuously on the certificate,a restriction is ineffective except against a person with actual knowledge of the restriction.id.a transfer restriction may be imposed by the certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws or by an agreement among any number of security holders or among such holders and the corporation.ann.b.however,n o restrictions so imposed shall be binding with respect to securities issued prior to the adoption of the restriction unless the holders of the securities are parties to an agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.id.
as discussed,harlamert stock certificate contains the written restriction march,these securities may be transferred only through the company and only in compliance with the agreement between this share holder and the company.although wff contends that the transfer restriction is conspicuous,such contention is meaningless if the certificate was issued prior to the adoption of the restriction unless harlamert was a party to the agreement referenced therein or had actual knowledge of the restriction when the certificate was issued to him 
wff claims that john harlamert was a party to and is bound by the shareholder agreement.it argues that the district court committed clear error when concluding that john harlamert never executed an agreement.we disagree.neither the parties nor their counsel were able to locate a signed agreement despite diligent efforts.company officials testified that they did not routinely require shareholders to sign such a
