opinion of the court 
appellant state farm brought this declaratory judgment action against appellee brian rosenthal alleging that his underinsured motorist claim was time barred by pennsylvania statute of limitations on contract claims.to resolve this action,the district court had to predict when the pennsylvania supreme court would begin running the statute of limitations on such claims.ruling in favor of rosenthal,the district court predicted that the statute of limitations on such claims would begin to run when the insurer denies the insured claim.we will affirm the district court ruling in favor of rosenthal on different grounds,as we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would start running the statute of limitations on the date on which the insured settles with or obtains an award from the adverse driver for less than the value of his damages.
the facts of this case are not in dispute.on june,brian rosenthal,a state farm insured who resides in pennsylvania,was struck from behind by another driver.in august,rosenthal met with a vocational specialist who opined that rosenthal sustained a loss of earning capacity in excess of million as a result of two one in june and an earlier one in march of the same year.also in august,rosenthal obtained a report from an economist who estimated his lost wages due to these accidents at million 
on june,rosenthal reached an agreement to settle his claim against the driver who hit him for.this other driver had a liability policy with a limit of.in a letter dated july,rosenthal attorney requested that state farm approve the settlement agreement and notified the company about his intent to pursue an underinsured motorist uim claim against state farm as follows as you are aware,i will be pursuing a uim case under rosenthal policy with your company.app.at.state farm notified rosenthal attorney of its consent to the settlement and continued to correspond with him about the details of his underinsured motorist claim for the next year.
on july,rosenthal attorney demanded underinsured motorist arbitration from state farm.in response,on march,state farm filed a complaint in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment that rosenthal underinsured motorist claim was time barred because of pennsylvania statute of limitations on contract claims.rosenthal filed a motion to dismiss,arguing the statute of limitations had not run.his motion was later converted into a motion for summary judgment.state farm filed a response and a for summary judgment.their motions presented an issue that has yet to be decided by the pennsylvania supreme court when the statute of limitations begins to run on underinsured motorist claims.
on january,the district court denied state farm summary judgment motion and granted rosenthal,predicting that the pennsylvania supreme court would not start running the statute of limitations on underinsured motorist claims until the insurer denies such a claim.in this case,the district court found that date to be in march,when state farm refused to arbitrate and filed a declaratory judgment action.under this reasoning,rosenthal underinsured motorist claim does not become stale until.
state farm filed this timely appeal on march.

because this case involves a novel question of pennsylvania law not addressed by the supreme court of the commonwealth,our task is to predict how that court would rule.glass sand caterpillar tractor,cir.in making this prediction,we must consider the pronouncements of the lower state courts.connecticut mutual life ins.wyman,cir.although such pronouncements are not controlling on an issue on which the highest court of the state has not spoken,we must attribute significant weight to these decisions in the absence of any indication that the highest state court would rule otherwise.wisniewski,cir citations omitted.
based on our review of relevant pennsylvania superior court caselaw,the parties briefs,and the positions taken by the parties at oral argument,there seems to be three possibilities as to when the pennsylvania supreme court would start running the statute of limitations on underinsured motorist claims listed chronologically the date of the accident as state farm argues the date on which the insured settles with the adverse driver for less than the insured damages as rosenthal argues or the date on which the insurer rejects the insured underinsured motorist claim as the district court found and as amicus curiae advocates.the parties advance a variety of legal arguments and policy justifications for selecting one date over another.after reviewing the relevant caselaw on this topic and considering the practical consequences of this decision,we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would start running the statute of limitations on underinsured motorist claims on the date on which the insured settles with the adverse driver for less than the value of the insured damages.
we begin our analysis with a review of relevant pennsylvania law.
while no pennsylvania state court has addressed the statute of limitations for underinsured motorist claims,there is ample caselaw from the pennsylvania superior court regarding the statute of limitations for uninsured motorist claims.see clark state farm auto.ins,seay prudential prop.cas,boyle state farm mut.auto.ins.these cases are in agreement that the statute of limitations begins to run when the right to payment of a benefit accrues to the insured,when the insured is in a motor vehicle accident the insured sustains bodily injury as a result of the accident and the insured knows of the uninsured status of the other owner or operator.clark,at.
in wheeler nationwide mutual insurance company,a district court in the eastern district of pennsylvania examined this superior court line of uninsured motorist cases and determined the three criterion listed above apply also to underinsured motorist cases.interpreting these criterion in the underinsured context,wheeler concluded the statute does not begin to run until the underinsured status of the adverse driver is definitively established,and reasoned as follows 
unlike an uninsured motorist case where the issue of whether a motorist has coverage at all is easily determined,the question of whether an insured motorist has enough coverage is not.this court holds that it is only at the time that the insured actually settled with the underinsured motorist insurance company that the status of the situation as one involving an underinsured motorist was definitely ascertainable.
id.emphasis in original.consequently,wheeler concluded that the statute of limitations does not begin to run on an underinsured motorist claim until the insured settles his claim with the underinsured driver or obtains a judgment against him.
the reasoning of wheeler seems to have been followed until another court in the eastern district rejected it in in motorist mutual insurance company durney,wl,dist.lexis.that case involved a motorist mutual insured who suffered approximately in injuries as a result of a accident with a driver who had only of liability coverage.the insured settled with the underinsured driver for with the consent of motorist mutual in,and then corresponded with motorist mutual about her ongoing treatment costs and her medical condition over the next five years.in,without ever having denied its insured claim or notifying its insured about the need to commence arbitration,motorist mutual filed a declaratory judgment action asking the district court to find the insured claim time barred.the district court ruled the claim was not time barred,essentially analogizing a dispute over underinsured motorist benefits to any other type of contract dispute 
in contracts disputes generally,the statute of limitations does not begin to run when the contractual rights vest,but when the contract is breached.b
