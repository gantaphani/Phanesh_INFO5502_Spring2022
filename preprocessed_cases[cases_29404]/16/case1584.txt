this appeal is from a declaratory judgment ruling that the plaintiff insurance company had a duty to defend and indemnify the defendant general contractor in an underlying state wrongful death suit.it involves the application of texas express negligence rule to an indemnity contract between a general contractor,the indemnitee,and a,the indemnitor.applying texas precedent,we conclude that the language in the indemnity provision satisfied the requirement that the contract must unambiguously state a party intent to indemnify the indemnitee for all liability caused by the indemnitee own future negligence.additionally,we reject the challenge to the reasonableness of the settlement.we affirm.
background 
kiewit offshore services kiewit was the general contractor performing welding services on the skyway bridge san francisco bay project.kiewit entered into a subcontract with welders,rbt.pursuant to this contract,rbt provided welders to kiewit to work on the project at kiewit facility in ingleside,texas.
on january,at the facility,mann nguyen,an employee of rbt,entered a confined space,which resembled a large steel box,to perform a weld repair.the gas in the steel box ignited,and the resulting explosion blew off the roof.nguyen,who was conscious after the explosion,suffered third degree burns over percent of his body.he was transported to the brooks army medical center and died one week later.ernesto moreno,a kiewit employee,had been standing on the roof at the time of the explosion and was killed instantly.
the families of moreno and nguyen brought suit against kiewit and rbt in texas state court,alleging that kiewit and rbt were negligent for operating the ingleside plant without implementing an adequate safety program for welding in confined spaces.at the time of the explosion,rbt had the following insurance policies an excess liability policy through xl specialty insurance company the in the instant declaratory judgment action a commercial general liability insurance policy from atlantic insurance company and a worker compensation policy through american interstate insurance company.after receiving service,kiewit demanded that xl specialty defend and indemnify kiewit as an additional insured.xl specialty refused,and atlantic tendered a defense.
rbt settled with the moreno family for four million dollars and the nguyen family for one million dollars.kiewit subsequently began negotiating with the nguyen family.during this time,kiewit counsel prepared a report analyzing kiewit potential liability to the nguyen family.the report was prepared based on kiewit internal investigation and initial discovery in the underlying suit.
the evidence demonstrated that kiewit was hired to construct bridge footings,a type of project that kiewit had not previously undertaken.kiewit usually worked on offshore platforms.unlike offshore platforms,the welding on bridge footings had to be done in an enclosed space.kiewit safety officer had no experience working on structures like bridge footings.kiewit had no provision for ventilating the enclosed space during welding.although kiewit provided fans for welders in the enclosed spaces,these fans did not have explosive proof switches and were not placed fully outside the enclosed space when in use.
kiewit counsel concluded that the operating procedures created a foreseeable risk of an explosion and that such procedures did not adequately protect the employees from the hazards of welding in enclosed spaces.the report concluded that kiewit was potentially liable to the nguyen family for failing to properly execute the confined space entry permit system failing to implement a proper confined space ventilation system and providing a ventilation fan that potentially was the ignition source for the explosion.it also estimated that nguyen survival damages for the week in the hospital suffering burns could be twenty million dollars,with perhaps fifty to sixty percent of the fault attributed to kiewit.because kiewit owned the facility,the report stated the percentage of fault could be higher.
kiewit,using rbt settlement with the moreno family as a guidepost,settled with the nguyen claimants for four million dollars.subsequent to the settlements,xl specialty filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court,seeking a judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify kiewit for kiewit settlement with the nguyen claimants because kiewit was not an additional insured under the xl specialty policy.kiewit filed a claim against rbt and a against xl specialty,asserting that rbt had a duty to defend and indemnify kiewit under the indemnification provision in the subcontract.kiewit further asserted that the xl specialty policy provided coverage for rbt liability under the indemnification provision.
the district court granted summary judgment,holding that rbt had contracted to indemnify kiewit for kiewit negligence with respect to the explosion,and the xl specialty policy provided coverage for rbt contractual duty to indemnify.rbt and xl specialty now appeal.

express negligence rule 
appellants rbt and xl specialty contend that the district court erred in finding that the indemnity provision at issue expressly provided that rbt would indemnify kiewit for kiewit own negligence.appellants argue that the indemnity clause did not satisfy the express negligence rule.texas express negligence rule is a rule of contract interpretation that applies specifically to agreements to indemnify another party for the consequences of that party own negligence.quorum health resources maverick county hospital district,cir.under this rule,contracting parties seeking to indemnify one party from the consequences of its own negligence must express that intent in specific terms,within the four corners of the document.id.citing ethyl daniel const.the texas supreme court adopted this stringent rule because indemnification of a party for the consequences of that party negligence was an extraordinary shifting of risk.id.at.whether an indemnity provision satisfies the express negligence rule is a question of law for the court to determine.id.at.
the instant indemnification provision reads as follows 
to the fullest extent permitted by law,subcontractor rbt specifically obligates itself to contractor kiewit,contractor partners,individually,and all kiewit companies defined as any company or business entity in which peter kiewit sons,directly or indirectly holds a controlling interest.contractor surety,owner and any other party required to be indemnified under the prime contract,jointly and severally,hereinafter contractor indemnified parties in the following respects,
