the agreement 
in august,dogswell entered into a representation agreement agreement with profit pet,granting profit pet the exclusive right to represent dogswell products to distributors in eleven midwestern states section of the agreement permitted modification or amendment by a writing signed by the parties.
the agreement set forth the relationship between the parties as one of principal and independent contractor,with explicit language that dogswell was concerned solely with sales by profit pet,and not how profit pet conducted its business section.the parties agree the commission rate was,although the rate was left blank in the agreement.no language in the agreement precluded profit pet from representing competitors products.
the agreement distinguished terminations for cause and without cause,and listed three specific for cause scenarios section 
profit pet fails to sell worth of goods on a quarterly basis,beginning in the second full quarter of the agreement 
commission of a felony in the course of performance of the agreement or 
failure to cure within fifteen days from a good faith written notice of breach or default.
if none of these events occurred,then the termination would be without cause.in addition,if dogswell terminates agency while profit pet is performing quarterly goals,profit pet is to receive year worth of commissions based on previous month sales section.
the march toward termination 
the parties began conducting business under the agreement in august.on march,giannini and baran had a conversation,memorialized later the same day in an that described dogswell desired key performance metrics.dogswell requested a reduced commission rate,that profit pet hire more employees,file certain reports with dogswell,set up a meeting for a dogswell employee with pet supplies plus,and acquire an invitation for dogswell to a pet supplies plus open house doc,ex.d.

termination without cause 
the first bone of contention here is whether dogswell provided the required notice to profit pet in order to terminate the contractual relationship for cause.the agreement section provides for three circumstances where termination is for cause failure to meet the sales obligation,commission of a felony,and failure to cure after good faith notice of breach or default.dogswell admits profit pet was meeting its quarterly sales obligation and there was no felony.therefore,the issue is whether dogswell sent a good faith written notice of profit pet actual breach or actual default section.if it did,then profit pet had fifteen days to cure the breach.if it failed to do so,dogswell could have terminated the agreement by written notice ten days after the failure to cure.there is no dispute that the time period was adequate,or that profit pet failed to do what dogswell demanded.
the district court held dogswell did not provide the required good faith written notice tr.the district court found the language in the to be perfectly consistent with an ongoing business dialogue,where one party would like to modify some terms of the agreement but it does specify default or breach as required under the notice and cure provision tr.this court agrees.these request profit pet 
lower the commission rate from to 
hire employees so that it could grow 
start filing certain business and customer reports and 
attend a meeting with pet supplies plus that a dogswell employee could also attend,and acquire an invitation for dogswell to attend a pet supplies plus open house.
on their face,these are not notice of a breach.
furthermore,section of the agreement states 
profit pet is not an employee of dogswell for any purpose whatsoever,but is an independent contractor.dogswell is interested only in the results obtained by profit pet,who shall have sole control of the manner and means of performing under this agreement.dogswell shall not have the right to require profit pet to do anything which would jeopardize the relationship of independent contractor between dogswell and profit pet.
requests for profit pet to hire employees,set up meetings,or to file reports detailing its operations do not describe or even imply a breach or default.instead,they show dogswell hounding profit pet to act contrary to section of the agreement which clearly states profit pet shall have sole control of the manner and means of performing.
profit pet specific duties under the agreement are limited to obtaining orders and reorders of dogswell products and services in the specified territory diligently and faithfully working the territory in an endeavor to secure business for dogswell section and selling at least worth of goods per quarter section.the specify no failure by profit pet to m
