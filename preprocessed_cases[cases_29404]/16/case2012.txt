settlement capital corporation settlement capital appeals a district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the united states on the basis of federal sovereign immunity.we affirm.
gary steele was injured by a virginia national guard vehicle.he filed a claim against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,et.the united states settled the claim by purchasing an annuity for steele benefit from transamerica assurance corporation transamerica.according to its contract with transamerica,the united states owns the annuity and retains the right at any time to designate to whom annuity payments will be made.steele has been receiving,and is set to receive,various periodic and payments under the annuity.
facing urgent business expenses and needing to finance his daughter wedding,steele sought to convey in anticipated annuity payments to settlement capital in exchange for a payment of.to this end and to comply with florida law regulating the transfer of payment rights,steele presented his agreement with settlement capital for review by the eleventh judicial circuit court of county fl.see.stat.hereinafter florida transfer act.the florida transfer act requires that notice of the proposed transfer be sent to interested parties,so settlement capital sent notice to both transamerica as annuity issuer and the united states as structured settlement obligor.see.stat.i,a.
having received no objection to the proposed transfer from either transamerica or the united states,the florida court issued an order approving the transaction.the next day,settlement capital wrote to inform transamerica of the florida court order and to ask that settlement capital be designated the payee of record for future annuity payments.the following day,an attorney from the department of justice wrote to the florida court explaining that while the united states neither intended to appear in the transfer proceeding nor consented to the florida court jurisdiction,it believed the florida court lacked jurisdiction to enter a transfer order attempting to alter the united states contract rights with both gary steele and transamerica assurance company.that is,the united states claims it would alter an alleged provision in the states settlement contract,as well as the language in the states annuity contract giving the united states the right to designate the annuity payee.the united states also sent a letter directing transamerica not to change the annuity payee.
settlement capital paid steele the lump sum,but transamerica hesitated to forward annuity payments to settlement capital because of the united states opposition.settlement capital urged transamerica to comply with the florida order,noting that despite similar opposition from the united states,annuity issuers have often acceded to transfers without incident,even when the united states owned the annuity.transamerica ultimately filed an interpleader action naming the united states,settlement capital,and gary steele as defendants and asking the district court to adjudicate the competing claims to the annuity payments.see.the parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court ordered,in relevant part,that the united states motion for summary judgment was granted and settlement capital motion for summary judgment was denied that the florida court order was void,as having been entered without jurisdiction and without a waiver of the united states of america sovereign immunity and that transamerica should continue to make annuity payments to steele unless the united states as annuity owner directed otherwise.settlement capital appealed the district court conclusion that federal sovereign immunity applies.
this case turns on whether the doctrine of federal sovereign immunity deprives a state court of jurisdiction to approve a transfer of payment rights where the united states nominally has no beneficial interest annuity funding these payments.if federal sovereign immunity applies,summary judgment should be granted in favor of the government.akers alvey,cir.this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and resolution of legal questions,but accepts the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous.hamilton county,cir.
tort damages have traditionally been paid on a basis.the structured settlement,often involving periodic payments over a long term,evolved as a way to foreclose a tort victim from improvidently exhausting his award the federal tax characterization of a tort award matters both to the victim and to the obligor.although payments have always been excluded from the victim income,see,the tax treatment of a award was once uncertain.tort victims periodic annuity payments received from a structured settlement,for example,might formerly have been included in the victim income,even though clearly part of a tort settlement.in the late,the internal revenue service irs issued several rulings suggesting that periodic payments would be excluded from the victim income as long as the victim could not control or accelerate the payments.a amendment to and enactment of clarified the tax treatment of structured settlements and revealed their potential advantages.section allows tort obligors to fund their obligations via an annuity and excludes these payments from the payee income as long as among other things the payments are fixed and determinable as to amount and time of payment and can not be accelerated,deferred,increased,or decreased by the recipient.c.
in response to victims desire to liquidate such rights,a market developed where companies purchase a tort victim rights to future payments in exchange for a lump sum.this business of liquidating anticipated payments is known as factoring,and the firms engaged in it as factors.but the industry faced a problem in the possibility of factored payments being deemed accelerated,no longer being deemed fixed and determinable,and accordingly being denied the favorable tax treatment otherwise accorded tort settlement proceeds.that is,factoring,it was feared,might disqualify payments from being excluded either from the payee income under or from the factor income since the factor is not a tort claimant under.but new legislation prescribing a method to accomplish a factoring transaction while retaining favorable tax treatment essentially eliminated this possibility.the victims of terrorism tax relief act of,added to title to govern the tax treatment of factoring transactions.it imposes a stiff excise tax on anyone acquiring payment rights in a factoring transaction,a,but then excepts from this tax any factoring transaction approved in advance in a qualified order,id.b.approval essentially turns on a finding that the transaction is in the best interest of the payee and is not contrary to law or court order,see id.b a,and a qualified order may be issued under the authority of an applicable state statute by an applicable state court,id.b b i.to support this scheme,states have passed statutes regulating the transfer of payments and empowering state courts to conduct transfer proceedings and issue orders that comply with federal tax law.the florida transfer act is one such statute.the issue posed here concerns the intersection of federal sovereign immunity principles and such implementing state statutes.
settlement capital first argues that under the relevant supreme court precedent,federal sovereign immunity does not deprive the florida state court of jurisdiction to issue an order directing the united states to redesignate the payee of the annuity in question.it invokes the supreme court decision in larson domestic foreign commerce,as its starting point for this argument.see malone bowdoin,d explaining that larson marks the beginning of the modern doctrine of federal sovereign immunity.larson,as with most cases on federal sovereign immunity,required determining whether a suit nominally against a government officer was actually a suit against the government.in this case,however,the connection between the federal government and steele petition in florida court is more attenuated no one affiliated with the federal government was a party to th
