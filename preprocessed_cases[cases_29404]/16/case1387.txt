we consider here the scope of the general rule that an unresolved claim for attorneys fees does not prevent a judgment on the underlying claims from being a final decision under.see budinich becton dickinson,d.
in an order dated april,the district court entered a judgment in which it determined that carolina power and light company cp l had breached a contract to purchase coal from dynegy marketing and trade dynegy and awarded roughly million in damages to dynegy under the contract liquidated damages provision.the april judgment left unresolved,and reserved for a later date,dynegy claim for damages under the contract legal costs provision,under which the nonbreaching party was entitled to reasonable expenses incurred by it including legal fees,by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under the contract.
treating the april judgment as final and appealable,cp l filed a notice of appeal on may,days after the entry of the judgment,in which it challenged the district court million award to dynegy.dynegy filed a motion to dismiss cp l appeal as untimely.see fed.a a providing that an appeal must be filed within days after judgment.cp l first response was to file on june a motion for an extension of time to appeal under rule c,which the district court denied on september.cp l then took the position that the april judgment was not final and appealable and that its appeal was premature.it now urges us to stay its appeal from that order,pending the district court resolution of the legal costs claim.it filed a second appeal from the district court september order denying its motion for an extension of the time to appeal.
we conclude that the april judgment was not a final decision under,triggering the time limit for filing an appeal under federal rule of appellate procedure a.specifically,we hold that a claim for legal costs based on a contractual provision that is not limited to expenses incurred during the underlying litigation is an element of damages to be proved at trial under the substantive law governing the action,see.d,c,and that a judgment that leaves open such a claim is not final and appealable.accordingly,we dismiss cp l appeal from the april order as interlocutory and remand for further proceedings.we also dismiss cp l appeal from the september order as moot.
cp l and dynegy entered into a contract dated august,under which cp l agreed to purchase specific amounts of coal from dynegy at predetermined prices.when dynegy financial rating declined in early and dynegy failed to provide credit enhancements under the contract,cp l declared dynegy financial condition to be a default event under the contract and declined thereafter to accept coal shipments from dynegy.cp l then commenced this action against dynegy in north carolina state court for a declaratory judgment that it had a right to terminate the contract.dynegy removed the case to federal court under diversity jurisdiction and filed a counterclaim against cp l for breach of contract and violation of north carolina unfair trade practices act.
the case proceeded to a bench trial,and after the close of cp l evidence,the district court granted dynegy rule c motion,finding that cp l was not entitled to terminate the contract early and therefore had breached the contract in refusing to accept coal shipments from dynegy.dynegy then presented its evidence on damages,requesting an award of damages under two of the contract remedial provisions.the first provision,which applied to the period of time after the nondefaulting party terminated the contract due to the other party default,required cp l to pay dynegy net losses and costs resulting from the termination of the contract.the second provision,which applied to the period of time before the nondefaulting party terminated the contract,entitled dynegy to recover an amount equal to the positive difference,if any,obtained by subtracting the market p rice from the contract p rice reasonable additional transportation costs incurred by the s eller due to the default and legal c osts incurred by the s eller.the contract defined legal costs as the reasonable expenses incurred by a party,including legal fees,by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under the contract.
after the presentation of evidence,the district court rendered a memorandum opinion,in which it ruled in favor of dynegy on its breach of contract claim,awarding dynegy,and in favor of cp l on dynegy unfair trade practices claim.the court also deferred ruling on dynegy claim for legal costs,directing the parties to submit briefs on that issue and explaining that it would issue a ruling on that claim at a later date.treating dynegy claim for legal costs as a collateral issue,the court entered judgment in favor of dynegy on april,in the amount of.
on may,days after entry of the april judgment,cp l filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered in this action on the day of april.shortly thereafter,cp l also filed a motion to stay execution on the judgment,together with a supersedeas bond,which the district court granted.
dynegy has filed a motion in this court to dismiss cp l appeal,asserting that the appeal was untimely filed under federal rule of appellate procedure a a providing that an appeal must be filed within days of the judgment of the district court.although cp l had,up until dynegy filed its motion,taken the position that the april judgment was final,it reassessed its legal position and now argues that the district court april order was not,after all,a final,appealable judgment.because the period for filing a notice of appeal does not run until the entry of a final judgment,cp l contends that its time limit for appealing the district court judgment did not start running on april.it asserts that because the district court has yet to resolve the request for legal costs,the time limit still has not commenced.cp l has requested that we stay its appeal from the april order until the district court resolves dynegy claim for legal costs under the contract.
thus,under neither party theory would we reach the merits of cp l appeal at this time.dynegy urges that we dismiss cp l appeal with prejudice because it was untimely and cp l urges,in essence,that we dismiss the appeal or stay it as interlocutory.
in urging dismissal of cp l appeal with prejudice,dynegy contends that its claim for legal costs is collateral to,and not part of,the merits of its breach of contract claim and that,under budinich becton dickinson,d,the unresolved attorneys fees issue did not prevent the april judgment from being final on april.in budinich,the supreme court considered whether a district court decision on the merits of an employment compensation claim was final under notwithstanding an unresolved motion for attorneys fees.see at.finding the decision to be final,the court explained that a s a general matter,a claim for attorney fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain because s uch an award does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action.id.at.
cp l contends that budinich does not control here because dynegy claim for legal costs differs in significant respects from the claim for attorneys fees made in budinich.cp l points out that dynegy requested legal costs pursuant to a contractual provision,whereas the plaintiff in budinich requested attorneys fees based on a state statute.see at.in addition,cp l notes that the statute in budinich applied only to attorneys fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with an underlying action.see id.in contrast,cp l argues,the legal costs provision in the contract on which dynegy rests its claim is not premised on prevailing in an underlying action.these differences,cp l contends,make dynegy unresolved claim for legal costs in this case an integral part of the claim on the merits that must be resolved before appeal is taken.
we are thus presented with the issue of whether the april judgment,in which the district court deferred its ruling on dynegy claim for legal costs,was a final decision under that was appealable under federal rule of appellate procedure a.at bottom,this issue relates to our jurisdiction.
section of title of the united states code provides that t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.the label that a district court attaches to an order it issues does not control the question of whether the order is a final decision.see,exchange bank daniels,cir page preisser,cir.rather,to determine whether a district court order is a final decision we must determine whether it is a decision that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.thus,a judgment on liability that does not fix damages is not a final judgment because the assessment of damages is part of the merits of the claim that must be determined.see liberty mut.ins.wetzel,d republic natural gas oklahoma.but an unresolved motion to assess attorneys fees as costs to the prevailing party generally does not prevent a judgment on the merits from being final because it does not call into question a decision on the merits.see.c budinich,at.
after budinich was decided,congress enacted of the judicial improvements act of,which explicitly authorized the supreme there was any doubt that the court had the define by rule when a ruling of a district court is final for the purposes of appeal under section,stat,codified at c see also federal courts administration act of,stat,codified at e giving the supreme court the authority to provide for appeal s of interlocutory decision s.shortly thereafter,the supreme court exercised its authority with the adoption,in,of amendments to rules and that clarified budinich.the amendment to rule provides that c laims for attorneys fees and related nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.d emphasis added.the rule thus creates a division in the handling of attorneys fees claims between claims that are not part of the underlying substantive claim,which must be made by motion,and claims that are an element of damages,which presumably must be made by complaint.as an example of a claim falling in the latter category,the advisory committee notes cite a claim for attorneys fees based on the terms of a contract.advisory committee note to amendments.
rule c which incorporates the rule amendment,addresses how claims for attorneys fees affect the entry of judgment.it provides that the e ntry of judgment may not be delayed,nor the time for appeal extended,in order to tax costs or award fees,except that w hen a timely motion for attorney fees is made under rule d,the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and has become effective to order that the motion delay the time for appeal.c emphasis added.thus,rule creates flexibility in entering a final judgment by authorizing a district court to treat a motion for attorneys fees either as a rule motion that delays the finality of judgment for appellate purposes or as a collateral matter to be disposed of after judgment.see.advisory committee note to amendments.but that flexibility is provided only when an attorneys fees claim is made by is,when the claim is not part of the underlying substantive not when it is claimed through the complaint as an element of damages.correspondingly,an unresolved claim for substantive attorneys fees under the complaint does prevent the entry of judgment.because the flexibility granted by rule to treat a motion for attorneys fees as either collateral to the judgment or part of it does not apply when the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.d a,such claims must be regarded as part of the merits of the judgment.we thus conclude that a district court decision that leaves unresolved a claim for attorneys fees that are sought as an element of damages under the substantive law is not a final decision within the meaning of.
in the case before us,the substantive law governing the contract between the provides for the recovery of legal costs as an element of damages to be proved at trial.d a.first,the provision for legal costs falls under of the parties contract,which instructs that t he remedies set forth in this section shall be a party exclusive monetary damages for the other party failure to deliver or accept the quantities of coal required by the contract prior to the party early termination due to an event of default.emphasis added.second,legal costs are recoverable as a remedy for the buyer failure to accept all or any part of the quantity of coal to be delivered under the contract.as such,the condition precedent to recovering legal costs is a breach of contract by the buyer,not the successful litigation of a claim by the seller.just as the seller must prove a breach by the buyer to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price or transportation costs,so too must it prove such a breach to recover its legal costs.and,just as the difference between the contract price and the market price and the costs of transportation function as elements of damages,so too do legal costs.third,unlike a right to nonsubstantive attorneys fees that are collateral to the merits of an action,which does not accrue until the litigation is actually brought,the seller right to legal costs under the contract between the parties in this case arises as soon as the buyer rejects a delivery of coal.
in short,we conclude that dynegy claim for legal costs is a substantive claim in that it is based on a contract that provides for the recovery of fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.see.d a,c.thus,a judgment that leaves open such a claim for fees is not final under,and therefore not appealable under federal rule of appellate procedure a.
although we rely on rules and,as amended in,to inform our understanding of,application of budinich,which was decided before those amendments,likewise leads us to conclude that the unresolved issue of the legal costs claim in this case prevented the april order from being a final judgment.unlike the circumstances in budinich,where the attorneys fees award depended on whether the claimant was a prevailing party in an underlying cause of action,the attorneys fees here would be awarded as part of the damages for dynegy breach of contract claim.the resolution of such a claim is not collateral to the action,but part of it to be resolved under the substantive law governing the outcome of the action.
the statute in budinich provided that attorneys fees shall be awarded in favor of the winning party,to be taxed as part of the costs of the action.at.quoting.repealed.in contrast,the contract here authorizes an award of legal costs to the seller if the buyer fails to accept all or any part of the quantity of coal to be delivered and to the buyer if the seller fails to deliver all or any part of the quantity of coal to be delivered hereunder.thus,when the district court eventually addresses dynegy request for legal costs,the court will have to determine whether cp l failed to accept coal that it was required to purchase,not whether cp l prevailed in its breach of contract claim.
the difference is important because claims,such as the one brought in budinich,that are based on prevailing in underlying litigation will never involve claims for attorneys fees.a claim for attorneys fees is one that can be brought as an independent claim,such as,for example,a claim brought by an attorney to recover fees from a former client pursuant to a retainer agreement.when a claim for attorneys fees remains unresolved,a district court decision is not final for purposes of appeal.for example,if an attorney were to bring suit to recover fees owed to him by a client,we certainly would not say that the district court decision was final before the court determined the amount of fees to which the attorney was entitled.see,liberty mut.ins,at.republic natural gas,at.when the governing law authorizes attorneys fees on some basis other than status,a claim for attorneys fees need not be linked to
