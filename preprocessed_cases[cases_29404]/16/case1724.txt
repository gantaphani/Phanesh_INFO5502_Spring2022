wright purchased a standard flood insurance policy sfip to cover his houston home.while wright purchased his sfip from allstate,the insurance was provided through the national flood insurance program nfip,which is administered by the federal emergency management agency fema under the nfia.the terms of sfip policies are dictated by fema.b,d.payments on sfip claims come ultimately from the federal treasury.gowland aetna,cir.allstate is a fiscal agent of the united states and,in the parlance of the nfip,a write your own insurer wyo.a,a.
after tropical storm allison struck houston in,wright filed a claim on his sfip.allstate dispatched claims adjuster jack gardner,of pilot catastrophe services,to inspect wright home.gardner estimated the covered damage at.wright hired his own certified public insurance adjuster whose agent,pat wolford,prepared an estimate of.because wolford estimate included damage unrelated to wright flood claim,wolford later revised her estimate to.wright did not provide allstate with a copy of wolford revised estimate,although allstate was apparently aware a second estimate had been prepared.
negotiations between wright adjuster and allstate representatives over the correct loss amount were unfruitful.wright refused to sign a proof of loss form pol,required under fema regulations,containing gardner damage estimate.instead,wright eventually submitted his own pol to allstate,listing to be determined in the spaces for cost of repairs,depreciation,cash value,and net amount claimed.allstate responded with a letter,containing what purports to be employee guy chapman signature stating we are accepting this proof in compliance with the policy conditions concerning the filing of a proof of loss.it continued,we expressly reserve all of our rights and defenses in connection with the ascertainment as to the value and loss,if any,and we do not in any way in acknowledging receipt of this proof of loss waive any of the rights and defenses we possess.wright adjuster subsequently sent three letters to allstate expressing an interest in negotiating a resolution.allstate response,received after the deadline for filing a pol had passed,rejected wright claim on the grounds that wright failed to cooperate as required by the terms of the policy and to file an adequate pol within the time frame.
wright filed suit against allstate and chapman,alleging breach of contract,violations of the texas insurance code and deceptive trade practices act,breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.the district court dismissed all but the breach of contract claim against allstate,holding that the state law claims were preempted by federal law.it also dismissed wright claims against chapman.with regard to the breach of contract claim,the court held allstate equitably estopped from asserting wright alleged failure to file an adequate pol as a basis for denial of his claim.finding that wright evidence failed to show that all of the claimed damages were caused by flooding,the court awarded wright,costs,and attorney fees.both parties appeal.
sfip policies require that insureds asserting a claim file a pol within days,subject to such extensions as fema may approve,listing the actual cash value of each damaged item of insured property,the amount of damage sustained and the amount claimed as due under the policy to cover the loss.a,d,e see also forman fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.courts have enforced this requirement strictly,holding that failure to timely file a pol complying with the regulatory requirements is a valid basis for denying an insured claim.see,neuser hocker,cir our sister circuits have consistently held that fema proof of loss requirement is to be strictly enforced.gowland.we have previously recognized that a pol lacking the requisite amounts claimed is insufficient to satisfy fema requirements.see forman,at.
the district court held,however,that allstate was equitably estopped from claiming wright failure to file an adequate pol as a basis for denying his claim.citing allstate letter accepting this proof in compliance with the policy conditions concerning the filing of a proof of loss,the court found that wright had proven the elements of equitable estoppel.on appeal,allstate argues that courts can not apply equitable estoppel against a wyo on these facts and wright failed to establish the elements of equitable estoppel.we review the district court application of equitable estoppel de novo.ramirez city of san antonio,cir.
we previously considered the application of equitable estoppel against a wyo in gowland.there,the insureds,like wright,argued that their wyo should be equitably estopped from asserting their failure to file a pol as a basis for denying their claim.id.at.we declined to so hold,stating that 
although the gowland policy was written by aetna,a private insurance company,payments made to that policy are a direct charge on the public treasury.when federal funds are involved,the judiciary is powerless to uphold a claim of estoppel because such a holding would encroach upon the appropriation power granted exclusively to congress by the constitution.
id.at quoting in re estate of lee,cir.we went on to explain that w hile this result may seem harsh it does not reflect a callous outlook.it merely expresses the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by congress for charging the public treasury.id.quoting fed.crop ins.merrill.
here,as in gowland,we find the doctrine of equitable estoppel inapplicable.the supreme court has made clear that judicial use of the equitable doctrine of estoppel can not grant respondent a money remedy that congress has not authorized.office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d.under the appropriations clause of the constitution,m oney may be paid out only through an appropriation made by law in other words,the payment of money from the treasury must be authorized by a statute.id.at.while richmond dealt with a claim of estoppel based on the actions of a government employee,our holding in gowland makes clear that the same principle applies to claims against wyos,because sfips are ultimately supported by federal funds.although the supreme court has not categorically held equitable estoppel unavailable in cases involving government funds,we find that such a claim is not viable in this case.our holding is also consistent with the principle that 
whatever the form in which the government functions,anyone entering into an arrangement with the government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the government stays within the bounds of his authority.the scope of this authority may be explicitly defined by congress or be limited by delegated legislation,properly exercised through the power.and this is so even though,as here,the agent himself may have been unaware of the limitations upon his authority.
merrill,at.see also dawkins witt,cir discussing the applicability of equitable estoppel in a claim against fema under the nfia,and concluding that a fema adjuster assurances that fema was not concerned with the sixty day pol deadline and fema acceptance of an untimely pol were insufficient to invoke equitable estoppel under the standard established by the supreme court
